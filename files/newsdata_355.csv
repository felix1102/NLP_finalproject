2018,Opinion | Mars Close Up,"Look skyward and dream. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Mars, the Red Planet named after the Roman god of war, is currently closer to the Earth than it’s been in 15 years, and the millions of people gazing at the bright red dot will once again be wondering, is there life out there? Over the years, the answer has gone from an unconditional “yes” — a century ago Mars was often perceived as a teeming alien world crisscrossed by canals, with advanced creatures sending strong signals to Earth — to an equally certain “no”: Space missions reported an arid, rusty globe with a thin atmosphere that couldn’t sustain even a germ. The intriguing current answer is “maybe.” Scientists working on the European Space Agency’s Mars Express mission reported last week that their orbiting radars may have found a briny subterranean sea beneath a Martian ice cap, which could mean that some form of life once existed there. Or still exists. A petri dish of Martian bacteria may not quite measure up to Ray Bradbury’s copper-colored creatures with telepathic skills (“The Martian Chronicles”), but it’s more than enough to sustain Mars as the most explored planet after Earth, with about 45 flybys, orbits and landings since the 1960s, and many to come. It’s also certain to maintain Mars as the most explored celestial body in science fiction. Possibly in a reflection on us Earthlings, the Martians in many books and films appear as supersmart invaders. H.G. Wells’s “The War of the Worlds” prompted a panic in 1938 when many listeners mistook a radio version of the novel as a real report of an attack by aliens armed with ray guns. In the interest of full disclosure, The New York Times had a front-page article on Sept. 2, 1921, in which a colleague of Guglielmo (then translated as William) Marconi, the pioneer of wireless transmission, reported that Signore Marconi was convinced he had intercepted Martian radio messages. The article contained no skepticism about that claim, nor about another by the same source saying the time was approaching when it would be possible to send photographs wirelessly across the Atlantic. At least the vision described by J.H.C. Macbeth, the London manager of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company Ltd., was one of optimism. His “material-minded” friends, he said, were asking what might be the practical advantage of communicating with aliens. “I say that the result would be the advancement of scientific knowledge, science that has wrought such miracles in the past quarter of a century, by at least 200 years,” he said. That is considerably cheerier than the vision of Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, who has said we need to get to Mars to preserve our species after we finish destroying our current planet. Luckily, we don’t seem to need such extreme stimulus to continue exploring our red neighbor, and we’ll eventually get there through the same extraordinary curiosity and ingenuity that has fired exploration from the dawn of time. And we may even find some form of life, requiring, as The Times’s Dennis Overbye writes, “a kind of spiritual and intellectual reckoning.” These are all things to ponder as we gaze at the red spot now a mere 35.8 million miles away. Don’t miss the chance — Mars won’t come any closer until 2035.

2018,"Martin Shubik, Economist and Game Theory Pioneer, Dies at 92","Martin Shubik, an economist whose prescient visions of a computerized world and pioneering applications of game theory to everyday life enlivened what has been described as the dismal science, died on Aug. 22 at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 92. The cause was complications of inclusion body myositis, an inflammatory muscle disease, his daughter, Claire Shubik-Richards, said. Professor Shubik, the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe, was born in New York, raised in England and evacuated to Canada before the Blitz in 1940. He earned a doctorate at Princeton, where he immersed himself in an intellectual caldron of professors and fellow fledgling mathematicians including Oskar Morgenstern, Albert William Tucker, Thomas Whitin and John Nash, the future Nobel laureate, with whom he shared a dormitory suite. Although he considered himself a social scientist and a “micro-microeconomist,” Professor Shubik, who taught at the Yale School of Management, disdained purely theoretical analysis and was nothing if not practical. (He applied to Princeton instead of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said, mainly because the application was much shorter.) As early as the mid-1960s, he was predicting that “computing machines” would become standard in homes and schools by 1990 and that “society would fall to bits of its own weight” without them. He warned, however, that the computers ultimately would be in human hands, and that the people responsible for them had better be not merely smart but also nice. Professor Shubik published hundreds of research papers, delving into subjects including terrorism, football, nuclear strategy, antitrust and the demographics of inclusion body myositis, the disease from which he suffered (in a paper he wrote with his son-in-law, Seth Richards-Shubik, also an economics professor). In the mid-1970s, he and Albert Madansky of the University of Chicago conducted a blind taste test to determine which of four Manhattan delicatessens produced the best sandwiches. When self-appointed deli mavens critiqued his methodology and stodgy economists chided his flippancy, Professor Shubik wrote that his research represented “a modest attempt to preserve for the annals, before it became too late, a record of the Great American Vanishing Species known as the Pastrami and the Corned Beef Sannawiches.” He also issued a warning: “Run, my friend — do not walk, for time is short and the world is about to be buried in bran flakes.” (In fact, all four of the delis the professors tested are now defunct.) With Lloyd S. Shapley, a Nobel-winning economist, Professor Shubik developed an index to measure the power wielded by coalitions within groups ranging from shareholders to legislatures. At Princeton, they, John Nash and another mathematician were among the creators of an economic strategy game, “So Long Sucker,” in which four players can make, and renege on, agreements with one another. Professor Shubik also invented the mathematical model for “Dollar Auction,” a game that illustrates “escalation of commitment” because while the winner collects the bill, the second-highest bidder loses whatever he bid. Martin Shubik was born on March 24, 1926, in Manhattan to Joseph Shubik, who was born in Russia and was in New York working for a Scottish flax and linen company, and Sara (Soloveychik) Shubik. Two years after Martin was born, the family returned to England, where he was raised until the onslaught of German air raids, when he, his mother and his sister were sent to join relatives in Canada. He finished high school there. He did well in algebra but poorly in geometry. (“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two,” he said in an interview last year with the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.) He served in the Royal Canadian Navy as a lieutenant, graduated in 1947 from the University of Toronto with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and earned a master’s in political economy there after writing his thesis on the Incas’ use of knotted strings for accounting and inventory. He stumbled into game theory as a specialty after he was required in college to review a book and randomly chose “The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,” by John von Neumann and Morgenstern. After earning his doctorate at Princeton, he worked as a consultant for General Electric and for IBM, whose thinking about research scientists he later described to The New York Times: “Well, these are like giant pandas in a zoo. You don’t really quite know what a giant panda is, but you sure as hell know (1) you paid a lot of money for it, and (2) other people want it; therefore it is valuable and therefore it’s got to be well fed.” In 1963 he joined the faculty at Yale, where he became professor of mathematical institutional economics in the School of Management. He became an emeritus professor in 2007. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Julie (Kahn) Shubik; two grandchildren; and his sister, Irene Shubik, a television producer. His brother, Philippe, a cancer researcher, died in 2004. While he was an expert on computer modeling and wrote or contributed to a dozen books, including “The Aggressive Conservative Investor” (2008), Professor Shubik explained in 1981 that it was impossible to predict any relationship between the economy and the stock market. Still, he netted several million dollars by investing more than 90 percent of his assets in stocks. In so-called war games, too, he believed that variables and alternatives left the conclusions open to human analysis. “It’s a question of comparative Rasputinology,” he said in 1978, “a question of which czar listens to which Rasputin.” What Professor Shubik predicted confidently was that scientific knowledge would continue to expand exponentially, and while he was willing to cede questions like whether God exists to cosmology and theology, he said the answer might lie at a boundary within the reach of forthcoming technology. “I’m not worried about the answer,” he said. “I’m worried about the journey.” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of a Nobel-winning economist with whom Professor Shubik collaborated. He was Lloyd S. Shapley, not Shapely.",The New York Times
2018,"Mary Carlisle, Depression-Era Movie Ingénue, Is Dead at 104","Mary Carlisle, an angel-faced blond actress who often played spunky but innocent ingénues in scores of Depression-era films, died on Wednesday in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 104. The death was confirmed by her son, James Blakeley III. From 1932 to 1939, when she was in her late teens and early 20s, Ms. Carlisle made 50 movies, including three musicals opposite Bing Crosby: “College Humor” (1933), “Double or Nothing” (1937) and “Doctor Rhythm” (1938). Even in pre-Code films (those made before censorship ruled Hollywood studios) like “Should Ladies Behave” (1933), she was more curious than sinful. She was born Gwendolyn Witter in Boston on Feb. 3, 1914, the daughter of Arthur William Witter and Leona Ella (Wotton) Witter. In later years she refused to confirm her age; some sources give her birth year as 1912. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 After her father died, when she was 4 (or 6, or any other number of ages, depending on which 1930s interview you read), she and her mother moved to Los Angeles, where an uncle worked as a film editor. Gwendolyn later took her stage name from her maternal grandmother, Mary Ella Carlisle. She was discovered, at 14 or so, having lunch at the Universal Studios commissary with her mother. She was noticed by the studio executive Carl Laemmle Jr., who insisted that she be given a screen test. After a couple more years of formal education and at least 10 uncredited movie roles (party guest, autograph seeker and — in “Grand Hotel” — giggly newlywed), Ms. Carlisle made her official movie debut in “This Reckless Age” (1932), about a family with ungrateful college students. From 1922 to 1934, the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers named more than a dozen promising young actresses Wampas Baby Stars as an annual publicity stunt. Their number included Clara Bow, Joan Crawford, Mary Astor and Loretta Young. Ms. Carlisle, chosen alongside Ginger Rogers and Gloria Stuart in 1932, was the last surviving Baby Star. Over the next seven years, her films seemed to cover all the genres and every category of leading man. They included “The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi” with Buster Crabbe, “Handy Andy” and “Down to Earth” with Will Rogers, “Say It in French” with Ray Milland, “Touchdown, Army” with Robert Cummings, “Beware Spooks!” with Joe E. Brown, “Palooka” with Jimmy Durante, “Murder in the Private Car” with Charles Ruggles, and a Preston Sturges comedy, “Hotel Haywire.” During Ms. Carlisle’s heyday, the Hollywood publicity machine was young but prolific. She was interviewed and written about in major newspapers on subjects as broad as her career plans (“I hope someday to become a great comedienne,” she told The Oakland Tribune in 1937. “I’d certainly prefer to make people happy than sad”) and as specific as her most recent fashion purchases (a skunk jacket is “so youthfully smart this season for girls my age,” she was quoted as saying in The Boston Globe the same year). As early as 1934, there were rumors of her engagement to James Blakeley, a British-born actor who later became a 20th Century Fox executive. When the two finally married, in 1942, he was an Army flying instructor. Mr. Blakeley died in 2007. In addition to her son, Ms. Carlisle is survived by two grandchildren. She retired from acting after playing a vampire’s beautiful young target in “Dead Men Walk” (1943) and went on to manage Elizabeth Arden salons in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Clearly, Ms. Carlisle had been thinking about some kind of change for years. As she told The Globe in 1937, right after having some glamour photos taken, “I’ve played sweet young heroines long enough.” An earlier version of this obituary misidentified Ms. Carlisle’s co-star in the film “Beware Spooks!” He was Joe E. Brown, not Joe E. Lewis.",The New York Times

2018,"Mary Pratt, Realist Painter of Household Scenes, Dies at 83","Fifty years ago, Mary Pratt was mopping the floor of her family’s isolated cottage in rural Newfoundland when she was taken by the sight of the sunlight on an unmade bed and its red blanket. The effect, she said in a 2015 video interview, was an “erotic charge.” “After that it was as if all the windows and doors opened and there were images everywhere that just ground themselves into me,” she said. “I just had to paint them.” Until her death at 83 on Aug. 14 at her home in St. John’s Newfoundland, Ms. Pratt had attracted a following for a series of meticulous, realist paintings that documented everyday objects and scenes from her life as a homemaker in ways both beautiful and unsettling. While Ms. Pratt was taken by both painting and color from an early age, her career as an artist was delayed. In 1957, during her final year studying painting at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, she was pulled aside by a professor and given some unsolicited advice: There could only be one painter in her household, and it would be have to be her husband, Christopher, who was also studying there at the time. While Mr. Pratt went on to become one of Canada’s best known artists, Ms. Pratt put off a career in art to become a homemaker. But she increasingly resented her husband’s early success and found moments to paint between raising their four children and tending to the house. She initially favored small canvases that could be completed within her time limitations. Before the revelation from the unmade bed, Ms. Pratt said that her work was “impressionistic” and without a clear theme. “I hoped that I could bring that erotic charge to the paintings,” she said of her later work. “It was a love affair with vision. A real love affair.” Much of what caught Ms. Pratt’s eye around her house was too fleeting to capture through sketching: sunlight passing through jars of jelly, or through water as it boiled in a Pyrex saucepan; blood emerging from a fish head that had been dropped near the drain of a stainless steel kitchen sink; the remains of yolks and egg whites in newly broken shells. So she began taking photographs for reference, eventually using a rear projection screen to display the slides next to her easel. Ms. Pratt’s resulting paintings often resembled exceptionally clear photographs, a quality that sometimes attracted criticism at a time when realism was not fashionable. But Jonathan Shaughnessy, a curator at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, said that her paintings were not simply reproductions of slides. “The photo was just a tool to get that moment back,” he said. Although Ms. Pratt’s paintings had very little relief — they were often painted on Masonite rather than canvas — and usually displayed no evidence of brush strokes, she repeatedly spoke in interviews about “sculpting” minute details of the objects depicted in them. In 2015 she told Mr. Shaughnessy that in one of her paintings of raspberries she had paid close attention to numerous glass blobs on the dish holding the fruit. “Every blob is different than every other glass blob, and every one of them has to be given its full due,” she said. “I just love these intricacies, because they all lend to the truth of the object or the truth of the vision.” Her work was included in a major exhibition of art by Canadian women at the National Gallery to mark the United Nation’s International Women’s Year, in 1975. The exhibit’s focus on objects and scenes that were largely associated with women’s lives or portraits of women made her something of a feminist champion. Ms. Pratt rarely spoke publicly about feminism, but she did say that she was pleased when housewives wrote her to say that her paintings had “made them feel a little more like heroes than they had felt before.” Mary Frances West was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on March 15, 1935. Her father, William J. West, was a lawyer, judge and politician who once served as the province’s attorney general. Her mother, Katherine Eleanor (McMurray) West, was a homemaker and a painter. Ms. Pratt recalled growing up in a household filled with discussions about the nature of art and color, particularly red, which dominates many of her paintings. Ms. Pratt began painting while in kindergarten and was encouraged by her father to study art at Mount Allison, where she met Mr. Pratt. The couple separated during the 1990s and divorced in 2005, but they remained close friends, discussing each other’s work. In 2006, Ms. Pratt married James Rosen, an American artist and academic. That marriage also ended in divorce. She is survived by two sons, John and Ned, who confirmed the death but did not specify the cause; two daughters, Anne and Barbara; her sister, Barbara Cross; 11 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Another son, David, died in infancy. Mireille Eagan, the curator of contemporary art at The Rooms, a provincial gallery in Newfoundland that opened in 2005 thanks in part to Ms. Pratt’s advocacy, said that the long hours that Ms. Pratt had spent attending to detail in her paintings led to a back condition that left her in pain and unable to walk. Ms. Pratt, however, remained enthusiastic both about her paintings and their often prosaic subjects. “I don’t think anything is ordinary,” she said. “I think everything is complex and worthy of conjecture and worthy of a close look.”",The New York Times
2018,Maryland Suspends Football Coach D.J. Durkin After Report of Abuse,"The University of Maryland on Saturday placed its football coach, D. J. Durkin, on administrative leave while it investigates accusations about mistreatment of players that surfaced after offensive lineman Jordan McNair collapsed during a May workout and died weeks later. [UPDATE: Maryland fires its strength and conditioning coach.] The suspension came one day after an article by ESPN detailed a culture of fear and intimidation at Maryland, according to current and former players and staff members, who said that coaches and trainers commonly embarrassed and humiliated players. The sources of the accusations were anonymous. Players’ masculinity was mocked when they were unable to complete a workout or lift a weight, and one player was belittled after passing out, according to ESPN. Coaches forced one player to overeat to the point of vomiting, the article said, and another — whom the coaches wanted to lose weight — was forced to eat candy bars while watching teammates working out. Maryland’s president, Wallace D. Loh, said such behavior was unacceptable. “Our responsibility as teachers is to inspire and enable students to perform at their best and expand the boundaries of their potential,” Loh said in a statement. He added, “Humiliating and demeaning a student is not only bad teaching and coaching, it is an abuse of the authority of a teacher and coach.” According to ESPN, the college on Friday placed three others associated with the program on leave: the strength and conditioning coach, Rick Court; the director of athletic training, Steve Nordwall; and the athletic trainer, Wes Robinson. Durkin is the second Big Ten football coach to be placed on leave this month while his school investigates allegations of abuse. Ohio State is examining whether its coach, Urban Meyer, properly handled domestic abuse allegations against a longtime assistant coach. Durkin served as an assistant under Meyer at Bowling Green and at the University of Florida. Durkin, 40, had been preparing for his third season at Maryland. The school has hired Rod Walters, a former college athletic trainer, to investigate whether coaches and officials followed protocol when McNair, a 19-year-old redshirt freshman, collapsed during a workout on May 29. He died on June 13. No cause of death has been released, but ESPN reported that McNair had died of heatstroke. Billy Murphy, a lawyer for McNair’s family, said that Maryland’s 911 call for help, which was recorded at 5:58 p.m., did not come until nearly an hour after McNair had first had convulsions after a series of sprints, which happened around 5 p.m. Such a delay, Murphy told ESPN, shows “an utter disregard of the health of this player, and we are extraordinarily concerned that the coaches did not react appropriately to his injury.” Maryland, in a statement, said that “no student-athlete, athletic trainer or coach reported a seizure occurring at 5 p.m.” College football practices may not be as severe as they once were, when players were routinely denied water breaks even in sweltering conditions in the belief that suffering would toughen them up. But many coaches still employ conditioning drills that are intended to imbue players with mental toughness. After McNair’s death, Durkin called a meeting to address concerns of players and their parents. On Friday, in advance of ESPN’s article, he wrote a letter to the parents, saying the program is cooperating with the investigation, which is expected to be completed by Sept. 15. “Our priority every day is the safety along with the academic, personal and athletic development of your sons,” Durkin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Baltimore Sun. “During this time of healing, our focus needs to be on each other and unity within our program.” Durkin, in the third year of a $12.5 million contract, coached the Terrapins at their Saturday morning practice. He will be replaced indefinitely by the offensive coordinator, Matt Canada. Maryland’s first game is in less than three weeks, on Sept. 1, against visiting Texas.",The New York Times
2018,"María Isabel Chorobik de Mariani, Crusading Argentine Grandmother, Dies at 94","BUENOS AIRES — María Isabel Chorobik de Mariani, who stood up to Argentina’s military junta during the 1970s in the search for abducted children as a founder of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, died on Monday in La Plata, near Buenos Aires. She was 94, having never found the granddaughter she lost José Luis Mansur, Ms. Mariani’s doctor, said the cause was respiratory complications of a stroke she suffered on Aug. 7. Ms. Mariani, who went by the nickname “Chicha,” was one of the most emblematic figures of a movement formed by women who were searching for hundreds of babies stolen from their parents under the brutal military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. Over more than 40 years she gained wide attention for efforts that were instrumental in the pursuit of justice for the crimes the state committed during that era, all the while holding out hope of finding her granddaughter, Clara Anahí, who was 3 months old when she disappeared. Human rights activists say as many as 30,000 people were killed or forcibly made to disappear under the military junta. Roughly 500 newborns are believed to have been kidnapped from political prisoners. Ms. Mariani played an important role in setting up a system that enabled the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo to discover the identity of scores of children taken from their parents and locate them. So far, 128 of the abducted, now in adulthood, have been reunited, or at least connected, with blood relatives. On Nov. 24, 1976, military and law enforcement officers descended on the home of Ms. Mariani’s son, Daniel Enrique Mariani, and his wife, Diana Esmeralda Teruggi, as part of an official campaign against people deemed to be subversives. The home, in La Plata, housed a printing press for the armed leftist group the Montoneros. Ms. Teruggi and four others were killed in the raid. Mr. Mariani was not home at the time, but he was killed less than a year later, in August 1977. Although military officers claimed that Clara Anahí had also died, witnesses said they had seen her being removed from the home. Convinced that her granddaughter had survived, Ms. Mariani joined forces with another grandmother, Alicia Zubasnabar de la Cuadra, whose pregnant daughter had been detained by military officers. The two women gathered 10 others to form the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo in November 1977. Simultaneously, another group, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, sought information about adults who had seemingly vanished without a trace. Ms. Mariani was the second president of the grandmothers’ group and led it until 1989. As part of her work with the group, she helped introduce blood tests as a way of matching people thought to be the children of the disappeared and their grandparents. She later set up a nonprofit organization in her granddaughter’s name. In a statement, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo said that Ms. Mariani had been “fundamental in the start of the search for the boys and girls who were appropriated by state terrorism.” Political and human rights leaders vowed to continue the search for Clara Anahí. In 2006, Ms. Mariani confronted Miguel Etchecolatz, a retired police commissioner, at his trial for his involvement in the state terror. She accused him of knowing where her granddaughter had been taken. “I see police commissioner Etchecolatz with the rosary,” she said, “and I’d like to ask that instead of praying to the rosary he should alleviate his conscience and say where Clara Anahí is, because he knows.” He did not respond, but years later said he had been told that the baby had died in the attack. Mr. Etchecolatz was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Ms. Mariani had a glimmer of hope in December 2015 when a woman claimed that she was her long-lost granddaughter. But a blood test proved otherwise. “That was a difficult situation that to this day I don’t quite understand,” said Elsa Pavón, who leads the Anahí foundation. “It hit Chicha hard, but she was strong and she was determined not to let anything stop her from her search.” Ms. Mariani was born Nov. 19, 1923, in San Rafael, in western Mendoza Province. In 1947, she married Enrique José Mariani, who died in 2003. No immediate family members survive. Ms. Mariani’s long years in pursuit of justice took their toll. “I’ve sometimes felt bad, tired and disappointed in life, people and things,” she said in an interview with Spain’s El Mundo newspaper in 2015. “I’ve even had so much fatigue that I think it’s time to go. “But I always react and tell myself, I can’t die,” she said. “I don’t have the right to die without having found Clara Anahí.”",The New York Times

2018,Massachusetts Town Loses Its Entire Police Force as All 4 Members Quit,"BLANDFORD, Mass. — The police cruiser sat at the edge of the parking lot in front of the town offices, angled toward the road as if an officer inside were waiting to catch speeders. Only there was no officer inside. Nor, for that matter, was there a Blandford police officer to be found anywhere else on Tuesday. The entire local police force in this western Massachusetts town had just quit, and the cruiser was the law enforcement version of a scarecrow. “The ghost cop,” said Bill Levakis, a member of the town’s board of selectmen, who had positioned the cruiser just so. He shrugged. “I don’t know what else to do.” The night before, the interim police chief had emailed local officials in Blandford, population 1,200, to say that work had grown unsafe and untenable for her and the town’s three part-time officers. The email cited failing brakes and faulty air conditioning in the police cruisers, ill-fitting bulletproof vests and low wages. “We refuse to put our lives on the line anymore for a town that seemingly cares so little about us,” read a statement signed by Roberta Sarnacki, the interim chief, and the three officers. So they turned off the lights, locked up the police department and said they weren’t coming back. But as word of the abrupt resignations spread through town, officials like Mr. Levakis said other tensions had played a role. Officials had been considering a merger of law enforcement services in Blandford with the nearby town of Chester as a way to cut costs. That concept, Mr. Levakis said, had threatened and angered Blandford’s own officers, who, he said, had never before complained about their safety. “You’ve got to move with the future,” Mr. Levakis said. “We’re just trying to find better ways to use our money.” Around the country, towns with shrinking tax bases and rising costs have been forced to make hard choices. In some cases, that has meant merging local police departments or cutting them altogether. Earlier this year, Brooksville, Fla., shuttered its 30-person police department and handed law enforcement duties over to the local sheriff. Other departments have disbanded after problems; Galesburg, Mich., for instance, closed its police department in January after firing the chief. “Small towns are having this discussion around maintaining the most basic functions of local government, police services being one of them,” said Josh Garcia, the acting town administrator for Blandford. The town was not without protection from law enforcement on Tuesday. Officials there said officers from the Massachusetts State Police, the local sheriff’s department and the Chester Police Department were helping to patrol the town. Still, the entire police department’s sudden exit was jarring in Blandford, which is just east of the Berkshires. Residents were already accustomed to spare services at times. Parts of the town have yet to be connected to broadband internet. The elementary school closed years ago, leaving the town struggling to lure young families. And residents have long been used to the sight of state police troopers in town, because the Blandford officers kept only limited hours. “All small hilltowns understand the fact that the police force is here and there,” said Tammy Mullens, a pet-sitter and dog walker who was taking her grandchild for a stroll near the town offices. “To know what little we had walked out is kind of a shock.” In an interview, Ms. Sarnacki, the former interim chief, said she and her officers felt they had no choice but to leave. In addition to safety concerns they raised about their cars, she said officers were frustrated because town officials were seeking applications to replace her. And, she acknowledged, there was some concern about the prospect of consolidation with another town. “I think you take a little bit of the town’s identity away if you take the police department away or move it to a different area,” Ms. Sarnacki said. Cara Letendre, the chairwoman of the board of selectmen, said Blandford officials had only had preliminary discussions about merging forces, but the idea seemed like a possible solution for an aging town with little industry to fuel a tax base. “We certainly have issues with funding a police department,” Ms. Letendre said. “That’s part of what we’ve been working to resolve.” Ms. Letendre said the police officers had not recently come to the select board with concerns about their working conditions, and one of the police cruisers had just been fixed. “All this did,” she said, of the sudden resignation, “was create chaos unnecessarily and leave the town vulnerable.” Some residents who have watched the erosion of services here said they were concerned. “It’s getting harder for a town to survive,” said Jim Webster, 70, a semiretired landscaper. But others, like Peter Langmore, said regionalization would be smart, given economic pressures. “There are only 1,200 people in this town — we work things out,” Mr. Langmore said. “We’ve been here since” the 1700s, he added. “We’ll continue to be here.” For Elaine Greene, a retiree who emerged from the town offices carrying a three-pound toy poodle in a carrier, the sudden lack of local police officers was not a concern. “I’m a member of the N.R.A.,” Ms. Greene said, smiling. “I can take care of myself if the need arises.” OpinionBrian Willingham",The New York Times
2018,"Matt Groening Goes Medieval With New Series, ‘Disenchantment’","SANTA MONICA, Calif. — Speaking as someone who has created two hit animated TV shows and is about to introduce his third series, Matt Groening has some advice to ensure a successful pitch meeting. “This is my Hollywood tip,” he said earlier this summer. “You can say, ‘It’s ‘The Simpsons’ meets anything’ or ‘It’s anything meets ‘Game of Thrones,’ and you’ve got a deal.” Mr. Groening was gently ribbing his new show, “Disenchantment,” which Netflix will release on Friday, Aug. 17. His latest series certainly shares a satirical sensibility and a distinctive curvy cartoon style with “The Simpsons,” his enduring Fox comedy that starts its 30th season in September. But while it takes place in a medieval realm of wizards and dragons, it is not exactly Mr. Groening’s answer to “Game of Thrones.” “Disenchantment” is more like Mr. Groening’s comic amalgam of fantasy franchises like “Lord of the Rings” and the animated epics of Hayao Miyazaki, to name just two of its dozens of influences. It is also Mr. Groening’s first show created for a streaming service — its initial 10 episodes can be consumed in a five-hour binge — as well as, consequently, his first to have a serialized narrative. “I’ve been working for 30 years in sequential, weekly, prime-time animation,” Mr. Groening said. “To suddenly have a bunch of episodes that go up at the same time, you have to tell a big story. And it’s been really fun. However, it’s its own torture.” For Mr. Groening, part of the challenge in creating “Disenchantment” has been attuning it to the tastes and pacing of contemporary television, which have changed considerably since the Simpsons were introduced in wiggly interstitial segments on “The Tracey Ullman Show.” And part of the difficulty — and part of the pleasure — is doing something different from “The Simpsons,” the decades-old behemoth that is constantly judged by the standards it set, and against which every subsequent creation of Mr. Groening’s is measured. As of 11 a.m. this June morning, Mr. Groening, 64, had already visited the “Simpsons” offices at the Fox studios in Los Angeles to give a couple of notes on an upcoming episode, and had dropped off his 5-year-old son, Nathaniel, at summer camp. His wife, Agustina, an Argentinian-born artist, was home with their newborn twins, Venus and Sol. As Mr. Groening explained: “Spanish is the primary language in my house. I don’t speak a word, but I can tell when they’re talking about me.” Mr. Groening was presently working from his personal office here in Santa Monica, a boxy building that does not exactly broadcast its Simpsons affiliations. Inside, the men’s and women’s bathroom doors are subtly distinguished with wavy lines suggesting the spiky haircuts of Bart and Lisa, and Mr. Groening’s second-floor work space is minimally decorated with Simpsons memorabilia, a few Frank Zappa albums and some dusty Emmy Awards. The artifact he was most eager to show off this day was a weathered notebook in which, for the past eight years or longer, he’d scribbled down his ideas for “Disenchantment”: lineages of fictional royal families, lists of more movies to emulate (“The Princess Bride,” “Jabberwocky”) and sketches of a goofy elf named Elfo that he said he’s been drawing since the fifth grade. “By the way, every character I draw is based on what I drew in the fifth grade,” Mr. Groening said. “They all have the big, round eyes, little nose and big overbite.” From these disparate data points, Mr. Groening has built “Disenchantment” into a series about the misadventures of a rebellious princess (voiced by Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City”), that aforementioned elf (Nat Faxon) and a mischievous demon (Eric Andre). Though each episode of “Disenchantment” tells a stand-alone story, Mr. Groening said: “Every single thing connects to things that will pay off later. There are moments from the very beginning — hints and clues and Easter eggs — that we lay in there for the people who really care.” To construct and populate the show’s interconnected kingdoms, Mr. Groening had help from some trusted colleagues. Josh Weinstein, the showrunner of “Disenchantment,” was previously a showrunner at “The Simpsons” and a producer of Mr. Groening’s science-fiction follow-up, “Futurama,” which ran for seven seasons on Fox and Comedy Central. When Mr. Weinstein joined “The Simpsons” in its third season in the early 1990s, he said the show was starting to perfect its comedic voice, one unlike anything on TV at the time. “There were really big jokes, but there was also a comedy of realism and getting things just right,” Mr. Weinstein said, citing the rampant stupidity of Homer Simpson and the strange relationships between supporting characters like Principal Skinner and his mother, Agnes. He said that even that early in the show’s run, Mr. Groening, a Portland, Ore., native who had moved to Los Angeles to become a rock critic and the author of the alternative comic strip Life in Hell, had already learned to navigate a strait-laced and demanding network-television environment. “You might have thought Matt was Mr. Underground Cartoonist,” Mr. Weinstein said, “but he had a very organized mind for what he wanted.” “The Simpsons” became a critical, cultural and commercial success, one that, in a pre-Internet era, was largely insulated from the opinions of its audience. “We had no idea, really, what people were thinking, so we had total freedom,” Mr. Weinstein said. On “Disenchantment,” he added, “We have that feeling again, of absolute freedom to do what we want, which is so rare.” The writing staff on “Disenchantment” consists of about a dozen people, about half who are veterans from “The Simpsons” and “Futurama,” and half from animated shows like “Gravity Falls.” “They haven’t heard of Mary Tyler Moore,” Mr. Groening said of these younger writers. “But I forgot to watch TV in the ’80s, so there’s an entire generation of references that have passed me by.” Bill Oakley, Mr. Weinstein’s former writing partner, worked with him as a “Simpsons” showrunner and a “Futurama” producer. He said the directive from Mr. Groening on “Disenchantment” is that it shouldn’t “require the viewer to know anything about fantasy or even like fantasy,” adding that Mr. Groening “wants the show to be about the characters, about them growing up and going forward.” It’s a lesson Mr. Groening said he learned, in part, on “Futurama,” which was set in a 31st century cohabitated by robots, aliens and lobster-people, and which was as much a sendup of genre conventions as it was of human interaction. On “Disenchantment,” he said, “We have to get past the fantasy jokes and into real emotion.” His imperative also highlights the emotional investment that fans of “The Simpsons” have made in that show as it has grown and evolved over the years. Justin Roiland, the co-creator of the Adult Swim animated series “Rick and Morty,” said that, when “The Simpsons” is at its best, “the characters are more important than the jokes.” “As you watch those first 10, 15 seasons, they really wrote up to those characters. They wouldn’t sacrifice the integrity of a character for a joke,” he continued. “You’d occasionally be surprised — oh, wow, I actually feel emotion for this cartoon.” But as the “Simpsons” creative team has learned, its audience’s strong sense of connection to the show can cut both ways. For many months now, the show has been at the center of a debate over its character Apu, an Indian-American convenience-store owner (introduced in 1990), whom some fans feel is an outdated cultural stereotype. Amid a longer discussion about the criticism of Apu, Mr. Groening said the argument had become “tainted,” adding, “There’s no nuance to the conversation now.” “I think particularly right now, people feel so aggrieved and crazed and powerless that they’re picking the wrong battles,” Mr. Groening said. Having become the longest-running scripted prime-time series in the history of television, “The Simpsons” often faces questions about whether it remains as incisive as it once was, and whether it still has anything new to say. But Mr. Groening emphatically believes that it does. “I’m still crazy about the show,” he said. “It’s not what it was back in its surge of insane popularity,” Mr. Groening said. But “it makes me laugh because it still surprises me.” Mr. Groening said his interest in creating “Disenchantment” and showing it on a nontraditional platform came simply from a desire to try something new. “I just wanted to see what it was like to go someplace else,” he said. But his colleagues suspect there is a bit more at stake for Mr. Groening, and that he wants to show he is as vital now as he was in past eras of his career. “If I had created ‘The Simpsons’ and ‘Futurama,’ I might retire,” Mr. Weinstein said. “But he’s somebody who loves to work, to his credit. He wants to be judged for what he’s doing now. He wants to keep contributing.” Mr. Groening has plenty to keep him busy: He is already working on a second 10-episode batch of “Disenchantment,” which Netflix will likely release next year. And he continues to contribute to “The Simpsons” — and is waiting to see how the Walt Disney Company’s acquisition of Fox might affect his best-known creation. On the one hand, the deal triggers his innate suspicion of all things corporate. But if it means that “Simpsons” characters could someday appear at Disney theme parks, maybe he could live with it. “It’s unknown territory,” he said. “I am dubious of synergy, creatively. But boy, I’d love to see a Simpsonsland.”",The New York Times
2018,"Matthew Newton, Director With Domestic Violence Record, Departs Jessica Chastain Film","Following a torrent of criticism over his hiring, a filmmaker with a history of domestic violence charges stepped down on Friday from directing a new action movie, the latest example of an entertainment figure being called to account for past behavior. The filmmaker, Matthew Newton, had been named last week as director of the movie “Eve,” which he also wrote, and which will star Jessica Chastain, a vocal supporter of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct and gender inequality in Hollywood. Ms. Chastain, whose company Freckle Films is one of the producers, was soon deluged with complaints on social media and in an online petition for her decision to work with Mr. Newton. Twitter users, especially those from Australia, where he is from, directed attention to reports about Mr. Newton, who has a relatively low profile in the United States. In 2007, Mr. Newton pleaded guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend, the actress Brooke Satchwell. A judge later overturned the conviction because Mr. Newton had a “severe depressive disorder.” Three years later, the actress Rachael Taylor, then Mr. Newton’s fiancée, reported that he assaulted her at a hotel in Rome. Ms. Taylor also said she had experienced physical and verbal abuse at his hands, including a concussion, bruising and a sprained jaw, according to Australian news reports. Mr. Newtown was given a two-year apprehended domestic violence order (similar to a restraining order). He breached the order and had to seek treatment. In 2011, Mr. Newton was charged in Sydney with punching a 66-year-old taxi driver in the head. A court dismissed the charges on the grounds that he had a mental illness, ordering him to comply with a treatment plan. In 2012, Mr. Newton was charged with punching a hotel clerk in Miami. He was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service and an anger management course. He has been living recently in New York. Mr. Newton, 41, who has been outspoken about his struggles with bipolar disorder, announced his decision to step down from “Eve” in a statement: “Yesterday I notified Jessica Chastain and the other producers on the film ‘Eve’ that I will be stepping down as director. Since the announcement of this film, the responses, which are powerful and important, have not fallen on deaf ears.” “Over the past eight years I have been working extensively with health care professionals to help me overcome my addiction and mental health illness,” the statement continued. “For the past six years I have lived a quiet and sober life. All I can do now is try to be a living amends and hopefully contribute to the positive change occurring in our industry.” On Friday, the petition that had started as a result of the announcement was closed. A message was posted, “Great news! Matthew Newton has dropped out of the film because of public pressure, including this petition. Thank you for signing!” Because Mr. Newton wrote the script of “Eve,” his resignation also raises questions about the fate of the movie. Ms. Chastain and representatives from Voltage Pictures, the other production company on the film, did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Ms. Chastain’s involvement with Mr. Newton’s movie was particularly jarring to many of the critics. The actress has spoken out in the past about increasing gender diversity in Hollywood, and has said she refused to work with Harvey Weinstein because of his reputation. She also told Australia’s The Feed that she considered it essential to take into account histories of assault when deciding whom to work with. “It’s very important to me that I practice what I preach, and that my actions follow my words,” she said. Mr. Newton has a long list of acting and directing credits, primarily in Australia. His most recent film was last year’s “Who We Are Now,” starring Julianne Nicholson, Emma Roberts and Zachary Quinto.",The New York Times
2018,"Maureen Dowd, in Australia, Explains Trump’s ‘Ego Arithmetic’","Letter 70 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter reflecting the experience (and quirks) of our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. Here’s where to find all our Australia and New Zealand coverage. ______ Even when Maureen Dowd is jet-lagged, she can turn a phrase that lingers in your mind forever. Last night, at a small event in Sydney for New York Times subscribers that we hosted with Advance, a network of global Australians, the Times columnist compared Barack Obama to Luke Skywalker. “He had the force, he just didn’t always use it,” she said. A minute later, she explained that many voters never warmed to Hillary Clinton because “they wanted a Rottweiler to bite the face off of Washington.” That’s just a taste. Her conversation in Melbourne with Julia Baird at the National Gallery of Victoria included another round of zingers, as no doubt will her appearance at the Antidote Festival on Sunday at the Sydney Opera House. But for those unable to see her live in Australia, why miss out? Here are a few highlights from her recent conversations in Australia: ‘Ego Arithmetic’ This is the main thing you need to know about President Trump, Maureen said: He thinks in terms of numbers that tell him how important he is. When she asked him why he thought he could be president back when he first considered it in 1999, for example, he told her, “I always get the highest ratings on Larry King.” Plus, he added, his name can found on buildings in New York, and his wife, Melania, (who was then his girlfriend) appears on lots of magazine covers. This conversation, Maureen said, occurred on his private plane filled with junk food. And he hasn’t changed much in the White House. He even calls it “the set,” she said, as if it’s just for him and just for television. “He’s thinking of this as a reality show and he will get those ratings,” Maureen said. “He’s an attention addict.” ‘We’re the Selfie Stick’ What about the role of the media covering President Trump? When asked about this last night, she acknowledged that the media and the president are caught in an intense symbiotic relationship. The most intense relationship in Washington, Maureen said, is not between the president and his wife but the president and the press. “He’s the selfie president, we’re the selfie stick,” she said. Still, she added, The New York Times and the family that owns it (the Sulzbergers) have made clear that they are not part of “the resistance” to President Trump. Even when pushed — at an Oscars party, for example, where various Hollywood stars warmly greeted our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, and pushed him to echo their own frustrations, Maureen said, he resisted and refused to be pushed into that role. ‘The Hall Monitors’ Maureen is no less scathing with the Democrats as she is with Republicans. When she comes at you, “it’s not your fault, it’s just your turn,” is how our publisher puts it. Last night proved the point. After lambasting President Trump, she said she also blamed the Democrats — the party that used to be so connected to her own roots, as a daughter of working-class Irish Americans — for losing touch and becoming the party of scolds. “They give off this hall monitor supercilious air — and this entitled air,” she said. Even President Obama, she said, sometimes failed to grasp the need to woo voters rather than hector them. “People voted for Barack to bring us into modernity,” she said, “but he could have explained it more and brought people along more.” When dealing with Congress too, she added, he often showed that “he’d rather be right than win.” Now, she added, with President Trump dismantling his legacy, “he’s learned you have to win first before you’re right.” On that note, let’s get to the news of the week, from all over the world (Canberra included).

Our Interpreter columnists traveled to a small town in Germany that was the site of anti-refugee attacks after researchers completed a landmark study showing that Facebook made communities more prone to racial violence. It’s a chilling example of the way algorithms impact human behavior. ______ Speaking of technology, did you see that President Trump appears to have googled himself and discovered a whole mess of critical coverage? He was not happy. He accused the company of suppressing conservative news outlets. Our Opinion columnist, Kara Swisher, called the accusation ludicrous. “The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways,” she wrote. ______ Betraying my own pop culture age and bias, I really loved this Ethan Hawke profile by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. I used to live on the same street as him in Brooklyn and so much of what Taffy wrote feels familiar, but also just what I imagined a long conversation with him would be like.

2018,Maurizio Sarri: Chelsea’s Tuscan Son,"The Italian manager cut his coaching teeth at tiny clubs in the small towns near where he grew up. He’ll carry the lessons he learned into his first season in the Premier League. CreditCreditPaul Childs/Reuters STIA, Italy — The road from Faella, down in the Arno valley, winds up and up into the hills, beyond the vineyards, with their military precision, beyond the tangled olive groves and into the woods, thick and dark and untamed. At Consuma, the highest point of the pass, the view stretches all the way west to Chianti; Arezzo lies south, Florence north. Consuma is not where the journey ends. It takes an hour, and countless tight hairpins shaded by slender cypresses, before the road descends into the village of Stia, its terra-cotta roofs nestled in an ocean of green, a little Tuscan idyll nestled in the valley. The soccer field, overlooking the river and screened by a chain-link fence, is the first thing you see as you arrive. Most days, for more than a year, Maurizio Sarri made the trip twice. Usually, he would do it after a full day at work, leaving Faella at 5 p.m. and not returning home until late. Often, he would car share with a handful of others based in the sleepy cluster of towns that line the Arno valley, to help spread the fuel costs. Every other week, he would do it on Saturday for a brief training session, drive back, and then do it all over again on Sunday, game day. Stia, then, was the end of his journey. In hindsight, it is where it all began. On Saturday, Sarri will take charge of Chelsea for the first time in the Premier League. A 59-year-old Italian, he is the 13th managerial appointment of Roman Abramovich’s impatient tenure at Stamford Bridge, and he is hardly the first to lack a garlanded playing career: of his predecessors, much the same could be said of José Mourinho, Andre Villas-Boas and Rafael Benítez. Sarri is, it is true, a little older than most of his peers: though hardly ancient by managerial standards, he had to wait for his chance among the elite. He was 55 when he first coached in Italy’s top division, Serie A, with Empoli, and 56 when he was given a chance by a major team: Napoli, the team he had supported from afar as a child. But it is not the length of his back story that makes him stand out so much as the locations in which it is set. There are, by and large, three routes into elite management in soccer: as a former player (Pep Guardiola); rising through the ranks at an academy (Benítez); and serving an apprenticeship under an established, respected patron (Mourinho). Sarri took none of them. He is, by the standards of his peers, an outsider: he spent the majority of his career not only working away from fully professional soccer, in Tuscany’s regional leagues, but doing so part-time, while holding down a full-time job in wealth management for Banca Toscana and, later, Monte dei Paschi di Siena. That background has, at times, been held against him: he has said that he has been witheringly referred to as “the employee” by some critics, simply because he has done another job. It is that unconventional route, though, that has defined Sarri. It was at all of those teams in quiet towns and sleepy villages, teams made up of enthusiastic amateurs and semiprofessionals, that Sarri the manager was shaped. And it was in all of those places — all within an hour or so of Figline Valdarno, the town where he was born, and Faella, the town where he lived, all in and around the Arno valley, all in the Tuscany of romantic imagination and travel brochures — that Sarri honed his unique coaching style, the technical, expansive approach that no less an authority than Arrigo Sacchi, the former coach of A.C. Milan and Italy, has said is “immediately recognizable.” Sarri has always said he does not “feel” Tuscan; just that he is Tuscan. In a globalized, rootless game, he is a product of where he is from, of the places he has been. Tuscany is embedded in his politics — this was, for a long time, a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party — and in his sporting philosophy, too. Vanni Bergamaschi, a former teammate and the man who set Sarri on his path into management, calls his friend’s journey through Tuscany’s minor teams his “Calvary.” It was slow, meandering, winding, but it was formative, too. It was here that Sarri sharpened his eye for detail, here that he developed his style, here that he became the manager who would make it all the way to Serie A and, now, the Premier League. Stia was simply the first stage. “He came here as a player in 1990,” said Bergamaschi, 60. “He was a defender, but he had a lot of injury problems. That year, the coach was not so good, and the club decided that it wanted to change. I was captain, so they asked me what I thought. Maurizio was half a coach when he played anyway, so I suggested him.” Sarri himself — as is traditional in these origin stories — was less than convinced. “He asked me if he should do it,” Bergamaschi said. “I just told him that at least he knew all of us, so he stood a better chance than someone coming in from outside.” Of course, he took the job, and thrived. “He started to watch the games of the teams we were about to play,” Bergamaschi said. “He wanted to know everything about everyone. This was at the lowest level, remember: we had never had anything like this. None of the other coaches, even the good ones, had anything like his vision.” There is an image in Italy of Sarri as a chain-smoking, Bukowski-reading eccentric: he has become known as Mister 33, after the alleged number of set-piece routines he teaches his players, each one named after a member of his staff. It is a characterization he rejects: there are only, in reality, half a dozen or so, he has said. But that sort of planning has been a cornerstone of his approach from the earliest days. “We had a few schemes for corners and for free kicks even then,” Bergamaschi said. Sarri’s eye for detail stood him in good stead. After a year at Stia, he was poached. “He had so many clubs,” Bergamaschi said. “But they were always small steps.” The first was Faellese, based in the town where he lived, a team of slightly grander scale than Stia (and a shorter commute). Its stadium has two stands, rather than one, both of them neatly painted in the club’s colors; even in the height of summer, in the searing August heat, when Stia’s field is locked up, there is someone tending to the grass at Faellese. From there, he went to Cavriglia, Antella, Valdema and Tegoleto: small steps, small journeys. Only on his fifth job, at Tegoleto, did he decide — in consultation with his family — to give up work at the bank and pursue soccer full time. At Sansovino, he finally won promotion from Italy’s regional fifth tier into Serie D, its fourth. And then, at Sangiovannese, 13 years after he started, he finally found “a really serious project,” according to Francesco Baiano, one of his players there. The presence of Baiano was, in itself, proof of how far all of those small steps had taken Sarri. In his prime, Baiano had played for Napoli, Parma and Fiorentina. He had even represented his country twice. In the twilight of his career, he had been brought to Sangiovannese, in the town of San Giovanni Valdarno, by Arduino Casprini, the club’s president, who was determined to take his team from Serie C2 into Serie B, Italian soccer’s second division. Sarri was brought in with the same aim. Though he had never traveled far, word of his abilities had spread. “The president talked to me, as one of the most experienced players,” Baiano said. “He told me he was appointing a coach from the lower leagues, but that he was really smart, really well-prepared. That is exactly how I found him. I’d had a lot of coaches in Serie A by that stage. Even then, Sarri was already a great coach.” The style then, Baiano said, was not the style that would become famous. “We did not have the players to play so technically,” he said. “We played into the wingers: we had a lot of quick players. We played a lot on the counterattack. If anything, it was a little like Liverpool.” The approach, though, was the same as it had always been, the same as it still is. Both Baiano and Bergamaschi use the same word to describe Sarri’s work ethic, its meaning obvious, flattering. He was, they both say, “maniacale” in his approach to soccer: a maniac. That is what took him from Stia to Sangiovannese, to all the points in between, and on to Serie A, to Napoli, and now to Chelsea. Everywhere he has been, they remember, takes a little pride in how far this son of Tuscany has gone. In Figline Valdarno, a friend has turned his coffee bar, Caffe Greco, into a shrine to the town’s most famous son. And Sarri remembers them, too. Bergamaschi turned 60 on June 1. He and Sarri have only been in fleeting contact in the last few years, but Sarri called him on his birthday, and they spent a few minutes wheeling through memories of their time together at Stia, of the little field by the bridge, of the little town in the valley, of where the long road ends, and where the journey began.",The New York Times
2018,Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen Play It (Relatively) Straight,"MALIBU, Calif. — During their lengthy runs on “Saturday Night Live,” Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen created some of the sketch comedy show’s most outrageous characters. Ms. Rudolph’s more memorable impersonations included a (very) platinum blonde Donatella Versace mangling the English language, Maya Angelou pranking Cornel West, and Oprah Winfrey making sweet, sweet love to a loaf of French bread. Mr. Armisen, meanwhile, performed comically lousy renditions of Hanukkah tunes; gave unwelcome sex advice, as Queen Elizabeth II, to Kate Middleton; and played hot potato with the decapitated head of a prep schoolboy. The two also performed together in several recurring sketches, channeling Beyoncé and Prince, Barack and Michelle Obama and the linguistically challenged art dealers Nuni and Nuni Schoener. Now, more than a decade after Ms. Rudolph left the show, and five years since Mr. Armisen’s departure, they are back together, in the new Amazon comedy “Forever.” But this time, they’re playing a relatively normal married couple who argue about fork tines. Their new show, which debuts Sept. 14 and is written and produced by the Emmy-winning writers Alan Yang (“Master of None”) and Matt Hubbard (“30 Rock”), signals a big leap from the pair’s sketch-comedy roots. Instead of playing a multitude of outlandish characters on a series with no discernible end (“S.N.L.” is entering its 44th season), the two play a single character each in a comedy capped at eight episodes. “Alan said it was the first time he did a show that had an ending, where he knew where it was going,” Ms. Rudolph said. “That was a huge light bulb for Fred and myself. We both said, ‘Yes, that’s what we want.’ ” The show began coming together in March 2017, when Mr. Armisen and Ms. Rudolph approached Mr. Yang about creating a series for them. Mr. Armisen was wrapping up his sketch series “Portlandia” after eight seasons; Ms. Rudolph was coming off her short-lived variety series with Martin Short, “Maya & Marty.” And they had always shared a desire to do another show together. “I remember Fred reminding me, weren’t we going to do a show where we played monsters or something?” Ms. Rudolph said. Mr. Yang immediately contacted Mr. Hubbard, whom he had worked with on “Parks and Recreation.” The two began brainstorming ideas and presented the actors with several pitches, between “five or so” (Mr. Armisen’s estimate) and “a million” (Ms. Rudolph’s count). Maybe Maya and Fred could be friends, they thought, or they could be dating, or they could be brother and sister? “There was one that had them running a preschool for rich people in Silver Lake,” Mr. Hubbard recalled, sitting in a trailer here with Mr. Yang during a break in filming the series. “I think I pitched a show where they were leaders of a cult.” “That was actually one of the better ideas,” Mr. Yang said. In the winning scenario, Mr. Armisen is Oscar, a dentist in Riverside, Calif., Mr. Yang’s hometown. June, Ms. Rudolph’s character, works at a shady time-share company when she isn’t chickening out of trying to find something better. “I think we thought it would be fun to take two people who are unbelievably good at playing anybody, and have them play a relatively normcore couple in Riverside,” Mr. Hubbard said. But despite their satisfying if somewhat predictable existence in a sleepy suburban Southern California town, June and Oscar find themselves dealing with improbable tragedies, energy-giving fountains and a mysterious briefcase-wielding weirdo. The two were drawn to the series’ unusual story arc, which includes a series of life-changing moments early into the eight-episode run, and the chance to play a pair of characters who grow and change over time. “It’s really about the relationship,” Ms. Rudolph said. “They’re happy, and from the outside, I think everyone sees a loving relationship. But with June, she’s always wondering, what else is out there?” Catherine Keener, who plays Kase, a free spirit who comes between the two, worked with Ms. Rudolph in the 2017 film “We Don’t Belong Here,” but had never worked with Mr. Armisen before. “Individually they’re both brilliant, but they’re another thing when they’re together,” she said. “You can almost see it, this thing, like they’re in this little pocket together. Everyone would stand around and just watch them.” The series has offered both Ms. Rudolph and Mr. Armisen a chance to bust out of the sketch-comedy bubble. “I never thought when I started out that being in comedy would mean being limited to comedy,” she said. “But very quickly, when you demonstrate you can be funny, people label you as a comedian, and they don’t like it when you go outside of that box.” The plotline of the series also allowed everyone involved to get outside for a change. On a chilly afternoon last March, Ms. Rudolph was here at the Leo Carrillo State Beach filming the final episode of the series. Over the course of the day, the actress flew a kite with Julia Ormond, jumped in and out of the Pacific and ran back and forth along the beach in front of Mr. Armisen. “He was off camera, and he was laughing so hard, because I don’t think he’s ever seen me run before,” Ms. Rudolph said. Besides the Malibu beach, the shoots have taken the cast and crew all over the Los Angeles area, including Big Bear and Simi Valley. Mr. Armisen, who moved to California three years ago, has been able to explore the state on Amazon’s dime; for the producers, it’s been a chance to get out from under the faux fluorescent lighting of their previous sitcoms. “ ‘30 Rock’ is in an office, ‘Parks and Rec’ is in an office,” Hubbard recalled. While Ms. Rudolph was flying her kite on the beach, Mr. Armisen hung out by a nearby craft services truck. As he waited for his next scene, he talked about how “S.N.L.,” “Portlandia” and “Forever” feel like extensions of each other (“As corny as it sounds, it’s sort of like a tree, like we’re still all united with all of that”), and why “America’s Funniest Home Videos” will always make him laugh (“I could mention some cool show from England, but as far as actual, immediate laughter, that show still works”). And he talked about the one important advantage “Forever” has over many of his past sketch comedy gigs. “I don’t have to keep putting on different wigs and mustaches and stuff,” he said. “I’m just one character all the way through. I don’t have to think like, ‘Wait, who am I today?’ So that’s been a nice feeling.”",The New York Times
2018,Maybe Your Sleep Problem Isn’t a Problem,"The conventional wisdom is that morning people are high achievers, go-getters, while late risers are lazy. But what if going to bed in the wee hours is actually an advantage? I hate that Delta Air Lines commercial, the one called “4 a.m.,” that mocks me from my in-seat screen. It starts off with a montage of perky professionals, rising before dawn in homes and executive-class hotel rooms around the world, stretching their gym-toned bodies and firing up coffeepots at an hour usually reserved for mating fruit bats. “Here’s to all 180 million of you early risers, go-getters and should-be sleepers,” the voice-over says, as Disney’s “Heigh-Ho” swells in the background. “Because the ones who truly change the world are the ones who can’t wait to get out in it.” Yes, I get it. I have heard this all my life: Society likes morning people. Loves them, actually. Early risers tend to be more punctual, get better grades in school and climb up the corporate ladder. These so-called larks are celebrated as the high achievers, the apple polishers, the C.E.O.s. It’s basically the idea that Ben Franklin touted more than 250 years ago — “early to bed, early to rise” — with everyone else cast as lazy or self-indulgent. But what if they are wrong? What if night owls are actually the unsung geniuses? What if we are the ultimate disrupters and rule changers, the ones who are better suited to a modern, postindustrial society ruled by late-night coders, digital nomads, freelance moguls and co-working entrepreneurs? Perhaps it is finally time for the night owls of the world to rise! (Just not too early, of course.) I knew I was different by the time I was 7 or 8. My parents’ efforts to get me to sleep by 7:30 p.m. were pointless. I have painful memories of those nights, lying wide-awake with the lights out, my mind whirring as I watching the minutes on my old digital clock grind by — 30 minutes, 60, 90. Only my hamster Stuart shared my nocturnal proclivities, rattling along on his squeaky wheel in the darkness. Things got worse in my teens. My father, who was an extreme lark, would wake up by 6:30 a.m. and storm into my room, huffing, “Society starts at dawn,” as he yanked off my bedcover. He was not wrong. Schools, office jobs and sports leagues were all designed around a lark’s schedule. And there was nothing I could do about it. The notion that I could simply reset my internal wiring with a little self-discipline seemed patently false, likely damaging. Keep in mind that my sleep hygiene, to invoke a term that had not yet come into vogue, was excellent. I didn’t touch alcohol or caffeine, and found it easy to avoid screen time before bedtime, since the only screen in my house was a cathode-tube television serving up dreck like “Joanie Loves Chachi.” Years later, sleep doctors would diagnose me with what is commonly called delayed sleep phase syndrome, which refers to anyone who goes to sleep hours later than the, ahem, “conventional” time. The condition is often boiled down to scary sounding initials — D.S.P.S. — like so many life-threatening diseases. And I have it fairly bad. My body naturally wants to go to bed around 2 a.m. and rise around 10 a.m. Whenever I try to adjust to an early schedule, my brain is like mush. Conversely, I light up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree around 9 p.m., and for the next few hours I am my most me: alert, clever, inspired to create. Not that society has ever shown much flexibility toward my sleep cycle. I have had an office job for most of my adult life, and I am now married with two children under 10, so I regularly rise by 7:30 a.m., doing my best to fake some Fred Rogers good cheer as I pack lunches and get our sons off to school. As a result, I suffer chronic sleep deficit. That is, I have a so-called sleep problem, although technically, that is not accurate. I sleep fine. It is everyone else who has a problem with it. My blue-pill moment came earlier this year, when I read “Why We Sleep,” by Matthew Walker, the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California at Berkeley. The book details how every human runs on a 24-hour circadian rhythm, an internal clock, which coordinates a drop in body temperature, for example, as it prepares for slumber, and cranks back up when it is time to wake. What larks like my father never understood is that not everyone’s clock is the same. According to Dr. Walker, about 40 percent of the population are morning people, 30 percent are evening people, and the remainder land somewhere in between. “Night owls are not owls by choice,” he writes. “They are bound to a delayed schedule by unavoidable DNA hard wiring. It is not their conscious fault, but rather their genetic fate.” (For further proof, researchers at Rockefeller University last year announced the discovery of a gene mutation that apparently accounts for D.S.P.S., meaning that I am, I suppose, a mutant, just like Godzilla and The Toxic Avenger). When night owls are forced to rise early, their prefrontal cortex, which controls sophisticated thought processes and logical reasoning, “remains in a disabled, or ‘offline,’ state,” Dr. Walker writes. “Like a cold engine in an early-morning start, it takes a long time before it warms up to operating temperature.” That might even serve an evolutionary purpose. When early humans lived in small tribes, as in the early scenes of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” staggered sleep schedules bestowed a survival advantage: Someone was always awake to watch for prowling leopards and club-wielding rivals, according to the book. But it has been downhill for us night owls ever since. The rise of agriculture brought fields to till at daybreak. The industrial revolution brought factories with 8 a.m. time clocks. Night owls were forced to adapt, and that appears to have taken a toll. According to a much-publicized study of chronotypes published this year, night owls may die earlier than morning people. Another study, in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, found that night owls are 6 percent more likely to suffer depression than people who slept conventional hours. Various studies have suggested that night owls also drink more, smoke more and have more sex partners (perhaps because it is easier to get lucky at a bar at midnight than in a Starbucks at 7 a.m.). Other research has drawn links to the dark triad of personality disorders: psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism. I certainly know what it is like to burn the candle at both ends. When I graduated from college, I found the morning rhythms of office life to be an eye-opener — though not literally, of course. At my first job, as a newspaper reporter in Orange County, Calif., I was required to be at my desk at 8 a.m. I held that job for 14 months, taking only one week of vacation, but my body never acclimated. Night after night I would lie awake until 1 a.m. or later, freaking out about my inevitable exhaustion the next day, as the Santa Ana winds violently rustled the Italian Cypress trees outside my bedroom window. Even when I dragged myself in at 7:45 a.m., my boss had already been there for an hour, because bosses rise at the crack of dawn, right? That’s why they are bosses. In the corporate world, rising early has always served as a handy signifier of unbridled ambition, the will to succeed. Among C-suite executives, that tradition is alive and well. Robert Iger of Disney, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Indra Nooyi, the departing chief executive of PepsiCo, are all said to rise between 4 and 4:30, and they are relative lazy slobs compared with Tim Cook of Apple, who reportedly bounds out of bed at 3:45 a.m. No surprise that “employees who started work earlier in the day were rated by their supervisors as more conscientious, and thus received higher performance ratings,” according to a 2014 study by the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington. It’s the old “dress like your boss” formula for success, but with chronotypes, not clothes. But what if the modern-day workplace no longer operates under that formula? What if being a night owl is no longer a handicap, but an asset? “I was never a morning person,” Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, said in a 2016 Facebook video interview with Jerry Seinfeld. He reportedly rises around 8 a.m., hours later than traditional executives, but perfectly in line with hacker hours that prevail in Silicon Valley. “The most productive coders I know — and writers and probably a lot of other creatives,” said Tim Ferriss, the life-hacking author and tech investor, “tend to do a lot of their best work when others are asleep, at times that coincide with the fewest inbound distractions.” Tech entrepreneurs are even advertising their night owl tendencies as a status symbol. Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, told Fast Company that he usually sleeps between 3 and 10 a.m. “I don’t use many apps,” he said. “I use naps.” Another next-generation tech titan, Alexis Ohanian of Reddit, is similarly boastful about his late hours, saying that he usually goes to bed around 2 a.m. and rises around 10 a.m., or whenever when his cat wakes him. The traditional 9-to-5 workplace is starting to fall out of favor, especially in Silicon Valley and creative sectors where the workday is no longer tied to daylight hours. And, with robots and artificial intelligence further eroding the old system by taking over the routine tasks, the new workplace culture is less about punctuality and more about creativity and breaking the rules. Say what you will about night owls, but we are a tribe of mavericks. Our hall of fame — or infamy — includes rebels (Keith Richards, Hunter S. Thompson) and revolutionaries (Mao, Stalin), mad geniuses (James Joyce, Prince) and madmen (Charles Manson, Hitler). Even our conventional political heroes (Barack Obama, Winston Churchill) are remembered as genius outsiders. This may not be a coincidence. The very essence of our chronotype makes us oddballs, prone to looking at life through a different lens. We are the weirdos who feel most alive skulking through the darkness, secure in the illusion that we own the world for at least a few precious hours every night while everyone else slumbers. In those wee hours, we feel the freedom to think any thought, dream any dream, safe from the scrutiny and judgment of the strait-laced world. Does that mean we are, in fact, narcissists? Perhaps. We are at least different. Maybe special. At least a few scientists agree. In 2009, Satoshi Kanazawa, a provocative evolutionary psychologist from the London School of Economics and Political Science, inspired many headlines with a study that attempted to suggest that night owls may be more intelligent than larks. Other researchers have suggested that we are preternaturally wired to take risks, a quality that I tend to associate with entrepreneurial verve. A 2014 University of Chicago study found that night owls were “associated with greater general risk-taking” in matters of finance, ethics and leisure. Granted, those traits may add up to embezzler as much as disrupter, but after a lifetime of hearing negatives about our chronotype, I’ll take what I can get. It would certainly make my life easier if scientists somehow proved that night owls were a teensy bit smarter and a weensy bit bolder. But I don’t think you have to go there to feel good about our chances. Corporate America is already catching up. Some 80 percent of companies now offer some form of flexible work arrangements, according to a 2015 survey by WorldatWork, a nonprofit human resources association, and FlexJobs, a career site. For many workers, this means “freedom from a crushing commute, from an interruption-filled office, from a 9-to-5 straitjacket,” said David Heinemeier Hansson, a tech entrepreneur and an author of the book “Remote: Office Not Required.” For night owls, this is huge. No longer must armies of professionals arbitrarily be rousted at daybreak, like groggy recruits heeding a bugle blowing reveille. Indeed, late risers are organizing. Camilla Kring, a Danish business consultant and author, founded B-Society, a night owl advocacy group that is lobbying to end daylight saving time, promote flexible work schedules and adjust start times in schools, “to support different human chronotypes.” “Companies can use the knowledge about circadian rhythms as a competitive advantage,” Ms. Kring said. And maybe they already are. The term “chronotype diversity” is starting to find traction, as business managers explore concepts like team energetic asynchrony: staggered work schedules to make sure all workers are working at peak efficiency. It is about time. Let’s say the whole world finally wakes up to the idea that we night owls are more than laggards and sleepyheads. Fast-forward to 2025, say, and I settle into my seat on a Delta flight, perhaps a supersonic one, to be greeted by a new commercial. It starts off with a montage of perky professionals in executive-class hotel rooms around the world, firing up the kettle for chamomile tea and furiously tapping away at laptops as they race to meet deadlines at an hour usually reserved for James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke.” “Here’s to all 180 million of you late risers, night crawlers and can’t-get-to-sleepers,” the voice-over says, as Eric Clapton’s “After Midnight” swells in the background. “Because the ones who truly change the world are the ones who are still at it when everyone else is fast asleep.”",The New York Times
2018,"Measles in Europe, Recently at Record Low, Jumps to Highest Level Since ’90s","LONDON — Cases of measles, which appeared headed toward elimination in Europe, have soared this year, reaching their highest level in two decades across the Continent as vaccination rates fall short, the World Health Organization reported on Monday. Until the 1990s, there were hundreds of thousands of measles cases in Europe every year, but aggressive vaccination programs pushed that steadily downward, to a record low of 5,273 in 2016. Last year, the figure jumped to 23,927, and in just the first half of 2018 there were more than 41,000 cases, 37 of them fatal. The increase in Europe has come even as measles continues to decline worldwide. Public health officials say that at least 95 percent of a population must have immunity to control the spread of measles, which experts call the world’s most contagious human disease. But in Europe, only about 90 percent of children receive the recommended two-dose vaccine in early childhood as recommended, the W.H.O. said, and last year, only Russia and a handful of small countries reached the 95 percent mark in young children. The rate in the United States was 94 percent. Several European countries, including relatively wealthy ones like France, Belgium and Austria, were at 85 percent or less. And in many countries, vaccination rates for young children have actually declined somewhat in recent years. The cause is a combination of complacency, lack of information, opposition to vaccination, distrust of government, and economic and political instability, said Dr. Mark Muscat, a technical officer in the W.H.O.’s immunization program in Europe. There, as in the United States, some people cling to the discredited theory that vaccines can cause autism. “It’s not just one reason,” Dr. Muscat said. “People are not aware of the potential dangers of this disease, and there are parents who do not see the need to vaccinate their children.” More than half of this year’s European cases, about 23,000 through June, were recorded in Ukraine, while Italy and Greece have also been unusually hard-hit, with more than 2,000 cases each. In Ukraine, the vaccination rate plunged beginning in 2008, as that country endured political and economic crises, a war against Russian-backed forces and medicine shortages. The rate has rebounded, but there is now a large population of older children who were not immunized. “You need 95 percent coverage not just at the national level, but in each community, to keep it from spreading,” Dr. Muscat said. He said it was not clear whether the flow into Europe, in recent years, of millions of migrants from the Middle East and Africa, where vaccination rates are lower, had contributed to the increase. The death rate from measles, which is spread by airborne droplets exhaled by an infected person, is relatively low — a fraction of 1 percent of cases in developed countries, but higher elsewhere — though it can do lasting harm to some survivors. The populations most at risk are people with compromised immune systems who have never had the disease and infants, whose immune systems are not fully developed and who do not receive the first dose of vaccine in the first year after birth. Epidemiologists measure how communicable a disease is by estimating how many people would catch it, on average, from a single infected person in a population without any immunity. For influenza, the figure is 2 to 3. For measles, it is 12 to 18. “If somebody with measles just walks through an airport, that one person could easily give measles to some others who breath the same air,” Dr. Muscat said. Anyone who has had measles, as many older adults have, has lifelong immunity. Vaccines — available since the 1960s, and far more commonly used in recent decades — confer long-lasting immunity, but it is not yet clear whether it is permanent.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Medical Liability Limits,"letter The American College of Emergency Physicians writes that liability protections need to be in place for doctors who provide emergency services. To the Editor: Re “Doctors’ Fear of Lawsuits May Hit Patients in the Wallet, Study Hints” (The Upshot, July 24): It’s common sense, really, that the fear of lawsuits would lead to unnecessary medical tests. The federal government has reported that defensive medicine is driving up the cost of health care for everyone, estimating that cost to be billions of dollars each year. The lack of medical-liability limits has also been linked to work-force shortages in medicine, especially among specialists needed to see patients in emergency departments. Emergency medicine is a unique specialty in that nearly every patient is new. Emergency physicians quickly have to determine a course of action without having prior knowledge of the patient’s medical history, like previous surgeries or allergies. In addition, hospital emergency departments are unique in that they have a federal mandate to screen and stabilize everyone who comes through the door, regardless of ability to pay. We also care for the most severely ill and injured patients who are at greatest risk of dying. Liability protections need to be in place for physicians who provide federally mandated emergency services. It would not only save a lot of money, but it would also help ensure that emergency physicians and the on-call medical specialists that are needed will be there.

2018,"Opinion | Medical School Should Be Free, but Not for Everyone","Cover tuition only for those doctors who agree to go where they are needed most. Dr. Rosenthal was an emergency room doctor before becoming a journalist. The New York University School of Medicine generally won rave reviews last week for announcing that it was eliminating tuition — about $55,000 annually for four years — for all current and future medical students. The stated goal is to eliminate a financial barrier for medical school applicants and to address a crucial imbalance in our country’s physician work force. Research shows that the burden of medical school debt discourages young doctors from going into types of practices that are poorly paid, like primary care, or working in places where many patients are on Medicaid. As a result, there is a shortage of doctors working in these areas. Over all, we have about the same number of doctors for our population as do Canada, Britain and Japan, but American doctors are more likely to be in highly paid subspecialties — orthopedic surgery and the like — rather than on the front lines. N.Y.U.’s plan was a noble attempt to redress this problem. But the medical school got it wrong. And N.Y.U. can look within — to its own law school, in fact — for a far better solution. Many doctors, and certainly most specialists, can pay off those medical school loans quite easily over time. After all, if you’re a doctor, you’re more likely to be a member of the top 1 percent than you would be with any other job. The doctors who usually have the most trouble paying off their debts are those who work in poor areas. They treat hard-to-manage diseases like addiction. And they focus on primary care for any patient who walks in the door — not just those with good insurance. Instead of making medical school free for everyone, N.Y.U. — and all medical schools — should waive tuition only for those students who commit to work where they are needed most. The N.Y.U. law school is a model. It has long had a program that attracts the best and the brightest to the low-wage corners of the legal profession: Each year, 20 students who commit to a career in public service pay no tuition, while those whose ambition hews toward corporate law are charged full freight. Likewise, let those medical students who want to be private practice ophthalmologists in the suburbs of San Francisco take out loans to pay tuition. But the university could demand no payment from those, for example, who commit to becoming primary care doctors and agree to take Medicare and Medicaid or specialists willing to practice in poor areas with doctor shortages. I know that many young people are not sure of their chosen path when they enter medical school. But there are simple ways to adjust the concept. How about all medical schools commit to forgiving or paying back the loans of young doctors who go into lower-paying fields or set up practice in underserved areas — and keep doing so as long as they stay there? The government could reasonably demand such a system from academic medical centers as a precondition for receiving federal subsidies and payments. After all, many receive billions from the government and pay little if any tax because the I.R.S. allows them nonprofit status, in part because they provide “community benefit.” So if a student chooses to become an ear, nose and throat surgeon in suburban New York or a private cardiologist in Miami, fine. He or she can pay back what has been borrowed. But if that doctor chooses to deliver babies in rural Oklahoma or practice pediatrics on the South Side of Chicago, then he or she should get to keep every penny of salary. The federal government and some states, as well as the military, already subsidize medical school tuition or pay back loans in exchange for limited-time service commitments. But that promotes a tour-of-duty mentality. They are also poorly funded and cover a relatively small number of students. The real goal is not short-term payback but to enable and support young doctors who feel that treating patients is a calling, regardless of the patients’ ability to pay. Still, if we want to train the best, most-caring doctors to take the jobs we most need, we have to come up with a fairer way to finance medical education. The titans of medical education should step up to the plate. N.Y.U. took a shot but missed the mark, despite all the hoopla surrounding its announcement and the framing of its offer as generous philanthropy to the tune of $600 million. Every academic medical center should see training the medical work force America needs not as charity but as an obligation, a “community benefit” of the highest order.

2018,"Meet Bill Nelson, the Under-the-Radar Senate Candidate in Florida. He’s the Incumbent.","STUART, Fla. — A few steps away from the St. Lucie River, which has been choked lately with thick blue-green algae that made neighbors sick, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida sat solemnly with a group of elected officials, scientists and activists who had anxious questions about the toxic bloom. A day earlier, Mr. Nelson’s political challenger, Gov. Rick Scott, had begun airing an eye-catching television ad that blamed the senator and the federal government for failing to prevent the environmental crisis. The meeting on Friday was Mr. Nelson’s second visit in a month. And this time, he declared, he was fighting back — not against the algae, but against the governor. “I was playing nice-nice when I was here before, but I’m going to lay out the truth,” Mr. Nelson said. “Governor Scott, in the last eight years, has systematically dismembered and dismantled the environmental agencies of the state of Florida.” Mr. Nelson, rarely a firebrand, then returned to his wonky element, delivering a long history lesson on water management and environmental policy. His audience nodded in agreement. But only a dozen people sat at the table listening to him. Mr. Scott’s ad, on the other hand, with its alarming footage of contaminated Lake Okeechobee juxtaposed with an unflattering image of Mr. Nelson, would reach thousands of potential voters. Faced with a formidable challenge by the wealthy governor, Mr. Nelson, a three-term incumbent, has been pushed into the unexpected position of underdog in one of the most closely watched Senate races of the midterms. After 18 years in office, Mr. Nelson remains less known than his opponent, and he is at risk of losing his seat in a battleground state where Democrats, fueled by anti-Trump energy, have notched four recent bellwether election victories. “The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election,” President Trump taunted at a rally in Tampa last week. “And after a while, you forget: ‘Who’s the senator?’” Panicked Democrats started appealing to Mr. Nelson’s team earlier in the summer to ratchet up the campaign. In the past, Mr. Nelson has won relatively easy re-election, but he faced weak opponents in years favorable to Democrats. In contrast, Mr. Scott has built a political brand around the state’s rebounding economy and has proved to be an aggressive campaigner. The senator has recently become more visible, helped in part by heavy media coverage of the Trump administration’s unpopular policy of separating families who cross the border illegally. Mr. Nelson made headlines when he led an effort to inspect a large shelter for migrant children in South Florida. But that event was something of an anomaly for Mr. Nelson: He has never been a cable news fixture with a deep national imprint. “He is so modest,” said DeAnna Dean, who heads the Democratic Party in heavily Republican Sumter County, home to the state’s fast-growing retirement community, The Villages. “He needs to get out there, and we need to tell people, ‘This is the man you can trust.’” Mr. Nelson is a low-key, gentlemanly product of an earlier Florida and a different Democratic Party. He is a politician easier to envision in the president’s box at a University of Florida football game than posing for selfies in diverse South Beach. When he first won a state House seat in 1972, President Richard M. Nixon was running for re-election and Florida was effectively a one-party state controlled by white Democrats, with relatively few blacks or Latinos in their ranks. Over time, many of Florida’s traditional Democratic voters drifted to the Republican Party as they did in other Southern states. The G.O.P. now controls every statewide elective office in Florida except one: Mr. Nelson’s. In a brief interview after a July campaign event in Miami, Mr. Nelson put the blame for his relatively low profile on his having to spend part of each workweek in Washington, limiting his public exposure back home — though most senators must juggle a similar schedule. Florida’s growing population, with newcomers moving in from other states and from abroad, also requires constant new introductions for a senator who is only on the ballot once every six years, Mr. Nelson said. “If you’re a senator from Delaware, the population doesn’t change,” he said. “This state is growing at 1,000 people a day, and a lot of people that are already here don’t identify with Florida politics. They still identify with the politics up north where they come from.” Mr. Nelson possesses extensive knowledge of Florida issues, ranging from the space program to commercial regulations to the environment. His political currency is a product of his five statewide electoral victories: he won terms as the state treasurer and insurance commissioner before reaching the Senate. But the race is likely to turn on whether he can energize Democrats and win over independents by harnessing widespread distaste for Mr. Trump around the state. At the recent Miami event, as Mr. Nelson tried to focus on United States policy toward Russia and control of the Supreme Court, a woman interrupted him by shouting “Impeachment!” Mr. Nelson’s plan has been to hold off running expensive television advertising until the fall, when it will matter the most, and to be ready to counter any last-minute spending by Mr. Scott, who poured $10 million of his own money into his gubernatorial campaign in the final days of the 2014 race. Mr. Nelson’s strategy has so far left Mr. Scott free to set the terms of the race, as he has tried to do with the ad on the algae bloom. “You need another commercial, because you have been there,” Dr. R. Grant Gilmore, a veteran research biologist, told Mr. Nelson at the environmental meeting in Stuart on Friday. “You have been fighting, and the truth needs to come out.” “Take off the kid gloves,” said Mike Conner, an outdoor writer and fishing guide. “You need to do it soon.” Mr. Scott, 65, has inched up in polls since he entered the race in April against Mr. Nelson, who is 75. Surveys point to a tight race in a state where major elections are often decided by a single percentage point. Democrats say the fact that Mr. Scott hasn’t surged ahead shows that he probably isn’t going to. He won his two terms as governor very narrowly, without receiving more than 50 percent of the vote either time. The Democrats expect his poll numbers to drop once Mr. Nelson starts reminding voters that Mr. Scott was a Tea Party favorite who has a friend in the White House. Mr. Scott, who headed a political action committee for Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, avoided appearing at the president’s rally in Tampa last week. Unable to compete with Mr. Scott’s early advertising onslaught, Democrats have instead tried to help Mr. Nelson by organizing field teams to remind voters about the race. Two women who answered the door during one young volunteer’s recent canvass in heavily Democratic Broward County had at best a hazy recollection of the senator. “My mom was telling me about him,” said Sandra Renninger, 53, of Sunrise. A few doors down, Susan Charboneau, 70, a retired hypnotherapist who moved to Florida from North Carolina four years ago, said she “remembered something” about Mr. Nelson. He’s the only Democrat running for Senate, the canvasser informed her. “Or I could vote for Mickey Mouse,” Ms. Charboneau joked. (The Disney character is, in fact, occasionally listed as Florida voters’ write-in choice.) What may be Mr. Nelson’s most serious shortfall in the race so far is his failure to keep up with Mr. Scott in campaigning to a key demographic group: the state’s Latinos who tend to vote less Democratic in Florida than elsewhere in the country because many of them are Cuban Americans who historically lean Republican. Mr. Scott, who learned some Spanish before his 2014 campaign, broadcast two Spanish-language ads on Telemundo last month during the World Cup. The network drew higher ratings in South Florida than anywhere else in the country during the tournament. Poll after poll has shown Mr. Scott holding his own among Hispanic voters, including Puerto Ricans who relocated to Florida after Hurricane Maria and were expected to lean toward the Democrats. The Puerto Rican influx so far has not been accompanied by a surge in Democratic voter registrations in Central Florida, a swing region, according to data tracked by Steve Schale, a Democratic political consultant. The same polls suggest how Mr. Nelson might win over those voters: by tying Mr. Scott to Mr. Trump, who remains unpopular among Puerto Ricans because of the federal government’s slow and problematic relief efforts after the hurricane. Mr. Nelson was recently endorsed by Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan, who became a darling of the political left after criticizing Mr. Trump’s response to the storm. And at the Miami campaign event, held at a new Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Nelson was welcomed by a former mayor of Miami, Maurice Ferré, a Puerto Rican who praised the senator for having first telephoned him a decade ago to discuss matters important to the island. Mr. Ferré declared that Mr. Nelson has “el corazón boricua,” a Puerto Rican heart. Even so, Armando Figueroa, a Puerto Rican sipping a Medalla beer at the bar, said he had no idea who Mr. Nelson was. Mr. Figueroa has lived in Florida for six years. “We Puerto Ricans love politics — it’s like a sport — and I watch the local news; he doesn’t appear on there much,” said Mr. Figueroa, 41, who like many Puerto Ricans is registered to vote without a party affiliation. “He’s Rick Scott’s opponent? Him I know of because he has been more involved in Puerto Rican issues. I have a good impression of Rick Scott.”",The New York Times
2018,Meet Golf’s Odd Couple: Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson,"On Golf ST. LOUIS — Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson used to be seen as flip sides of the same generation. Woods was a two-seat Lamborghini, built for performance. He stood out from the crowd and left little room for others. Mickelson was a Subaru S.U.V., built for crowds. He was bulky and could accommodate everybody. But those earlier versions, of Woods and Mickelson in their 20s and 30s, have given way in middle age to models that are more similar than not. Mickelson, 48, has turned himself into a sleeker machine who nosed out a player nearly half his age, Justin Thomas, the defending champion of the P.G.A. Championship, to win a World Golf Championships event in Mexico City in March for his 43rd PGA Tour victory — and his first in four years. And Woods, 42, has become less isolated and more welcoming. The steely focus that made him so intimidating in his heyday is still there, but after the last putt drops, he is quick to smile and socialize with other players. After five years spent battling debilitating back pain that required four surgeries, Woods described himself on Tuesday as “very blessed” and said, “It’s a dream come true” to simply be back playing tournament golf. [Follow our live PGA Championship leaderboard here] “He’s more talkative,” Thomas said. “He’s enjoying himself more. He’s obviously still competitive and wants to kill us when he’s out there, but it definitely is a different Tiger than I watched on TV growing up.” Fans who flock to Bellerive Country Club, the site of this week’s 100th P.G.A. Championship, to watch Woods and Mickelson go at each other like the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs are in for a surprise. The thaw that was evident at the Masters in April — when Woods and Mickelson, the best two golfers of their era, played a practice round together — has warmed into a full-fledged partnership. “We’re both kind of realizing that we can get a lot more done together than we can on our own,” Mickelson said. “We’re better together than apart.” An at-odds couple no more, they are completing details for a high-stakes match in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend. And before that, they expect to be a part of the United States team that will take on Europe in next month’s Ryder Cup in Paris. Each is motivated to finish well here to secure a playing berth, either on points or as a captain’s pick. Woods has committed to the team as an assistant to the United States captain, Jim Furyk. Woods was the top-ranked player in the world and Mickelson was No. 2 the last time they were in the field for an event at Bellerive. It was 2001, and the event ended up being canceled because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In those days, Woods and Mickelson seemed so fundamentally different that, Thomas said: “You don’t choose both. You choose one or the other.” Mickelson, a short-game maestro with an easy accessibility to the fans, won his first PGA Tour event while still an amateur and had nine victories when Woods turned pro in 1996. Woods, a power hitter whose early interactions with the public were mostly limited to when he hit his ball into the crowd, won the 1997 Masters, his first major start as a pro, in a rout. Over the next decade, he dominated golf as perhaps no athlete has ruled any other sport, accruing eight of his 14 major titles before Mickelson won the 2004 Masters for the first of his five major victories. The millennials making their mark on golf now — players like Thomas, 25; Jordan Spieth, 25; and Rory McIlroy, 29 — grew up wanting to be like Woods. “It’s like any 8-year-old kid; right now, he probably wants to cheer for the Warriors,” Thomas said, referring to the team that has won three of the past four N.B.A. championships. His appreciation for Mickelson would come much later, once he was on the tour and saw his strengths up close. “I really, really respect him, and I really, really respect what he’s doing now,” Thomas said. “I think people forget that a lot, that he’s playing at a very high level very often at 48 years old.” As a youngster, Spieth was skeptical of Mickelson’s sunny demeanor and constant good cheer around the fans. “He’s real, but he’s wired differently than I am, which is why I thought he was fake,” Spieth said. “I really thought there’s no way this guy can be that way — smile and give the thumbs up — all the time,” Spieth continued, adding, “And then you start to really see how he is when no one’s looking, and he’s the exact same person.” Woods and Mickelson don’t have the same wiring, either. “They’re different people,” Spieth said. But as Woods became a parent — and split custody after his 2010 divorce — his daughter, Sam Alexis, 11, and his son, Charlie Axel, 9, helped him find a lower gear in which to idle. “When I play a bad round, I fester a little bit, but now I go home and I’ll be with the kids or they want to talk and FaceTime,” Woods said, adding, “When it’s time to play, it’s time to play, and when it’s not, it’s just different.” Mickelson has striven to put his family ahead of golf: Last year, he bypassed the United States Open, the only major he has not won, to attend the high school graduation of his firstborn, Amanda. A few of Mickelson’s playing colleagues immediately thought of Amanda and her two siblings, Sophia, 16, and Evan, 15, when they watched him dancing enthusiastically but inexpertly in a new commercial for his line of golf dress shirts. “We were saying, like, what are his kids’ friends going to say when they go back to school?” McIlroy said with a laugh. Mickelson said his children were cool with it. “They helped me pick out the moves,” he said, adding, “I think it’s fun to laugh at yourself.” Woods’s humor came through last week during the stilted dance that is his postround scrum with reporters. After his Saturday round at the World Golf Championships event in Ohio, he stepped to the podium wiping perspiration from his face. “You are sweating like Martha Stewart getting a stock tip,” Michael Collins of ESPN joked. Without skipping a beat, Woods replied, “Before or after?” The next day, after a disappointing tie for 31st, Woods talked about hitting a few pulls off the tee and a few blocks. “I had them both going this week,” he said with a smile. Asked if he needed a day off, he joked, “I’m done pretty early today so I’ll have this afternoon off.” It would have been hard to imagine the Woods of a decade ago poking fun at his bad shots or an early Sunday finish. It would have been just as hard to picture Mickelson playing in the event that Woods hosts every December. But last week, Mickelson said he was seriously considering adding the Bahamas tournament to his schedule. When a reporter relayed the news to Woods, he beamed. “Oh, he didn’t say that to me,” he said. “That made me feel better.”",The New York Times
2018,Meet Iceland’s Whaling Magnate. He Makes No Apologies. ,"Kristjan Loftsson’s company is the last one in the world still hunting fin whales. His credo: “If it’s sustainable, you hunt.” REYKJAVIK, Iceland — It was a whale sighting, but not the kind the visitors expected. One summer day off the coast of Iceland, on a calm sea, a whaling crew towing freshly killed fin whales chugged past a tourist boat. Whale cruises are popular in Iceland, and for good reason. There are plenty of things to see — fin whales tend to stay far offshore, but minke whales, humpbacks, dolphins, porpoises and puffins are usually easier to find. Commercial whaling, it turns out, is not so popular among the whale-watching crowd. While some don’t object to seeing dead whales on vacation — as those tourists did in 2015, and others have since — “most people clearly despise it,” said Sigurlaug Sigurdardottir, a whale-watching guide. With that in mind, Kristjan Loftsson, the man who runs the whaling operation responsible, had a suggestion for whale watchers who see his boats: “Just tell them to look somewhere else. They can just turn around and look the other way.” Mr. Loftsson, 75, is the world’s last commercial hunter of fin whales. He has been denounced by environmental groups and his boats have been sunk by radical activists, but his business is legal here because Iceland doesn’t recognize the international moratorium on commercial whaling. Though essentially an international outcast, he is admired by some at home. And even his most passionate critics give him a measure of respect. Robert Read, chief operating officer of the British branch of Sea Shepherd, a conservation group that has blocked and harassed whaling ships at sea, called Mr. Loftsson “quite a clever man.” “If you ask him a question, he generally will answer you, but he’ll pause and think before he speaks,” Mr. Read said. “That’s something that we don’t often see.” Mr. Loftsson likes to say that whale blood runs in his veins. He and his sister together are the largest shareholders in Hvalur, the whaling business once run by their father. (Hvalur, pronounced KVA-lur, is the Icelandic word for whale.) They spent many of their childhood summers at the company’s whaling station. Mr. Loftsson watched as whales were brought to shore and carved up by hand. At age 13, he got a job helping out on a boat, washing dishes and scrubbing floors. “It was fun,” he said of his early days on the boat. Later, he worked as a deckhand. In 1974, when Mr. Loftsson was 31, his father died and he became head of the company. Today, Iceland and Norway are the only countries that allow commercial whaling. Japanese hunters operate under a research permit issued by their own government, and aboriginal subsistence hunting takes place in a handful of countries that includes the United States, Canada, Russia and Greenland. Globally, fin whales are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and commercial hunting of the species was halted in Iceland for 20 years, though some whales were taken under scientific permits. In 2006, the government allowed hunting to resume. (The next year, an assessment by the I.U.C.N. found that populations in the North Atlantic were not threatened. A 2015 survey estimated there were 40,000 fin whales in the central North Atlantic.) The country has come under steady international pressure to end whaling. In 2013, President Barack Obama called for an end to the hunt. The following year, the European Union led an international protest against Iceland’s whaling. So far, the government has stood its ground. And the hunt has support in Iceland. Only a third of Icelanders surveyed this year expressed some level of disapproval of whaling. Fin whales are almost the largest animals on Earth; only blue whales are longer and heavier. Scientists from Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute say as long as quotas are respected, fin whales will remain abundant in Icelandic waters. For Mr. Loftsson and his supporters, whaling is no different than agriculture or fisheries. “If it’s sustainable, you hunt,” he said. His boats hunt with explosive-tipped harpoons. The charge is designed to go off inside the animal’s body. Sometimes, a second shot is needed. Mr. Loftsson likened that to big game hunting, where an elk doesn’t always die from the first bullet. Ultimately, he said, the whales “give a few jerks, and then they just sink.” The dead whale is then secured to the ship and taken to Iceland’s only whaling station, in a fjord north of Reykjavik, where it’s sliced up for meat. Most of it is destined for Japan. This summer, Iceland’s Ministry of Fisheries has given Mr. Loftsson’s company permission to hunt 238 fin whales. And hunt they do. It was close to midnight one day late in July when the 50th and 51st whales of the season were hauled to the whaling station in the summer twilight. Steep, gray mountains loomed as the 70-year-old boat neared the station. A team of workers was waiting, getting ready to flense the carcasses. As the workers prepared for the processing, which would take place outside, one of them kept the beat with his cutting tool as the soundtrack from “Grease” blasted through speakers at the station. As the first whale was pulled ashore and the team got to work, steam rose from the station and a smell something like cat food filled the cool air. Four members of Sea Shepherd had shown up to make sure the world knew what was going on. Armed with smartphones and cameras, they live-streamed the event from a grassy hill above the station. The group has a long history with Mr. Loftsson. One night in November 1986, a pair of activists boarded two of his boats in the Reykjavik harbor and opened the seacocks, letting water flow in. The boats sank up to their wheelhouses. The activists jumped on a plane and never faced trial in Iceland. Sea Shepherd took responsibility for the attack. The boats were refloated but haven’t been used since. Making them seaworthy again would take a lot of work, Mr. Loftsson said. “I don’t really think it will ever be done.” It’s unclear whether the whaling operation is profitable. Mr. Loftsson said it was generally doing well, although restarting whaling after the long hiatus had been costly. He also described Japanese food safety procedures as a huge hurdle. He declined to cite numbers. Mr. Loftsson said he had also had problems moving his product because shipping companies were reluctant to carry whale meat. One of his projects is to develop a freeze-dried whale powder that could be sprinkled on cereal as an iron supplement. He called the idea “exciting as hell” but acknowledged that the powder could be hard to market. Whether or not the whaling operation is making money (the company has held investments in other businesses like mainstream commercial fishing), Mr. Loftsson is clearly a successful businessman. Public records show that he was assessed the equivalent of roughly $2.8 million in taxes in 2017, pointing to a substantial level of income for that year. He also clearly relishes the life. When he goes to the whaling station, he stays in a World War II-era hut left by Allied forces. It’s nice in the pouring rain, he said, hearing the drops pounding on the corrugated metal roof. “I’m there a lot,” he said of the station, though he acknowledged that he doesn’t do much more than “see what’s going on, get fresh air in the lungs and that kind of thing.” Still, considering the headaches around his business, is fresh air and the sound of rain worth the trouble? Wouldn’t it be easier to do something else? “Sure, you can do anything, but why should you stop doing this?” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with this.” For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.",The New York Times
2018,"Meet Josh Shapiro, the Man Behind the Bombshell Investigation of Clergy Sexual Abuse","As attorney general of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shapiro rooted out sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, prompting international calls for reform. Now, he talks about the anti-Semitism he faced, how the report shaped his own spirituality, and the possibility of a federal investigation. Josh Shapiro had no idea about the secret grand jury investigation that was waiting on his desk when he was sworn in as attorney general of Pennsylvania last year. But he pushed the nascent inquiry forward with the “full force” of his office, and this month that investigation — into the Catholic Church’s cover-up of sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children over decades — was finally revealed in a bombshell report, prompting outrage, anger and international calls for legal and spiritual reform. “It just was the most purposeful thing, short of giving life to our four children, I’ve ever done in my life,” Mr. Shapiro said in a phone interview. His investigation into Catholic clergy sexual abuse has certainly garnered the most public attention, but even before it Mr. Shapiro’s broader national profile had been rising. Just two weeks after he was sworn into office, he and other attorneys general fought President Trump’s first travel ban. In December, he got an injunction to halt Mr. Trump’s birth control rollback. Last month, he sued to stop Pennsylvanians from being able to download plans to print 3D guns. Mr. Shapiro talked with The New York Times about the blockbuster report, the possibility of a federal grand jury investigation, how this case has influenced his own spirituality, and his political ambitions. The following is an edited and condensed version of that conversation. Q. You graduated from Georgetown Law, a Jesuit school, in 2002, right when the Catholic clergy child sex abuse scandal in Boston was breaking. How did that influence you? A. I’ve really focused a lot on child welfare and dealing with child abuse issues. I can remember as a young boy, early teenage years, going with my dad, who’s a pediatrician, when my dad would testify on behalf of the commonwealth in child abuse cases. This has been something that has been part of who I am, literally, as I’ve grown up. This particular investigation actually started in 2016, not too long before your tenure. Walk me through what happened when you took office, when this landed on your desk. Obviously, I didn’t know about it. It was a secret grand jury investigation. I was presented with an investigation that was in its very, very early stages, and presented with the choice of moving forward with this investigation or ending it. Really? Yes. I made it clear I wanted the investigation to continue. I put the full force of our office into this investigation. Tell me about some of the key moments along the way. There was one bishop, Bishop Lawrence Persico of Erie, who, unlike all the other bishops, actually agreed to testify before the grand jury. I went to Erie to see him, to try to search for some common ground with him, whereby which he would agree to publicly state that there were efforts to try to shut this down, and that he would not participate in those efforts. I knew that if I could convince Bishop Persico to say that, it would force the hand of the other bishops. Each of the other bishops, almost immediately, came out and made statements that they too wouldn’t block the report — when at least two of them were working behind the scenes to shut the report down. Which two? It was [the dioceses of] Greensburg and Harrisburg. There were all kinds of efforts being led by our opponents within the church, and supporters of the church, really powerful lobbyists and lawyers who would file all kinds of motions — which, again, I think a lot of that I still can’t speak about — or take certain steps to either derail our investigation or shut it down. You sent a very public letter to Pope Francis, asking him to personally tell church leaders to stop blocking the release of the investigation’s findings. Did you ever hear back from him? We’ve heard back now twice through the pope’s spokesman, Greg Burke. Of course the couple-thousand-word letter from the pope a few days ago. That’s the public response. Nothing to you? Not to date. I had the high honor of meeting the pope, as I described in that letter. Not only was it such a moving and spiritual moment for me to meet the Holy Father; literally minutes after we met, steps from where we met, he visited with abuse victims, and set a new standard for the church that his own leadership in Pennsylvania was not meeting. I thought it was important for him to know. What have you heard from other attorneys general in other states about pursuing similar investigations? I have heard from several attorneys general of both parties, from really across the country, trying to understand how we conducted our investigation, asking in some cases general — and in some cases very specific — questions about either the broad structure of an investigation, or a specific priest who might now be within their state. Should Jeff Sessions open a federal grand jury investigation on Catholic clergy child sex abuse? I have spoken to a representative of the Department of Justice. Beyond that, I do not think it would be prudent for me to comment. Did they reach out to you? Yes. After the release? Yes. After the release, and related to the release of our report. I’ve heard questions about the report in a few areas. People say to me, O.K., there are hundreds of allegations in the report. How did the attorney general determine which were true and which were false? Or is just every accusation from decades in there? While the grand jury named 301 predator priests, they actually got reports on more than 400. What we did in this process was to be very conservative in how many, and which, predator priests were named. Another question I’ve been getting: Was the rate of abuse higher in the Catholic Church than in other institutions during the same time period? Really what people have asked is, why single out the Catholic Church? My record is very clear. We handled the Penn State case and got convictions on all three senior-level officials, the president and the two vice presidents for covering up the Sandusky crimes. We just arrested a local police chief and a local deputy coroner and county prison guards for covering up sexual abuse, in some cases of minors, in other cases of adult women. We go after these kinds of cover-up and abuse wherever we find it. Do you think the Catholic Church has made any progress in stopping child sexual abuse in the last 30 years? The notion this is just something that happened a long time ago, and that we need to move on, is exactly the wrong response. Child rape is child rape, whether it happened in 1970 or it happens in 2018. There is no excuse for allowing it. And there is no excuse for covering it up. Are you worried at all about alienating Catholic voters in Pennsylvania? I never once thought about the politics of this. And frankly, to do this job effectively, you can’t think about the politics of any investigation. I’ve always believed, since my first time running for office, that good government is good politics. More personally, you are Jewish. How has this investigation influenced your own spirituality? My faith and my family are central to my life and ground me. We do celebrate the Sabbath each week together as a family. As a person of deep faith, I was deeply offended by the weaponization of faith that we found in the grand jury investigation. I am in public service because Scripture teaches us that no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it. Everyone has a responsibility to get off the sidelines, get in the game and do their part. Did you ever encounter any pushback fighting the Catholic Church on this issue as a Jewish man? Certainly I’ve experienced anti-Semitism. There were a number of statements, emails. I don’t read a lot of my social media, but social media postings like that, that were just clearly anti-Semitic. I frankly don’t pay any of that much mind. If at the end of the day, your response to the grand jury report, which uncovered this type of horrific abuse and cover-up, is to attack me with an anti-Semitic slur, then frankly you’ve got the issue. In the midst of this investigation, you’ve been aggressive on a number of other fronts. What do you see as your role in this political moment? There’s a lot the president does that I disagree with, but I’m not some congressman that just opines all day about stuff. My job is to adhere to the rule of law and make sure the law is being followed. Where I see it not happening, like for example when the president decided he didn’t like Obamacare’s guarantee that women would have access to contraception, and just one day did away with it, whether you agree or disagree with his decision — I obviously disagree — the fact is that the rule of law requires him to continue to provide access to contraception. We sued and won a nationwide injunction. Similarly, when he authored his travel ban, which ultimately became law, the second one or third one, I didn’t sue him. Even though I thought it was the worst policy and makes us less safe and is fundamentally wrong, I thought what he did was lawful. So, what happens next? You’ve got a big political fight coming up in the Legislature now about changing statute of limitation laws. The majority leader in the statehouse has said their first order of business is going to be to bring up a bill that will basically contain these four recommendations. I don’t know how any responsible lawmaker, after reading this report, and reading the specific recommendations of the grand jury, could not vote in favor of that legislation. I have one more question: Are you running for governor in a few years? I love my job as attorney general, and I am hopeful that my wife and four kids give me the go-ahead to run for re-election.",The New York Times

2018,"Meet Peter Polansky, Tennis’s Luckiest Loser","Sitting in the lobby of a Midtown Manhattan hotel, Peter Polansky was struggling with the attention generated by his record-setting year at the Grand Slam events. “I had to turn notifications off for Twitter,” he said. “It was kind of annoying, actually. I can see now how the celebs have it.” Polansky was joking, of course; even he knows he is still more of a curiosity than a celebrity, despite his year of remarkable resilience. Four times this year Polansky lost in the final round of qualifying for a Grand Slam event, and four times he was able to enter anyway, drawn to a replace a late-withdrawing player. He thus completed the first calendar-year Grand Slam of being a lucky loser. Not that he wanted any part of the feat. “You don’t want to take that risk of losing in qualies — it doesn’t make any sense,” Polansky said. “You always want to get through on your own.” Assuming he does not become United States Open champion, Polansky, 30, will have been eliminated from a Grand Slam singles draw eight times this year, double what most players manage. “It’s not the best accomplishment,” he said. “But it’s something that I think is super fun. I don’t think it will ever happen again.” “I feel like I could be a question on ‘Jeopardy!’ or something,” he added. There was more to Polansky’s feat than just luck or losing, however. This year, he also had to manage a run of relentlessly middling performances: results that were good enough to be one of the highest seeds in qualifying, but not good enough to grant him direct entry into the draw. Four times he advanced through two qualifying rounds, which are some of the most pressure-packed weeks of the year, only to lose in the third. And each time that happened, Polansky needed a player to withdraw, and for his ranking to be high enough to secure a spot in the lucky loser draw. So when he lost in his final qualifying match once again on Friday, falling by 7-5, 1-6, 6-3 to Donald Young, the stage was set for Polansky to complete his regrettable but remarkable sweep. “Beating Donald Young yesterday, I would take that over this ‘record,’” Polansky said Saturday, making quotation marks with his fingers. “But at the same time, I was thinking, Wow, this could be a fourth lucky loser in a row at a Slam, it was something that’s unheard-of. It was kind of a fun thought to have in the back of my mind, but I was never planning on anything like that.” Polansky hung around for five hours after his loss to Young, awaiting his fate. Pablo Cuevas had pulled out of the main draw on Thursday to open up one lucky loser spot, and when Jared Donaldson pulled out on Friday afternoon — after Polansky lost — there was suddenly a second. Polansky rushed to the referee’s office after the final qualifying match had ended to witness the determination of the lucky loser order, knowing he would need to be drawn into one of the first two spots. Tournament officials, aware of what was at stake, let Polansky pull the chips himself. He picked his own, No. 2, first; next came 1 (Lorenzo Sonego), then 3 (Ruben Bemelmans), then 4 (Nicolas Mahut). Bemelmans and Mahut eventually made it into the main draw too after two more players withdrew. History made, Polansky walked out of the referee’s office with his arms held high, and mimicked a mic drop. To celebrate his apparent invincibility, Polansky tweeted an image of Heath Ledger as the unkillable Joker from “The Dark Knight,” adding the caption “LL-SLAM COMPLETE.” While some fellow players cheered his feat, other users on Twitter chided him for appearing to revel in repeated failure. “Some people are like, ‘This is shameful, why are you proud of losing?’” Polansky said. “Some people take it too seriously.” Though the lucky loser Grand Slam remains incredibly unlikely, Polansky might have found the perfect conditions for it this year. Seeking to cut down on first-round retirements by injured players at Grand Slam tournaments, tennis officials instituted a new rule on a trial basis this year that offered injured players half of their first-round prize money if they withdrew before their first match. Last season, there were only a total of five lucky loser spots available for men at the four Grand Slam events; this year, there have been 21, including the four occupied by Polansky. Two other men, the Italians Sonego and Simone Bolelli, have been lucky losers at majors twice this year. Polansky’s luck did have its limits, however: once he secured a spot in the U.S. Open main draw, he was placed into the toughest possible open spot for a qualifier in this year’s draw, facing fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev in the first round. And Polansky lost again, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, in 1 hour 36 minutes. “You’re playing with casino money once you get in as a lucky loser,” said Polansky, who has in fact earned an extra $100,000 through his lucky loser appearances this year. Polansky has shown resilience before this run of unexpected bonuses. A dozen years ago, he had to come back from a serious injury sustained after sleepwalking out of a third-story window, an accident that nearly ended his career. His next goal is to be directly accepted on the strength of his ranking into the next Grand Slam event, the 2019 Australian Open. In an odds-defying career, that is one thing he has never done.",The New York Times

(Go Mercury!) Why did you apply to write for The Edit?I was just tired of not seeing anyone like me writing about the issues and topics I cared about. I figured the only way to change that was to write about them myself. What are you hoping to write about?I’m interested in writing about the way our growing dependence on tech has changed the way we interact and the complex role race still plays in society. I’ll probably have some spicy pop culture takes every now and again. Song of the summer?That’s hard! Toss up between “Guatemala,” by Rae Sremmurd and “Look,” by Got7. Once you go K-pop, you can’t go back! Where did you go to school?I graduated in May 2018 from Wayne State University. I majored in English and minored in sociology. Do you work?

I’m also freelancing for some publications here in Detroit. What are you hoping to write about?As an undecided major during a portion of undergrad, I feel for students who don’t know which direction to head. I‘d like to write for them, imagining what 18-year-old Nushrat would have appreciated. Now, I’m transitioning to life after college and hope to write about this wild experience: the lull right after graduating, the panic that sets in and the sparks of hope for the future. What’s something you don’t know how to do, but you feel like you should?I don’t know how to swim. Song of the summer? Drake, “Nice for What.” What are you reading right now? I’m rereading the Harry Potter series. Where do you go to school? I’m a junior at Harvard College, studying sociology and Spanish. I also work as a commissioned poet and organizer. How surprised were you that you were selected?It’s kind of like being struck by lightning. 20,000 talented people applied and there’s 13 of us. When you do the math, those chances are less than 1 percent. I feel like Charlie with his golden ticket, if Charlie had actually been a skinny black girl poet. Describe where you’re from in five words.The L.A. that’s actually L.A. What are you hoping to write about?Issues related to protest, poetry and political participation (and so the alliteration begins). Song of the summer?“Growing Pains,” by Alessia Cara. I relate, though I haven’t grown in five years. What are you reading right now? I’m rereading Homer’s epics. Where do you go to school?I’m a senior at the University of Oklahoma studying professional writing and history. Do you work? What do you do?I write for a campus magazine, the Crimson Quarterly, and help out in our athletic communications office. Why did you apply to write for The Edit?For me, writing is the best and most rewarding way of processing what I feel, whether I’m responding to something in my own life or a larger cultural moment. What did you do this summer?I spent most of the summer interning at an internet company doing communications and design work, but I made time for a 10-day road trip in July to visit family in Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. That trip was about as great a summer vacation as I can imagine. What’s something you don’t know how to do, but you feel like you should?I’d really like to find the balance between letting the 24-hour news cycle consume me and being an informed citizen and consumer. Song of the summer?“Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” features a new version of Abba’s “Super Trouper” in the movie’s last scene. The “Mamma Mia!” timeline collapses into nonsense, every character is in beautiful, absurd disco costumes and the whole production carries this kind of chaotic joy for two and a half minutes. It’s electric. Where did you go to school? I graduated in 2017 from State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and my major was media studies. Do you work? What do you do? I’m a staff content producer at a Brazilian newspaper called Meio & Mensagem, which focuses on media and advertising issues. Why did you apply to write for The Edit? I want to discuss the hopes, anguishes and interests of young people. Having more Latino voices in The Times can’t do us any harm, right? What did you do this summer?I’m a little late to the minimalism trend, but I finally cleaned out my closet, book shelf and my phone app library. What’s something you don’t know how to do, but you feel like you should?The Brazilian government recently changed the country’s pension system, so I probably should learn how to start investing.

2018,Meet The Times’s ‘Mini Detective Agency’,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Their names appear modestly at the end of articles. Research contributed by Jack Begg, Susan Beachy, Alain Delaquérière, Doris Burke or Kitty Bennett, the credits read. But, while their bylines are unassuming, their work as researchers at The Times often forms the building blocks for the paper’s biggest stories. In the quest to give readers a clear report of events beyond their sightline, editors and reporters consult the research department with urgent and vexing questions. They can track down hard-to-find phone numbers so a newsmaker can comment on an article. After a high-profile trial, they can locate jurors for interviews. If a reporter is on deadline, they can quickly dig out an obscure court document. Or they could learn that Travis Kalanick, former chief executive of Uber, once considered running for governor. So every day, their inboxes fill with reporters’ queries: “Can we find a cell for this guy?” “Will someone please help me find contact information for a man who graduated from Hunter College High School in 2010?” “Hey, could you tell me about these two political action committees and how much they raised in 2018?” “We don’t say no,” said Jack Begg, the department supervisor, who has worked at The Times for 21 years. “Our beat is information,” Mr. Begg said. “We are the experts at finding information.” They also watch social media for developments. And when big news breaks, they gather details on who was there and when and where the events took place. “We have the capacity to put ourselves into a reporter’s shoes. We can say, ‘Gee, if I were on the ground covering this accident, what would I want to know?’” Mr. Begg said. During mass casualty events, such as school shootings, the team looks for contact information for victims, survivors, witnesses and even neighbors. They search over 50 databases that index public records including voter registration, real estate transactions and lawsuits. On the ground, reporters take this intelligence and knock on doors. “They help us break news all the time,” said Julie Bloom, deputy editor on the National desk. “You could try, based on their reporting, three different houses and end up at the right one, and get the interview that no one else has, and that’s what sets us apart especially in a big breaking news story,” Ms. Bloom said. The research department began as an experiment in 1967, according to an old company newsletter, provided by Mr. Begg. The Times was the first paper to add such a department. But with an increasing number of sources, management thought professional researchers could help reporters. “It took a while for reporters, accustomed to doing their own digging, to get used to the idea that someone would do it for them, but once they caught on they came back for more,” according to the newsletter. Similar teams now exist at other media organizations, although many have shrunk with budget cuts. At The Times, the department has survived. “In this environment when things are so fast paced, and we’re dependent on getting everything as quickly and as accurately as possible, they become an essential part of that effort,” Ms. Bloom said. For instance, when reports appeared that a duck boat, full of tourists, had sunk in a lake in Missouri, Susan Beachy, who joined The Times in 2013, started digging. A trained news researcher, with a master’s degree in library sciences, Ms. Beachy trawled Twitter for details about the accident. She searched for specific, less obvious terms that might help find victims, witnesses and survivors. “I feel like Nancy Drew all day long, playing detective and trying to make sense of things that are going on in the news,” Ms. Beachy said. “It’s almost like a mini detective agency in some ways.” Reporters, who want readers to imagine themselves at the scene of a news event, seek specific details. For instance, when the reporter Daniel Victor heard 100 goats were wandering around a suburban Idaho street, he wanted to talk to neighbors who saw the goats. With the help of the research team, Mr. Victor spoke with a homeowner whose garden was affected. “In the case of the goat story,” Mr. Victor said, “seeing it through the eyes of that man and him telling us about his own rose bushes was so much stronger than simply repeating the reports of someone else.” It’s this unique ingredient, Mr. Begg said, that the research department provides. “It’s the difference between some kind of bland pizza sauce and one with oregano and coriander and different spices and herbs,” Mr. Begg said. “That’s why the customer comes back,” he said. “You could say people want any old pizza. But people want a good pizza.”",The New York Times
2018,Meet the Mediums of Lily Dale,"The Look A hamlet in Western New York is home to a community of Spiritualists. LILY DALE, N.Y. — It was the last Friday in June, and this tiny community of pocket-size cottages, their white picket fences festooned with climbing roses, was performing an idealized version of small-town Americana. There was a flag raising with five veterans in full uniform (after which the crowd sang “America the Beautiful”); a butterfly release and four church services. Everything adhered to a postcard quaintness, except for a couple of details: Many of the front doors were adorned with signs that read, “May Be Haunted,” and the church services seemed more like networking events for dead people. “May I come to you, young lady?” asked Sherry Lee Calkins, a white-haired medium with an upturned nose and a sweet smile. She was channeling a spirit before a crowd that had come for the opening of Lily Dale’s summer season. The spirit seemed intent on dispensing cooking tips (encouraging one woman to bake with honey, and another to use more salt) and career advice (consider public speaking or writing, Ms. Calkins said to a third woman in a mauve head scarf, adding that the spirit was offering adjectives from the other side to help her do so, like a spectral thesaurus). “We welcome loved ones, and not-so-loved ones,” said Neal Rzepkowski, a mischievous 66- year-old family doctor and medium who had exchanged his customary T-shirt for a Hogwarts robe (“Hufflepuff — don’t ask — the spirit made me,” he said) to oversee a midafternoon church service. Dr. Rzepkowski, who has been H.I.V. positive half his life and said that this community’s good vibes are a factor in his continued good health, is the president of the Lily Dale Assembly, the organizing body of this 160-acre town. Founded in 1879 as a Spiritualist’s summer retreat, the original Lily Dale was a tented community that welcomed all manner of outsiders, including Susan B. Anthony, already a regular at nearby Chautauqua, the more intellectually minded cultural community founded a few years earlier. While Chautauqua’s engine is philosophical — arts-focused education for grown-ups — Spiritualism is a religious practice. Its central tenet is that the dead are still with us, and eager to chat. But not everyone can hear them. There are 52 registered mediums in residence here, charging $80 to $100 for a half-hour reading, Dr. Rzepkowski said. (To be registered, they pass a number of tests overseen by the members of the Assembly that includes three readings.) Their services, and Lily Dale’s small-town charms, draw about 22,000 visitors each year during the town’s season, which ends the day before Labor Day. (That number has held steady for the last two decades.) There are curious day-trippers, to be sure, but also the truly bereaved, like Karen Mitchell, a hairdresser from Seattle who attended the butterfly release, and said she had an appointment with a medium later that afternoon. Her mother had died six months ago, and she was hoping to connect to her grandfather too. “I miss him dearly,” Ms. Mitchell, 52, said. “I feel like maybe I’m going to connect with myself in a different way.” Spotted in the gift shop, among the tie-dyed T-shirts printed with the words “Old Soul”: a pamphlet titled, “Do I Have To? A Treatise on Reincarnation.” There were young seekers that day, like Gabrielle Abt, 13, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., who wore blue high-tops and cutoffs, and intends to pursue a career in forensic psychology. She is also interested in psychic phenomena and Wicca, otherwise known as contemporary witchcraft. “We’re looking forward to the séance,” said her mother, Meg Roper, 34. Mediums from elsewhere had come to sharpen their practice (one workshop trained them in connecting with trees), and to rub shoulders with their peers at talks like Diversifying American Mediumship or International Perspectives on Spirit Communication. Dawn Bruce, 47, and Barbara Kelleher, 46, are Canadian healers on their fifth trip here, they said. In years past, they had come to learn, but this year they were serving for the first time in the healing temple — hands-on healing on a first-come-first-served basis. Caveat emptor, suggested John White, 72, a medium, mystic and medical intuitive, for the American Medical Association has not blessed these practices. “We have to say that we are not doctors, and that we know you’re going to use common sense,” he said. What is a medical intuitive? “You can see what’s going on in someone’s body,” he said. “People also come to me for help finding something they have lost and expect me to find it, which I can’t. Just because you’re dead doesn’t mean you know a lot. You have the same belief systems as when you’re alive. Close your eyes,” he said to this reporter. “Now open them. That’s what it’s like to be dead.” I winced. “What makes us different from other religions,” Gerta Lestock said, “is that we bring evidence that life continues.” Ms. Lestock, 71, is a physical medium, which means she has a skill set that includes spoon bending and table turning. She spent part of the afternoon before Lily Dale’s opening testing the weight of a table — “If it’s 200 pounds, there’s no way in hell I’ll be able to move it,” she said — and buying extra spoons from an antiques store for a séance she was holding over the weekend. “You’re supposed to bring your own,” she said, “but nobody does.” As it is for many of the mediums practicing here, Lily Dale is Ms. Lestock’s third or fourth life chapter. Ms. Lestock emigrated to Ohio in the late 1960s, part of a mass Jewish exodus from Poland, where she grew up, to escape anti-Semitic government policies. She has been a furrier, a marketing executive and a boxing coach. “I was born Jewish, raised Catholic, baptized Lutheran, and now I’m a Spiritualist minister. I’m covered,” said Ms. Lestock, who moved here full time in 2006. In the 19th century, Western and Central New York were such hotbeds of social revolution, free thought, dubious science and new religions that they were known as the Burned-Over District. There were abolitionists, suffragists and utopians. There were Shakers, if not movers. Joseph Smith was seeing angels; William Avery Rockefeller (father of the founders of Standard Oil) was hawking quack nostrums; and the Fox sisters, a trio of teenagers living in Hydesville, were receiving messages from a dead tin peddler. The Foxes’ exploits contributed to the birth of Spiritualism, though one later admitted they had made their experiences up. Yet they are stars in Lily Dale. Their cottage was moved here in 1915, and its site (it burned to the ground at midcentury) is now the Fox Memorial Garden, still a favorite spot for Spiritualist pilgrims and tourists of the paranormal. Spiritualism may have peaked by the turn of the 20th century, but it accrued a bit of New Age energy in the 1970s, and some reality show love a few decades later (TLC’s “The Long Island Medium,” otherwise known as Theresa Caputo, is an appealing contemporary example). With no central text and only the vaguest core principles, said Mandi Shepp, Lily Dale’s library director, “Spiritualism has always been very personal.” Guessing the number of its practitioners is almost impossible, but the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, based in Lily Dale, counts 85 American churches among its members. Gorgeously tattooed and a with a spray of pale blue hair, Ms. Shepp, 32, is the first professional director the library has had in decades. She was hired in 2014, after having been digital director of the Skeptiseum, an intoxicating virtual museum of fringe science and far-out religion curated by Joe Nickell, a paranormal skeptic. Ms. Shepp has brought some order to the roughly 12,000 volumes here. There are primers on quack medicine, mediumship and slate writing. Manuals for mesmerism and magic. A book of sarcognomy, which is like phrenology except it involves the whole body. (Ambition, ostentation and domesticity, apparently, live in our biceps.) “I personally am an atheist,” Ms. Shepp said. “A grumpy atheist. But I think the culture of Spiritualism is fascinating. This is a dream job for a former teenage Goth girl.”",The New York Times
2018,Meet the Special Counsel Team: So Careful They Won’t Even Disclose Their Shake Shack Orders,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Greg D. Andres looked like any ordinary guest at the Westin hotel here, standing near the valet in flip-flops and a white Notre Dame boxing T-shirt, waiting for a Postmates delivery from Shake Shack. The moment would be unremarkable save for Mr. Andres’s role as the lead prosecutor for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the trial of Paul Manafort, concluding its third week here. Even the briefest glimpses of Mr. Mueller’s investigators, who have spoken publicly only in court papers and short court appearances since the inquiry began, draw notice. Mr. Manafort’s tax and bank fraud trial has provided the first real look at the special counsel’s team, the elusive players in the central drama of Washington political life and the subjects of fascination for the capital’s chattering classes. Tagged by President Trump as “17 angry Democrats,” they have shown themselves to be typical, if harried, government lawyers, staying at the hotel opposite the courthouse to devote most of their waking hours to trying the case. Other members of the special counsel’s office have joined Mr. Andres in the courtroom, including Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s top deputies, who oversaw the prosecution from a seat in the back. Like a basketball coach during timeouts, he huddled with the others during recesses for strategy sessions, clutching a green government-issue notebook that the rest of the team used during the trial, making them easy to identify. The prosecutors snacked on Life Savers and orange-colored Starburst candy from jars that sat near Judge T. S. Ellis III. They drank from worn foam cups marked with their initials. Next to them sat a black catering-style cart labeled “Property of SCO” — Special Counsel’s Office — piled with binders of documents. Mr. Mueller’s spokesman, Peter Carr, whose “no comment” replies have become a running dark joke among the Washington press corps, sat among the spectators and reporters. He would not even confirm Mr. Andres’s order from Shake Shack, deferring to reportorial observation. Nor would Mr. Andres himself. Asked later whether he had in fact ordered Shake Shack, he laughed, then paused. “I can’t say,” he said, his usual response when journalists at the hotel asked him about his work as he strolled the lobby juggling half-eaten bags of Lay’s potato chips, Starbucks beverages and Diet Coke, his hair tousled and tie loosened. He did wonder aloud on Wednesday outside the gift shop, which is filled with postcards and key chains celebrating Mr. Trump’s inauguration, whether he had included every important detail during his final rebuttal after closing arguments. As the prosecutors have shuttled between the courtroom and the hotel, they have found themselves in tight spaces with Mr. Manafort’s lawyers and reporters, testing their professional and social boundaries. The two sides went out of their way to be civil, bantering and making small talk about sports and work, a person close to Mr. Manafort’s defense team said. Encounters with reporters have proved more delicate. In one instance, Uzo Asonye, one of the special counsel prosecutors, stepped into an elevator with a colleague whom he stopped midsentence. “Stop,” he said, gesturing to the reporter’s press badge. He held up his hand to silence her. He turned to the reporter with a smile. “Sorry. I can’t talk to you.” The prosecutors’ habits are to be expected in such a big case, former members of independent counsel teams said. The difference this time is the magnitude of the investigation paired with an era of instant news. “This is unusual,” said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a deputy independent counsel who was selected by Judge Kenneth W. Starr to handle the grand jury questioning of President Bill Clinton. “This is a major, major trial with intense press interest in an era when you have 24-hour cable news.” During the 2007 trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney’s former chief of staff who was convicted of perjury in connection with the leak of a C.I.A. officer’s identity, the prosecution team took unusual measures to deter attention, said Peter R. Zeidenberg, a deputy special counsel in the case. Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the lead prosecutor, at one point negotiated with a photographer to allow for a picture of him picking up coffee. The deal, Mr. Zeidenberg said, was that the photographer would then leave Mr. Fitzgerald alone. Perhaps no member of Mr. Mueller’s team has drawn more curiosity than the special counsel himself, who has not spoken publicly about the inquiry. The void has filled with speculation about the smallest observations — even about his choice of watch, the hyper-accurate Casio DW-290, which he wears with the face on the inside of his wrist. Public sightings of him are scarce. A New York Times reporter spotted Mr. Mueller leaving a 7-Eleven convenience store in Washington on a Saturday morning this winter in a cinched-waist parka and gym clothes, walking to a small sport utility vehicle. Mr. Mueller got behind the wheel, made a U-turn to cross a double yellow line and drove away. Most of the sightings draw buzz. A photo of Mr. Mueller waiting to cross a street in downtown Washington made the rounds on social media. Last month, Politico published a photograph of Mr. Mueller feet away from Donald Trump Jr. at a gate at Reagan National Airport. The image quickly boomeranged around Twitter and was picked up by many news outlets. Thomas Burr, the Washington bureau chief for The Salt Lake Tribune, was eating dinner with his girlfriend at a Washington restaurant in June when Mr. Mueller and his wife walked by their table and said hello. “They got a booth,” Mr. Burr said, “and we left them alone.” Mr. Burr tweeted about the encounter but declined to specify the restaurant, for fear of giving it unwanted attention. The scene across the Potomac River in Alexandria did provide a reminder that not everyone is riveted by the Russia investigation. On Wednesday evening, New York Jets players, staying at the Westin before a preseason game against the Washington Redskins, sat at the bar near the defense lawyers. As they signed autographs, some asked reporters who Mr. Manafort was and why so many cameras were set up on the front curb.",The New York Times

WINNERS TAKE ALL The Elite Charade of Changing the World By Anand Giridharadas 288 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. First came the books describing just how much worse economic inequality had become over the past 20 years, with all the dramatic political implications now impossible to ignore. Then there were the tomes about globalization (including my own, I admit), detailing the West’s unfettered pursuit of neoliberal policies that abetted all this unfairness. Well, prepare for a new genre: books gently and politely skewering the corporate titans who claim to be solving such problems. It’s an elite that, rather than pushing for systemic change, only reinforces our lopsided economic reality — all while hobnobbing on the conference circuit and trafficking in platitudes. Anand Giridharadas, a former columnist for The New York Times, spoke about this phenomenon at an Aspen Institute conference in 2015, and he takes his ideas further in his entertaining and gripping new book, “Winners Take All.” As the Democratic Party struggles to figure out its future and global demagogy thrives, it’s worth considering where we went wrong and how best to save the world from the dangerous turn it has taken. It’s now very clear that globalization, technology and market liberalization did not bring their promised benefits — at least not for the vast majority of Americans and those in advanced countries around the world. For those at the helm, the philanthropic plutocrats and aspiring “change agents” who believe they are helping but are actually making things worse, it’s time for a reckoning with their role in this spiraling dilemma. I suggest they might want to read a copy of this book while in the Hamptons this summer. In a series of chapters centered on different individuals who are part of this rarefied class, Giridharadas exposes the rationalizations of the 0.001 percent who actually believe they are making the world a better place. The Sacklers helped create the opioid crisis but give money to important causes. The chief executive of Cinnabon thinks that being transparent about the fat and sugar she peddles offsets the harm her company creates. It’s a land of PowerPoint presentations and cuddly good intentions. Giridharadas calls this prevailing ethos “MarketWorld,” made up of people who want “to do well and do good.” He beautifully catches the language of Aspen, Davos and the recently extant Clinton Global Initiative, which will doubtless reappear in the newly born Bloomberg initiative. It’s a world of feel-good clichés like “win-win” and “make a difference.” The rote conversations of this crowd were on recent display at the Public Theater, in the beginning of the second act of the Bruce Norris play “The Low Road.” As Giridharadas describes the ethos of MarketWorld, it’s made up of people like former President Bill Clinton who saw the anger bubbling up but proved unable to “call out elites for their sins: or call for power’s redistribution and fundamental systemic change; or suggest that plutocrats might have to surrender precious things for others to have a mere shot of transcending indecency.” Like the dieter who would rather do anything to lose weight than actually eat less, this business elite would save the world through social impact investing, entrepreneurship, sustainable capitalism, philanthro-capitalism, artificial intelligence, market-driven solutions. They would fund a million of these buzzwordy programs rather than fundamentally question the rules of the game — or even alter their own behavior to reduce the harm of the existing distorted, inefficient and unfair rules. Doing the right thing — and moving away from their win-win mentality — would involve real sacrifice; instead, it’s easier to focus on their pet projects and initiatives. As Giridharadas puts it, people wanted to do “virtuous side projects instead of doing their day jobs more honorably.” In order to really have an economy with the greatest opportunity for all, the kind of economy they seem to champion, the MarketWorlders would have to pay high levels of corporate and personal income tax, offer decent wages to their workers, allow unions, fund public schools (instead of pet charter projects) and support some form of single payer health care and campaign finance reform. One simply can’t arrive at a more economically equal reality when the rungs of the ladder are so far apart. At Davos and the other international conclaves where the muckety-mucks celebrate the new economic world they have helped create, which has rewarded them so amply, corporate leaders move seamlessly from sessions discussing the risks of climate change, growing inequality and financial instability, to dinners at which they praise tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and applaud proposals for deregulation. They conveniently don’t mention the increases in taxes on a majority of those in the middle, the Republican moves to eliminate health insurance for some 13 million in a country where life expectancy is already in decline, the increase in pollution, the risk of another financial crisis, the ever increasing evidence of moral turpitude — whether it’s Wells Fargo cheating its customers or Volkswagen cheating on its emission tests. Cognitive dissonance is intrinsic to MarketWorld. Giridharadas rightly argues that this misallocation of resources creates a grave opportunity cost. The money and time the MarketWorlders spend fixing the edges of our fraying social order could be used to push for real change. This is especially so in the political battles in which the country is currently engaged, where a majority of the Supreme Court and members of Congress seem hellbent on rewriting the rules of the American economy and political system in ways that will exacerbate economic disparities, increase monopoly power, and decrease access to health care and women’s reproductive rights. Moreover, the ideology of the MarketWorlders has spread and just espousing it has come to seem like a solution instead of the distraction that it is. Giridharadas shows how this is done. One category of enabler he describes is the cringeworthy “thought-leader,” who nudges plutocrats to think more about the poor but never actually challenges them, thus stroking them and allowing them to feel their MarketWorld approaches are acceptable rather than the cop-outs they are. Another recent book, the historian Nancy MacLean’s “Democracy in Chains,” provides a salutary lesson on the dangerous ways a self-serving ideology can spread. Giridharadas embedded himself in the world he writes about, much as the journalist David Callahan (who edits the Inside Philanthropy website) did for his recent book, “The Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.” And like Callahan, Giridharadas is careful not to offend. He writes on two levels — seemingly tactful and subtle — but ultimately he presents a devastating portrait of a whole class, one easier to satirize than to reform. Perhaps recognizing the intractability and complexity of the fix we are in, Giridharadas sidesteps prescriptions by giving the book’s last words to a political scientist, Chiara Cordelli. “This right to speak for others,” Cordelli says, “is simply illegitimate when exercised by a powerful citizen.” Although a more definitive conclusion would have been welcome, Cordelli does point to the real lesson of the book: Democracy and high levels of inequality of the kind that have come to characterize the United States are simply incompatible. Very rich people will always use money to maintain their political and economic power. But now we have another group: the unwitting enablers. Despite believing they are working for a better world, they are at most chipping away at the margins, making slight course corrections, while the system goes on as it is, uninterrupted. The subtitle of the book says it all: “The Elite Charade of Changing the World.”",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Melania Trump Could Be Our Greatest First Lady ,"Is this a spectacularly tense marriage or a pussy-bow coup? Opinion Columnist Maybe someday, when the history of Donald Trump’s presidency is written, we’ll pinpoint the start of this week as his pivot into complete derangement and come up with a pithy name for it. Maybe we’ll call it Melania Monday. We’ll note that on Aug. 20, 2018, the first lady, again with a pussy bow, publicly chided cyberbullies at the same time that her husband ranted and raged on Twitter, likening Robert Mueller to Joseph McCarthy and demonstrating a grasp of history commensurate with his grip on civility. We’ll admire the wickedness of her announcement, just hours later, that she’d be making a solo trip — her farthest and flashiest yet as an official ambassador — to Africa, whose nations the president can’t pronounce, let alone respect. She didn’t choose that destination randomly, throwing a dart at a map. She chose it defiantly, throwing shade at her husband. Surely Melania Trump is getting under his skin. Certainly she’s making the effort. If she would just turn these fitful baby steps into full-length strides, she might finally undo him and set us free. Melania the Savior. A pussy-bow coup. Stranger things have happened. Less exhilarating fantasies have been born. And is it really so far-fetched? To judge by his tweets, tantrums and apparent belief that Rudy Giuliani is an appropriate advocate, Donald Trump teeters at the precipice of incoherence and self-destruction, needing only a shove. Who best to administer it but a spouse with her own, separate bedroom in the White House and her own, separate hotel suite when they travel? She inches ever closer to open contempt for him. She finds increasingly clever ways to show it. And it’s a perfect wedding of patriotism and payback for all the humiliations that he has heaped on her. This first-lady thing clearly flummoxed her at first. It’s a ludicrous job. You’re supposed to make a difference without making waves, find a passion while veiling your convictions and smile blithely through a ceaseless forensic examination of your every accessory. It’s infantilizing. It’s objectifying. If a presidential administration were a sedan, the first lady would be its hood ornament. If it were a manse, she’d be the topiary bracketing the front stoop. Usually Melania Trump was absent topiary. America had a denuded front stoop. And we made hasty assumptions. When she initially announced her anti-cyberbullying campaign in a speech in November 2016, we thought that she was out to lunch. Did she not see the contradiction? The updated theory is that she’s trolling him. I buy it. It fits in with so much else. For the president’s first State of the Union address, she wore a white pantsuit that served as a sartorial reminder of suffragists and of Hillary Clinton. This month, after he questioned LeBron James’s intelligence in a tweet, her spokeswoman released a statement that asserted the first lady’s admiration for James’s work with at-risk children in his hometown, Akron, Ohio. Melania was possibly interested in visiting the school there that James had helped to start, the statement said. And my colleagues Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman recently reported that during a trip overseas last month, the president had a fit because the first lady’s television on Air Force One was tuned to CNN, not his beloved Fox News. Was CNN an accident or a provocation? Well, in a public response to the incident, Melania’s spokeswoman made clear that the first lady watches “any channel she wants.” I’m not sure what to make of that “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” jacket that she wore on her way to a detention center for migrant children in Texas. It’s the “rosebud” of our time. But what if the message was that she didn’t mind if we interpreted her behavior as a rebuke of her husband’s? Marriage as psyops — it’s not virgin territory, but the stage and stakes here are epic. On Monday, as The Washington Post’s James Hohmann noted, she used the phrase “global society” in both her spoken remarks about cyberbullying and her written remarks about the trip to Africa, which she praised for its “rich culture.” Her husband, of course, treats “globalists” and “globalism” as dirty words, and some of his “shithole countries” are on that richly cultured continent. She’ll be going there without him. Other first ladies beautified highways, promoted reading, planted squash. This one could abbreviate a nightmare. She’s in a situation that her predecessors weren’t, on the arm of an overlord who needs undermining, and it’s her invitation to greatness, or at least her prompt for an itinerary tailored to taunt. I urge that visit to James’s school. Bring Don Lemon along. I suggest lunch dates with Maxine Waters, Aperol spritzes with Angela Merkel and pajama parties with Nancy Pelosi. And pussy bows and pantsuits for days on end. They’re the threads of a revolution.",The New York Times
2018,"Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House","CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Hours after Melania Trump moved into the White House in June of last year, she peered out a window and took in a stunning view of the Washington Monument: “Looking forward to the memories we’ll make in our new home!” the first lady cheerily wrote on Twitter in a snapshot of the tableau. But Mrs. Trump understood even then that her efforts to forge her own role would be second-guessed and scrutinized at every turn, including by her spouse. Mrs. Trump, a former fashion model who prefers clean, modern lines, had chosen some furniture for the White House residence in the months before she joined her husband in Washington. Yet in her absence, President Trump — whose tastes veer toward the gilded, triumphal style of Louis XIV — replaced her choices with several pieces he liked better. One of two people familiar with the episode cited it as an example of Mr. Trump’s tendency not to relent on even the smallest requests from his wife. A little more than a year later, Mrs. Trump remains an intensely private first lady still adjusting to the demands of a new life. She has few friends in Washington, keeps a light public schedule and when not watching over her 12-year-old son, Barron, returns home to New York — at least once per month, two people close to her say — for meetings and to visit a small circle of associates, including her sister and her hairstylist. Unlike other modern first ladies who wielded influence behind the scenes, friends say Mrs. Trump has insulated herself from the chaos and leaks of the White House by directing the East Wing to operate independently from the West Wing. Her staff is small — 10 people, compared with more than 25 who worked for Michelle Obama or Laura Bush — and she has struggled to put substance behind a public service project, which the role of first lady now demands. The nascent progress of Mrs. Trump’s signature policy effort, a child-focused campaign called “Be Best,” was stymied this month with the departure of her policy director after six months on the job. Mrs. Trump “is staying true to the independent woman that she is by doing things her own way,” Stephanie Grisham, her communications director, wrote in an email. “This should be celebrated, not criticized. Her priorities remain her family, her personal health and her role as first lady.” Allies describe Mrs. Trump as warm, engaging and witty, traits at odds with the totemic stance she often takes in public. Just like her husband, she often ignores guidance from aides in favor of her own instincts, and directs her staff to fight back against news media coverage she dislikes. (Ms. Grisham insisted that the White House furniture replacement was a joint husband-and-wife effort. “They both chose the décor,” she said.) But Mrs. Trump remains a Rorschach test for public perceptions of Mr. Trump’s White House: People tend to see in her what they already believe about the president. To conservative supporters of the president, she is a quietly loyal helpmate. To Mr. Trump’s critics, she is an enabler trapped in a gilded cage, occasionally breaking out to express a divergent opinion or make a high-profile gaffe before retreating again into silence. In June, the Slovenian-born Mrs. Trump, 48, was the only senior administration official to visit multiple detention facilities near the United States’ border with Mexico after thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents as part of the administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies. But any good intentions were overshadowed by her decision to wear a jacket emblazoned with the phrase “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” on an official trip to Texas. It was widely seen as inappropriate, insensitive and unbecoming of her office. Mr. Trump seized on the moment to say his wife was addressing the news media, but a person close to Mrs. Trump said the jacket was actually directed at anyone — both outside and inside the White House — who wanted to criticize her decision to visit the children in light of the administration’s aggressive immigration policies. The East Wing insisted the jacket had no underlying message. “No one tells the first lady what to do,” Ms. Grisham said. “Our office has nothing to do with what clothing choices she makes and this situation was no different.” In other matters, Mrs. Trump has made her opinions pronounced. This month her office issued a statement supporting LeBron James’s work with children — hours after the president insulted the athlete’s intellect on Twitter. “It looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation, and just as she always has, the first lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today,” Ms. Grisham said in a statement. Several friends and aides of the Trumps insist that the dynamic of the first couple’s marriage has not fundamentally changed from their days in Trump Tower. One friend of the Trumps in Palm Beach, Fla., said Mrs. Trump entered the relationship with Mr. Trump with her eyes open, and has weathered 13 years of scandal-plagued marriage and a rocky transition into the White House primarily for the benefit of keeping life stable for their son. She has faced constant questions from critics who want to know why — or how — she can remain with Mr. Trump. In January, Mrs. Trump was said to be infuriated by reports of her husband’s attempt to pay off the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, with whom he is accused of having an affair shortly after Mrs. Trump gave birth to their son. The president’s allies say he remains concerned about her reaction whenever headlines about his extramarital behaviors crop up, and he has told friends he feels guilty about the criticism she has faced. In private, a former White House official said, Mr. and Mrs. Trump give the impression that they like one another, but their rapport is not particularly warm. One person who has spent a considerable amount of time around her said Mrs. Trump was far more relaxed outside the presence of her husband than when he was around. The president does not often accede to anyone’s influence, but those close to the family say Mrs. Trump is the strongest voice in the president’s life. Several people in the president’s orbit have relied on Mrs. Trump to try to get back in Mr. Trump’s good graces when they have found themselves criticized or on the outs. “He listens to her more intently than anyone and respects her advice and counsel not only because she is his wife, but because her loyalty, grace, trust, elegance under fire, intellect and instincts are time tested and proven,” Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a friend of the president, said in an interview. The sort of Twitter fisticuffs that tend to recharge her husband’s batteries exhaust Mrs. Trump, who has political views different from her husband’s on some issues, one friend of the family said, and has at times been frustrated by his inability to compromise. But, unlike other people close to the president, she is not afraid to share her unvarnished thoughts with him. “He’s ‘Donald’ to her,” Mr. Barrack said. At the White House, Mrs. Trump tends to stay in the residence, where she has worked with the kitchen staff to arrange more-healthful meals for her husband — though he still prefers two scoops of ice cream for dessert. She does regular Pilates workouts and consults with the White House Historical Association on residence renovations and upkeep. She maintains a separate bedroom from her husband, and when the two travel, they stay in separate hotel suites. Outside of the White House, Mrs. Trump stays in touch through emoji-laden text messages with friends in New York, including Suzanne Ircha Johnson, whose husband, Woody Johnson, owns the New York Jets; Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a friend with deep ties to New York’s philanthropic and fashion worlds and briefly an unpaid White House adviser to Mrs. Trump; Karen LeFrak, the wife of the real estate developer Richard LeFrak; and Mrs. Trump’s older sister, Ines Knauss, who lives a few blocks from Trump Tower. “She is a woman of grit, never afraid to speak her mind,” Mrs. LeFrak wrote in an email. “As a friend, I’ve seen how she handles her role as first lady with the same finesse and care as she uses in her friendships — always quality over quantity.” Very few people are privy to the inner details of her life. Her aides regularly deny a widespread belief that Mrs. Trump lives outside the White House with her parents, near Barron’s school in Maryland. A White House official said her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, split their time among an apartment in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and the suite in the White House once used by Mrs. Obama’s mother. The Knavs recently became American citizens after Mrs. Trump sponsored them for green cards — the kind of “chain migration” that Mr. Trump has repeatedly and publicly denounced. At first, Mrs. Trump relied on Ms. Wolkoff to help her assume her new role. Aside from overseeing inauguration events, Ms. Wolkoff assisted the first lady in setting up the East Wing, which included making key hires, writing speeches and developing a child-focused platform with a serious mission. But in February, Ms. Wolkoff left the East Wing, along with other unpaid advisers, as a result of an administration-wide security clearance review. While operatives say her departure had to do with reports that her event planning firm received $26 million for work on the inauguration, she has vehemently denied this, and has said that every cent her firm spent on the inauguration was accounted for. “It unfortunately brought an abrupt end to the efforts and partnerships we’d developed to improve the well-being of children, which Mrs. Trump genuinely cares about,” Ms. Wolkoff said in an interview. “The end outcome was not what I expected, but this had more to do with other factions of the White House.” In the months that followed, more ambitious ideas were whittled down to “Be Best,” a name the first lady chose, with the broad goals of encouraging good online behavior and exploring solutions to the opioid crisis. At its rollout, the program was greeted with fanfare in the White House. Attendees were given a pamphlet and cookies decorated by White House chefs. The president suggested that Mrs. Trump choose a different topic to avoid questions about how the wife of a notorious Twitter bully could lead a campaign to spotlight anti-bullying and other child wellness efforts, and he warned her that she was opening herself to such jeers, people familiar with the conversations said. She rejected his advice, and publicly said she was willing to face the criticism. Despite a tightly controlled rollout and assurance from her aides ahead of the event, one White House official said, Mrs. Trump was still upset by accusations of plagiarism surrounding the launch of the initiative, and was frustrated by the president not backing her up, in public or in private. Shortly after the rollout in May, she was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a five-day hospital stay to treat what her aides called a benign kidney condition. She did not appear in public for nearly a month, and since then has not participated in a dedicated “Be Best” event. Instead, Mrs. Trump has mentioned her program during five tightly controlled solo appearances since. The East Wing disputed any notion that “Be Best” has not been carried out as the first lady envisioned. “It is exactly what she wants it to be, and has been a success,” Ms. Grisham said. “We look forward to continued success in her mission of helping children.” The president has offered glowing reviews of his wife’s work as first lady, and brings her up frequently in public and in private. At rallies, Mr. Trump has told the crowd that she supports the work he has done as president, and that she is watching from home. “In many conversations, the president frequently references Melania, sharing her opinions with me on people and things,” said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump’s. “She’s smart and has good intuition. He knows that.” While the Trumps vacationed in Bedminster, N.J., last week, Mrs. Trump appeared by his side at a dinner the president hosted with supporters, including Mr. Ruddy: “I just want to thank the president for doing an incredible job,” she said to her husband, “and for all of your help.” Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2018,"Melania Trump’s Parents Become U.S. Citizens, Using ‘Chain Migration’ Trump Hates","President Trump has repeatedly and vehemently denounced what he calls “chain migration,” in which adult American citizens can obtain residency for their relatives. On Thursday, his Slovenian in-laws, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, became United States citizens in a private ceremony in Manhattan by taking advantage of that same family-based immigration program. Asked if the Knavses had obtained citizenship through “chain migration,” their lawyer, Michael Wildes, said, “I suppose.” He said chain migration is a “dirtier” way of characterizing what he called “a bedrock of our immigration process when it comes to family reunification.” Melania Trump had sponsored her parents for their green cards, Mr. Wildes said in describing the process by which the Knavses had become United States citizens. “Once they had the green card, they then applied for citizenship when they were eligible,” he said. Even as his in-laws were going through the process, Mr. Trump was denouncing it. In November, he tweeted, “CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!” Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, said that because the Knavses are not part of the administration, “I’m not commenting on them.” Ms. Grisham directed further questions concerning the president’s views on immigration — and the immigration status of his in-laws — to the West Wing, which did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. The Knavses have a relatively high profile for presidential in-laws. They frequently travel with the Trumps and split their time between New York, Palm Beach and Washington, where they stay in the White House. Since initial reports emerged in February that the Knavses had obtained permanent residency in the United States, there has been a lack of clarity about when or how the couple received green cards. And unless the couple themselves divulge the timeline of their citizenship process, the applications and petitions are protected by privacy law. Under immigration statutes, the Knavses would have needed to have their green cards for at least five years in order to apply for citizenship, along with fulfilling character, residency and civic knowledge requirements. The time to process an application for naturalization in New York City typically ranges from 11 to 21 months, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Their lawyer said that the couple had met the five-year requirement, but added, “I can’t give further comment.” News of the ceremony prompted an immediate response on Twitter. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and political commentator, tweeted, “I guess when it’s Melania’s Family, it’s ‘family reunification’ and should be applauded. Everybody else, it’s ‘chain migration’ and must be stopped.” But Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports tighter controls on immigration, said in an interview that the Knavses were following the law. “It’s the current system,” he said. “The question is what is the policy, and if a different policy is better, I’m all for it, but it doesn’t mean people working within the current policy are doing anything morally wrong.” The president often rails against family-based immigration at his rallies, and has called it a pathway for terrorists to enter the country. He frequently reminds his audiences of the October terror attack in New York, where Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, plowed a pickup truck down a bike lane, killing eight people near the World Trade Center. While the president never names Mr. Saipov, who obtained his green card through the equally maligned diversity lottery, which grants visas to people from countries that have had fewer immigrants, he has been known to detail the attack. “He said, ‘Hey look, there’s people, nice people, they’re relaxing, some are jogging,’” Mr. Trump said during a rally last week in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., lamenting the lives lost and those who were injured. “He decides to kill them.” “They lost arms. They lost limbs. They lost so much. They lost their life. But they lost so much,” Mr. Trump added. “So, we have to change this and we’re going to change it.” Typically, naturalization ceremonies at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building at 26 Federal Plaza are large events, where groups of immigrants are sworn in as citizens en masse, after reciting an oath and the Pledge of Allegiance. The Knavses’ lawyer said their ceremony was kept private for “security reasons.” Thomas Cioppa, New York district director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, presided over the 20-minute ceremony, Mr. Wildes said. As is customary, the couple held their hands over their hearts and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, he said. The Knavses, both in their 70s, raised Mrs. Trump in Sevnica, a Slovenian town of around 4,500 people. There, Mr. Knavs was a traveling car salesman and belonged to the Communist Party. Mrs. Knavs had harvested onions on her family’s farm, then worked in a textile factory, and sewed her two daughters’ clothes. Mrs. Trump was born in 1970 and during her childhood Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia, was ruled by Josip Broz Tito, a Communist dictator who nonetheless allowed more freedoms than other Eastern bloc leaders. When Mrs. Trump began her modeling career, while still a teenager, the whole family sensed opportunity, according to those who knew them in Slovenia. According to news reports, she entered the country in 2001 on a so-called Einstein visa for “individuals of extraordinary ability” as a model. She became a United States citizen in 2006. Mrs. Trump was not present for the ceremony, and her parents told their lawyer she was in Bedminster, N.J., where the president spends time in the summer at Trump National Golf Club. The Federal Building also houses immigration court and the local offices of the Department of Homeland Security, and its subsidiary, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It is not infrequently the site of protests, but on Thursday, things were quiet as the first lady’s parents came and went. Curious about the cameras, bystanders wandered over. William White, a 74-year-old actor, said, with his eyebrows raised, “I’m happy for them.” He went on: “It seems like we now have two immigration systems. One for the people who have no power, and one for the people who we are letting in through the V.I.P. entrance. We saw an example of that today.”",The New York Times
2018,Melania Trump’s Parents Ignite Debate Over ‘Chain Migration’,"Readers debate who deserves to get a family visa to immigrate to the U.S., citing as examples their own families’ stories and the stories of families they know. The naturalization of Melania Trump’s parents last week in a private ceremony in Manhattan led many of our readers to question President Trump’s opposition to family-based immigration. In recent months, Mr. Trump has derided the program that his in-laws, Amalija and Viktor Knavs, used to become United States citizens. Calling it “chain migration,” he has argued that it must be restricted in favor of more merit-based immigration. A few readers talked about relatives and friends who they feel have abused family visas as proof that the program should be curtailed. But others offered themselves and their families as examples of Americans who, they argue, are just as deserving as the Knavses, if not more, of family-based immigration. Here is a condensed and lightly edited selection of the comments. Tell us in the comments how you see the issue. My husband and I are U.S.-born citizens. Our legally adopted kids from an African country were granted green cards but must wait over a year and a half to receive their certificate of citizenship, thanks to the Trump administration’s slowdown on processing forms. They cannot take money out of their personal bank accounts, cannot apply for drivers’ licenses nor apply for college because their green cards expired while we wait. I am an American citizen who is married to a lovely Japanese woman and citizen of Japan. We have two kids, both of whom are also American citizens. We are in our fourth year of dealing with the bureaucracy of the U.S. immigration department, having to obtain countless documents, translations from Japanese to English and now having to find the inoculation records of my 48-year-old wife. Who, besides children, have their measles mumps and rubella records? I guess the parents of “Einstein visas” have all that information and are able to slide through quite nicely in a private ceremony. Congratulations to them. I wish I knew the “right” people. I am an Indian who immigrated to the United States 30 years ago. I became a citizen 18 years ago under an employer sponsorship. I worked my way up from a student visa to a temporary work visa to an H-1 to a green card and finally to a U.S. passport. I have not sponsored a single relative for citizenship. However, I am an exception. I have a friend from India who immigrated here at exactly the same time as I did. He was the beneficiary of chain migration. His uncle, 15 years before him, had come to the United States and established a base here. He then sponsored all his siblings. They in turn sponsored their children and spouses, their children and spouses then sponsored their spouses and siblings, respectively, and so on. Today, this friend has a very large extended family of individuals who would not have been in the United States had it not been for his uncle who started the chain migration in the 70s. The above is an example of a regular, educated, middle class family, with no particular reason to leave India other than the fact that it was “conveniently available” and also with no special value add to American society. Look at what one of my cousins did with his family. After waiting for several years, three of his brothers and their families, totaling 10 people, came to America on a green card. None of them speak good English. None of them has any skills. Immediately after coming, they applied for Medicaid. Though they are trying to find a job, it is difficult to find one. If they don’t find any job, they may be eligible to apply for all kinds of benefits. Americans will be spending thousands of dollars to feed them, to house them, to provide medical care, to educate their children, etc. While that is the case, there are many educated and skilled people who can’t come to America under the current system. What Trump proposes is good for America. Bring immediate family members and create a merit based system with a limitation of overall immigration. After passing that system, if Trump brings any of his distant relatives, you have a right to criticize him. I am a U.S. citizen living abroad on contract. My wife had a green card for more than 30 years, taught thousands of children, paid taxes and cost the government exactly zero. She was put under so much browbeating and stress by the I.N.S. (taken to private room for questioning etc.) every time we returned to the United States that she surrendered her green card for a quiet life. We’re not coming back. I am somewhat conservative in many of my views. My wife is an immigrant and when I hear Trump going on and on about “chain” migration it really bothers me. I could understand if he is talking about keeping terrorists from entering the country, but my wife’s nieces and nephews who have tech degrees would be great to have here in America. She would really like to have her mom come to live with us here also. Obviously her 70-year-old mom does not have any degree, and I cringe when he talks about chain migration because I feel like he is talking directly to our family. If my wife wants her mom here and we sign papers that we will support her, there should be no problem. Just a note, when my wife came here I had to sign papers that said she would not take any public aid, no food stamps or welfare, or I would have to pay it back, and that if she ran away or disappeared I would have to pay all fees associated with deportation, etc. My husband is an American citizen. He sponsored his parents for a green card, so they could come and live with his sister’s busy family, help with the grandchild, and not be alone in their country where things are bad and their friends and family are mostly dead. My husband’s father recently died in the United States. One of his big fears had been that he would die in the old country, and no one would be coming to his grave. Thankfully, his grave is in the United States, and his wife, children and the grandchild visit often, as Papa hoped. Trump wants to prevent people like my father-in-law from enjoying his last days with his closest family; this change would have crushed my father-in-law’s soul. And now, my husband’s mother has her green card, but may never be able to get citizenship, and may never feel secure in her status, until her dying day. No one in this family broke any laws. Every adult in the family has at least one PhD. My husband was initially on the Einstein visa — because he is an internationally respected physics professor. Why should he not be able to provide for his parents what the Einstein Melania did for hers?

2018,"Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz, Feminist, Activist and Author, Dies at 72","Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz’s devotion to social activism began when she was 17. It was 1963, and with the civil rights movement gathering strength she became involved with the Harlem Education Project, an effort to educate young people on black history and give them access to cultural institutions and workplaces where they could get advice from professionals. “It was my first experience with mobilizing a proud community and with the possibilities of collective action,” she wrote in “The Tribe of Dina” (1989), an anthology of Jewish women’s writings that she edited with Irena Klepfisz. “I was hooked.” It was a passion that would endure. Ms. Kaye-Kantrowitz, who died of Parkinson’s disease at her home in Elmhurst, Queens, on July 10 at 72, “was living and breathing the dynamic movements of her time,” said her longtime partner, the activist and organizer Leslie Cagan, who confirmed the death. Ms. Cagan said that Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz — she formed her surname by combining her Anglicized name at birth with her family’s earlier name, which she reclaimed as an adult — helped shape new ways of thinking about Jewish identity as well as the intersections of race, class and gender, “before folks used the term intersectionality.” One of her contributions to discussions of Jewish identity was her theory of what she called radical diasporism — what Ms. Cagan characterized as “a counter to Zionism and the belief that Israel is the one and true homeland of all Jews.” The idea behind radical diasporism, Ms. Cagan said, is that Jews can honor their Jewish identity, history and culture without believing that Israel is their homeland. “Instead,” she said, “they take the fullness of their Jewish traditions and values and put them into practice wherever they are, wherever they call home.” As Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz explained in “The Colors of Jews: Racial Politics and Radical Diasporism” (2007): “What do I mean by home? Not the nation state; not religious worship; not the deepest grief of a people marked by hatred. I mean a commitment to what is and is not mine; to the strangeness of others, to my strangeness to others; to common threads twisted with surprise.” Among Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz’s several other books were “My Jewish Face and Other Stories” (1990), a collection of short stories, and “The Issue Is Power: Essays on Women, Jews, Violence, and Resistance” (1995). In the early 1990s, Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz became the first director of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, an organization that defines its mission as “to fight for systemic change and a just world.” She later served on its board. Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz, who came out as a lesbian in the early 1970s, went on to edit and publish the lesbian literary and art journal Sinister Wisdom in the 1980s. (It is still being published.) “I believe that once she knew this about herself, she was not hesitant to be open about her sexual identity,” Ms. Cagan said. She was born Melanie Kaye in Brooklyn on Sept. 9, 1945, into a family with roots in Poland and Russia. Her parents, Milton and Violette Kaye, “were supportive in a broad way of the struggles for peace and justice of their time,” Ms. Cagan said. Melanie’s father and his sister together owned a small women’s clothing store, where her mother also worked. Her father had changed the family name from Kantrowitz to Kaye before she was born. But even though Kaye was a made-up name, Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz once wrote, it did have history: It spoke of her family’s effort to assimilate as Jews, and that history informed her decision to keep it. She earned a bachelor’s degree from City College of New York and a Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of California, Berkeley. She went on to teach the university’s first women’s studies class. She also taught urban studies, race theory, public policy, Jewish studies and gender and queer studies at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and at Goddard College and Norwich University in Vermont, among other schools. In addition to Ms. Cagan, her partner of 21 years, Ms. Kaye/Kantrowitz is survived by a sister, Roni Natov, and a nephew. “Melanie believed in the core goodness of people,” Ms. Cagan said. “She also deeply believed in the power of art, the power of the written word and the power of collective action.”",The New York Times
2018,Melting Ice Uncovers 1946 Wreckage of U.S. Plane in Swiss Glacier,"LONDON — After an emergency landing on a Swiss glacier, the group of 12 Americans drank melted snow and survived on rations of one chocolate bar a person until daring pilots shuttled them to safety after five days marooned on the ice. Relics of that harrowing adventure and the successful rescue of all those onboard, including an 11-year-old girl and the captain’s mother, resurfaced after more than 70 years this month when scorching summer temperatures in Europe caused the glacial ice to recede. [Read a 1946 article about the accident and rescue mission, published in The New York Times.] The melting uncovered a large part of the wreckage of the United States Army transport plane, including a wing and items from the cabin, like canned food and clothes hangers. Parts of the C-53 aircraft, also known as a Dakota, had already been discovered over the past 20 years. But the heat waves washing over much of the Continent this year, which many have linked to climate change, have permitted the retrieval of many more artifacts that recount the death-defying story of the 1946 flight. The plane had been heading to Marseille, in the south of France, from Munich, carrying American officers and family members. The pilot, Capt. Ralph H. Tate Jr., found himself navigating among snowy peaks in turbulent weather and was forced to make a risky landing on the glacier to avoid crashing. “It was a case of hitting the rocky peaks or coming down on the snow,” the captain’s father, Brig. Gen. Ralph Tate, explained after the rescue. One passenger, a sergeant, broke his knee in the crash, but the others had relatively minor injuries. Snow covered the plane and formed a kind of igloo that helped them survive, Swiss rescuers said, adding that the plane had “miraculously missed a crevice 250 feet wide and 50 feet deep.” The passengers used wooden parts of the aircraft’s structure and mixed gasoline and oil to light a fire. The rescue operation was extensive. About 150 American troops stationed in Italy arrived in the village of Meiringen, at the foot of the glacier, to climb the mountain in search of survivors. But it was two Swiss pilots who became the mission’s heroes, flying German-made reconnaissance planes fitted with skis to land on the ice and pick up the stranded Americans. The planes could carry only two of the stranded passengers at a time, however, so numerous gut-wrenching trips were needed to transport everyone to safety. The 11-year-old onboard, Mary Alice McMahon, smiled as she got out of the rescue plane, chewing a piece of gum. The operation — the first time the Swiss Air Force used planes to carry out a mountain rescue — became a milestone in Swiss aviation history. “Past and present combined to write one of the happiest chapters in the history of aviation disaster,” The Times wrote in an editorial at the time, finding in the rescue proof that “painfully though steadily we are winning our age-old struggle with the elements.” The survival of everyone onboard after the plane careened into a glacier at 170 miles an hour continues to amaze experts. “It was the most improbable story in the history of international aviation, for a passenger aircraft cruising at a speed of 280 kilometers per hour, to hit the ground with everyone on board unhurt,” Peter Brotschi, a Swiss aviation expert, told the state broadcaster SRF after the recent discovery. The glacier’s inexorable slide has moved the plane debris about two miles. Despite the new finds, Adriano Boschetti, an archaeologist for the Bern region, which includes the crash site, said most of the aircraft was still under the ice, at an elevation of 11,000 feet. Mr. Boschetti said the Swiss Air Force would work to retrieve the fragments, “after which we will choose the ones we will show to the public.” The heat waves in Europe have exposed more than just what lies beneath Swiss glaciers. Ghostly echoes of the past emerged in the form of crop marks in Britain and Ireland, for example. With the help of drones, experts have discovered lines in yellowing fields revealing Neolithic settlements, a Roman villa, and long-gone stately homes, among other remnants. The sweltering temperatures have also contributed to wildfires as far north as the Arctic Circle in Sweden. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the organization that operated the crashed plane. It was a division of the United States Army, not the Air Force, which was established in 1947.",The New York Times

2018,Memorable Moments From Aretha Franklin’s Funeral,"Thousands of people packed a Detroit church on Friday to pay respects to Aretha Franklin, the musical giant whose legacy was evident in several hours of tributes in song. Here are some memorable moments. The 25-year-old pop princess Ariana Grande created a stir on Friday when she appeared early in the program at Aretha Franklin’s funeral. Wearing a black dress that caused some eyebrow raises on Twitter, she performed a reserved version of the diva’s classic “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” saving her vocal firepower for the chorus. She received enthusiastic accompaniment from the house band at Greater Grace Temple. But as she began to leave the stage, Ms. Grande was called back by the Bishop Charles H. Ellis III, who thanked her and confessed that he was less than familiar with her work. “When I saw Ariana Grande at the program, I thought that was a new something at Taco Bell,” he joked. As they stood next to each other, the pastor’s arm around Ms. Grande’s waist, his hand remained pressed into the right side of her chest for more than 30 seconds. Viewers noticed Ms. Grande’s uncomfortable expression as she leaned away. Soon, the hashtag #RespectAriana was trending on Twitter. On Friday night, Bishop Ellis apologized, telling The Associated Press that he might have been “too friendly” with the singer. He also said he regretted if anyone took offense when he compared Ms. Grande’s name to a Taco Bell menu item. [In a hometown send-off, Aretha Franklin belongs to everyone, our critic writes.] The church set up a huge screen to livestream the proceedings for fans in a gas station parking lot up the street from the service. They jeered loudly when Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican, took the pulpit, still angry over his role in the Flint water crisis. But the mood turned jovial again when Ms. Grande followed with her rendition of “Natural Woman.” The entire parking lot joined Ms. Grande in the chorus. Greg Mathis, the retired Michigan district court judge turned daytime television star gave one of the most memorable eulogies of the day, saying that his last conversation with Ms. Franklin had been on the subject of the water crisis in Flint. He recalled that after Ms. Franklin had shared her concerns about the governor’s office halting the distribution of water in the city, he had confessed to her that he had been mocked the last time he spoke out about the water crisis. People had told him: “‘That’s not your fight. Stay on television,’” he said. Ms. Franklin, he said, had little patience for his concerns. “What, you’re scared?” he remembered her saying. “You’re supposed to be from Detroit! What you scared of?” The conversation continued, he said, with Ms. Franklin sharing the last piece of advice that she would ever give him, quoting the wisdom that animated her most popular song. He told her that he would again return to fight for the people of Flint. And “she said: ‘Yeah Greg. You go back up there, and you sock it to ‘em!’” Judge Mathis said. “So in honor of my sister, I’m going to Flint and I’m going to sock it to ’em, sock it to ’em, sock it to ’em.” [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Cicely Tyson’s millinery alone enchanted viewers on Friday. The actress wore a sweeping, swooping, enormous black hat that caused cries of “mom,” “grandma” and “auntie” to echo through social media. But her eulogy prompted more adoration as Ms. Tyson profoundly thanked Ms. Franklin’s family for the gift they had given the world in the form of the Queen of Soul. She then performed the Paul Laurence Dunbar poem “When Malindy Sings,” replacing the name “Malindy” with “Aretha.” Ms. Tyson even burst into song during the stanza in which the poem discusses the religious power of a great singer’s voice, drawing whoops and applause from the audience. And as she wound down, she sang again and appeared to shed a tear as she ended the poem with a verbal crescendo, channeling all the vocal power she could summon in memory of the departed singer. The former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama sent statements to be read, but Bill Clinton appeared in person to declare that he and Hillary Clinton were lifelong fans. “We started out not as a president, a first lady, a senator, a secretary of state. We started out as Aretha groupies or something.” Then he paid tribute to her well-known love of fashion. “I want to say, and I hope God will forgive me, I was so glad when I got here and the casket was still open, because I said: ‘I wonder what my friend’s got on today. I want to see what the girl is carrying out.” The Rev. Al Sharpton was the first to get political from the pulpit early in the proceedings. He took a direct shot at President Trump, whose tweet upon news of Ms. Franklin’s death upset some by noting that the singer “worked for me” at his casinos. Sharpton’s rebuke: “No, she used to perform for you. She worked for us.” The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson spoke at length about his own Parkinson’s diagnosis and revealed intimate details about Ms. Franklin’s own physical descent. But he also noted that Mrs. Clinton, who sat on the dais, lost the state of Michigan by about 10,000 votes, which could have been overcome had more African-Americans been registered and voted. “There was long lines at the museum for Rosa Parks,” he said, “long lines for Aretha, long lines today. We have long lines to celebrate death and short lines for voting.” Tyler Perry recalled how his father viewed Ms. Franklin’s music as a good indicator of his mother’s moods. She was always playing Ms. Franklin’s records in the house, he said. “If he came home and she was playing ‘Respect’ or ‘Think,’ he knew he’d been doing something wrong. If she was playing ‘Dr. Feelgood,’ he was doing something right.” Part of the beauty of “Amazing Grace” is it’s a song that belongs to no one. But Ms. Franklin performed a definitive, nearly 11-minute version that was captured on her 1972 live album “Amazing Grace.” And one of the next generation’s strongest voices infused it with all the heart and soul she could muster at the Queen of Soul’s funeral: Jennifer Hudson, the onetime “American Idol” and “Dreamgirls” star who is set to portray Ms. Franklin in the biopic “Aretha: From These Roots.” As Ms. Hudson threw her whole body into the performance, wailing on the high notes and willing herself to reach new heights, the crowd stood mesmerized, touched by her raw, spiritual performance. Just after 6:20 p.m., hours after he was originally scheduled to perform, Stevie Wonder arrived onstage, grabbed hold of a microphone, and started to breathe through his harmonica for “The Lord’s Prayer.” When he sat down behind his keyboard to give a speech, he spoke of love: “Please remember the greatest gift that we’ve been given in life itself is love,” he said. “We can talk about all the things that are wrong, and there are many, but the only thing that can deliver us is love. So what needs to happen today, not only in this nation, but throughout the world, is that we need to make love great again. Because black lives do matter. Because all lives do matter.” Then he turned to musical matters, saying that he’d never imagined Aretha Franklin would sing “Until You Come Back to Me (That’s What I’m Gonna Do)” when he wrote it as a 15-year-old. “But she did. And better than I could have ever,” he said. He said that he had been speaking with Ms. Franklin about doing another song together: “But you know what,” he added, “I look forward to that time, if I’m so blessed, to be with her again.” Then he began playing “As” from his landmark 1976 album “Songs in the Key of Life,” and the band slid in behind him. The crowd stirred to its feet, the choir swelled and singers including Jennifer Lewis came to his side to sing the backing vocals. Mr. Wonder was restrained, keeping the spotlight on Ms. Franklin instead of his own performance. “God bless Aretha” he said as her coffin gleamed in the lights before him. “God bless you. Amen.”",The New York Times
2018,"Memphis Milano Returns, and Takes Over Fashion ","Browsing The case for the loud colors and clashing patterns of the 1980s. Memphis Milano, the Italian-born design movement of the 1980s, was the antithesis of minimalism. It was an orgy of loud colors, clashing patterns and big shapes, with little to tie it together. It’s an aesthetic that’s as confusing as it is unabashed, and perhaps that’s why it’s striking such a chord in these confusing times. The design world has been playing with the trend for a few years, but fashion is starting to get behind it, too. Nordstrom has dedicated a portion of its Seattle store to a pop-up that will celebrate (and sell) some of the movement’s signature pieces, starting Aug. 17 and running through October. You can also shop for some of the items online at Nordstrom.com, or pick up some of the snazzy items below. Minimalist in shape, maximalist in color — the best of both worlds.

2018,Mendocino Fire Reaches Record Size in California,"For the latest updates on the Mendocino Complex Fire, read this story. A fire that has been growing for nearly two weeks in Northern California, becoming the largest in modern state history, continued to rage overnight, as firefighters battled to keep the edges from eating into residential areas, officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire, which is burning northwest of Sacramento, reached more than 290,600 acres as of Tuesday morning, said Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. It overtook last year’s 282,000-acre Thomas Fire on Monday to become the most sizable California fire in a century of record-keeping. Benjamin Nicholls, a division chief of Cal Fire, said on Tuesday morning that crews were battling the expanding blaze along the northern edges of the fire, where it extends into mostly forested areas. He said crews were working on hot spots to make sure the fire does not creep into residential areas in the south. “The increase of acreage is into the forest,” he said in an interview. “The fire is holding on the south side.” Lynne Tolmachoff, a spokeswoman for the agency, said on Monday that the state was in only the middle of its fire season, noting that the worst fires often occur later in the year, as the land becomes increasingly dry and weather patterns create windy conditions. “We’ve got a long road ahead,” she said. [Sign up for the California Today newsletter, delivered weekday mornings] Larry Dietz, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said there were about 500 people in six Red Cross shelters and in one other shelter that is not affiliated with the agency. Residents are given bedding, kits with toiletries and meals. “It is kind of smoky here,” he said, speaking by telephone from Middletown, which has a population of about 1,300 people. ‘We have a very high proportion of people that are in the shelter requiring significant medical care, such as mobility issues and use of oxygen tanks. It is my understanding that they had to evacuate a skilled nursing facility.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday, Cal Fire said in its latest update. It has destroyed 143 structures as of Tuesday: 75 residences and 68 other types of structures. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. By contrast, the Carr Fire, which is also burning in Northern California, has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,600 buildings. It is the 12th largest in California history, at about 164,000 acres. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.",The New York Times
2018,Merkel and Putin Sound Pragmatic Notes After Years of Tension,"BERLIN — The personal relationship between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is often boiled down to certain anecdotes: her put-downs about his role in the K.G.B., his attempts to rattle her by bringing his large black Labrador to a meeting, knowing her fear of dogs. But the two countries’ long history of alienation and rapprochement was also at play when Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin met for three and a half hours on Saturday at the German government’s villa in Meseberg, outside Berlin. It was their second meeting in three months. The two leaders concluded the talks without issuing statements. Before the meeting began, they told reporters that bringing stability to eastern Ukraine and Syria and addressing the future of the Iran nuclear deal were the top issues on their agenda. Analysts had viewed the meeting as a chance to put relations between Berlin and Moscow on more pragmatic ground after years of increasing tensions. Mr. Putin seemed to suggest the same in his comments beforehand, saying in particular that he wanted Germany’s help in rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure so refugees could return to the devastated country. For years Russia has provided military backing to help prop up President Bashar al-Assad of Syria against the rebel groups seeking his demise. Ms. Merkel also pointed to a need for greater cooperation, though she suggested Moscow had a particular burden. “Germany, but especially Russia, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, has a responsibility to find solutions,” Ms. Merkel said. “I am of the opinion that controversial issues can only be addressed in dialogue, and through dialogue.” Bilateral issues focusing on energy and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline were also up for discussion. Here’s a look at the issues that define and influence German-Russian ties and the leaders’ discussions. The two countries could be described as the ultimate international “frenemies,” with economic, cultural and intellectual ties reaching back centuries. Since the 18th century, they have cycled through a series of conflicts and reconciliations, most recently World War II and the Cold War. Throughout the Soviet era, Germany was Moscow’s most important trading partner, and many Germans view the strong, positive ties to Moscow as a key contributor to the end of the Cold War and German reunification. When the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reached out to Moscow, partly to help the departing Soviet bloc countries integrate into the European Union, not only strengthening political and economic ties, but also investing in civil society. But a break in relations that started with the Russian authorities’ repressive reaction to public protests in 2011 and 2012 worsened in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported rebels in eastern Ukraine. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin have still maintained regular contact. In May, the chancellor visited the Russian president at his summer residence in Sochi and she told reporters she saw Saturday’s meeting as a continuation of those talks. Susan Stewart, a senior associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, cautioned that the leaders’ meeting in Germany should not be viewed as a fundamental shift in German-Russian relations. Instead, it reflected hope that the two sides could compromise on Syria, energy and other key issues, while maintaining their differences over Russia’s role in the conflict in Ukraine. Both Germany and Russia have problems tied to Syria. For Ms. Merkel, the issue is domestic. Her decision to allow more than one million people — most of them refugees from the war in Syria — to apply for asylum in Germany has been met with increasing resistance from the public and from her own government. For Mr. Putin, it is not being quite able to find a solution to Syria’s civil war. Both leaders could benefit from finding a way to ensure sufficient political stability in Syria to allow Germany to begin encouraging refugees to return, while Mr. Putin is seeking support from Berlin and the European Union to help rebuild the country, said Stefan Meister of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “It is in the domestic political interest of the German government that Syrian refugees be able to return to a stable Syria,” Mr. Meister said. A common interest could bring the countries closer after a period of deteriorating relations. Russia had been surprised by Germany’s willingness to throw its full weight behind American sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the pro-Kremlin insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The move made clear to Russian leaders that the special relationship they believed they had shared with Berlin was over. Soon afterward, Germany found itself in the cross-hairs of Russian cyberattacks and a campaign in the Russian news media that caused Germany to plunge in Russian public opinion. “If you look at the image of Germany — and Merkel in particular — in Russian political discourse, you will see that it really has deteriorated tremendously,” said Sabine Fischer, head researcher on Eastern Europe at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. A survey cited on Friday by Vedomosti, a Russian business daily, reflected this trend, showing approval of Ms. Merkel among Russians plummeting to 15 percent in August 2016 from 60 percent in February 2011. Germany imports about 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, according to government statistics. That is more than any other European Union country, but less than the 60 percent to 70 percent that President Trump cited when he accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia at a NATO summit meeting last month. “That comment clearly taps into a stereotype in Washington that because of its economic ties, Germany is ‘weaker’ on Russia,” said Derek Chollet, an adviser on security and defense policy with the German Marshall Fund in Washington. On Saturday, Mr. Putin rattled off a list of statistics that speak to the strength of the two countries’ economic ties, among them a 22 percent increase in trade in 2017, to $55 billion. He also addressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was at the heart of Mr. Trump’s claim, insisting that it was needed to “meet the European economy’s growing demand for energy resources.” “I want to emphasize again that Nord Stream 2 is a solely economic project and it closes no opportunities for transit shipments via Ukrainian territory,” Mr. Putin said. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s close relationship to Mr. Putin and his decision to join the board of Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft, has bolstered that notion that Germany is beholden to Russia. But Ms. Merkel has shown a willingness to draw a line, with her decisions to support sanctions against Russia in 2015 and to join the coordinated response to the poisoning in Britain this spring. “My sense is Merkel, who in her own way makes clear that she understands the Russians and Putin as a type as well as anyone, has no illusions about Russia or Putin and their motives,” Mr. Chollet said.",The New York Times
2018,Mets Are Just What the Struggling Orioles Needed,"Orioles 6, Mets 3 BALTIMORE — Chris Davis, Adam Jones and Tim Beckham each homered to back a strong performance by starter Andrew Cashner, and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Mets, 6-3, on Tuesday night to stop a five-game skid. Baltimore won both games against the Mets at Citi Field in June and can complete a season sweep Wednesday. Cashner (4-10) retired 10 consecutive batters before Jeff McNeil singled on a ground ball that caromed off first base in the fourth inning. Cashner allowed two runs and five hits with three strikeouts and three walks over seven innings. “You can talk about a lot of things about the game, but it starts with the outing that Andrew had,” Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said. “He was solid. You could tell he was carrying good stuff in the first inning. Really attacking the bottom of the zone. I think he kind of set the tone in the first inning.” Davis broke a 2-2 tie with a towering shot in the seventh off Bobby Wahl (0-1). Renato Nunez added a run-scoring single later that inning off Paul Sewald. Beckham had a two-run homer in the ninth to make the score 6-2. The Mets pulled within three when Brandon Nimmo tripled and scored on a throwing error by reliever Miguel Castro. Mychal Givens entered and retired three straight batters to pick up his fourth save. The Orioles took a 1-0 lead off starter Jason Vargas in the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Mark Trumbo, who was given a platelet-rich plasma injection in his sore right knee Monday. Vargas allowed two runs over six innings, his longest outing of the season. He is winless in six career starts at Camden Yards. The Mets took a 2-1 lead in the fifth on R.B.I. singles by Kevin Plawecki and Amed Rosario with two outs. Jones tied the score in the sixth with a drive over the left-field fence.

2018,Mets Endure Most Lopsided Defeat in Franchise History,"Nationals 25, Mets 4 WASHINGTON — On pace to lose more than 90 games, the Mets have endured a fair amount of misery, injuries and mistakes this season. Then came Tuesday night and a new nadir. The Mets lost to the Washington Nationals, 25-4, the most lopsided loss in the team’s 57-year history. Seven Mets pitchers took the mound, and all but two coughed up runs, including the veteran infielder Jose Reyes. In all, the Mets gave up 26 hits, the second-highest total in team history. “A tough loss,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said after the game. “It’s embarrassing. We gotta do better than that.” The Mets have given up more runs in a game before. That distinction belongs to the 1985 squad, which lost by a score of 26-7 to the Philadelphia Phillies on June 11 of that year. But that team at least made up for it by finishing the season with 98 wins and would go on to be World Series winners the next year. This year’s Mets are mired in gloominess with little way out. Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline came and passed without a major trade to improve the team. Earlier in the day, John Ricco, the assistant general manager, insisted the Mets could contend for the playoffs in 2019 because of the team’s talented core of pitchers. His words did not prove true in the evening. Steven Matz, one of the starting pitchers the Mets hope to build around, surrendered seven runs and lasted only two outs in the shortest start of his career. After some uneven defense in the bottom of the first inning, first baseman Wilmer Flores also came out of the game. The Mets later announced it was because he felt dizzy and dehydrated, another unusual ailment in a season full of them. “I wasn’t even there,” Flores said. “I felt lost.” It made little difference who was on the mound or in the field. The Nationals smashed five home runs, including two by the former Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. By the third inning, the Mets trailed by a score of 13-0. The only two relief pitchers who did not allow a run were Jerry Blevins and Drew Smith, who combined to pitch two and a third innings. By the fifth inning, Callaway knew he would need to use a position player to avoid burning through everyone in the bullpen. Noah Syndergaard, who is returning from a stint on the disabled list for hand, foot and mouth disease, was slated to start on Wednesday, so the Mets wanted to keep some relief pitchers fresh just in case. In the sixth inning, Callaway asked Reyes, the struggling backup infielder, if he was willing pitch. Reyes, who had been hoping to get a chance to pitch before he retired, said yes. The last time Reyes, 35, pitched was when he was 11 or 12 years old in his native Dominican Republic. “When you get on the mound and before you throw a pitch, it’s fun,” he said. “But when you start to see people hit a homer and stuff, you get more serious. Even though I’m not a pitcher, you don’t want to see that. I want to put a zero up there. But I do the best that I can.” Juan Soto, the Nationals rookie outfielder, laughed as he stepped in the batter’s box. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a longtime opponent of Reyes, even faked charging the mound after Reyes hit him with a pitch. “That was pretty funny and surreal to hit against him,” Zimmerman said. In all, Reyes, throwing from a sidearm position, gave up six runs on five hits, including two home runs. He threw 48 pitches, a concerning number for anyone who might be asked to pitch again anytime soon. Reyes hit 87 miles per hour with his fastball and threw a curveball in the 60s. As Reyes’s pitch count ballooned, Callaway grew concerned and sent pitching coach Dave Eiland to the mound to check on Reyes, who was also worried about hurting his arm. Paul Sewald, a relief pitcher, warmed up in the bullpen as an emergency. “I’m glad that I got out of the inning and Mickey don’t need to use to another position player or pitcher,” Reyes said.",The New York Times
2018,Mets Finally Reward Jacob deGrom With a Victory,"Jacob deGrom has had precious little margin for error even while having the best earned run average in the majors. Finally, on Wednesday, he got the run support he needed. DeGrom struck out 10 over six innings, received rare significant run support and earned his first win in nearly two months as the Mets blanked the Cincinnati Reds, 8-0, at Citi Field. “Almost every game he’s pitched in, one pitch can cost him the game,” Manager Mickey Callaway said. “So I feel like all of those are stressful innings. “Jacob is so relaxed, he might not feel the stress of those, but I would have to think every time a runner gets in scoring position or every time a home run hitter gets up that he steps on the gas a tad more to make sure he doesn’t even give up one run.” Brandon Nimmo tied a team record with three doubles and drove in three runs as the Mets won for only 22nd time in their last 66 games. DeGrom (6-7) ended a seven-start winless streak, allowing four hits in a 100-pitch outing and lowering his E.R.A. from 1.85 to 1.77. He won for the first time since June 18 at Colorado, where the Mets scored 12 runs. It was his sixth double-digit strikeout game of the season and 27th of his career. His first nine strikeouts were on changeups and fastballs, and deGrom used his curveball to fan Scooter Gennett to end the sixth. “When I go out there, I don’t want anybody to score,” deGrom said. “I don’t like giving up runs whether it’s 8-0 or 0-0, and that’s how I approach this year, go out there and keep guys from getting around the bases.” DeGrom allowed one earned or fewer for the 13th time this season, tying him with Justin Verlander, Blake Snell and Chris Sale for the major league lead. He held an opponent under three runs for the 20th straight time. “He’s definitely one of the best in the game,” Gennett said. “His numbers show it.” He was 0-5 with a 2.47 E.R.A. during the winless skid, with the Mets giving deGrom a combined eight runs in those games. They scored plenty on Wednesday for deGrom, who helped himself with an R.B.I. walk in the fourth. It was the second straight outing in which he drove in a run. Austin Jackson drove in two runs with a double in the second and a single in the fifth as the Mets built a 5-0 lead. Nimmo hit an R.B.I. double in the fifth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Amed Rosario in the fourth. Nimmo also added a two-run double in the eighth and Jackson capped the scoring with a single. Rosario’s sacrifice fly came after deGrom drove in his third run of the season and 15th of his career. With runners at second and third, the Reds intentionally walked Devin Mesoraco, but starter Robert Stephenson (0-1) threw four straight pitches out of the strike zone. “I wanted to throw just whatever I could throw for a strike, and that at-bat, I wasn’t able to throw any for a strike,” Stephenson said. Stephenson made his season debut for the Reds after going 6-0 in his last seven starts for Class AAA Louisville. A former first-round pick, Stephenson allowed three runs on three hits in four innings. The Reds wound up moving left fielder Phillip Ervin to the mound to finish the eighth. Seth Lugo, Jerry Blevins, and Robert Gsellman each pitched a scoreless inning for the Mets. INSIDE PITCH Brandon Nimmo’s three doubles marked the 29th time in team history it happened and the first since Yoenis Cespedes on Aug. 3, 2015, at Miami. … Third baseman Jose Bautista scored his 1,000th run in the fourth inning, becoming the 10th active player to reach the milestone.",The New York Times
2018,Mets Set Franchise Mark With 24 Runs,"Mets 24, Phillies 4 | Phillies 9, Mets 6 PHILADELPHIA — Jose Bautista hit a grand slam and had a career-high seven runs batted in, and the Mets set a franchise record for runs while forcing the Phillies to use two position players for the final three innings of a 24-4 victory in the first game of a doubleheader Thursday. Corey Oswalt (2-2) allowed four solo homers in six innings, Amed Rosario hit a leadoff homer and had three R.B.I., and the Mets took advantage of four errors to score 11 unearned runs. The Mets’ previous record was 23 runs against the Cubs in Chicago on Aug. 16, 2017. Even reliever Jerry Blevins got his first career hit, a line-drive run-scoring single off infielder Scott Kingery. “There’s nothing better,” Blevins said. “It’s something you dream about as a kid.” The Mets have scored more than 15 runs in consecutive games for the first time in franchise history. They beat Baltimore, 16-5, on Wednesday night. Rhys Hoskins, Maikel Franco, Nick Williams and Jorge Alfaro went deep for the Phillies. Outfielder Roman Quinn gave up a homer to Michael Conforto on his second pitch, a 79-mile-per-hour fastball. Quinn got five outs, gave up seven runs and threw 42 pitches. Kingery went the final one and a third innings and allowed two runs. “In that situation, our best relievers aren’t excited about coming in, and our position players enjoy it,” Phillies Manager Gabe Kapler said. “Our strategy is to be in the best position to win the second game.” Mets right fielder Brandon Nimmo left the game after injuring his left index finger when he hit a grounder to third base with two outs and the bases loaded in the third inning. Nimmo fell to the ground as the ball rolled to Franco, who was late tagging third but threw to first, easily getting the out. X-rays on Nimmo’s finger showed no broken bones, and he said he would have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Friday. Bautista replaced him. “I just said, ‘Oh, crud,’” Nimmo said. “It hit my knuckle.” The Mets did not indicate how long he would be out. Phillies starter Ranger Suarez (1-1) gave up eight runs, four of them earned, and 11 hits in four innings. Mark Leiter Jr. allowed seven unearned runs and four hits in one inning. After Alfaro’s shot cut the score to 5-4, the Mets had a 10-run fifth. Suarez balked in a run and left the game after Bautista followed with a run-scoring single. Another run scored on Alfaro’s throwing error on Oswalt’s sacrifice, and Rosario drove one in on a fielder’s-choice grounder. Hoskins then dropped Austin Jackson’s two-out fly ball for an error, and another run scored. After Wilmer Flores’s run-scoring single, Bautista connected for his 10th homer. Bautista had a chance to hit another slam when he faced Quinn in the eighth but was walked on a 3-2 pitch over his head. He added a run-scoring double off Kingery. “We didn’t play good defense,” Kapler said. “We put pressure on our pitchers to get additional outs.” In the second game, Rhys Hoskins hit a three-run homer, and Scott Kingery had a solo shot in the Phillies’ 9-6 win. After scoring 24 runs in the opener, the Mets kept on hitting in the nightcap with three straight doubles on Zach Eflin’s first four pitches. Conforto’s two-run double made the 2-0. But then Hoskins crushed one high off the foul pole to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead in the bottom half of the first inning against Steven Matz (5-10), just activated from the disabled list. Hoskins, who went deep in both ends of the doubleheader, has 11 of his 25 homers since the All-Star break — and three in the last four games. The Phillies added three runs in the second. Kingery homered, Wilson Ramos had an R.B.I. single, and Cesar Hernandez swiped home on a double steal. Eflin (9-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in six and two-thirds innings. Seranthony Dominguez got the last two outs. The Phillies moved within a game and a half of the Atlanta Braves, who are leading the National League East.",The New York Times

2018,Michael Avenatti Urges Democrats to Reject Michelle Obama’s Advice on Trump,"CLEAR LAKE, Iowa — Michael Avenatti, fresh off his declaration that he may run for president in 2020, used his first big speech as a prospective candidate to call on the Democratic Party to reject Michelle Obama’s oft-quoted advice about President Trump and his allies: “When they go low, we go high.” Mr. Avenatti, the hard-charging lawyer who represents the pornographic film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, did not once mention the former first lady in his keynote speech Friday night at the Democratic Wing Ding, a party fund-raiser in northern Iowa. But there was no mistaking his meaning. “We must be a party that fights fire with fire,” Mr. Avenatti said to cheers from the audience, his voice rising. “When they go low, I say hit back harder.” He received a thunderous ovation at the end of his speech, notably louder than the applause for the night’s other speakers, including Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio as well as Representative John Delaney of Maryland, who is running for president. At times, his language verged on apocalyptic. The Democratic Party, he said, is “fighting for no less than the survival of our republic,” and doing so against “a man that wants to turn back the hands of time, to send us back to the Dark Ages.” In such a fight, he continued, “we must honestly ask ourselves whether those that we fight for can afford our gentleness.” It is a message in keeping with the work that has made Mr. Avenatti a boldface name: his alliance with Ms. Clifford, who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump and is suing the president’s onetime fixer, Michael D. Cohen. As Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Mr. Avenatti has adopted the president’s brash manner and some of his tactics. He has a similar instinct for using the news media to his advantage; he seems always to be on one cable news show or another. His Twitter feed is sometimes combative, sometimes coy, virtually always provocative — an example of the tack he is now urging the Democratic Party to take. There was a certain tension, however, in his speech, which mingled calls to arms with calls for Democrats to reach out compassionately to Trump voters whose support for the president may be wavering. Democrats should think of such voters “not as evildoers but as victims of a great con,” he said. “Decent people get conned all the time, and let’s face it, Trump is a very good con man.” He also devoted part of his roughly 20-minute address to political platitudes. At times, it became abundantly clear that he was trying, at least to some extent, to recast himself from pugnacious lawyer to palatable politician. He talked about “good-paying jobs” and about giving people “a real shot at a real American dream.” He talked about saving Roe v. Wade. He listed some standard items on the Democratic platform: equal pay. Women’s rights. Gay rights. He ended by declaring that the people would “make America decent again.” But it was when talking about political combat that he was most enthusiastic, and visibly most in his element. Want peace? he asked the audience. “We must be willing to do battle to achieve it.” video",The New York Times
2018,"Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels’s Lawyer, Eyes Another Gig: President","WASHINGTON — From the moment President Trump shocked much of the world by winning the White House in 2016, there has been an assumption in political circles that his victory would inspire a why-not-me caucus of imitators in 2020. But in an all-too-Trumpian twist, and perhaps demonstrating again a failure of imagination on the part of the political class, the first potential presidential candidate following in his audacious path is not another ambitious private-sector mogul. Rather, he is another brash cable news fixture who is busy on Twitter and seems intoxicated with the publicity derived from a media profile and connections to a photogenic woman. Yes, Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels’s lawyer and Mr. Trump’s tormentor, is pondering a presidential campaign. “I’m strongly considering it — it’s going to have a lot to do with who enters the race,” Mr. Avenatti said in a telephone interview Thursday night from Iowa, where he ate not one but two pork chops at the state fair. He first revealed his apparent intentions to The Des Moines Register. He will be addressing Iowa Democrats on Friday at a party dinner, known as the Wing Ding, that is a traditional proving ground for White House aspirants in the first-in-the nation caucus state. And he said he had scheduled meetings with “key officials” in Iowa and was being escorted by Matt Paul, a Democratic operative who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign there. Next, Mr. Avenatti revealed, is New Hampshire: He is headed to the first primary state “within the next month.” Like the president he has delighted in hectoring while working for Stormy Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump — Mr. Avenatti has never served in elected office. But he has ample self-confidence and a ready answer for whether this is simply a grab for more attention. “Anybody paying attention in the last six months knows the last thing I need is any additional publicity,” he said, with a trace of irritation, before trumpeting what he called his “18-year, very successful legal career.” Of course, many Americans with ego, money and time on their hands — or some portion of each — can float themselves for president. But it is a sign of the opportunity available to any Democrat willing to aggressively confront Mr. Trump that Mr. Avenatti is being invited to such venerable gatherings as the Wing Ding. After all, there is no lack of veteran Democratic officeholders with all manner of conventional qualifications who are also hoping to receive invitations to such events. (The dinner will also include a more familiar brand of dark horse candidate: House members. Representatives John Delaney of Maryland and Tim Ryan of Ohio are attending.) “We live in a different age,” Mr. Avenatti offered as an explanation for how this was even possible. “I think a lot has changed over the last eight to 12 years with the advent of social media.” But then he quickly put aside punditry and returned to his central message, and what he said was the important lesson from 2016, when Mr. Trump steamrollered a group of Republican politicians before dispatching Mrs. Clinton. “We don’t want another candidate that just has a lot of experience,” he said. “Democrats need to nominate somebody who can actually beat this guy.” He would not name any such potential candidates, of course: Why share the spotlight with anyone else? A California-based lawyer, Mr. Avenatti was quick to note that he spent his “formative years” in St. Louis, that his parents still live there and that he considers himself a Midwesterner. And he said he will return to Iowa later this month. As for the pornographic film artist who put him on the map — or screen — he said that “Stormy is 100 percent supportive” of his exploration. “She knows these are dire times,” Mr. Avenatti said.",The New York Times
2018,Michael Cohen Says He Arranged Payments to Women at Trump’s Direction,"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, a litany of crimes that revealed both his shadowy involvement in Mr. Trump’s circle and his own corrupt business dealings. He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,” implicating the president in a federal crime. “I participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election” for president in 2016, Mr. Cohen said. The plea represented a pivotal moment in the investigation into the president, and the scene in the Manhattan courtroom was striking. Mr. Cohen, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump — and loyal confidant — described in plain-spoken language how Mr. Trump worked with him to cover up a potential sex scandal that Mr. Trump feared would endanger his rising candidacy. Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to multiple counts of tax evasion and a single count of bank fraud, capping a monthslong investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors who examined his personal business dealings and his role in helping to arrange the financial deals with women connected to Mr. Trump. The plea came shortly before another blow to the president: His former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted in his financial fraud trial in Virginia. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had built a case that Mr. Manafort hid millions of dollars in foreign accounts to evade taxes and lied to banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have, for months, said privately that they considered Mr. Cohen’s case to be potentially more problematic for the president than the investigation by the special counsel. But Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said in a statement after Mr. Cohen’s plea, “There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government’s charges against Mr. Cohen.” In federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Cohen made the admission about Mr. Trump’s role in the payments to the women — an adult film actress and a former Playboy playmate — as he pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes. One of those charges stemmed from a $130,000 payment he made to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors said that Trump Organization executives were involved in reimbursing Mr. Cohen for that payment, accepting his phony invoices that listed it as a legal expense. The other charge concerned a complicated arrangement in which a tabloid bought the rights to the story about the former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, then killed it. [The scene inside the courtroom: “I had a glass of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks,” Mr. Cohen said when asked whether he had taken medication or alcohol in the last 24 hours.] Mr. Cohen’s plea was announced by Robert Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney, along with senior officials from the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service. Addressing reporters outside the courthouse, Mr. Khuzami said that Mr. Cohen had “decided that he was above the law, and for that, he is going to pay a very, very serious price.” The plea agreement does not call for Mr. Cohen to cooperate with federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Still, it does not preclude him from providing information to them later or to the special counsel, who is examining the Trump campaign’s possible involvement in Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign. The plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty. If Mr. Cohen were to substantially assist the special counsel’s investigation, Mr. Mueller could recommend a reduction in his sentence. Mr. Cohen had been the president’s longtime fixer, handling some of his most sensitive personal matters over a decade at the Trump Organization. He once said he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump. As Mr. Cohen addressed the judge, admitting to the crimes he had committed, the packed courtroom remained silent. Even when Mr. Cohen made obvious references to Mr. Trump, referring to him as “the candidate” and “a candidate for federal office,” spectators seemed to listen raptly, with no gasps or audible reactions. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion for concealing more than $4 million in personal income from 2012 to 2016 and to one count of bank fraud, for failing to disclose $14 million in debts in an application for a $500,000 home equity line of credit — the source of his payment to Ms. Clifford. He also pleaded guilty to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution during the 2016 election cycle. He will be sentenced on Dec. 12 before Judge William H. Pauley III. Though Mr. Cohen faces a maximum of 65 years in prison, the plea agreement provides for a far more lenient sentence: The government calculated the sentencing guidelines at from 51 to 63 months and the defense put them at 46 to 57 months. A final guidelines determination will be made by the Probation Department, but the ultimate sentence will be determined by Judge Pauley. Mr. Cohen’s attorney, Lanny J. Davis, said Mr. Cohen had put his family and country ahead of his loyalty to Mr. Trump. “He stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” Mr. Davis said. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?” Looming over the negotiations between prosecutors and Mr. Cohen has been the possibility of a presidential pardon. Mr. Trump reached out to Mr. Cohen by phone a few days after the F.B.I. raids, and they had dinner together a month earlier in March, at Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Cohen’s lawyer had loosely raised the issue of a pardon with an attorney for Mr. Trump several months ago, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations. By striking a deal with Mr. Cohen that includes prison time, federal authorities were aware of the risk that the president might pardon him, said another person briefed on the matter. But it is also possible that Mr. Cohen could eventually cooperate. Prosecutors charged that Mr. Cohen’s $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford was effectively a donation to Mr. Trump’s campaign, because by securing her silence it improved his electoral fortunes, and thus violated 2016 campaign finance law prohibitions against donations of more than $2,700 in a general election. Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to “causing” an illegal corporate donation to Mr. Trump through his involvement in a $150,000 payment American Media Inc. made to Ms. McDougal in late summer 2016 to buy the rights to her story, effectively securing her silence for the remainder of the campaign. Corporations are prohibited from coordinating political spending with candidates or their representatives. Mr. Cohen signed papers a month later to purchase the rights to her agreement from A.M.I., but the publisher backed out of the deal at the last minute. The prosecutors filled in several blanks in a story that has been unfolding for months about the lengths to which Mr. Cohen went during the campaign to help his boss stave off embarrassing news about alleged affairs ahead of Election Day. And the charges confirmed that what might have seemed on the surface to have been only tawdry allegations involving an adult entertainment star and a former Playboy model may actually carry legal and political implications for a sitting president. Michael D. Cohen who paid $130,000 to who negotiated payment between says he made the payments at the direction of The National Enquirer Stephanie Clifford Karen McDougal whose chief executive is to cover up an alleged affair with to cover up an alleged affair with is a longtime friend of Donald J.

Pecker Donald J. Trump is a longtime friend of By The New York Times Prosecutors left little doubt that A.M.I. Inc., owner of The National Enquirer, became a de facto campaign proxy for Mr. Cohen in his efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump. According to court papers, the publisher agreed in August 2015, months before the first primaries, to look out for damaging stories about Mr. Trump and his alleged affairs with women during talks with Mr. Cohen and “one or more” members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. The tabloid company agreed to identify those stories “so they could be purchased and their publication avoided,” the prosecutors said on Tuesday — an inverted role for a tabloid scandal sheet such as The Enquirer, which went on to savage Mr. Trump’s opponents while promoting and protecting him. That deal led to the arrangement with Ms. McDougal, which was struck in August 2016. It only came together, prosecutors said, after Mr. Cohen promised A.M.I. it would be reimbursed for the McDougal payment. But prosecutors also reported for the first time that A.M.I. was intimately involved in the arrangement with Ms. Clifford. The tabloid connected Mr. Cohen with the lawyer who had negotiated the McDougal contract, Keith Davidson. Mr. Davidson also had Ms. Clifford as a client and later hashed out the agreement for Ms. Clifford’s silence. Prosecutors said in court papers that when Mr. Cohen initially failed to finalize the deal, an editor at A.M.I. — a likely reference to Dylan Howard, the company’s chief content officer — alerted Mr. Cohen that there was a risk that Ms. Clifford would sell her story to another media company, one that would publish it. Mr. Cohen’s admission that he broke the law by paying off Ms. Clifford was a remarkable turnaround from the legal and publicity battle that he and his lawyers had waged against her. Ms. Clifford and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, have hounded Mr. Cohen since May, taunting him on social media and predicting his indictment. Mr. Cohen’s lawyers frequently fired back, accusing Mr. Avenatti of “fanning a media storm” and of “smearing” Mr. Cohen in a relentless series of televised appearances. “I predicted this a long time ago before the warrants were even executed,” Mr. Avenatti said on Tuesday. “We feel extremely vindicated.” Mr. Cohen’s plea culminates a long-running inquiry that became publicly known in April when F.B.I. agents armed with search warrants raided his office, apartment and hotel room, hauling away reams of documents, including pieces of paper salvaged from a shredder, and millions of electronic files contained on a series of cellphones, iPads and computers. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump spent the next four months working with a court-appointed special master to review the documents and data files to determine whether any of the materials were subject to attorney-client privilege and should not be made available to the government. The special master, Barbara S. Jones, who completed her review last week, issued a series of reports in recent months, finding that only a fraction of the materials were privileged and the rest could be provided to prosecutors for their investigation. On Monday, the judge overseeing the review, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan, issued an order adopting Ms. Jones’s findings and ending the review process. It was unclear on Tuesday what role the materials that Ms. Jones reviewed, which were made available to prosecutors on a rolling basis, may have had in the charges against Mr. Cohen. One collateral effect of Mr. Cohen’s plea agreement is that it may allow Mr. Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, to proceed with a deposition of Mr. Trump in a lawsuit that Ms. Clifford filed accusing the president of breaking a nondisclosure agreement concerning their affair. The lawsuit had been stayed by a judge pending the resolution of Mr. Cohen’s criminal case. Mr. Avenatti wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that he would now seek to force Mr. Trump to testify “under oath about what he knew, when he knew it and what he did about it.”",The New York Times
2018,"Michael Cohen, D.N.C., Tariffs: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A grim focus in the White House: The morning after the conviction of Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and a guilty plea by Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, President Trump monitored the headlines, sat for an interview with Fox News and discussed ways to try to seize the news cycle again. But the legal setbacks — and the possibility that both defendants might cooperate with the special counsel — have all but collapsed the president’s attempts to dismiss the criminal investigations engulfing his tenure. Even Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders acknowledge that he could be exposed to the possibility of impeachment. We know it’s a confusing story. Here’s an overview of all the moving parts. _____ 2. The Democratic National Committee said it had warded off an attempt to hack its voter database. The F.B.I. is investigating the attack, which the committee learned of this week, according to two officials. It was not immediately clear who was behind the hack. The committee was hacked in 2016 during the presidential election campaign, and the episode was later traced back to Russia. “This attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks,” said Bob Lord, chief security officer for the committee. _____ 3. Facebook said it had removed 652 fake accounts, pages and groups that were trying to sow misinformation. The activity originated in Iran and Russia, Facebook said. Unlike past influence operations on the social network, which largely targeted Americans, the fake accounts, pages and groups were this time also aimed at people in Latin America, Britain and the Middle East, the company said. _____ 4. By one measure, the bull market hit a milestone — but most Americans aren’t at the party. After 3,453 days, it ranks among the great booms in American market history. But as the stock market surged, prices for homes — the most important source and store of wealth for the American middle class — recovered much more slowly from the Great Recession and housing bust. Incomes, too, have barely budged. One economics professor put it bluntly: “This is the decade in which wealth inequality has increased the most in U.S. history.” _____ 5. For many consumers, the trade war with China will hit home this week, when the White House said it would impose a 10 percent tariff on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products. That will bring the total so far to $50 billion. From bicycles to luxury handbags, here are eight ways you might feel the pinch. As tensions ramped up, Chinese state media took a jab at President Trump in a satirical video, thanking him for helping make China stronger. _____ 6. Saudi Arabia is seeking the death penalty for Israa al-Ghomgham, a 29-year-old female activist accused of encouraging demonstrations for Shiites, Human Rights Watch said. The kingdom has one of the highest rates of capital punishment in the world. But calls to execute a woman in a case of nonviolent political crime are highly unusual. The move contradicts Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to brand himself as a reformer. _____ 7. For patients with an aggressive skin cancer that has spread to the brain, immune-activating drugs can shrink tumors and prolong survival, a new study found. Melanoma is more likely than most cancers to spread to the brain, and once it gets there, fewer than 20 percent of patients survive one year with traditional treatments, an author of the study said. But this treatment could help many more patients. In other health news, you’ve probably heard all about the benefits of vitamin D. But what most Americans don’t know? The doctor whose enthusiasm for the supplement helped propel it to fame, above, has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the vitamin D industry. _____ 8. Air pollution is shortening your life. Months, and sometimes years, are being shaved off life expectancy, according to a new study. Outdoor air pollution — fine particulate matter from sources like coal-fired power plants, truck tailpipes, wildfires and dust storms — reduces the worldwide average life expectancy at birth by one year, researchers found. The average Egyptian loses 1.9 years; the average Indian, 1.5 years; the average American, a little more than four months. Many of the sources of outdoor air pollution are linked to greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting that moving to cleaner sources of energy could deliver public health dividends. _____ 9. Hawaii is bracing for Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 storm that forecasters say could bring whipping winds, flooding and high surf. The state closed government offices, including public schools, on the Big Island and Maui, in anticipation of the storm, which has 155-m.p.h. winds. For a brief period, Hurricane Lane was a Category 5, making it only the second storm at that strength to travel within 350 miles of Hawaii in the state’s history, according to the National Weather Service. _____ 10. Finally, the Netherlands is trying out a new approach to treat patients with dementia, including simulated beach scenes and other sensory aids. The treatment harnesses the power of relaxation, childhood memories, family structure and other tools to heal, calm and nurture the residents. It’s a sharp departure from the old prescription of bed rest, medication and, in some cases, physical restraints. And it seems to be making a difference: “It’s really about all the little things that make a normal life,” said one nurse. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

2018,"Michael Cohen, Germany, Dubai: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Michael Cohen’s dramatic admission, an ex-Nazi’s deportation and two artists’ singular taxidermy creations. Here’s the latest: • President Trump’s difficult day. His former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted in court that Mr. Trump directed him to pay two women — the adult film star Stormy Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal — hush money “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Mr. Cohen, once a loyal ally to the president, pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and multiple counts of tax evasion and bank fraud. Minutes after Mr. Cohen’s extraordinary admission, a separate courtroom delivered Mr. Trump a second blow: his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of financial fraud. He faces a second trial next month on charges of obstruction of justice and failure to register as a foreign agent. Both of the dramatic cases could add momentum to the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, which has so far produced more than 100 criminal counts against 32 people. _____ • The U.S. deported a former Nazi guard to Germany. Jakiw Palij, who entered the United States in 1949, is believed to have been an armed guard at the Trawniki labor camp in occupied Poland, pictured above, where more than 6,000 Jewish men, women and children died in one day. Mr. Palij, now 95, has denied involvement in any killings. He is believed to have been the last surviving Nazi war crimes suspect on American soil. His arrival in Germany comes as the country is witnessing a disturbing trend of violence against refugees, fueled in part by content on Facebook — highlighting, again, the persistence of the social media platform’s misinformation problem. _____ • Another day, another round of potential Russia sanctions. Lawmakers from both parties are considering punishing the country further after a new report found that hackers connected to the Kremlin were targeting American research groups. Above, a Senate Banking Committee hearing at which sanctions were discussed. The report, published by Microsoft, detailed how hackers were going after think tanks that want the Trump administration to take a tougher stance toward Russia. Separately, the Trump administration slapped Russia with economic penalties — for delivering oil to North Korea. _____ • Dubai is seen as one of the more liberal places in the Middle East. But foreign women who move there soon find that only men can be recognized as the head of a household. Husbands must consent to any job offers their wives receive, and only men can open a bank account or approve a credit card. Husbands also determine whether their wives may drink alcohol. The imbalance can be emotionally unsettling, writes our Baghdad bureau chief, who is in the midst of moving to the city-state. • The Trump administration is set to hit China with more tariffs. For American consumers, that means goods from bicycles to handbags to coffee makers are likely to become more expensive. • Uber hired a new head of finance, Nelson Chai, a former executive at Merrill Lynch and CIT Group, as the company prepares for an initial public offering next year. • Slack, the workplace messaging app, said it raised $427 million in fresh funding, bringing the company’s value up to $7.1 billion. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • A powerful earthquake struck Venezuela, shaking buildings in the capital city of Caracas, pictured above. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the tremor, which had a magnitude of 7.3. [The New York Times] • Asia Argento, the Italian actress who became a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement, denied accusations that she paid a young actor who accused her of sexually assaulting him when he was 17. Ms. Argento’s denials, however, will probably do little to change the minds of Italians back home who have already been ridiculing the actress. [The New York Times] • At least 10 hikers were killed and five went missing after flash floods swept through parts of the southern Italian region of Calabria. Rescuers continue to look for survivors and victims. [The New York Times] • Nike stopped selling a face-covering balaclava on its website after a backlash over an image of a model wearing the product. Some Twitter users called it “distasteful” and accused the brand of “endorsing knife crime.” [BBC] • The police in Rome are searching for two male tourists who were filmed skinny-dipping in a fountain dedicated to fallen soldiers and the unification of Italy. [The Guardian] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • What’s the one thing you want to do most, but won’t talk about? • Using apps to track everything may not be a bad idea. • Recipe of the day: Your turn to bring snacks to the office? Make some lemon meltaways. • In the Dutch city of Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, two taxidermists are changing the art form into a more ethically focused pursuit. Instead of employing the typical kill-and-stuff method to make trophies, this studio, above, uses animals that have died of natural causes and sets them in dramatic poses. • She predicted Prince Louis’s birth week, Beyoncé’s wedding year and President Obama’s re-election, and she counts Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Lindsay Lohan as fans. Meet Susan Miller, the astrologer whose monthly horoscopes have brought entire TV filming crews to a halt for a “reading break.” • The hit romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians” depicts a picture-perfect immigration story with two central characters finding success in America. But in reality, Asian-Americans are the country’s most economically divided racial or ethnic group, with a “crazy” income gap of about $120,000 between the richest and poorest segments. Dorothy Parker, who was born on this day in 1893, once suggested her own epitaph: “Excuse my dust.” It was a classic, coolly unsentimental remark by Ms. Parker, the acerbic wit whose writing was a mainstay in Vanity Fair and The New Yorker for years. But her other post mortem plans came as a surprise to many. When she died on June 7, 1967, the bulk of her estate was left to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr., whom she had never met. Ms. Parker, a champion of humanitarian and left-wing causes, admired the civil rights leader’s work, but even Dr. King was surprised. Her will also stipulated that, if anything were to happen to Dr. King, control of her estate should pass to the N.A.A.C.P., which it did after his assassination the next year. That decision appalled some of her friends. “She must have been drunk when she did it,” her executor, Lillian Hellman, said in an interview with The Times Book Review in 1973. Ms. Parker was cremated, and her ashes were finally placed at the organization’s headquarters in Baltimore in 1988, after spending the previous 15 years in her lawyer’s filing cabinet because they were never claimed.

2018,"Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Trump: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Pivotal legal developments for President Trump’s circle. His longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, above, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and bank and tax fraud. He also made the extraordinary claim that he had paid the adult film actress Stormy Daniels “at the direction of” Donald J. Trump for the purpose of “influencing the election.” While the deal does not require cooperation with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, it does not preclude his providing information to the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller. And Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted on eight counts in his financial fraud trial. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts, and the federal judge declared a mistrial on those charges. _____ 2. Up to 1,400 premature deaths and 48,000 more asthma attacks. Those are among the startling costs identified in the White House’s own Affordable Clean Energy rule, a proposed overhaul of pollution rules for plants fired by coal. The plan would override stricter regulations from the Obama administration. Apart from the increased health risks from higher rates of microscopic airborne particulates, carbon emissions would rise, too. Opposition was immediate and vocal. “Once again, the Trump Administration has chosen the profits of polluters over public health and safety,” tweeted Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. He pledged to “resist this all-out assault on the environment.” _____ 3. The 14-year battle to deport a former Nazi guard from the U.S. came to an end after he was sent to Germany. Jakiw Palij, 95, had been living in New York for decades, after lying on his immigration papers and claiming to be a refugee. He is believed to have been the “last adjudicated Nazi criminal in the United States.” The deportation handed President Trump, who had pressed strongly for his removal, a powerful talking point against critics of his immigration policies. _____ 4. New evidence emerged that Russian hackers are targeting conservative U.S. research groups and the Senate’s own web pages, leading a key Senate panel to signal a willingness to advance new Russia sanctions. And in Germany, there’s a troubling correlation between the use of Facebook and an uptick of anti-refugee violence. A new study found that wherever per-person Facebook use rose a specific level, attacks on refugees increased by about 50 percent. Our columnists went to Germany to check out the researchers’ findings. Here’s what they found. _____ 5. Voters in Alaska and Wyoming head to the polls today. Neither state has a clearly competitive race, but here’s what to watch for this evening. And in New Hampshire, where primary voting is weeks away, Levi Sanders, right, has a message for voters: I’m not my father. Indeed, both the younger Mr. Sanders and the elder, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are keen to keep their politics separate. Senator Sanders has yet to even endorse his son, who is running for a House seat. _____ 6. Uber named a chief financial officer after a yearslong search, a crucial move before its plan to go public next year. Nelson J. Chai, 53, a former executive at Merrill Lynch and CIT Group, will assume the post next month. Uber, one of the most highly valued private companies in the world at $62 billion, could likely have one of the biggest-ever technology I.P.O.s. _____ 7. Protesters at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill toppled a Confederate statue late Monday, the day before classes began. The monument, known as Silent Sam, has been on campus for over 100 years — and has been a point of consternation for decades. Critics saw it as an enduring tribute to white supremacy, and many cheered its demise. The university and state lawmakers criticized the demonstrators’ actions. The president of the university system called the move “unacceptable, dangerous, and incomprehensible.” _____ 8. The homes were drafty. The social scene was a bore. So what drove hundreds of Gilded Age American heiresses across the Atlantic to marry into struggling British families? “The Husband Hunters” by Anne de Courcy recounts the fates and fortunes of the women who helped prop up the British aristocracy, leaving behind the savage competitiveness of New York for the English countryside, male-dominated politics — and a lot of rain. Read our review of this glittering history. _____ 9. “I had been brainwashed into believing that my existence was limited to the boundaries of another person’s approval.” Kelly Marie Tran, the star of “The Last Jedi,” deleted her Instagram posts after months of racist and sexist harassment. In an essay for The Times, she speaks out for the first time since. “I want to live in a world where children of color don’t spend their entire adolescence wishing to be white,” she writes. “And this is the world that I will continue to work toward.” _____ 10. Finally, after over a century behind bars, some of America’s most beloved animals will roam free. After a package redesign, the animals on Barnum’s Animal crackers are no longer shown in cages. It is a symbolic victory for animal rights activists — and a moment in snack history. Have a great evening. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

2018,"Michael Cohen, Trump’s Ex-Lawyer, Investigated for Bank Fraud Over $20 Million","Federal authorities investigating whether President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, committed bank and tax fraud have zeroed in on well over $20 million in loans obtained by taxi businesses that he and his family own, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators are also examining whether Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance or other laws by helping to arrange financial deals to secure the silence of women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The inquiry has entered the final stage and prosecutors are considering filing charges by the end of August, two of the people said. Any criminal charges against Mr. Cohen would deal a significant blow to the president. Mr. Cohen, 52, worked for the president’s company, the Trump Organization, for more than a decade. He was one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal and visible aides and called himself the president’s personal lawyer after Mr. Trump took office. The bank loans under scrutiny, the total of which has not been previously reported, came from two financial institutions in the New York region that have catered to the taxi industry, Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union, according to business records and people with knowledge of the matter, including a banker who reviewed the transactions. Federal investigators in New York are seeking to determine whether Mr. Cohen misrepresented the value of his assets to obtain the loans, which exceed $20 million. They are also examining how he handled the income from his taxi medallions and whether he failed to report it to the Internal Revenue Service. The two lenders were cited in the search warrants for raids that federal agents conducted this spring on Mr. Cohen’s office, home and a hotel room where he was staying, several of the people familiar with the matter have said. Sterling received a grand jury subpoena seeking records related to the loans, one of the people said. There is no indication that either bank suffered a loss as a result of the loans or that Mr. Cohen missed payments, which are ordinarily important aspects in a bank fraud case. While bank fraud without a loss is rarely charged on its own, it is sometimes charged in conjunction with other crimes, which may be what happens in Mr. Cohen’s case. [Read The Times’s investigation into how Mr. Cohen built a shadowy business empire.] At this late stage of the inquiry, it is still possible that Mr. Cohen may plead guilty rather than face an indictment. He has hinted publicly and has stated explicitly in private that he is eager to tell prosecutors what he knows in exchange for leniency. A cooperation agreement would likely include a provision that Mr. Cohen also provide information to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating possible involvement by the Trump campaign in Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. It is unclear whether the prosecutors and Mr. Cohen’s lawyers have had detailed discussions about a potential cooperation deal, but it is unlikely that the government would bring charges without having done so. But if a plea deal is not reached, either because Mr. Cohen and prosecutors cannot agree on the terms or because prosecutors determine he does not have valuable information or is not credible, the government would likely seek to bring charges well before the midterm elections. If the matter is not finalized by the end of August, prosecutors probably will wait until after the election, one of the people familiar with the inquiry said in recent weeks. That schedule would conform with the Justice Department’s informal policy of avoiding bringing politically sensitive cases that could influence voters close to an election. Mr. Cohen and his lawyers declined to comment on the investigation when contacted over the weekend and last week. Federal officials in New York and Washington also would not comment. The investigation into Mr. Cohen burst into public view on April 9, when federal authorities searched his home, office and the hotel room, a move that sent a seismic wave through Washington and rattled Mr. Trump’s inner circle. The investigation began under Mr. Mueller, who then referred the evidence to the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. That office is now leading the inquiry along with the F.B.I. and I.R.S., which have conducted an extensive review of Mr. Cohen’s personal business activities. Days after the search, Mr. Cohen went to court in an attempt to limit the evidence prosecutors could review, claiming much of what was seized was covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Trump joined the effort. During that litigation, prosecutors revealed that they had been investigating Mr. Cohen for fraud for “months” and had previously obtained a search warrant for his email accounts. Mr. Trump railed against the investigation on Twitter and complained that “attorney-client privilege is dead.” His lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, referred to the agents who carried out the searches as “storm troopers.” (The normally combative Mr. Cohen, for his part, told an interviewer that they were “were extremely professional, courteous and respectful.”) At the time, some of Mr. Trump’s advisers came to view the investigation into Mr. Cohen as more dangerous to the Trump presidency than Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. In recent decades, Mr. Cohen has had a wide range of personal business interests, in addition to his work for the Trump Organization. He was a real estate investor, had a personal injury law practice and was involved with a gambling boat in Florida. But federal investigators appear to be especially focused on his work as an investor in taxi medallions, the permits that drivers need to legally operate yellow cabs in New York City. A review of court filings, business and property records and interviews with people with knowledge of the matter has provided the clearest picture to date of the scope of that inquiry. The search warrants for the Cohen raids sought records and communications relating to the two financial institutions, Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union, as well as documents regarding the payments to women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, among other materials, several people with knowledge of the inquiry have said. The investigation into possible bank fraud has focused at least in part on a series of loans for more than $20 million that the two institutions made in December 2014, according to a review of business records and interviews with people with knowledge of the matter. Publicly filed financing statements indicate that Mr. Cohen used 32 taxi medallions as collateral for the Sterling loans. The medallions were then valued at more than $1 million each, and generated more than $1 million a year in income. The loans were made to 16 separate companies controlled by Mr. Cohen and his family, each company owning two taxi medallions, the person who reviewed the transactions said. Mr. Cohen and his wife also personally guaranteed the loans, according to the filings. The tax fraud aspect of the investigation has been focused in part on whether Mr. Cohen properly reported the income from the medallions, which was sometimes in cash, people with knowledge of the matter said. One witness who could provide evidence about the possible bank and tax fraud is Evgeny Freidman, Mr. Cohen’s longtime friend and former business associate who began cooperating with federal prosecutors this spring. Mr. Freidman, known as the Taxi King for his once vast and longtime holdings in that industry, managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his family between 2012 and 2018. In 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman, a lawyer who was disbarred earlier this year, had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. New York City regulators have barred him from continuing to manage medallions. Mr. Freidman was facing up to 25 years in prison in an unrelated state fraud case in Albany involving his taxi business. But he struck a deal with state prosecutors under which he avoided prison in return for cooperating with federal authorities investigating Mr. Cohen. Several people with knowledge of the matter have said investigators are focusing, in part, on precisely what was done with the monthly payments of the income from the taxi medallions that Mr. Freidman made to Mr. Cohen, what representations Mr. Cohen made to the banks about those payments, and whether they were reported on Mr. Cohen’s taxes. Mr. Freidman’s lawyer, Patrick J. Egan, said on Friday, “It would be against Mr. Freidman’s interest to make a public statement regarding an ongoing criminal investigation.” Andrew MacMillan, a spokesman for Sterling, declined to comment, and a spokesman for Melrose did not respond to a message seeking comment. A Long Island accountant who worked for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Freidman could also provide testimony about the payments, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, has testified before the grand jury hearing evidence against Mr. Cohen. Mr. Getzel’s lawyer, Peter J. Larkin, declined to comment. It is unclear whether prosecutors might seek to charge Mr. Cohen with conduct related to the presidential campaign or his work for Mr. Trump. Legal experts have said that the payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump could become part of a campaign finance case. Neither woman, after being paid, spoke publicly about Mr. Trump in the weeks before the election. One of Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, Lanny J. Davis, revealed a possible piece of evidence for such a case last month when he released a recording of a September 2016 conversation Mr. Cohen had with Mr. Trump. On the recording, they discussed a $150,000 deal the tabloid publisher American Media Inc. struck with one of the women, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal. The audio was not protected by attorney-client privilege, and Mr. Davis said at the time he released it to contradict a claim that Mr. Giuliani made about what Mr. Cohen had said on the recording. The company, which publishes The National Enquirer, bought the rights to her story and declined to publish it, a practice known in the tabloid industry as “catch and kill.” Prosecutors have examined whether Mr. Cohen planned the payment in conjunction with A.M.I. to protect Mr. Trump’s election prospects, and they could use the recording as part of the basis for charges that the deal represented an illegal campaign contribution or that there was a conspiracy to make an illegal contribution. Corporations are prohibited from spending money to influence campaigns in coordination with candidates. Prosecutors could also charge that a $130,000 payment to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, better known by her stage name of Stormy Daniels, was improper. Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford out of his own pocket, and although Mr. Trump reimbursed him many months later, the initial outlay could also count as an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump’s candidacy, several legal experts have said. Federal campaign finance laws prohibit individuals from donating more than $5,400 per election cycle to a federal candidate. With the release of the recording, Mr. Cohen and his attorneys seemed to be signaling a willingness to cooperate with the federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Mr. Davis, a longtime supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has said the tape was released because Mr. Cohen is “on a new path — it’s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.” Mr. Cohen, who once said that he would “take a bullet” for Mr. Trump, also hinted he might help prosecutors during an interview on “Good Morning America” in July, saying “I put family and country first.” “To be crystal clear,” he added, “my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country, have my first loyalty.”",The New York Times
2018,Michael Cohen’s Drink on Eve of Guilty Plea: Glenlivet on the Rocks,"Michael D. Cohen sat silently in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday as a judge ran through a list of questions typically asked of defendants before they plead guilty. Had he been under a doctor’s care? Had he ever been hospitalized for mental illness or addiction? No, Mr. Cohen replied each time. But when the judge asked whether he had had any medication or alcohol in the last 24 hours — “What have you taken or consumed, sir?” — Mr. Cohen responded affirmatively. “Last night at dinner, I had a glass of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks,” Mr. Cohen said, drawing laughs from the spectator gallery. It was not his usual custom to do that, he added. The exchange was the only moment of levity in an otherwise tense and somber hearing at which Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, pleaded guilty to breaking tax and campaign finance laws, and made stunning admissions about helping Mr. Trump buy the silence of two women about affairs they said they had with him. Mr. Cohen’s sunken eyes loomed as dark as his charcoal suit. After he took his seat, he moved his head side-to-side and he clasped his hands, which seemed to be trembling. He sighed deeply. He reviewed documents given to him by his lawyers, and at one point lifted a hand over his mouth. After the hearing began, Mr. Cohen responded calmly to questions from the judge, William H. Pauley III, often with a lawyer’s precision and self-assurance. Asked his age, he answered, “In four days, I’ll be 52.” The plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty. And when he was asked later whether he knew his false statements to a financial institution were untrue when he made them, he answered with legalese. “They were omitted, your honor, as opposed to being false,” Mr. Cohen said. When the judge pressed him — “Well, you knew it was false; that it falsely depicted your financial condition, didn’t you?” — Mr. Cohen acquiesced, saying, “Yes, your honor.” Throughout the hearing, Mr. Cohen maintained a look of grim resignation, pursing his lips and nodding slightly when the judge advised him of his rights. After one question, he paused and his voice almost seemed to disappear. “Do you understand,” Judge Pauley asked, “that you can change your mind right now and refuse to enter a plea of guilty?” “Yes, sir,” Mr. Cohen responded, in a voice far reduced from its normal bold tenor. When Judge Pauley also asked Mr. Cohen if he understood that he could face as many as 65 years in prison, Mr. Cohen’s voice began to crack, and he appeared to fight back tears. “Yes, sir,” Mr. Cohen said softly. Judge Pauley, appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by President Bill Clinton, was randomly assigned to Mr. Cohen’s case. He scheduled Mr. Cohen’s sentencing for Dec. 12. As the hearing ended and the courtroom began to empty, Mr. Cohen stood quietly with his lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester; Ms. Lester patted him gently on his left shoulder. They left without offering any comment, and soon Mr. Cohen was walking to a waiting black Buick on Worth Street. This scene played out before scores of reporters and camera crews enclosed behind police barricades. There was also a crowd of onlookers, some of whom wore shirts with slogans like “treason” and “Mueller Time.” Hecklers shouted “guil-ty! guil-ty!” and “lock him up!” After Robert S. Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney, made a short statement outside the courthouse, one woman shouted, “Thank you!” and some onlookers applauded.",The New York Times
2018,Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ Suit is Back,"In honor of what would have been the pop star’s 60th birthday, Hugo Boss has reinvented the classic. Madonna might not have been the only style-changing pop star to turn 60 this month. Michael Jackson would have reached that milestone on Wednesday. In honor of that birthday, Hugo Boss, the German label behind the white suit that Mr. Jackson wore on the cover of “Thriller,” the 1982 album that is one of the best-selling records of all time, is updating and reissuing the suit. At a time when fashion is having a 1980s moment and the brand/pop star collaboration is ever more celebrated — be it Selena Gomez and Coach, Elton John and Gucci, or Justin Timberlake and Stella McCartney — this is one worth remembering. Mr. Jackson, who died in 2009, is often referenced as one of the great musical trendsetters of his generation, both vocally and visually — see, for example, the current exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London, “Michael Jackson: On the Wall,” which explores his influence on the art world. But the focus, at least when it comes to his image, is generally on his most sparkly, extreme incarnations: the gem-encrusted shirts and socks, the motorcycle and military jackets embellished with gleaming hardware and ribbons. The unsettling facial changes. There’s a tendency, especially in retrospect, to get distracted by the costume-y aspect of it all. Amid all that, the white suit stands out as a beacon of calm, a nod to the heritage of Fred Astaire, and a representation of the wide-ranging layers and references of Mr. Jackson’s sartorial vocabulary. He may have given us the single glove as signifier, but he also understood the power of a well-placed pleat — especially before he began disappearing into the world of his own imagination. To that end, the new version of the suit has a narrower silhouette (that’s a good thing), but it still has two pleats on the pants and three mother-of-pearl buttons on the jacket cuffs. Only 100 are being made; each suit is numbered and will sell for $1,195. There are T-shirts for those who like their homages on a more accessible level, but given that Mr. Jackson wore his look with a black button-down, they are less on-message even if they do have the man himself on the front. Still, it is a canny move by Boss, which tends to be typecast as the workplace outfitter of choice for strait-laced white-collar professionals everywhere. On the eve of New York Fashion Week, when the brand is set to unveil a new look men’s and women’s wear show, the reissue is a reminder that it is little more adventurous than its stereotype might suggest.",The New York Times
2018,"Michael Sheehan, Prescient Counterterrorism Expert, Dies at 63","WASHINGTON — Michael A. Sheehan, a former top counterterrorism official for the State Department, the Pentagon and New York City, who sounded an early, and unheeded, warning about Osama bin Laden and the dangers of Al Qaeda before 9/11, died on Monday in Bethesda, Md. He was 63. His death, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, was confirmed by his wife, Sita Graham Vasan. He had multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, she said. Mr. Sheehan, an intensely energetic man, started a counterterrorism career of more than three decades as an Army Green Beret, leading a clandestine hostage-rescue assault team in Panama in 1979. Fluent in Spanish, he later carried out antidrug and counterinsurgency missions in El Salvador, Colombia and Honduras. A year after retiring from the Army, he was named, in 1998, the State Department’s chief of counterterrorism. Soon he was presciently raising alarms about Al Qaeda and its leader. In a secret memorandum written that year, after the bombings of two United States embassies in East Africa, Mr. Sheehan urged the Clinton administration to step up efforts to persuade Afghanistan and its neighbors to cut off financing to Mr. bin Laden and stop giving Al Qaeda sanctuary, according to an account in The New York Times. Mr. Sheehan’s memo outlined a series of actions the United States could take toward Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen to persuade them to help isolate Al Qaeda. The document called Pakistan pivotal to the strategy, urged Clinton aides to work with the countries to curb terrorist financing, and recommended that the United States go public if any of the governments failed to cooperate. Mr. Sheehan’s plan “landed with a resounding thud,” one former official told The Times. “He couldn’t get anyone interested,” the official said. Mr. Sheehan pressed on. “What’s it going to take to get them to hit Al Qaeda?” he asked colleagues in 2000. “Does Al Qaeda have to attack the Pentagon?” After 9/11, the administration of President George W. Bush ultimately took the steps outlined in the Sheehan memo, but the Bush White House, too, was accused of having earlier ignored warnings about the threat of attack by Al Qaeda. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Sheehan spent two years as an assistant secretary general of the United Nations, overseeing 16 missions and 40,000 military and police personnel in peacekeeping operations around the globe. In 2003, Raymond W. Kelly, commissioner of the New York Police Department, tapped Mr. Sheehan to run the force’s new counterterrorism bureau. In three years, he created one of the world’s elite terror-fighting units, overseeing some 220 officers and investigators. “The foundation of N.Y.P.D.’s counterterrorism program was built by Mike Sheehan,” Michael O’Neil, one of his top police deputies at the time, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Sheehan was searingly critical of America’s post-9/11 counterterrorism strategies. In “Crush the Cell: How to Defeat Terrorism Without Terrorizing Ourselves,” published in 2008, he argued that the United States was relying too heavily on bloated security bureaucracies instead of fighting terrorism primarily through the combined efforts of diplomats, commandos, spies and law enforcement. “Most of the billions spent on new bureaucracies, defense and intelligence contractors, and thousands of new Washington staff officers after 9/11 were unnecessary, in my view,” he told Harper’s Magazine in 2008. Attack Qaeda and other extremists with targeted raids fueled by specific intelligence, Mr. Sheehan wrote, but avoid the terrorist trap of overreacting to the inevitable domestic strike. “We must continue to crush their cells relentlessly for another generation, but not overreact to their occasional attacks in the interim,” he told the magazine. “Terrorists succeed when we overreact.” Colleagues recalled Mr. Sheehan’s passion — a soldier-statesman-scholar who described himself as “a door kicker” and “a swamp drainer” (of terrorists around the world). “That sometimes made him the squeaky wheel or the cranky contrarian voice,” said Nicholas Rasmussen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “But his was a voice that carried unparalleled credibility with his peers in government.” In 2011, Mr. Sheehan was named an assistant secretary of defense overseeing Special Operations forces and military drone policy worldwide. After leaving the Defense Department in 2013, he became a fellow at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and lectured and consulted. Michael Andrew Sheehan was born on Feb. 10, 1955, in Red Bank, N.J., and grew up in Hazlet, N.J., the second of seven children of John and Janet (Purcell) Sheehan. His father was a construction engineer, his mother a kindergarten teacher. He entered the Special Forces after graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1977. He received a master’s degree in 1988 from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a second master’s, in 1992, from the Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. The next year, while still on active duty with the Army, he joined the staff of his former Georgetown professor, Madeleine K. Albright, when she was United States ambassador to the United Nations; he focused largely on peacekeeping issues. (Ms. Albright was later secretary of state in the Clinton administration.) He retired from the military in 1997 as a lieutenant colonel. Mr. Sheehan’s first marriage, to Maria Eitel, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, of 18 years, whom he met on a blind date to play tennis, he is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Eitel, from his first marriage; a son, Michael V. Sheehan, from his second marriage; and his father, three brothers and two sisters. In his final weeks, friends and colleagues say, Mr. Sheehan was brimming with enthusiasm about a new e-textbook that he was writing for United States Military Academy cadets, an assessment on Afghanistan that he was writing for the State Department and a draft of a new security strategy for the 21st century. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism scholar at Georgetown University, said of Mr. Sheehan, “He was always looking for new angles and new perspectives to solve problems.”",The New York Times
2018,"Michelle Bachelet, Ex-President of Chile, Picked as Next U.N. Rights Chief","The leader of the United Nations said on Wednesday that he had picked Michelle Bachelet, a prominent women’s rights advocate and the first woman to serve as Chile’s president, to be the organization’s next top human rights official. The announcement by Secretary General António Guterres ended the uncertainty over who would replace Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and longtime diplomat who became one of the most forthright critics of abuses by governments in many countries, including the United States, during his four years as the high commissioner for human rights. Mr. al-Hussein said in December that he would not be seeking an extension of his term, which expires next month. He told colleagues that “to do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication.” Ms. Bachelet, 66, who was imprisoned and tortured during Chile’s right-wing dictatorship and years later became a pediatrician and politician, will be stepping into a particularly difficult and contentious role at the 193-member organization. Efforts to reach Ms. Bachelet in Chile were not immediately successful. The change comes as the Trump administration has taken an increasingly dim view of human rights diplomacy at the United Nations. The administration withdrew from the Human Rights Council in June, partly over the frequent criticism of Israel and other actions that the administration described as two-faced. After Mr. al-Hussein’s office criticized the White House over the practice of separating children from parents to deter undocumented immigrants, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador, angrily accused it of ignorance and hypocrisy. Ms. Haley had a measured reaction to the choice of Ms. Bachelet. “The failures of the Human Rights Council make the Secretary-General’s selection of a new High Commissioner for Human Rights all the more important,” she said in a statement. “It is incumbent on the Secretary-General’s choice, Ms. Bachelet, to avoid the failures of the past.” Human rights advocates welcomed the choice of Ms. Bachelet. “As a victim herself, she brings a unique perspective to the role on the importance of a vigorous defense of human rights,” Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “People worldwide will depend on her to be a public and forceful champion, especially where offenders are powerful.” Ms. Bachelet became involved in Chilean human rights activism practically at the onset of Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in September 1973. She was studying medicine at the University of Chile and active in the Socialist party when a military coup toppled the government of Salvador Allende. Her father, a general in the air force, was arrested and tortured by subordinates and died in prison of heart failure in March 1974. Ms. Bachelet and her mother, Ángela Jeria, were detained by Chile’s secret security agency in January 1975 and tortured for weeks. After their release, Ms. Bachelet and her mother spent years in exile. She returned to Chile in 1979, finished school and became a pediatrician and public health advocate, specializing in children traumatized by political violence. She later held positions in the government, including health minister and defense minister, and was president from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 until this year. Between her presidential terms, Ms. Bachelet was an under secretary general of the United Nations and the first executive director of U.N. Women, an organization that promotes gender equality. In conversations with journalists in recent days, Mr. al-Hussein spoke of the pressures he felt as an outspoken critic of repressive world leaders. He said Mr. Guterres had from time to time asked if he could have chosen less provocative language, but did not insist that the high commissioner change his words. “I saw it as advice from a friend,” Mr. al-Hussein said. He also maintained that as the world body’s top human rights advocate, he did not want to err on the side of silence and regret it later. “Silence does not earn you respect,” he told journalists in a news conference last week. “If I’m going to make a mistake I’d rather make a mistake speaking out.” In an interview on Friday with the New York Times editorial board, Mr. al-Hussein said it should be part of the position’s responsibilities to be outspoken regardless of who is offended. “I don’t see how you can do the job otherwise,” he said.",The New York Times

2018,Michigan Is About to Elect a Very Different Member of Congress,"DETROIT — A Palestinian-American woman in the Michigan legislature running in the mold of Bernie Sanders. The African-American president of the Detroit City Council, who is popular with unions. The white mayor of a nearby suburb, positioning himself as a pragmatist. Two black state senators from historically prominent political families. One of the most diverse Democratic congressional primaries of the year will reach a climax with voting on Tuesday. Yet it’s the competitive nature of the race that is a drastic adjustment for some residents, considering just how long political representation in this region has been almost singularly defined by one name: Conyers. Voters are choosing a successor to Representative John Conyers Jr., a legend in Detroit and one of the nation’s most powerful black leaders until he resigned in December amid allegations of sexual misconduct. His House district, the Michigan 13th, has been a base of African-American political, economic and civic power since he first won election in 1964, so much so that Mr. Conyers’s name remains one of the first things that comes up when his would-be successors go door-knocking on the campaign trail, both in Detroit and the surrounding metro area. [Update: Rashida Tlaib and Brenda Jones both won their Michigan primaries.] Besides electing a new member of Congress, many residents see Tuesday’s election as an opportunity to reshape the identity of the district, which is one of the poorest in the country and a shadow of its former self during Detroit’s heyday, in terms of population, homeownership and jobs. People speak less of choosing candidates based on traditional ideological lines, and more of selecting a new face of hope in a community that has been so defined by waves of economic and political tumult. “Something got lost in translation over that many decades,” said Will Miller, a community activist. “We love John Conyers, but our community — under his watch — turned into nothing.” Michelle Moncrief, a 59-year-old who said her Detroit home had been inundated with campaign literature, said it’s “time to let someone else get in there,” though she shuddered at the idea of a nonblack candidate winning the seat. “I’d like for the blackness to stay where it’s been for so long, but we may not get what we want,” she said. “Someone who understands.” Detroit is no longer experiencing the worst of the early 2000s economic downturn, but the region still suffers from a disproportionately high concentration of poverty. More than 16 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line, according to a recently released report from 24/7 Wall Street, and a 2016 report from the Brookings Institution in Washington said the Motor City had the highest concentrated poverty rate among America’s 25 largest metro areas. The 13th Congressional District also has unemployment rates well above the national average, which can be seen in the stark dichotomy between communities. While some areas of the congressional district are the hub of new investment, others remain blighted — and residents say that though the country at large may be experiencing times of robust economic growth, it is yet to become a reality in “The D.” “We need things done around here,” said Vernon Boswell, a 67-year-old homeowner. “We need new people who can help get this community back on track.” At a recent forum of candidates who are running to replace Mr. Conyers, several tried to lean into their social justice bona fides to win over minority voters, some of whom expect a vocal civil rights advocate to occupy the seat. On Tuesday, voters will cast ballots in not one, but two Conyers-related elections — a special election determining who will finish Mr. Conyers’s 2018 term, and a primary that will likely determine Mr. Conyers’s permanent successor. With little reliable polling on the race, no clear front-runner has emerged among the candidates on the ballot (most of the major candidates are competing in both the special election and the primary election). The result is a campaign that seems equally about politics and personality, with six major candidates all heading into the election’s homestretch feeling confident about their chances of success. [Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] The biggest fund-raiser has been Rashida Tlaib, the state lawmaker who could become the first Muslim woman successfully elected to Congress, but Brenda Jones, Detroit’s well-liked City Council president, may have the highest name recognition in the city. Also running are State Senator Coleman Young II, the only son of legendary Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, and State Senator Ian Conyers, the great-nephew of the now-resigned congressman. A former Detroit state legislator named Shanelle Jackson is also in the race, as is Bill Wild, a white mayor of a Detroit suburb called Westland, who could benefit from the fractured field. Because there’s little policy daylight among the Democrats, issues of race, gender, age and dynastic politics have all received more attention and discussion in the primary race, as candidates have attempted to use their personal identity and legislative experience to differentiate themselves from their opponents. None will have the seniority and influence of Mr. Conyers, whose signature legislative legacy includes helping found the Congressional Black Caucus and being the first lawmaker to propose the establishment of a Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday. But the candidates said their fresh faces would bring the much needed enthusiasm the 89-year-old Conyers missed. Ms. Jones, a former union president who was first elected to the Detroit City Council in 2005 and has the backing of powerful labor unions such as the United Auto Workers and Michigan’s AFL-CIO, said she aims to bring “purity” and “civility” to the office. Though politicians often make that pitch, Ms. Jones expects the message to resonate more in Detroit, considering residents have seen almost every level of government ensnared in political scandals over the past decade. ""Civility is what’s needed in D.C. and that’s what I brought to local government in the city of Detroit,” said Ms. Jones, a deeply religious woman who wears an angel pin on her back to protect her from those who metaphorically “stab her.” The younger Mr. Conyers, 29, is hoping the combination of his youthful energy — and his famous last name — can help him keep the congressional seat in the family. He was once considered a favorite to replace the family patriarch, but with uncertain momentum and a continued public feud with other members of the Conyers family, some are questioning whether he can win. During a campaign stop in Detroit’s Rosedale Park neighborhood, Mr. Conyers expressed confidence that his doubters would soon be proven wrong. Mr. Conyers, never shy of using his last name to his advantage, jogged from house to house with an exuberant energy, yelling “Conyers here!” while he passed out literature showing a picture of him, his great-uncle and President Obama and Michelle Obama. [John James, black and Republican, thinks he can crack the ‘blue wall’ in Michigan.] “If my opponents are going to claim the credit for the things that are happening here in Detroit, there’s a lot of bad that’s still happening, and you have to pay the tab on that,” Mr. Conyers said, trying to cast himself as an outsider. “I’m a new legislator, but there’s all these issues that are unsolved and are nonnegotiable to who was at the wheel.” But for a district that has one of the highest percentages of black voters in the country, it’s the race’s two nonblack candidates that have raised the most money — Ms. Tlaib, the state representative, and Mr. Wild, the Westland mayor. Mr. Wild, whose majority-white city is outside the Detroit city limits but inside the 13th District, is considered to be a strong candidate — particularly if he carries the white suburban regions and Detroit voters split their votes among four prominent African-American candidates from the city. In an interview, Mr. Wild highlighted his personal relationships with Detroit’s civic leaders, as well the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, as reasons he was suited to procure investment into the 13th District. He also brushed aside any suggestion that a white politician from outside Detroit might be unsuited to represent the district and cited the recent election of a white mayor in Detroit as proof the community is singularly focused on policy outcomes — not skin color. “People want to see results,” Mr. Wild said. “This is going to come down to the individual. This is going to be about trust in government.” For Ms. Tlaib, ethnicity is an uncertain factor. The state lawmaker is the eldest of 14 children born to Palestinian immigrants in Detroit, and she moves with a frenetic energy more common among political activists than elected officials. Ms. Tlaib became locally famous five years ago for trespassing on corporate land to test for suspected pollution, and she says interacting with voters is her “comfort zone,” where she feels most free to do what she loves — rail against “corporate PAC money” and the uselessness of dispassionate politicians. She just received the endorsement of the Detroit Free Press, the city’s largest local newspaper. “That fear and hesitation that politicians have — you don’t have that with me because I’m not worried about getting re-elected,” Ms. Tlaib said in an interview. “This isn’t some consultant. It’s real.” Ms. Tlaib said voters in the 13th District want someone that has “experienced the same challenges they’re going through now or someone that they can relate to.” In that view, she saw herself as a logical continuation of the civil rights activism that Mr. Conyers made a hallmark of his time in office. Like Mr. Conyers, who — along with his longtime friend Rosa Parks — helped bring Nelson Mandela to Detroit in 1990, Ms. Tlaib said she’s a product of the protest tradition. During one campaign stop in Inkster, a deeply impoverished Detroit suburb that saw its entire public school system dissolved in 2013, she showed children a cellphone video of her heckling President Trump during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club in 2016. Ms. Tlaib told the children that protesting “evil” was “one of the most American things anyone can do.” “I like being bad!” one boy then yelled out. “Me too,” she responded.",The New York Times
2018,Michigan and Notre Dame Bolster a Sport Built on Rivalries,"Notre Dame should never have become Notre Dame. The small Catholic university in Indiana roamed the country playing an eclectic group of opponents and recruiting from the archipelago of Catholic high schools dotting the nation. But these idiosyncratic features, along with several national titles, actually made the Fighting Irish, in the postwar years, the most popular (and polarizing) college football team in America. Notre Dame’s closest rival as a program with a recognizable and broadly appealing ethos might be its neighbor to the northeast, Michigan. The Wolverines have long been front-runners: Their stadium holds the most fans; their coach makes the loudest splash; as befitting their fight song, “The Victors,” they have won the most games in major college football history. It is fitting, then, that Notre Dame and Michigan enjoy one of college football’s more celebrated rivalries. It will be renewed in Saturday’s season opener in South Bend, Ind., following an unusual four-year hiatus, as the No. 12 Irish host the No. 14 Wolverines. Michigan leads the series, 24-17-1. Eliminate the first several games — played when Michigan’s program was far more put together than Notre Dame’s — and the record is about even. “It’s a rare rivalry where neither team seems to look up or down on the other,” said John U. Bacon, the author of several books about Michigan football. The rest of the season will retroactively decide how crucial this game proves. Many have pegged Michigan as likely to win the Big Ten. Notre Dame, one of the few independents left, has a typically difficult slate and a small margin for error. But the Notre Dame-Michigan rivalry illustrates how, in college sports, off-field contrivances — such as rivalries with a history behind them — generate excitement for the on-field product. In the N.F.L. and the N.B.A., the only sports that currently rival college football in mass appeal in the U.S., rivalries come and go depending on which teams feature the best players and duel for championships. By contrast, in college football, especially in recent years, the mainstay games with decades of legend behind them have become an increasingly essential part of the pageantry. The Iron Bowl, the annual game between the in-state rivals Auburn and Alabama, has, in the past nine seasons, featured seven Southeastern Conference champions, six national titleholders and three Heisman Trophy winners. The winner of the Clemson-Florida State game has gone on to win the Atlantic Coast Conference in each of the past seven years. Yearly contests between Stanford and Southern California, Ohio State and Michigan State, and Georgia and Florida have been pivotal in determining which teams play for conference championships and qualify for the four-team College Football Playoff. Yet even rivalry games that have had less bearing on the postseason landscape of late (such as Wisconsin-Minnesota, Texas-Oklahoma and Army-Navy) have proved indispensable features of college football, providing the kind of subtext that distinguishes it from the N.F.L. The actual game “is not the only aspect which inspires fandom and pride and creates identity and community within postmillennial college football,” Ben Phillips, a cultural sports historian, said in his master’s thesis. “Instead, team histories, nostalgia, stadiums, stadium traditions, fan activities, songs, cheers and geography all play a role.” Rivalries help insulate college teams from losing seasons. Mississippi can salvage a bad year by beating Mississippi State, keeping fans intensely interested into late November regardless of results, and lending an added incentive to purchase season tickets. It’s no surprise that several of the most-watched regular-season broadcasts last year were traditional rivalry games: the Iron Bowl, Ohio State-Michigan, Georgia-Auburn. Rivalries featuring Notre Dame — in which regular opponents include not only Michigan but Miami, Michigan State, Navy and, most of all, Southern California — nearly always carry an intangible vitality, even if they are as much a marketing device as anything else, as the producers of Saturday’s game are well aware. “The brand Notre Dame is synonymous with college football, and in our telecast we try hard to showcase what makes Notre Dame special,” Rob Hyland, a coordinating producer at NBC Sports, said. He added, “We always remember and remind our viewers of the history, the heritage, the tradition.” Interestingly, the Notre Dame-Michigan rivalry has been contested far fewer times than many might think: There have been only 42 games. By contrast, Notre Dame has played U.S.C. 89 times and Michigan has faced Ohio State 114 times. The competition owes its continued existence to the similarities, shared history and nuanced differences between the two programs. And, of course, to business considerations. It may be the only rivalry in which one team taught the other how to play football. In the late 19th century, Michigan took it upon itself to spread the rugby knockoff that prestigious Eastern schools played throughout the Midwest. The first football game west of the Alleghenies is generally considered to be Michigan’s tilt versus Racine College in 1879. (Michigan won, 1-0; the game was a little different then.) The Wolverines eventually got around to teaching the game to Notre Dame, which in turn imitated its teacher faithfully. Notre Dame’s fight song, “Victory March,” was written 10 years after “The Victors.” There are blueprints of Michigan Stadium in Notre Dame’s archives, as it was used as the model for Notre Dame Stadium, according to John Kryk, author of “Natural Enemies,” a book about the rivalry. Michigan won the first eight games in the series before the Irish took the ninth, in 1909. The 1910 game was canceled at the last minute as Michigan officials claimed several Notre Dame players were ineligible (fielding freshmen or players who had played for three years was frowned upon by some). The teams met twice during World War II before adjourning the rivalry for another 35 years. Fritz Crisler, Michigan’s longtime coach and then athletic director, disliked Notre Dame’s athletic director, Frank Leahy. He also worried that Catholic Michigan students would root against their team when playing Notre Dame. “It’s hard to imagine to our ears today,” Bacon said, “but the Catholic/non-Catholic division then was far stronger.” The teams finally met again in 1978 because Crisler’s successor as athletic director, Don Canham, was a brilliant marketer who saw the economic potential in the series. It continued nearly unabated for more than three decades. There was one more twist. In 2012, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick infamously handed his then-counterpart, Dave Brandon, an envelope in which the Irish announced they would discontinue the annual game after 2014. Bacon blamed the poor relationship between the two men for the breakdown. Two years ago, after Warde Manuel took over Michigan athletics, the universities announced a home-and-home series for this year and next, with hopes to continue it afterward. To make room on its schedules, Michigan canceled two games against Arkansas at an exit cost of $2 million. Mike Tirico, who will be calling Saturday’s game for NBC and who makes his home in Ann Arbor, Mich., is extremely aware of all the extra baggage. It is possible that no two teams have more history between them — and certainly true that no two teams are more eager to remind everyone of that history. “It’s two legendary programs that are very similar,” Tirico said in an interview last week. But when the ball is kicked, much of that will dissipate, like dew burning off the field of Notre Dame Stadium (which, heretically, switched to a FieldTurf surface a few years ago). Attention will turn to whether the Irish’s experienced defensive line can stop the run and get to Michigan’s quarterback, and in turn whether that quarterback, the Mississippi transfer Shea Patterson, can prove he deserved to win the preseason’s close and much-watched position battle. “The historical stuff is really the foundation for the week of hype,” Tirico said. “But once the game takes off, it’s 2018, and the people are on the field right now.” Michigan’s coach, Jim Harbaugh — who as the Wolverines’ starting quarterback was 2-0 against Notre Dame — seemed to be saying the same thing at a news conference this week. “Feel good about renewing the rivalry,” he said. “Feel good about being in game week. Feel good about starting the season.”",The New York Times

Here’s what you need to know: • The Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election has recently focused on conservative American think tanks that have been critical of Moscow, according to a report to be released today by Microsoft. The company said it had seized websites in recent weeks that sought to trick people into thinking they were clicking on links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute. The sites redirected to web pages to steal passwords and other data. Microsoft also found websites imitating the U.S. Senate, but it was able to catch the spoofed sites as they were set up. The goal of the hacking attempts was unclear. • Separately, today is Primary Day in Alaska and Wyoming. There are no clearly competitive races in either one, but here’s what to watch for. • The answer is to take states to court, education activists increasingly say. One lawsuit in Minnesota accuses the state of knowingly allowing towns and cities to set policies that led to segregated schools, lowering test scores and graduation rates for low-income and nonwhite children. The state’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the suit could move forward. • The case is part of a wave of lawsuits over the quality of schools in more than a half-dozen states, coming at the same time as a push in some state legislatures for more school funding. • Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, called for Mr. Clinton to be questioned in graphic detail about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, according to a memo released on Monday by the National Archives. Judge Kavanaugh spent more than three years working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated a series of scandals during Mr. Clinton’s presidency, and who worked on the report that led to the president’s impeachment. • Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings are set to begin next month. He seems certain to be questioned about the memo, and what it suggests about Robert Mueller’s current investigation of Mr. Trump. Read the memo here. • Pope Francis released a letter to the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics on Monday, after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania revealed a cover-up of widespread sexual abuse of children by hundreds of priests over 70 years. “We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis wrote. • But the pope, whose slow response to clerical sexual abuse has threatened to damage his papacy, offered no specific remedies. • Reports that Asia Argento, an actress who has been a public face of the campaign against sexual violence, made a deal with her own accuser show that #MeToo is working as it should, the movement’s founder said on Monday. Tarana Burke, who started the movement over a decade ago, said on Twitter, “I’ve said repeatedly that the #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward.” • Ms. Argento arranged to pay $380,000 to Jimmy Bennett, a young actor who said she had sexually assaulted him when he was 17.

The theft, on this day in 1911, “caused such a sensation that Parisians for the time being have forgotten the rumors of war,” The Times reported at the top of its front page. Sixty detectives were assigned to the case, and conspiracy theories abounded. “Possibly,” a police officer told The Times, “the theft was committed by a maniac.” The authorities didn’t pay enough attention to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian laborer who had created the protective glass around Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece. He was questioned twice and let go. Two years passed. Mr. Peruggia then tried to sell the painting to Giovanni Poggi, the director of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

2018,"Middle Schools Face Concentrated Poverty and Gaps in Opportunity, Report Finds","As New York City’s middle schools emerge as the focus of desegregation attempts, a report released Wednesday highlights just how much work there is to be done. About a third of the city’s roughly 600 middle schools serve overwhelmingly poor students, and more than half of the city’s low-income adolescents are clustered in just a quarter of middle schools, according to the study from the New York City Independent Budget Office. Low levels of academic achievement in schools with highly concentrated poverty have long plagued urban school districts, and decades of interventions have not produced clear solutions. Studies have shown that breaking up those clusters of poverty could help improve schools across the board. Over the last year in particular, parents, activists and city officials have pointed to segregation in middle schools as a contributor to the persistent achievement gap between white, Asian and middle class students and their poorer peers, who are often black and Hispanic. Parent groups in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and on Manhattan’s Upper West Side have proposed new middle school admissions policies in the hopes of curbing segregation before students enroll in sixth grade. Parents in Upper Manhattan and central Brooklyn are experimenting with similar plans of their own. But the report shows just how challenging it will be for the city to address middle school segregation across the school system. The Independent Budget Office studied more than 158,000 students from 279 middle schools between 2013 and 2014. It considered students low income if they live in poor parts of the city, in neighborhoods with above-average levels of violence, or in neighborhoods where adults have low levels of education and have low incomes. The researchers found significant opportunity and achievement gaps between students at schools with high levels of low-income students and those with a wealthier population. Several of the 25 middle schools identified as having the lowest numbers of poor students — schools where fewer than 17 percent of the student body come from low-income homes — send a sizable portion of their students to the city’s specialized high schools, which require a test for admission. At least 20 percent of students at five of those schools were offered admission to a specialized high school. Just over half of eighth graders at one of the schools with the fewest poor children, the Salk School of Science in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park, received an offer to a specialized school. None of the schools with the smallest populations of poor students are in the Bronx, but 22 of the 25 middle schools with student bodies that are at least 93 percent poor are there. Several of those schools are among city’s worst-performing: eight are in the city’s Renewal program for struggling schools, and two have been closed by the Department of Education for poor performance since 2014. A more integrated school system could help combat the ills of housing segregation, activists say, by offering children early opportunities to travel outside their neighborhoods and meet peers from other parts of the city. Even opponents of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposal to scrap the specialized high schools exam in favor of a system based on class rank and test scores that would admit more black and Hispanic students have called on his administration to address segregation and uneven academic performance in the middle schools. The schools chancellor Richard A. Carranza, has already approved the desegregation plan on the Upper West Side and has indicated that he will approve one for District 15, which includes Park Slope. When told of the report’s findings, Will Mantell, a department of education spokesman, said that the city was “investing in a comprehensive equity and excellence for all education agenda to provide students with high-quality instruction at every New York City school. Working towards more diverse and inclusive schools is a key part of that agenda.”",The New York Times

2018,"Migrants Walk Off Italy’s Tomato Fields, and Into Its Immigration Debate","ROME — Hundreds of migrant farmworkers walked off tomato fields in southern Italy on Wednesday to protest their working conditions after two road accidents killed 16 African laborers in 48 hours, adding a volatile new element to Italy’s wrenching debate over illegal immigration. “We are not slaves,” the workers chanted as they marched in the red caps that protect pickers from the sun, and have become a symbol of their battle against day-labor exploitation in the province of Foggia. The deaths dominated prime-time television this week and were quickly seized upon by the hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who promised to stop the exploitation by breaking up the ghettos where many migrants live. “The fight against the mafia and exploitation are priorities of mine and of the government,” Mr. Salvini said on Tuesday, as he met with representatives of the African workers. Mr. Salvini campaigned on a pledge to expel thousands of illegal immigrants, and his government has turned away boats carrying them from African shores. But union leaders and labor experts said that ending the exploitation of migrants was a complex task that defied simply solutions. The workers who were killed came from North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. They were headed back from fields that, for a few weeks in the summer, produce millions of tons of tomatoes and a bare livelihood for thousands of migrant workers. Decades ago, as farm contracts became more rigid for companies in Italy, illegal recruitment agents set themselves up to provide seasonal workers, a business that has turned increasingly exploitive in recent years, according to union leaders and investigators. Each harvest season, thousands of migrants seeking a better life and remittances to send home to their families land in Italy’s southern regions. For years, this large pool of workers allowed recruiters — often of the migrants’ same nationality — and farmers to build a lucrative business on their backs, a vicious circle that authorities have sometimes failed to break, and sometimes ignored. As the number of migrant day-laborers has increased, their already-low wages have dropped and many workers have been trapped in slavelike conditions. The problem burst into public consciousness this week after newscasts on Monday showed footage of a rickety, overturned van in Foggia surrounded by scattered tomatoes and 12 bodies covered in white sheets. The images mirrored those from this past weekend, when another truck transporting tomatoes in the same region slammed into a similarly unsafe van, killing four foreign workers and injuring others. Each of Monday’s passengers had paid 5 euros to travel in a van originally equipped with nine seats. At the time of the crash, the van was carrying 14 men. The van operated under a Bulgarian license plate, in order to save insurance money and avoid legal troubles in case of accidents. “The two accidents were not chance,” said Daniele Iacovelli, an official with Flai Cgil, a union of agricultural and food workers. “It’s a matter of statistics if you have an estimated 200 or 300 perilous vehicles roaming the streets with up to 20 people packed in them.” Migrant workers and their advocates have long called for a public transportation system during the peak harvest season so that laborers are not forced to use the middlemen’s inhumane vans. “The lack of such a system forces them to travel like animals,” Mr. Iacovelli said, adding that the union has been protesting the conditions for decades. Recruited via word of mouth and WhatsApp, the migrants often live in shantytowns with no running water or electricity. The shantytowns are inundated with mud when it rains, and offer only metal sheets as protection against the sun. “Evacuating people from the ghettos is a priority only if we offer them a proper shelter and better working conditions,” Mr. Iacovelli said of Mr. Salvini’s remarks. “Their salaries are too low to rent an apartment.” Last year, a fire killed two Malian workers at a refugee camp north of Foggia, and the authorities subsequently moved out residents. Today, the camp is home to thousands of migrants seeking a daily job. Law enforcement authorities are struggling to enforce a recent law intended to combat worker exploitation, because of the huge business interests behind the system and the number of vulnerable workers involved. More than 50,000 day-laborers live in the Foggia area during its picking seasons. Officials believe that 50 percent of farmers in Foggia Province employ seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, Africa and Italy under illegal conditions. Unofficial surveys put that number as high as 90 percent. Foreigners, especially those in the limbo of Italy’s lengthy asylum procedures, have urgent need for money and accept salaries as low as 20 euros a day, for 12-hour workdays picking tomatoes under the scorching summer sun. Even the workers with regular papers and who have been in the country for decades rarely receive the benefits and salaries required by law. “We treat them like this, but without them, we’d not eat tomatoes or zucchini in Italy anymore,” Mr. Iacovelli said.",The New York Times
2018,Miguel Andujar Lifts Yankees to Narrow Win Over White Sox,"Yankees 4, White Sox 3 | 13 innings CHICAGO — Miguel Andujar may be going through growing pains with his glove, but there is nothing wrong with his bat. Stationed at designated hitter in the two games since his costly error led to an extra-inning loss to Boston on Sunday night, Andujar delivered a two-out, run-scoring single in the 13th inning that lifted the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night. Andujar, who earlier hit a solo home run, drove in Didi Gregorius by reaching down and lining a changeup from the White Sox left-hander Luis Avilan into left-center field. Unlike their 7-0 romp over the White Sox on Monday, the Yankees had to work especially hard for a win that kept them nine games behind the Boston Red Sox in the American League East. After Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-out, two-run homer in the 10th inning to give the Yankees to a 3-1 lead, the White Sox answered back when Jose Abreu hit a two-out, two-run homer off the recently acquired Zach Britton. Britton, who had 139 saves with the Baltimore Orioles, was trying to save the game because Aroldis Chapman, the Yankees’ closer, was out of commission after throwing 39 pitches in Sunday night’s loss at Boston. Britton hit the first batter he faced, Omar Narvaez, but retired the next two batters before Abreu hit a 1-1 fastball over the center-field wall. Sonny Gray, making his first relief appearance after being removed from the starting rotation last week, pitched the final three innings, striking out Nicky Delmonico to end the game. “I knew the situation of the game — one run and the game is over,” Gray said. “But I didn’t think about that,” Gray said. Instead, he focused on going after hitters, something he had gotten away from at times. “Grip it and rip it and see what happens,” he said. “Throw everything with conviction.” The Yankees were no-hit for five innings by Reynaldo Lopez and were kept scoreless until Andujar’s solo home run leading off the seventh. But C.C. Sabathia and four relievers kept the Yankees in it, and in the 10th inning Stanton belted a full-count slider from Tyler Danish deep into the right-center field seats, just beyond the range of Adam Engel, the acrobatic center fielder who had stolen two home runs in the first two games of the series. Engel, who leapt at the wall to steal a potential three-run homer from Greg Bird on Monday, jumped even higher on Tuesday to snatch a home run away from Kyle Higashioka in the fifth inning. It not only deprived the Yankees of a run, it kept Lopez’s no-hitter intact. The right-handed Lopez did not yield a hit until Aaron Hicks hit a double that was just out of Engel’s reach in the left-center gap. Lopez eventually worked out of a first-and-third, no-out jam by getting Gregorius to pop up, Gleyber Torres to fly out — Engel made a fine running catch on the shallow pop — and Bird to strike out when he could not check his swing. In the seventh, Lopez stiffened again. After Andujar’s leadoff homer tied the score, Higashioka poked a one-out double into the right-field corner and advanced to third on pinch-hitter Brett Gardner’s deep fly to center. But Lopez retired Hicks on a grounder to second to keep the score even at 1-1. Lopez was almost matched by Sabathia, who had lasted a total of seven and two-thirds innings previous two starts. He had a far more robust outing Tuesday, striking out a season-high 12 and allowing only one run, when Narvaez walked to begin the third, advanced to third on a double by Avisail Garcia and scored on Abreu’s sacrifice fly to center.",The New York Times
2018,Miguel Andujar’s 2-Run Homer Props Up a Shaky Outing by Yankees Relievers,"Yankees 5, Rangers 3 Maybe Miguel Andujar should get the save for the Yankees’ 5-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium. On a bad day for the Yankees’ bullpen, a walk and a balk with the bases loaded in the seventh inning cost the Yankees a two-run lead. They got it back for good on Andujar’s two-out, two-run opposite-field home run in the bottom of the inning, then held on in the ninth. The game ended after closer Aroldis Chapman had allowed Texas to load the bases again. Andujar’s home run, off Rangers reliever Chris Martin, was the 17th of his rookie season. It brought home Giancarlo Stanton, who hit a solo home run in the first inning and continues to play designated hitter while healing a tight left hamstring. “It was going out when I hit it,” Andujar said. Andujar’s heroics preceded a near meltdown by the Yankees’ bullpen after five solid innings by Lance Lynn, who made his first home start for the Yankees. David Robertson pitched a clean sixth inning and then Manager Aaron Boone called upon Zach Britton, whose earned run average has jumped to 4.50 from 3.45 since being acquired from the Baltimore Orioles on July 25. Britton ruptured his right Achilles’ tendon during an off-season workout and did not make his debut this season until June 12. Britton, a tall left-hander whose trademark is resting his black leather glove under his chin before delivering the ball, appeared on his way to retiring the side in order when he induced a slow grounder from Shin-Soo Choo. Shortstop Didi Gregorius charged across the diamond and tried to field the ball with his bare hand, but it nicked against his right thumb, allowing Choo to reach first base safely. The Rangers followed with a single and two walks, cutting the Yankees’ lead to 3-2. That was when Boone pulled Britton for Dellin Betances. “All the bad outings I’ve had here are self-inflicted of me not throwing enough strikes to where guys respect it,” Britton said, “and they sit up there and they make me throw three strikes and I’m not able to do that right now. So I got to find a way to do it.” He added: “It’s about as frustrating as I’ve been throughout my career right now. I think a lot of it’s mental. The physical part’s there. I think now it’s like a mental block, getting over that and trusting my stuff.” A mental glitch by the Yankees’ bullpen allowed the Rangers to tie the score. With the bases loaded, Betances had a 1-2 count on Jurickson Profar. Looking to end the Rangers’ rally, Betances lifted his glove, looked down at Profar and then quickly glanced over to his right to see Rougned Odor dancing down the third-base line with an aggressive lead. Betances shuffled his left leg and then his right ever so slightly, drawing a balk call from the home plate umpire Ben May. “That’s just out of the corner of his eye and not reacting properly right away,” Boone said. “That’s just where you got to see it and just step off immediately and not flinch.” Betances struck out Profar and earned the win thanks to Andujar’s home run, but closing out the game was not easy. F or the second time in three days, Chapman came unhinged during the ninth inning. Showers fell sporadically throughout the afternoon, but by the time Chapman trotted out to the mound, heavy rains began to dampen the field. Chapman had a 1-2 count on pinch-hitter Isiah Kiner-Falefa, but threw his next three pitches far out of the strike zone. After Kiner-Falefa walked, Chapman reached down and grabbed a large clump of dirt to dry his hand, then struck out Choo. His control problems did not disappear completely. Chapman loaded the bases before striking out Profar for his 30th save of the season. Chapman said he felt better pitching on Saturday than he did on Thursday, when he walked two batters and did not light up the radar gun with his usual zest. Boone said he thought his closer pitched “O.K.” and took “a step in the right direction.” “It’s not going to always be easy,” Boone said, “and it’s hard for us right now, but we did a lot of good things today and found a way to win a game today when it was hard. Considering the conditions, just considering where we’re at right now, to grind one out there is nice.”",The New York Times
2018,Mike Francesa Still Believes in the Power of Radio,"Talk You’ve been doing sports talk radio for about 30 years. What’s the main difference, if you had to pinpoint one, between when you started and right now? When we started in 1989, there was no internet. There were no cellphones. There was none of that stuff, and it was a very different world. We had a lot of information that the average fan didn’t have. If you go on Twitter, it seems as if just about anyone can be a sports journalist now. Anyone can do a podcast — heck, everyone does a podcast, O.K.? Except me. I don’t want one. You left behind a TV career to do radio. What potential did you see in radio back then? What radio does more than any other medium is it allows you to really get close to your audience. When you do TV, they acknowledge you, they nod their head. But when you do radio, they feel like they know everything about you. They feel like they’re your best friend — or maybe your worst enemy, if they don’t like you. Do you have any theories about why that is? A couple. They hear every emotion that you have. They hear the days you’re really happy, the days you’re really angry, the day you might be without a care in the world. But more than that, they can take you everywhere. They’re in the car with you — on the way to work, on the way home. They can take you with them when they’re lying there ready to go to sleep, when they get up in the morning, when they go to the beach, when they’re on the couch. When I’m talking, I think of myself talking to each person. I envision people on the highway. I envision people in their cars. I envision how people are listening. I envision a lot of them, but I envision them one at a time. Now that you’ve gone solo, are there moments when you’re talking about the Yankees and you wish that there were someone there to bounce ideas off of? Absolutely. Listen, I wouldn’t be averse to breaking somebody in if I found the right person. Now, I wouldn’t make it a 50-50 partnership. Which did you like doing better? Do you like the show by yourself, or did you like doing it with the Mad Dog? “Mike and the Mad Dog” will probably be regarded forever as the No.1 sports talk show. I mean, I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t think “Mike and the Mad Dog” wasn’t a great show. I would say they’re very different shows. I would say I enjoyed doing both of them equally. Come on. You had to have more fun doing one. If you put a gun to my head, I’d probably take the solo show. You seem to be a very competitive person. Where did that come from? It’s just my nature. I want to finish first all the time, and that’s not fun, either. It’s always got you on edge, and I don’t consider it a gift sometimes. I don’t know where it came from. If you want to psychoanalyze — I’m a kid who comes from, you know, we didn’t grow up with any money. I had no father — you know, stuff like that. Maybe that’s part of it. Politics occupies a much bigger place in sports media than it did back when you started, and in a much more upfront way. How do you feel about that? The reason every story is about President Trump is because it sells. Yes, you’ll turn on Fox News and they’ll be pro-Trump, and you’ll turn on MSNBC and they’ll be anti-Trump, but the reason it’s about Trump every minute of every day is because the audience is demanding it. I think everybody in media has to realize this might just be a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, a comet across the sky, rather than something that is changed forever now. Everyone has this nightmare where they can see the point in the future where they realize that they’re washed up. What does that moment look like for you? That moment’s never happening. Washed up to me would mean that my ratings were no longer good. If my ratings started to really fail, they wouldn’t have to say, “Go.” I’d go.",The New York Times
2018,Millions of Frequent Flier Miles Are Donated to Reunite Families Separated at Border,"On the morning of Aug. 6, a law professor at the University of Michigan wrote a tweet about a family that had been separated by immigration authorities after crossing into the United States. Then the professor, Beth Wilensky, went for a run. Then she ate some lunch. “I came back and checked my Twitter feed and said, ‘Oh my goodness,’” Ms. Wilensky recalled. Her post was blowing up, on its way to getting tens of thousands of retweets. The tweet said: “My husband travels a lot. Downside: he’s gone a lot. Upside: frequent flier miles. We just used some to fly a 3-yr-old and his dad, who had been separated at the border, from Michigan (where the son had been taken) to their extended family. DM me if you have miles to donate.” A “zero tolerance” immigration policy from the Trump administration led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents or guardians this year. In June, President Trump signed an order meant to stop the separations. But hundreds of children remain in United States custody without their parents, according to the Homeland Security Department. Ms. Wilensky said she was seized by a desire to do something. She joined online communities of people who felt the same — citizens busy with day jobs and families of their own, now bound by Twitter threads, Reddit groups and Facebook pages. But faced with the daunting and sometimes inscrutable bureaucracy of immigration policy and enforcement, many people wondered how best they could help. The tweet appeared to strike a chord. Asking for direct messages turned out to be a mistake; Ms. Wilensky could not respond quickly enough to the queries that came pouring in. So later that day she posted again, encouraging people to contact Michigan Support Circle, a group in her area to which she was connected via Facebook. The group was responding to the needs of migrant families on a largely ad hoc basis. Michigan Support Circle coalesced about six weeks ago to support migrant families affected by the administration’s policy, said Rosalie Lochner, a founder of the group. “I think a lot of people across both sides of the aisle believe that families need to be protected, and that the trauma of separating these families is something that, as citizens, we are responsible for,” she said. After seeing the tweet, people from across the country reached out to the group on social media, asking how they could help. Ms. Wilensky also included a link to Miles4Migrants, a two-year-old group that uses donated frequent flier miles to transport refugees to new homes or to reunite families divided by conflict. Andy Freedman, a founder of that nonprofit, quickly noticed that something was up on Monday. There were more visitors to the website. A few more inquiries. A small spike in donations. He wondered if the extra attention was the result of some new campaign or a smart social media post. It was, it turned out, the tweet from Ms. Wilensky, a stranger in Michigan. On that Monday alone, Mr. Freedman said, his organization received pledges of over one million miles. That number has now ballooned to more than 28 million. Miles4Migrants grew out of a Reddit group dedicated to “credit churning,” a risky practice that involves systematically signing up for credit cards to win bonuses and points to cover airfare and hotel costs, and even to get cash back. It is a time-consuming and “dorky” hobby, said Seth Stanton, a founding member of Miles4Migrants, which coalesced after one member of the Reddit group, Nick Ruiz, shared a story about using his air miles to help reunite a Pakistani family. In the years since, Miles4Migrants has partnered with donors and aid organizations to reunite dozens of families on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis. The refugees and asylum seekers they helped had international itineraries: Islamabad to Manchester. Addis Ababa to Edinburgh. Tehran to London. (The founders work around day jobs. Mr. Stanton, an optometrist, sometimes arranges flights between patients.) But this week, flush with more than 28 million newly donated frequent flier miles, the organization is thinking about how to tackle the logistics of reuniting families in the United States. The group’s overall mission is not really about American politics, and that won’t change now, Mr. Freedman said. “We’re about reuniting families,” he said. “The way we do that is fairly simple. We help them with a flight.” So far, Miles4Migrants has booked two flights for migrants within the United States. Mr. Stanton said that while the logistics and the bureaucracy are daunting, they hope to do more and are looking for partner organizations, including airlines, to help them do it, as well as cash to cover the fees and taxes associated with flights. Michigan Support Circle is working with Miles4Migrants to arrange flights as needed, but it, too, is in need of more than just miles, Ms. Lochner said. The organization helps families in whatever way it can, for example by donating home goods or facilitating medical care. But Ms. Lochner said the extra attention has been encouraging. “I’m so impressed by how much people want to be involved, and how willing people are to help in whatever way they can,” she said. Ms. Wilensky still wonders why her post was so effective and why the idea of frequent flier miles donations held such appeal for thousands and thousands of strangers. “I think a lot of people out there, like my husband and I, have watched all of this unfold — this family separation policy — with a sense of absolute horror,” she said. “I think a lot of people felt like we did, which is, ‘Oh my gosh, here’s something real and concrete that might help to fix this problem, even if it’s just for one family.’”",The New York Times
2018,Minimizing the Pain of Trump’s Tax Law,"Because the tax changes are weighted against high-tax states like New York, some locals are moving to low-tax states and exploring other ways to keep their tax bills down. Longtime New Yorkers Joanne and Vince Intrieri left their 3,100-square-foot three-bedroom near the United Nations earlier this year, trading it in for a sunny three-bedroom condominium in Downtown Miami. Ms. Intrieri, who has a construction and design firm that she is moving to Miami, and Mr. Intrieri, who owns VDA Capital Management, were not ready to retire. But they decided to move to the Florida coast to escape exorbitant taxes that they knew would be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s new tax law. “My husband and I have been in New York City for more than 20 years, but we aren’t tied to an office anymore and our kids are older,” said Ms. Intrieri, 59. “Between the state and city taxes, plus about $50,000 in property taxes, it is a lot of money going out the door. Why do it?” The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as the legislation is known, was passed last year and will be applied to 2018 returns, which are due in April 2019. The law limits the deductions taxpayers can take on property taxes and state and local taxes (known as SALT deductions) up to $10,000 — a cap that many New Yorkers easily exceed. For the highest earners, New York state’s income tax rate is 8.82 percent and New York City’s rate is 3.876 percent. Nearly half of Manhattan’s taxpayers have taken SALT deductions in the past, and the average deduction has been over $60,000 a year. The new legislation also limits the deductions that taxpayers can claim on interest for mortgages up to $750,000, down from the previous $1 million limit. Mortgages often surpass this cap in Manhattan, where the average sales price for a co-op or condominium was $2.09 million in the second quarter of this year, according to Douglas Elliman. All told, more than 8 percent of New York State residents will face higher taxes for 2018, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. For those with income in the top one percent, a much larger number — 29 percent — will see their income taxes rise. The specter of higher taxes has prompted some New Yorkers, like the Intrieris, to seek relief by moving to lower-tax states, while others have deliberately sought out buildings with tax abatements to reduce their costs. Accountants say that others are exploring different ways to minimize their tax bills, like converting part of a home into a business with a home office or through Airbnb for a tax deduction. In anticipation of higher tax bills, the Intrieris and others have already relocated to states like Florida, which has no income tax and low property taxes. “I work with a lot of clients in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — so all high-tax states — and we are seeing a lot of them move south, especially to Florida,” said Robert Westley, a New York City-based certified public accountant. “With almost all of our clients it comes up, and I would say about half of them are really looking into it.” An added incentive for moving is the fact that the new legislation preserved a tax break that allows married homeowners who sell their primary residence to shield up to $500,000 of their capital gains from the property, Mr. Westley said. Shahab Karmaly, the founder of KAR Properties, a real estate development and investment firm, currently lives in Manhattan, but has been taking steps to relocate his family and business to Miami. “If I didn’t have the added complexity of kids, then I would already be down there,” said Mr. Karmaly, who has been touring schools for his children in Miami. Indeed, the Florida housing market has seen a bump since the tax law was enacted. In Naples, for example, sales of single-family homes priced at $2 million and above rose 25 percent in the second quarter of 2018, compared with the second quarter of last year, according to the Naples Area Board of Realtors. Pending sales of such homes in Naples are up 22 percent, while pending sales of similarly priced condominiums have risen 32 percent. “Causality is difficult to quantify, but taxes are certainly playing a role,” said Niklas Ahola, a real estate adviser at Compass in Naples. “I have about 10 clients, including three from New York, who are fleeing high-tax states.” At the same time, the housing market in New York has slowed this year, and real estate analysts believe that is also in part because of the tax changes. Home sales in Manhattan declined 16.6 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to Douglas Elliman. In Westchester, sales dropped 17.7 percent; in the Hamptons, they fell 12.8 percent. “People have pressed the pause button and are waiting before they buy,” said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which conducted the research. In Brooklyn, housing sales also decreased in the second quarter, but at a more modest 5.7 percent. This may be in part because home values in the borough are lower, making property taxes lower and dampening the impact of the tax law. While the new legislation largely benefits the wealthy and corporations, it hasn’t translated into a boon for high-end real estate in New York, Mr. Miller said. “When this was first announced, people said it would have no impact because they were going to get more money back on taxes,” he said. “But people don’t buy individual assets based on a basket of assets. It isn’t like people say, ‘I will pay more for my house because I got money back from taxes.’ It just doesn’t work that way.” Some prospective buyers have focused their searches on buildings with tax abatements to limit their tax costs. Buyers at 550 Vanderbilt, a new development in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, for example, benefit from a 25-year tax abatement. Owners of studios at the building pay as little as $18 a month in property taxes, compared to $563 a month without the abatement. “It was a huge factor in our decision to buy here,” said Rebecca Miller, 33, who purchased a two-bedroom at 550 Vanderbilt with her husband, Adam Tau. “We got our recent tax bill, and it worked out to be about $42 a month. It would have been closer to $1,500 a month without the abatement,” she said. Ryan Serhant, the associate broker with Nest Seekers International who is handling sales at 550 Vanderbilt, said that since the tax changes were implemented, “we have seen a massive uptick in people coming from Manhattan. Before the tax law passed, people paid attention to real estate taxes, but if it was a little more, they just wrote it off. Now you can’t do that.” While it is clear that the tax changes are already having an impact on the real estate market, it is too early to know the full extent of the repercussions, said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody’s Analytics. In New York, while there has already been a slowdown, “the adjustment will take some time, both to show up in house prices and to be fully internalized by buyers and sellers,” he said. “In fact, it may not truly happen for many until they file their tax returns next spring.” The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said that its accountants are exploring new ways to keep their clients’ tax bills down. One strategy would be to claim part of a home as a business expense. If a taxpayer has a home office, for example, or a room leased to a tenant or through Airbnb, it can be counted as a business expense and deducted, over and above the $10,000 cap on tax deductions. “The rules are a little complicated, but if you qualify, and let’s say you have a home office that takes up 15 percent of the square footage of your home, you could take 15 percent off your property taxes and deduct it,” Mr. Westley said.

2018,Minnesota Democrats Targeted in Ads Citing Allegations Against Keith Ellison,"A conservative super PAC launched an ad campaign on Monday that uses domestic abuse allegations against Representative Keith Ellison, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Minnesota, to attack other members of his party running for office in the state. The ad, titled “Ashamed,” has been tailored to target several Democrats running for the House of Representatives and chastises them for not calling on Mr. Ellison, who is also the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to drop out of the race. “Joe Radinovich is standing by Keith Ellison,” says one version of the ad, edited to focus on Mr. Radinovich, a former state representative running in Minnesota’s Eighth Congressional District. “Backing Ellison instead of believing his victim? Joe Radinovich should be ashamed.” Other versions of the ad focus on Dean Phillips, Angie Craig and Dan Feehan, all hoping to become first-time members of Congress. None of the four candidates responded to requests for comment on Monday. The ad campaign was released by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC endorsed by the House Republican leadership, and invokes the National Organization for Women, a left-leaning group that called for Mr. Ellison to exit the race after he won the Democratic primary last week. [Read more about the Congressional Leadership Fund and other super PACs here.] Mr. Ellison was accused of physical and emotional abuse earlier this month by a former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, an organizer at the Minnesota chapter of the Sierra Club. The allegation was first made public by Ms. Monahan’s son, who wrote about it on Facebook. Ms. Monahan told The Times earlier this month that she suffered “narcissist abuse” during a yearslong relationship with Mr. Ellison, including verbal abuse and being dragged off a bed. “It is the most difficult form of abuse to articulate,” Ms. Monahan, 44, wrote in an email to The Times. “It is a slow insidious form of abuse. You don’t realize it is happening until it’s too late.” Mr. Ellison did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, but he has denied Ms. Monahan’s allegations in the past. “Karen and I were in a long-term relationship which ended in 2016, and I still care deeply for her well-being,” Mr. Ellison said in a statement after the allegations became public. In an interview with CBS News last week, Ms. Monahan said Mr. Ellison met her at a coffee shop before he decided to run for attorney general to ask if she was going to make an abuse allegation against him. “The conversation went straight to, ‘Hey, I notice you’ve been tweeting a lot about abuse and the #MeToo,’ ” she said, referring to the #MeToo movement. “He goes, ‘I don’t want to look over my shoulder all the time wondering when you’re going to tweet something and say it’s me.’ ” “I look straight at him and said, I never ruined your career,” she said. “I didn’t choose to do the things you did.”",The New York Times
2018,"Miriam Nelson, 98, Golden Age Dancer and Choreographer, Dies","Miriam Nelson, whose seven-decade career as a choreographer and dancer spanned the golden ages of Broadway, Hollywood and television, died on Aug. 12 at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 98. The death was confirmed by Rusty Frank, a dance historian and longtime friend. When William Holden and Kim Novak slow-danced to “Moonglow” in the 1956 film “Picnic,” that was Ms. Nelson’s choreography. The Los Angeles Times later called the scene “one of the movie’s classic moments of sexual magnetism, the most graceful and sensual of mating dances.” Much of Ms. Nelson’s movie work was for nonmusicals. She choreographed the madcap party scene at Holly Golightly’s apartment in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” (1961), and also appeared in it as the glamorous party guest in gold brocade and pearls who argues with the man wearing a fake eye patch. Behind the camera, Ms. Nelson taught Tuesday Weld to watusi in “I’ll Take Sweden” (1965), Ingrid Bergman to do early disco moves in “Cactus Flower” (1969), Jerry Lewis to hoof it like a space alien in “A Visit to a Small Planet” (1960) and the whole cast of “Cat Ballou” (1965) — led by Jane Fonda, who she said was a balletically trained natural — to execute Old West dances for the hoedown scene. In “The Apartment” (1960), Variety called an office-party faux striptease choreographed by Ms. Nelson “sexier than many in a strip joint,” although the actress in the scene removed only her necklace. Once in a while, stars could be temperamental. Bette Davis, appearing as a woman traveling with dancers in a 1959 episode of the television series “Wagon Train,” wanted to do a slow-tempo cancan. Ms. Nelson sent word, through the producer, that such a performance would be unflattering. Ms. Davis relented. “That’s an old trick I use once in a while,” Ms. Nelson wrote in a memoir, “My Life Dancing With the Stars,” published in 2009. “If some stars think they won’t look good, they’ll listen.” During much of Ms. Nelson’s career, choreography was a primarily male profession. Even Judy Garland had never worked with a female choreographer before when the two collaborated on a TV show. “She was terribly worried about it,” Ms. Nelson recalled. “She thought I’d have her dance like some ‘damned ballerina.’ ” Things worked out fine. Miriam Lois Frankel was born in Chicago on Sept. 21, 1919, the only child of Daniel Frankel, a salesman who later produced nightclub shows, and Miriam Elizabeth (Bly) Frankel, a seamstress who went on to a show-business wardrobe department career. The Frankels separated when their daughter was 8, but they remained friendly, eventually reconciled and moved to New York when Miriam was 15. She took tap lessons from a dance instructor who lived in their apartment building. A high school dropout, Miriam was soon hired for a vaudeville act, recommended by a friend. She appeared in the New York version of Billy Rose’s Casa Mañana dinner theater, where one of her dancing partners was Van Johnson. At 19 she made her Broadway debut, in “Sing Out the News” (1938), a musical revue, with June Allyson, whose songs included “Sing Ho for Private Enterprise.” As Miriam Franklyn (sometimes Franklin), she appeared in six Broadway shows, including two Cole Porter musicals, “Panama Hattie” (1940), starring Ethel Merman, and “Let’s Face It!” (1941), with Danny Kaye. Even in those days, she recalled, she would ask the shows’ choreographers about their work. In 1941, two weeks after Pearl Harbor, she married Gene Nelson, a fellow dancer and actor. They moved to Los Angeles, and good luck followed. Having lunch at Paramount one day with a friend, she ran into a New York pal and came home with a seven-year acting-dancing contract. Ms. Nelson’s onscreen appearances included “Lady in the Dark” (1944), a straight acting role as Edward G. Robinson’s secretary in “Double Indemnity” (1944) and versatile dance work in “Duffy’s Tavern” (1945). After the Nelsons divorced in 1956, she took up choreography full time. Her television projects included “The Red Skelton Hour,” “Father Knows Best,” “The Lucy Show,” “The Love Boat” and “Murder, She Wrote.” Ms. Nelson’s first credited big-screen choreography was on Blake Edwards’s “He Laughed Last” (1956), a crime comedy about a chorus girl. Her final screen credit was “Out of the Cold,” a romantic drama starring Keith Carradine, released on DVD in 2001. She was married to Jack Meyers, a producer, from 1965 until his death in 1988. Her survivors include a son, Chris Nelson; three grandsons; and a great-granddaughter. Ms. Nelson stayed busy in all aspects of the business — doing projects for Disneyland and the Oscar telecast, coaching a pre-“Cheers” Ted Danson for Aramis commercials and even “feet-dubbing.” A 2004 Op-Ed essay in The New York Times about lip-syncing mentioned the film industry’s practice of using dancers to overdub the sounds of tapping and called Ms. Nelson “one of the best of them.” She was sometimes referred to as the Marni Nixon of tap, a reference to the soprano who dubbed many film stars’ singing voices. People often asked Ms. Nelson if she planned to retire fully. “Not as long as the phone keeps ringing,” she wrote in her memoir. She was still tap dancing, her friend Ms. Frank reported, the week before her death. An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Ms. Nelson’s performing career on Broadway and to the reason she moved to Los Angeles after World War II began. She did not appear in the 1939 revue “George White’s Scandals.” She moved because her husband, the actor Gene Nelson, had been cast in a movie — not because of his “wartime work with the Signal Corps.”",The New York Times
2018,Miss America Slams the Miss America Organization and Gretchen Carlson,"“I never expected — or wanted — to have to be a whistleblower,” Cara Mund, the winner of Miss America 2018, wrote in a letter. Cara Mund, whose reign as Miss America comes to a close next month, accused the pageant’s parent organization of systematically silencing her in a letter made public Friday. It was the latest setback for the organization, which has struggled to reinvent itself after a string of scandals. In a missive that ran over 3,000 words long, Ms. Mund said that the pageant’s leadership had “reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis.” She went on to say that members of the organization had prevented her from posting in her official capacity on social media and had criticized her appearance on multiple occasions. She added that she had researched New Jersey state laws and that the mistreatment amounted to “workplace bullying.” She said that she had been condescended to in a manner that suggested “I don’t understand this ‘big girl job’ or how and why Miss America is relevant,” and that she had often been reminded that she was dispensable. “My contract still says — and I am regularly reminded by word and action — that I can be fired anytime, with or without cause,” she wrote. In particular, Ms. Mund’s letter singled out the organization’s chief executive, Regina Hopper, for disparaging her. It also took issue with Gretchen Carlson, the chair of the organization’s board of directors, who Ms. Mund said had supplanted her as the organization’s ambassador. Ms. Carlson, who was Miss America 1989 but is most famous for her tenure at and departure from Fox News, has appeared in the news on behalf of the Miss America Organization since she took the position as its chair in January. “They told me that I’m not important enough to do big interviews, and that the major press is ‘obviously’ reserved for Gretchen,” said Ms. Mund, who represented North Dakota in the 2017 pageant. A former Miss America competitor said that the letter had circulated among the show’s past contestants, but Ms. Mund did not answer calls, texts or an email asking for more specifics. After news of the letter broke, it was posted to a Facebook page that bears Ms. Mund’s name. A request for comment made through Ms. Carlson’s lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, was not immediately returned. Ms. Mund’s letter, intentionally or not, evoked scenes from the film “Mean Girls,” with Ms. Mund being instructed not to wear pink because “Regina hates pink” and being told that she should burn certain outfits. The letter elaborated on a statement that Ms. Mund gave to the Press of Atlantic City in which she admitted that it had been a “tough year.” In that interview, Ms. Mund expressed fear of “being punished” for speaking her mind. In a statement, the Miss America Organization responded to Ms. Mund’s letter by saying that it supported her and that “it is disappointing that she chose to air her grievances publicly not privately.” “Her letter contains mischaracterizations and many unfounded accusations,” the statement said. “We are reaching out to her privately to address her concerns.” This is the latest drama for the Miss America franchise, which has attempted to rebrand itself in recent months. The organization’s leadership was compelled to resign in the winter after HuffPost published emails sent by Miss America’s chief executive, Sam Haskell, that denigrated past pageant participants. In May, the organization announced that in addition to Ms. Carlson, it had hired Ms. Hopper as its new chief executive and Marjorie Vincent-Tripp, who was named chairwoman of the Miss America Foundation’s board of trustees. All three women were former contestants in the pageant, and Ms. Vincent-Tripp, an assistant state attorney general in Florida, was Miss America 1991. “The induction of this all-female leadership team signals forthcoming transformational changes to the entire organization and program, ushering in a new era of progressiveness, inclusiveness and empowerment,” the Miss America Organization and the Miss America Foundation said in a joint news release at the time. In June, Ms. Carlson announced that the pageant’s swimsuit competition, which had been part of Miss America since its inaugural event in 1921 in Atlantic City, would come to a close. That decision caused an uproar within the organization. The following month, Ms. Vincent-Tripp, too, resigned from her position without saying what had led to the decision. Last week, 11 former Miss Americas, including Ms. Vincent-Tripp, signed a letter calling for Ms. Carlson to resign immediately. Throughout the various fireworks, Ms. Mund, a graduate of Brown University, had stayed quiet, making appearances across the country on behalf of the organization. Chatter about her interview with the Press of Atlantic City last week prompted her to elaborate on her concerns. “I never expected — or wanted — to have to be a whistleblower,” Ms. Mund said in her letter. She asked for the support of her fellow pageant veterans, saying that without their voices, “the leadership will simply continue to push out, silence, and tighten security to reduce access around Miss America.” “Miss America is fragile right now,” Ms. Mund concluded. “She needs all of us if she is going to survive.”",The New York Times
2018,"Missing Paperwork Got Him Out of Jail. Then, Police Say, He Raped and Killed.","It was a simple clerical error, a missing bit of paperwork. But it had tragic consequences. Danueal Drayton was arrested earlier this year on charges that he choked an ex-girlfriend in Nassau County. By that time, he had a left a trail of similar crimes in his home state of Connecticut. Yet when Mr. Drayton came before a county judge for a bail hearing, no one there was aware that he had a history of violence against women — not the local prosecutor, not the public defender, not the court clerks. His out-of-state criminal history was missing from his court file, even though the Nassau County police insist they hand-delivered a copy to the court. On July 5, the judge canceled Mr. Drayton’s initial bail of $2,000 and let him out of jail on his own recognizance to await trial. Just two weeks later, the police say, Mr. Drayton raped and murdered a young nurse he met on the dating app Tinder. The case highlights a weakness in New York’s system for providing courts with the criminal histories of people brought before them. Since the 1970s, a state law has required the police to distribute paper copies of defendants’ criminal histories to local district attorneys and courts, which share them with the defense. Court clerks with clearances are now able to check criminal records themselves through the state’s electronic portal. But because of the law, judges rely on the local police instead, said Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration. In Mr. Drayton’s case, state officials said his comprehensive records were sent to the police, the district attorney’s office and the court in Nassau County on July 1, four days before the judge’s bail decision, through an electronic portal called eJustice. But the judge and the prosecutor handling the case never checked the portal, court officials and the Nassau County District Attorney’s office said. New York City detectives eventually tracked Mr. Drayton to an apartment in Los Angeles, where he had fled using one of the slain nurse’s credit cards, the police said. When officers came through the door, they found Mr. Drayton holding another woman captive, who told officers he had raped her, Los Angeles authorities said. Mr. Drayton is being held in Los Angeles on rape charges and New York is seeking his extradition. Mr. Drayton’s case has ignited a debate in New York among court officials and law enforcement agencies about rap sheet procedures and what should be done to prevent future mistakes. The Nassau County police have not publicly accepted responsibility for the missing records, but after reviewing the case, the department updated its protocol to specify that criminal records from out of state must be shared with the court and district attorney. P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney and the president of the District Attorneys Association of New York, said the lapse was indicative of a larger problem with the criminal justice system relying on paper documents and analog processes. He argued that the onus should be on the courts to ensure they have the information judges need: “They should begin the practice of routinely pulling those records because it’s the courts that determine the issue of bail,” he said. Mr. Chalfen in the Office of Court Administration did not agree. He said the error in Mr. Drayton’s case was an unfortunate mistake, but it did not expose a deeper problem. “We have not found that the current method of how criminal background checks are provided to the court, at arraignment, have any systemic flaws,” he said. “New York State’s criminal procedure law is clear as to the fact that the local police agency is responsible.” He added that, with 450,000 bail hearings a year, it would be impractical to shift that responsibility to courts in the state’s smaller towns and villages, where judges and prosecutors operate with only a few staff members. Even courts in larger counties depend on other agencies for many tasks, he noted, like bringing defendants to court. Some prosecutors have taken matters into their own hands. In district attorneys’ offices in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as in Albany, staff regularly retrieve defendants’ criminal histories from eJustice. The platform automatically searches state and national databases for convictions, warrants, orders of protection and parole or probation statuses after the police upload suspects’ fingerprints. The Manhattan district attorney’s office reviews the records, for example, when prosecutors are deciding whether to charge someone with a more serious crime based on a prior conviction. Other prosecutors and defense lawyers have said that the problem could be minimized if the Division of Criminal Justice Services provided the criminal history reports in a single document on the online portal. Currently, eJustice generates three separate reports that typically arrive within minutes, but reports containing out-of-state and federal data can sometimes be delayed by days or weeks. Had Justice Erica L. Prager received Mr. Drayton’s criminal history before she decided his bail, she would have seen a dark portrait of a violent man. Mr. Drayton had spent several years in jail for attacking women, he violated orders to stay away from them and he repeatedly skipped check-ins with his probation officers, according to records from the Connecticut Judicial Branch and news reports. In 2011, Mr. Drayton was arrested on charges that he beat and choked his girlfriend on Thanksgiving Day in East Haven. He was arrested in New Haven for choking the same woman four months later, despite a protective order, after a judge reduced his $20,000 bail to personal recognizance and released him, according to the Hartford Courant. Judicial records showed Mr. Drayton was charged with felony strangulation and sentenced effectively to three years in jail and three years on probation. He was released on probation in November 2014, but returned to jail the following May after he was caught holding a woman captive in her Waterbury home, the Hartford Courant reported. Mr. Drayton was arrested again while that case was pending after the same woman found him in her house, and he was eventually sentenced to three years in prison for unlawful restraint and violating a protective order, judicial records showed. He was released in April 2017. In February, New Haven police arrested Mr. Drayton again for sending threatening messages to a male friend. He pleaded guilty to harassment in March and received a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail, plus one year of probation, according to judicial records. Mr. Drayton was still on probation on June 30, when New York police arrested him for fare evasion in Brooklyn and extradited him on a warrant to Nassau County, where a former girlfriend had accused him of choking her. By then, Mr. Drayton had missed three appointments with his probation officer in Connecticut and the authorities there were searching for him. But they were unaware he had been jailed in New York and only issued a warrant for his arrest on July 17, after his release without bail. That same day, the nurse Mr. Drayton met on Tinder, Samantha Stewart, 29, was found beaten and strangled to death in her bedroom in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Investigators tracked Mr. Drayton to North Hollywood, Calif., a week later, where the authorities said a fugitive task force found him holding a woman captive. The police said he kidnapped and raped her after meeting her in an Uber; they believed he intended to kill her. Mr. Drayton remains in jail in California, where he has pleaded not guilty to rape charges. He is expected to be extradited back to New York to face murder and rape charges, the police have said. The police said Mr. Drayton has claimed responsibility for several more rapes and murders in New York City, which detectives are investigating. Investigators said they believed he raped a 23-year-old woman on June 17 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, but no other victims have come forward. The ex-girlfriend who accused Mr. Drayton of choking her told Nassau County police in June that Mr. Drayton attacked her when she tried to break up with him and that he returned a few days later and slashed her tires. In a chilling Facebook message, he wrote, “This is the beginning,” according to the criminal complaint against him. A judge set his bail at $2,000 bond on July 1. But Justice Prager let him go on his own recognizance at a follow-up hearing on July 5. Justice Prager declined to comment. A court transcript showed that she was never told of Mr. Drayton’s past, and in fact was given the opposite information. “He has no criminal record,” a public defender, Aubrey Chamberlain, told the judge, arguing against bail. “He has zero failures to appear.” The prosecutor, Karen Lipton, said nothing about the defendant’s criminal record. Instead she argued that his bail should be set high because he had threatened the former girlfriend on Facebook, saying he would cut her brake lines and set her car on fire. “I haven’t even used Facebook,” Mr. Drayton pleaded. “I am not here to cause any heinous acts.” “Every case is different,” the judge said. “Every defendant is different. Every situation is different.” She asked if the prosecution had been in touch with the victim, but Ms. Lipton could not say for sure. Then the judge asked Mr. Drayton if he would return to court. “Yes, I can come back to court,” he said. “O.K.,” Justice Prager said. “He is released on his own recognizance.”",The New York Times
2018,Missouri Voters Reject Anti-Union Law in a Victory for Labor,"After a succession of political setbacks in onetime strongholds and a landmark defeat in the Supreme Court, organized labor has notched a hard-won victory as Missouri voters overrode a legislative move to curb union power. A measure on the ballot on Tuesday asked voters to pass judgment on a prospective law barring private-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers who choose not to become members. The law was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin. The Supreme Court in June struck down such fees for public-sector employees, achieving a longstanding goal of conservative groups and overruling a four-decade precedent. Labor leaders argued that the rare opportunity for voters to weigh in directly on a so-called right-to-work measure — which several states have passed in recent years — revealed how little public support the policy has, at least once voters get beyond the anodyne branding. “It shows how out of touch those institutions are,” said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “How out of touch the Republican legislature in Missouri is, how out of touch the Supreme Court is.” But Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies unions at Washington University in St. Louis, cautioned against overstating the victory. A mere 8.7 percent of workers in Missouri were union members last year, below the national average and down from more than 13 percent a decade-and-a-half ago. “A ‘win’ just returns the situation to the status quo,” Mr. Rosenfeld said by email, though he acknowledged that it was “a huge morale boost to a beleaguered movement.” [Here are five key takeaways from Tuesday’s voting.] The victory in Missouri aligns with other tentative signs of a labor revival. Among them are polls showing rising popular support for unions and an uptick in membership in teachers’ unions after walkouts in several states during the past school year. The examples of Michigan and Indiana, where right-to-work laws took effect earlier this decade, suggest that the legislation could have cost unions thousands of members and millions in revenue. One question is the extent to which the victory could reverberate beyond Missouri. “I think this will build momentum and send a message to all legislators,” Mr. Trumka said, “that if you vote against the people, go against the will of the vast majority of working Americans, it’s going to cost you.” But it was not immediately clear that the forces driving the impressive showing for labor in Missouri could be reproduced elsewhere. One reason is that Republican voters who buck their party on a ballot measure, as many appeared to do in Missouri, may be unwilling to vote against Republican candidates in a general election, even when those candidates are hostile to labor. “There’s a big difference between overturning the law itself and defeating legislators who supported it,” said Jonathon Prouty, a Missouri political consultant and former executive director of the state’s Republican Party. “It’s a lot easier for unions to energize their base around the issue, which is right to work, rather than against candidates.” T. J. Berry, a Republican state representative whose district includes some outer suburbs of Kansas City, said that many of his constituents were proud union members who opposed right to work but nonetheless voted Republican because they were conservative on issues like abortion and guns. “I have four guys who are Ford workers in my Sunday school class,” Mr. Berry said. “And they fit exactly what I’ve told you: Pro-life, pro-gun and pro-worker. All of them voted for Trump.” Labor also appeared to enjoy a significant financial advantage in Missouri that is unlikely to recur in other states where Republicans have the wherewithal to pass right-to-work bills. According to state financial filings, the union-funded We Are Missouri coalition had spent just over $15 million on its ballot campaign as of late July, about three times what the four leading groups supporting the right-to-work legislation spent over the same period. A key factor behind this disparity was the leadership vacuum that the former Republican governor, Eric Greitens, left when he resigned amid scandal in May. “He was going to be the champion, then he was embroiled in controversy the whole year,” Mr. Berry said. “If you don’t have a leader, it’s pretty hard to rally the troops.” Even so, Mr. Prouty acknowledged that the momentum against the right-to-work effort was more than a function of labor’s spending. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen,” he said. “There is energy out there.” Mr. Greitens had signed a right-to-work bill into law after the legislature passed it in early 2017. Supporters argued that the measure was essential to the state’s economic competitiveness. “Companies that have a choice of expanding or choosing where they locate to begin with, they will generally choose — especially in the manufacturing sector — a right-to-work state,” said Daniel Mehan, president and chief executive of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He cited the manufacturing boom in the South in recent decades as a key data point. But shortly after the law’s passage, unions and their allies in the state started a campaign to keep it from taking effect. They submitted about three times the roughly 100,000 required signatures by last August, setting up the statewide ballot vote, then began aggressively campaigning this spring for a “no” vote — that is, a reversal of the legislative move. “I’ve been out knocking on doors, walking, since the middle of May,” said Mark Staffne, an electrical construction mechanic and union member, who lives in St. Charles County, which is heavily Republican. “I met both Republican voters who voted for Trump and labor Democrats who voted for Trump,” he said. “By a vast majority, a huge amount of people I talked to said they’re voting no.” Labor groups characterized right-to-work laws as an attack on workers’ livelihoods, because, they said, they undermine unions’ ability to negotiate wages and benefits. A 2015 report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute found that the typical full-time worker, not just the typical union member, earned about $1,500 per year more in states where mandatory union fees are allowed than in right-to-work states. If union fees are not mandatory, workers can enjoy the benefits of union representation without having to chip in for unions’ work on their behalf, often known as the “free rider” problem. These arguments appeared to resonate in Missouri, but Janice Fine, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, wondered whether the tendency of many unions to define their relationship with workers in narrow economic terms may be accelerating labor’s decline over the long run. An overly transactional relationship might prove less compelling if workers feel they can spend their money better elsewhere — say, by joining a bowling league or a gym. The alternative would be to cultivate more of a philosophical commitment, making unions more akin to evangelical churches, albeit in the secular realm. “I feel so ambivalent about that whole argument,” Ms. Fine said, referring to the free-rider case against right-to-work laws. Any union that thought of itself primarily as providing benefits to members, she added, “had a very thin notion of what solidarity was.”",The New York Times
2018,"Missy Robbins Embraces Simplicity, at Misi","The restaurant Preview The Lilia chef’s second Italian restaurant, also in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, includes an airy, glassed-in room where pasta is made. Missy Robbins, the chef and owner of Lilia in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, now has a challenge: distinguishing Misi, her new restaurant, from its older sibling about a mile away. From nearly the moment it opened in 2016, Lilia was a hit with diners and critics, who extolled the Italian menu and her touch with pastas. “I expected Lilia to be a neighborhood restaurant where people would just come in for a plate of pasta, but people are really dining there, and they come from all over,” Ms. Robbins said. “Misi is meant to be a little simpler.” The space will not have a wood-burning oven, but it will still have some eye-catching features. Among them are a gleaming stretch of open kitchen along one side and an airy, glassed-in room for making pasta on the other, where three to five artisans will be on view, mixing, rolling, extruding, twisting and filling. The two butcher-block work tables, where the pasta will be made during the day, will be available for private dining at night. If all goes well, Ms. Robbins expects that on weekends, she’ll be serving about 500 portions of pasta a day. She does not plan to sell the pasta retail. “I’ve been working on all of this, in my head, while I’m running Lilia,” she said. The subdued gray, white and black design by Peter Guzy, in a more straightforward room than Lilia’s quirky space, includes a total of 98 seats, 35 at a counter facing the kitchen and the bar. (Ms. Robbins says that, from her experience at Lilia, they add warmth and make dining fun and interactive.) She added that she did not intend to serve anything from the menu at Lilia. “The menu will be very simple,” Ms. Robbins said, “10 varied pastas and 10 vegetable dishes, some with proteins.” Among the pastas she expects to serve are tortelli in brown butter with a spinach and Swiss chard filling; bigoli with pork sugo; and chickpea pappardelle with rosemary. The vegetable-focused dishes may include charred radicchio with bone marrow and balsamic vinegar, and olive oil-poached zucchini with capers, oregano and torn grilled bread. There may be a nightly special. For dessert, there will be gelato. Her new wine director, Eliza Christen, came from the highly rated Meadowood resort in the Napa Valley and is assembling a collection, mostly Mediterranean, that’s more varied than the all-Italian list at Lilia.

2018,"Modi’s Cash Crackdown Failed, Indian Bank Data Shows","NEW DELHI — Almost two years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India threw the country into turmoil when he decided, by surprise and practically overnight, to effectively invalidate the old paper currency. Mr. Modi’s plan, kept secret even from his cabinet until it was announced, gave citizens a 50-day deadline to turn in their 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes to banks in exchange for new notes. After the deadline, the old notes would be totally useless. As Indians waited in interminable lines at banks, and everyone from rickshaw drivers to real estate agents suffered a hit to their businesses and lives, Mr. Modi’s team said the pain was necessary to punish those who were hoarding ill-gotten cash. These hoarders — including criminals, terrorists and tax evaders — would be too afraid to exchange their old bills for new ones, the thinking went, because going to banks would expose them to scrutiny and possible prosecution. But according to the central bank, it didn’t work out that way. Figures released this week by the Reserve Bank of India showed that 99 percent of the value of the old bills that had been removed from circulation eventually found its way back into the financial system. The figures suggested that criminals and other hoarders, like nearly everyone else, found ways to change their old bills for new ones. Mr. Modi’s enemies instantly pounced on the findings, saying the prime minister should apologize for all the chaos he caused. Economists shook their heads. “This was a big mistake,” said Arun Kumar, an economics professor at the Institute of Social Sciences in New Delhi. “Employment was lost, output was lost and investment came down.” Mr. Kumar said Mr. Modi’s decision clearly did not tackle the problem of illicit cash and was “a complete failure.” Mr. Modi’s plan, called demonetization or just “demo” by many Indians, was a huge gamble, possibly Mr. Modi’s biggest, and some analysts say the prime minister will pay next year when he is up for re-election. It is also the way he did what he did that ruffled many feathers. He did not consult Parliament. He did not solicit advice from many learned advisers. He did not give the public any warning. Instead, Mr. Modi made the decision in intense secrecy with the input of only a few trusted lieutenants and then sprung it on the nation, announcing in an unscheduled live television address on Nov. 8, 2016, that all the big bills in circulation were suddenly invalid. To keep the country in the dark, his government had largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So for months after his announcement, India suffered an acute cash shortage, with ATMs running dry and people lining up for hours to turn in their old bills and wait in vain for new ones. The stress pushed several people to suicide; others died of heart attacks while waiting in bank lines. So much in India turns on cash, not just common purchases for goods and services like food and taxi rides. Even real estate deals worth millions of dollars are sometimes done partly in cash. Many economists believe that demonetization, along with stricter tax policies that Mr. Modi’s government has put into effect, has crimped India’s economic growth, which is running at around 7 percent a year. That growth rate, however, is still the envy of many countries. And some economists contend that it is wrong to consider demonetization a failure, because the government can now obtain much more data from the banks, forming a clearer picture of what’s happening in the economy. “The risk to tax evaders has jumped sharply and they should be on tenterhooks,” said Gautam Chikermane, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a research institute in New Delhi. Another goal of demonetization was to move Indians away from cash. The idea was that Indians would bank more of their money and the government could then track it more closely — and collect more taxes in a country where only a tiny fraction of earners pay income tax. To some degree, the banking sector did benefit. In the wake of demonetization, millions of Indians opened their first bank accounts. But not all of that is attributable to Mr. Modi’s efforts. India has been rapidly modernizing, and its economy is now the world’s sixth largest (behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and Britain), though hundreds of millions of people are still very poor. And even to this day, cash is still king in India. Want to buy a table? More often than not merchants will offer two prices. If you want to pay by credit card, it’s this much. But if you pay cash (which means the merchant will most likely not report the sale), the price can be much cheaper. Mr. Modi has kept quiet about the recent demonetization findings, which basically confirmed those released a year ago. He is a prolific Twitter user, with nearly 44 million followers. But his latest burst of Twitter postings show him shaking hands with regional leaders or congratulating Indian table tennis players, with nothing about the economy.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Mollie Tibbetts, Racism and the Rule of Law","The hoopla over her killing is a classic example of bigotry. But that's not the only thing going on. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The main reason that Mollie Tibbetts’s horrible killing has received so much attention is racism. Tibbetts’s accused murderer is a Mexican immigrant, and large segments of the conservative media, including talk radio and Fox News, like to call attention to crimes committed by people with dark skin. It’s silly to pretend otherwise. You’ll notice the pattern if you spend any time watching or listening to these media sources. The pattern becomes especially clear when they descend into falsehoods. Just look at the made-up story that Fox promoted last week about land seizures in South Africa, which led to a false tweet from President Trump about “the large-scale killing of farmers.” Or look at Lou Dobbs’s long history of telling on-air lies about immigrants (despite their comparatively low crime rates). Dobbs, other right-wing hosts and Trump have no such history of making up stories about crimes committed by white people. I don’t think it’s possible to have an honest conversation about the Tibbetts debate without acknowledging the role that race plays. But I also think that David A. French’s piece in National Review is worth reading, especially for progressives. French starts the piece by acknowledging the role of racism. That’s not his focus, though. His goal, instead, is to persuade readers that race is not the sole reason that the Tibbetts case resonates with so many people. “There are reasons why illegal-immigrant crime can carry a poignant punch among people of good will,” French writes. “The murderer wasn’t supposed to be here. I’m reminded of the pain that people feel when, for example, they find out (in different crimes) that the police didn’t follow up on a lead or a prisoner was wrongly released on parole. The feeling is palpable.” Imagine, for example, that you heard the killer in a mass shooting had been able to purchase a gun illegally, because of a failure in the background-check system. Wouldn’t that heighten your sense of injustice about the crime? For most of us, the answer is yes. “The official failure magnifies the personal injustice,” as French argues. We live in a society that is supposed to be governed by laws. When they are not followed or enforced, many people are bothered. And they are right to be. Society functions better when its rules mean something. I’m outraged by the racism that the many immigrants face, by the lies told about them and by the abuses that the Trump administration is committing against them. None of it is defensible, whether the immigrants arrived here legally or illegally. But once the disaster of the Trump presidency has passed, the United States really should rewrite its immigration laws with the goal of reducing illegal immigration (as Barack Obama and John McCain, among many other politicians, have advocated over the years). Toothless laws undermine people’s faith in their government — and create all kinds of kindling for mistrust and anger. On the same subject: Tibbetts’s relative, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, wrote a moving denunciation of racism in a recent Facebook post. And several writers, including Rachael Revesz in The Independent and Amanda Marcotte in Salon, noted that gender is a far more important part of the story than immigration.

2018,"Mom and Dad Were Spies: Two New Novels Unravel Complicated Legacies, One Secret Mission at a Time","Fiction SAFE HOUSES By Dan Fesperman 405 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. RED, WHITE, BLUE By Lea Carpenter 301 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. That the phrase “the fall,” in the context of espionage fiction, usually refers to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall doesn’t entirely rinse it of its theological connotations. The Cold War has long been a backdrop against which to explore human frailties; that’s one of the reasons so many spy novels are backward-looking. But, like any careful spook, the best of such novels look both ways at once. In what we have to assume is the twilight of his career, John le Carré opted to interrogate his own past in the recent “A Legacy of Spies,” but took the opportunity to examine the present at the same time. If neither era showed human nature at its best, it was hard not to discern between the lines a certain amount of nostalgia for the world before the fall. Dan Fesperman’s latest novel, “Safe Houses,” similarly opts for a dual perspective. It begins in 1979, in a Berlin rife with shady bars and attic windows, but that’s something of a red herring: Though peopled by spies of every shade, it’s not a Cold War thriller as such. Instead, its narrative flashes back and forth between the backstabbing streets of a divided city, where the enemies might easily be on your own team, and a murder investigation set in the present; a murder with roots in long-ago events that is not the simple domestic tragedy it appears to be. This novel stumbles at the outset, it should be said: One fortuitously overheard conversation in a safe house is a fair device to trigger a thriller; two is stretching credulity. But that bump in the road having been negotiated, what follows is a smooth ride, a novel belying its historical origins with a #MeToo slant. In 1979, the C.I.A. officer Helen Abell discovers that a handler in the Berlin station has a history of sexual assault, and puts first her career and then her life at risk to expose wrongdoing the Company seems all too happy to accommodate. Thirty-five years later, in Maryland, Anna Shoat’s parents are murdered by her brother, a young man with learning difficulties. Anna wonders if there’s more to the crime. As she investigates, she is aided by Henry Mattick, a refugee from Washington politics. Many of his ground rules overlap with those of the world of espionage — for example, that information is shared and friendship offered “not out of any sense of love or loyalty. … You’re just hoping to use me.” As their probing reaches back to the 1970s and beyond, skeletons drop rattling from the cupboards. The narrative choreography demanded by Fesperman’s split timelines is expertly handled, and the dilemma faced by Helen, in particular — whether to be a good employee or a good citizen — illustrates the kind of weight that the spy novel, in the right hands, is capable of bearing. Lea Carpenter’s “Red, White, Blue” is an altogether different kettle of spooks, less an unfolding story than a series of set pieces, using — rehearsing might be a better word — some of the tropes of the spy thriller. There’s nothing new about this: Many a self-consciously literary novelist has dipped a toe in the genre in order to examine themes of identity, betrayal, duplicity and so on. Few, though, have skated quite so lightly over the surface of the world they’re borrowing. While much of the pleasure of Fesperman’s novel derives from its detail, and the acute handling of tradecraft — like the escape and evasion kit Helen prepares — Carpenter dabs instead on a larger, fuzzier canvas. An unnamed C.I.A. case officer delivers a series of bulletins about his career, and the spy trade in general, to Anna, a young woman whose late father also worked for the C.I.A. He has, it seems, something of moment to impart to her. Alternating with these sections are glimpses of Anna’s own life: her memories of her father, her girlhood, her marriage, her gradual comprehension of who her father was and what he did. What the threads have in common is a kind of dreamlike, affectless prose that effectively nulls characterization — Anna’s husband, we’re asked to believe, is a mover and shaker in the music business, but nothing about his behavior adds credibility to this bare résumé. And the individual sections are, if anything, overcrafted, each straining for its own little epiphany. A ship’s nautical compass, appearing in an opening paragraph, will inevitably have mutated into “a moral compass” by the section’s closing line. Meanwhile, our nameless agent delivers a series of unanchored observations, supposedly laying bare operational truths. “Timing plus empathy equals a successful recruitment … timing plus empathy can even, occasionally, avert an attack.” This sounds worth exploring, but remains an abstract profundity. Narrative scaffolding, indeed, is conspicuous by its absence throughout, and while we’re told at one point that “the order in which we receive facts matters,” this isn’t borne out by the text, many of whose sections could be rearranged without fracturing the story. And yet, it weaves a spell. Though mannered and elliptical throughout, it’s more readable than those qualities usually herald, and in the end there’s something hypnotic about its stately, confessional prose. I’d hesitate to classify it as a spy novel, because it pretty clearly doesn’t want to get grubby. No: It’s a novel in which some of the characters are identified as spies. But in its contemplation of different kinds of lost innocence, it’s also pondering the fall.",The New York Times
2018,Money Really Does Lead to a More Satisfying Life,"Economic View New research suggests that more money really does lead to a more satisfying life. Surveys of thousands of Swedish lottery winners have provided persuasive evidence of this truth. Lottery winners said they were substantially more satisfied with their lives than lottery losers. And those who won prizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars reported being more satisfied than winners of mere tens of thousands. These effects are remarkably durable. They were still evident up to two decades after a big win. (The researchers lacked the data to trace out even longer-term consequences.) The findings appear in a research report, “Long-Run Effects of Lottery Wealth on Psychological Well-Being,” that has generated a lot of buzz among economists over the summer. The working paper, by Erik Lindqvist from the Stockholm School of Economics, Robert Ostling from Stockholm University and David Cesarini from New York University. It is certain to feed a long-running debate about the role that personal finances play in shaping subjective well-being. Many previous analyses — including several that I have conducted with my partner, Betsey Stevenson, a fellow University of Michigan economist — have documented that people with higher incomes tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction. The relationship between income and satisfaction is remarkably similar across dozens of countries, suggesting that findings about Sweden likely apply to the United States. Those earlier studies merely documented a correlation. What’s new here is the evidence that higher income is causing higher life satisfaction. This research is able to reliably disentangle causation and correlation because a lottery effectively provides a randomized control trial. As in the trial of a new drug, those who received the treatment — in this case a big dose of money, courtesy of a lottery ticket — were compared both with those who received a smaller dose by winning a minor prize and with statistically matched individuals of the same age and sex who entered the lottery and didn’t win. In a drug trial — as in a lottery — whether you get the big dose, a smaller dose or no dose is determined purely by chance. Scientists find this sort of trial to be persuasive because the random assignment ensures that lottery winnings are the only factor driving systematic differences between those who receive the treatment and those in the control group. It therefore isolates the effect of extra money in driving satisfaction. The authors persuaded the Swedish statistical authorities to try to survey every winner of three of the country’s major lotteries over more than a decade, and then used government records to track other aspects of the winners’ lives. The researchers examined the same indicators for Swedes who had entered but lost the same lotteries, or who won minor prizes. Their surveys took several approaches to measuring subjective well-being. The measure most robustly linked to income asks people how satisfied they are with their lives as a whole. By contrast, responses to a question asking about happiness showed less of a connection to lottery winnings, and these effects could not be reliably distinguished from the effects of chance. Social scientists widely view questions about life satisfaction as eliciting a broad-based evaluation of one’s life while questions about happiness yield responses more related to current moods or feelings. A further set of questions probed the mental health of respondents, finding that greater income had no effect, although in related work, the same authors find that lottery winners are prescribed fewer mental health drugs. I interpret this as suggestive but not conclusive evidence that wealth improves one’s mental health. Other studies by these authors — sometimes with other scholars — have tracked the economic lives of these lottery winners to further explore the consequences of wealth. Contrary to popular stereotypes, those who win hundreds of thousands of dollars don’t blow most of their winnings at once. Instead, they slowly spend their newfound wealth over many years. Many don’t quit their jobs, but they do tend to work a bit less and retire a bit earlier. Surprisingly, the increase in wealth caused by winning the lottery has few effects on the physical health of the winners or their children. It seems possible that family wealth might have quite different effects in a less egalitarian society, like the United States. These results provide strong evidence in support of the standard economic view that money increases well-being, albeit not in an entirely uniform manner. It runs counter to the view championed by many psychologists that people largely adapt to their circumstances — including their financial situation. In an email, Mr. Cesarini characterized that perspective as the “widespread misperception that science has proved that winning the lottery often makes people miserable.” That misperception most likely comes from an earlier generation of lottery studies. Perhaps the most famous of them is a 1978 study, “Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?” With the benefit of hindsight, that study appears to illustrate changing standards of empirical research more than any truths about well-being. It compared the subjective well-being of 22 winners of the Illinois State Lottery with a control group of 22 people. The lottery winners rated themselves as happier after winning their prizes, but because the sample size was so small, the researchers concluded that this might reflect the influence of chance and failed to note that these data were consistent with the idea that the lottery winners were substantially happier. The problem with small samples is that it’s hard to be sure of anything. That same study also surveyed 29 paraplegic accident victims, finding them to be less happy than other people. Yet many popular accounts of this study describe it as if it supported the opposite proposition, that people adapt to personal tragedies. I’ve seen this pattern before, as a counterintuitive finding captures the public’s imagination, taking on a life of its own. In time, the facts become too interesting to check. But eventually, science corrects itself. After 40 years, three determined economists, thousands of lottery winners and reams of detailed data have revealed a more reliable but less romantic truth: Money really does help people lead a more satisfying life.",The New York Times
2018,"Money for Sale, Heroin-Injected Lasagna: How One Artist Is Defining Our Era","As playful as he is provocative, Darren Bader interrogates the meaning of art itself. Plus, four works he created exclusively for T. THE ARTIST DARREN BADER had been in Rome for a spell, and was passing through Palermo on his way to several weeks at the beach on the Tyrrhenian coast. We agreed to meet in Palermo, where we could visit the city’s sunstruck churches, with their grandiose, almost careless accretion of centuries of styles, and converse along the way. This turned out to be appropriate by happenstance, since both Sicily and Bader are renowned for their arresting juxtapositions — Sicily of epochs and cultures, and Bader for his elevation of the profane and ridiculous into the realm of high art. For a piece in the 2014 Whitney Biennial, for example, Bader displayed two donation boxes: One said, “All donations will go to something,” and the other said, “All donations will go to nothing.” People filled them with discarded Biennial programs and cash; someone wrote in marker on their dollar bill an obscene message directed to Bader, with his name misspelled. On the surface, Bader’s art may appear to be a kind of elaborate prank. He injected a piece of lasagna with heroin for a 2012 work titled “lasagna on heroin,” and he drove his aunt’s car from her house outside Miami and parked it in front of the Bass Museum of Art for a 2011 piece called “my aunt’s car.” There is a bit of “Well, what happens if … ?” to Bader’s work, which is as much about what strange combinations the artist concocts as it is about their result. In a 2011 show at the Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York, he released a pair of live goats into the gallery; for Bader, the goats were “found objects,” a kind of art world cliché on many artists’ materials lists. He had initially considered adding cats to the mix, but decided against it for fear of ancient feline instincts for preying on goats; instead, he encouraged viewers to adopt cats from a store in the East Village — and thereby become owners of a Bader sculpture. A 2010 show at the Alex Zachary gallery in New York featured a photograph of another bizarre sculpture, “kangaroo and/with lobster,” which amounted to a slightly perplexed-looking kangaroo with a lobster on the ground near its legs. How he came up with it, and more important, why, are common questions about Bader’s work. These kinds of works don’t obviously place Bader in the realm of the European artistic tradition that was all around us in Palermo, but I was surprised by his concerns with the disappearance of the religious context that once gave artists meaning. “Contemporary art is by its very nature kind of a tenuous proposition and category,” he told me, as we Google-mapped ourselves from the Chiesa di San Cataldo, a clean, cool, symmetrical Arab-Norman domed construction, to the Gothic mess of the main cathedral. “I always sense these fault lines, and perhaps I’m overly sensitive to it — perhaps paranoid, I don’t know.” He said he is always looking for where meaning can be found and how to define it, but he often comes to the realization that this attempt is “kind of a fool’s errand.” Bader, who is curly-haired, slight-framed and inclined to slouch, has edged into his early 40s with some reluctance, and he speaks with the vagueness, the slack elaborateness, of someone committed to a serious discourse about art: “ ‘What is art?’ both as some sort of spiritual entity, or quantity, and what is this world we live in, this highly commercialized society, a consumer society, and what does it mean to find meaning within it?” At the same time, he recognizes that we live in a moment when such seriousness is constantly being questioned. A number of Bader works explore the often ridiculous nature of money in the art world, where impractical, valueless objects can command hundreds of millions of dollars. Bader provides a kind of running commentary on this culture. In 2015, he raised nearly $16,000 on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo in order to sell the money itself as a lot at a Christie’s auction in London (the final price realized, about $19,000, was donated to charity). Bader turns capital from a symbolic thing, a means for transaction, to, in his words, “an object in the world as anything else might be.” His work is playful and logical — he has said that his art is about what he thinks art is about — and it often results from deducing what the contemporary art world can and will value. Bader’s work, in other words, challenges and provokes the viewer (and the artist and his gallerist and his collector) to ask what precisely art is. For many, especially rich collectors, there seems to be no crisis in artistic meaning: According to a report published in March by Art Basel and UBS, in 2017 the world art market totaled $63.7 billion in sales, up 12 percent from the previous year. The insane valuations given certain artists and their works, especially in a time of global political crisis, has heightened the feeling among the rest of us — the 99 percent, let’s say — that contemporary art is, to use Bader’s phrase, a “tenuous proposition.” Bader is not necessarily a political artist, but his conceptual pieces do provide a sustained critique — however farcical — of the commercialism and didactic elitism of the realm in which his work is made. He is a weird formalist, a somewhat unmoored logician, whose pieces seem to be the result of long, elaborate trains of thought, picking up steam as they pull into stations of absurdity. And yet Bader is always throwing us back on the absurdity of our own reality as well: the odd pairings of objects and ideas that fill our lives (and screens). By front-loading this ridiculousness through simple, random connections — a screenshot of Google search results for himself blown up on a wall, or his father’s piano for sale in a gallery — he is investigating the very nature of meaning and pushing the limits of what we will understand and accept. BADER AND I WALKED through the Albergheria neighborhood, where the cramped streets were shaded with carapaces of laundry, and where some buildings had not been reconstructed since they were bombed in World War II. On the exposed side of one building, a graffiti artist had reproduced a giant version of the logo for the condom brand Durex. It was a work — ridiculous and profound, close to but not quite a punch line or a philosophical lament — that was worthy of the artist himself. Bader, impressed, snapped a photo with his phone. Bader’s seismographic feeling for, as he says, “the fault lines” of the contemporary art world may come from his having arrived at it from a different tradition. He grew up in Fairfield County, Conn., and attended New York University, where he studied film and art history. (He retains a knowledge of and affection for old master paintings, as I discovered when he thumbed through a monograph on the otherwise obscure Lombard Renaissance painter Vincenzo Foppa at a used bookstore.) Bader says it was the experimental film tradition as made by people like Hollis Frampton and Stan Brakhage, whose work he would watch at Anthology Film Archives, that brought him into the contemporary art world, where experimental film still thrived. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles, where, among other jobs, he worked at the Museum of Contemporary Art bookstore, helping complete his education. (He is now based mostly in New York City.) He learned about movements like Arte Povera, the 1960s stylistic school whose intensely temporal, decaying sculptures, often made from banal materials like rocks and soil, are clear antecedents for Bader’s investigations of found objects. In the 1990s, installation art, the intricate, three-dimensional works designed for the transformation of a specific place, rose in popularity. This appealed to him — the art had a “cinematic element.” “I didn’t like being on set — I couldn’t stand it,” he said, explaining one reason he stopped making films; the other was that he didn’t have any money. “I didn’t want to wait around for years,” he said, “to make something I wanted to make.” The way Bader described his inclusion in his first shows is essentially how his artwork still functions: as an attempt to fill a void. “When you’re dealing with an exhibition,” he said, “you have to figure out what to put in it. That’s been my job.” As recently as the 2014 Whitney Biennial, Bader has made a sort of drama out of being asked to contribute something to a show and not knowing quite what to do. One of his contributions to the Biennial was a video, “Things I’m (Probably) Not Going to Get Done for the Biennial,” in which he stood and named ideas, among which were “using a car key to start a puddle,” and “patent an invisible mirror.” A minor, casual work in the Bader canon, it’s nonetheless a revealing glimpse of how thoroughly (and self-parodically) conceptual his artistic universe is, consisting almost entirely of tossed-off ideas — some of which occasionally make it into a gallery space. His work can be serenely perverse, but there is nonetheless a vertigo to the logical extremes that Bader will pursue in his ideas. It occasionally seemed to seize him, sometimes intensely. Pointing to a street sign, he described how it could be included in an exhibition as a sculpture: “If someone purchases the work, then I issue a certificate either explaining, ‘This is how you use a street sign,’ or the certificate simply defines the work as three spatial dimensions and says you can do whatever you want with this thing. And in that sense,” he went on, “I could consider my work sculpture. In the past I have more deliberately considered it sculpture, but the world gets more and more confusing. I don’t know — three dimensions, two dimensions — who knows what’s sculpture and what’s image-making, I don’t know.” In recent years, he has pursued these questions on Instagram, where he creates rhyming riddles on one of his feeds, @rt_rhyme, photographing artists’ works alongside a rhyming object in front of them. One person stands with a bouquet of spoons in front of a swollen sculpture by Jeff Koons. In another, a pair of spats are held up in front of a painting by Alex Katz. Finally — inevitably? — in April of this year, Bader put another of his Instagram accounts, @mined_oud, up for sale. He did so via a post on the account, with the contact information for his dealers included, and offered a certificate of authenticity to the buyer. (The work sold in June, though he won’t say for how much.) THOUGH THE VISUAL history of Surrealism is an obvious precedent for Bader’s practice — “the chance meeting of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table,” to quote the 19th-century French poet Isidore Ducasse, sounds like a description of a Bader sculpture — there is also an intensely written aspect to Bader’s work. The concepts often require, or benefit from, instructions. For example, his directions for 2012’s “motorcycle on birth control” (dimensions variable) include the following: “Pills should be placed in the motorcycle’s fuel tank following prescribed usage.” Much of conceptual art has been built around text-based, vaguely philosophical ruminations. Lawrence Weiner, an artist known for writing aphoristic concepts directly onto the walls of galleries and museums using paint or vinyl letters (“Dust + water put somewhere/between the sky & the earth”), famously created his own guidelines that spoke to his work’s value: “1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built.” Weiner once said, “Once you know about a work of mine, you own it.” The question of “what’s the point?” is implicit in conceptual art, whose very job is to interrogate the nature of art: What is it? What can it be? Why does it need to exist? It’s no coincidence that these searching questions, to which there is often no answer, arise in moments of tumult. Marcel Duchamp created the most famous ready-made in 1917, in the middle of World War I, by trying to place a urinal in a New York exhibition (the pitch was rejected). Conceptual art in the United States, as practiced by the likes of, say, Sol LeWitt and Adrian Piper, emerged from the ferment of the 1960s. As the late ’70s gave way to the aggressively neoliberal ’80s, and the art world became increasingly asphyxiated by commerce, artists reacted to the turning of their creation into capital. From that shift came a new kind of art that was impossible to buy, sell or own in any conventional sense. Bader came of age as the art world was reaching its commercial peak, and his contribution to this history is to commodify conceptual art itself — some of his work is only complete once it is bought. (In these instances, what collectors are buying is the idea itself, in the form of a certificate.) How to buy a work and live with it is often part of the work’s narrative. His other, perhaps more important contribution to conceptualism is his sense of humor. In his most recent show this past April at Andrew Kreps, for a piece titled “Lawrence Weiner study/encomium,” Bader referenced Weiner’s lexicon, writing in vinyl letters on the walls in his style, but reduced Weiner’s aphorisms to morbid jokes like “Get young or try dying,” or the Ace of Base lyric “Life is demanding without understanding.” There is a stone-faced drollness to so much of conceptual art, yet Bader’s instructions call attention to the genre’s futility with impressive deadpan. Here is the text for 2012’s “cow and/with bed,” in its entirety: The work consists of two elements: a cow, a bed. The cow* can be any free-roaming member of the species Bos primigenius. The bed can be any type of bed. Cow and bed should be placed in relative proximity to one another, roughly conforming to a person’s ability to see both elements without having to move her/his head. The work has no recommended duration. The cow in the work may likely be in the presence of other cows. Thus, if cow = cows, that is entirely ok. *Humane treatment of the cow(s) is of the essence. “I’m a writer, first and foremost,” Bader said. “I can’t tell a story at all, so I never went into fiction writing. But I love images of all sorts, however you want to define an image. My work’s really about how word and image can interact and compromise one another.” Bader in fact considered studying experimental writing — he was rejected from Brown University’s M.F.A. program — but his output also consists of a number of very weird books, often filled with images that reflect the detritus of contemporary life. His first, “James Earl Scones” (2005), largely consists of a series of letters that detail outlandish projects. “Dear Tom Cruise and NASA,” the first begins. “I am an artist. Never mind which kind of artist, for it is such an onerous thing to have to deem oneself this or that.” The address is vintage Bader — pairing the nation’s space program and one of its highest-paid film stars — and the style deliberately archaizing. The pitch Bader offers “verges on the simple. I would like to shoot Mr. Cruise and a (sexless) 5-year-old into outer space.” While in space, he goes on, “the ‘space capsule’ will contain enough egg salad to feed any hungers and maintain a sense of there being more egg salad than might be thought of as ‘decent.’ ” The rest of the book consists of a diary and more letters, several to museum directors at the Musée d’Orsay, the Prado, the Capitoline Museums, and their responses to his proposals, such as one to defecate in front of Giotto frescoes. “Dear Mr. Bader,” the response went, from the director of museums and libraries in Padua, “with regard to your request that reached us on 10th June ’03, dealing with your project in Scrovegni Chapel, we are sorry to inform you that the present visiting conditions do not allow the accomplishment of your project.” IF BADER’S WORK often appears irreverent, a knowing mockery of the art world’s shallowness, its tendency to elevate the preposterous and ridiculous into something sacrosanct, he has also become a creature of the gallery and the exhibition space. At the end of our day together, as we were chased by scooters down a cramped street that led to the Palazzo dei Normanni, a giant medieval fortress, I asked him about the politics of his work in the contemporary moment. It was a question he struggled with, jockeying between saying art had nothing to do with “daily, quotidian or local political concerns” and pointing to Gustave Courbet and Eugène Delacroix, 19th-century French artists who made social statements with their work. “Art is a privileged place. What is art, if it’s not this remove from immediate concerns, pressing exigencies?” he asked finally. “It’s somewhat of an elitist notion, or construction.” He talked about it being dependent on a scarcity of resources, but now “there seems to be sub-infinite resources. A lot of what I do is discuss the qualities of these — this great reservoir of resources.” It made me think of a post-postscript to his 2012 book, “Life as a Readymade,” a statement that might stand for the whole of his work: “Do I care? Probably.” The pitches in “James Earl Scones,” scabrous in an occasionally juvenile way, eventually gave way to more serious attempts to realize his projects: “how to make this abstraction concrete?” as Bader put it to me, by way of describing his method. The artist is occasionally compared to Duchamp, in the way that he also seems to exploit ready-mades, but it is a comparison he largely rejects. One reason, he pointed out to me earlier in the day, as we clambered over the roots of an enormous, ancient ficus tree in a garden in the Piazza Marina, was that Duchamp seemed disinterested in beauty. It was the sort of strangely earnest statement that the otherwise relentlessly common-sense skewering Bader was more likely to make. The guy who parked his aunt’s SUV in front of a museum cares about beauty? And yet that was his line of inquiry: as he put it, the question of “how to make religious work in a post-religious society — however ridiculous and grandiose that sounds.” “But,” he added, “what is art if not a spiritual kind of pursuit?” The artist sent us a list of instructions for a set of works he created exclusively for T. We executed them as best we could. A “Lou Reed memorial sculpture,” in the artist’s words, “in which someone named Stephanie, someone named Candy, someone named Caroline and someone named Lisa are in a space together (public or private doesn’t matter) and converse. This might be more effective as video, but still photography gets the point across fine, too.” Bader’s instructions for this work were: “Have someone make and sell their own Darren Bader and I’ll issue a certificate of authenticity to the purchaser.” We asked the installation artist Urs Fischer, who obliged with this work of a smoothie made of honey, milk and cut-up money. Bader sent us instructions for works involving guns: “Filling up a revolver’s chambers with fish roe inside a vitamin capsule rather than bullets. Filling up an emptied pistol magazine with polenta and tuna salad … Filling up shotgun shells with fingernail clippings instead of shot.” 5 Photos View Slide Show › Bader has said he will issue a certificate of authenticity to the first person to realize this work, in which a house is placed into an enormous bag (and could later be transported via helicopter so that you could “travel without leaving home”).

2018,Monsanto Ordered to Pay $289 Million in Roundup Cancer Trial,"A California jury on Friday found Monsanto liable in a lawsuit filed by a school groundskeeper who said the company’s weedkillers, including Roundup, caused his cancer. The company was ordered pay $289 million in damages. The case of the groundskeeper, Dewayne Johnson, 46, was the first lawsuit to go to trial alleging that Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers cause cancer. Monsanto, a unit of the German conglomerate Bayer following a $62.5 billion acquisition, faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States. Mr. Johnson’s lawyers said he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after using Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide, as part of his job as a pest control manager for a California county school system. The jury in Superior Court of California in San Francisco deliberated for three days before finding that Monsanto had failed to warn Mr. Johnson and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by its weedkillers. It awarded $39 million in compensatory and $250 million in punitive damages. Monsanto said in a statement that it would appeal the verdict. More than 800 scientific studies and reviews “support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr. Johnson’s cancer,” the company said. The lawsuit, filed in 2016, was put on the fast track for trial because of the severity of Mr. Johnson’s cancer. His doctors said he was unlikely to live past 2020. Brent Wisner, a lawyer for Mr. Johnson, said in a statement that jurors had seen for the first time internal company documents “proving that Monsanto has known for decades that glyphosate and specifically Roundup could cause cancer.” He called on Monsanto to “put consumer safety first over profits.” in September 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found that the chemical was not likely carcinogenic to humans. But the World Health Organization’s cancer arm in 2015 classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Monuments for a New Era,"Op-Art What should replace statues celebrating the Confederacy? Six artists imagine a way forward. A year ago, torch-carrying white nationalists who opposed a plan to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville, Va., city park convened for a “Unite the Right” rally, where a participant killed a counterprotester. After the tragedy, that statue and another honoring Stonewall Jackson were shrouded, but only temporarily. Around the country, similar monuments have been removed. In some cases, only their pedestals remain. We asked artists to contemplate these markers of our country’s racist and violent history — the space they take up, physically and psychically — and imagine what should happen when they are gone. It has taken a tremendous effort to remove the Confederate statues that have been taken down so far. This is a great beginning. I’d like to replace the 68-foot-4-inch column and base that for 133 years provided a platform for a figure of the white supremacist general Robert E. Lee with an anti-monument. I’d call it “The Legacy of Slavery Is in the Way of Progress and Will Be Until America, Which Benefits From That Legacy, Has Been Replaced With a Completely Different Society.” Rather than sticking a monument to an African-American hero atop the structure that was once a pedestal for a racist, I would lay the upended column across the road — which is still called Lee Circle — making it impassable. This broken and shattered ruin would be an intentionally inconveniently placed eyesore, disrupting travel and commerce. The placement would demand that visitors confront how slavery and the ideals that maintained and rationalized it continue to stand in our way. A 84-foot-10-inch-deep hole (representing the height of the former monument including the now removed statue of Lee) would create a gaping abyss. There would be no barriers to protect people from falling in. This reimagined monument transforms visitors from spectators of history to participants in a shared memory. It creates a space for confronting America’s history of slavery and segregation — acknowledging their ongoing manifestations and the healing that can take place through reconciliation. Inspired by the design agency Zerflin’s project “But Slavery Was So Long Ago…”, the six-story stone pedestal is stained red to represent the 339 years of American slavery, yellow for the 89 years of American segregation and green for 60 plus more years of American inequality. The glass sky room allows participants to stand on the platform where Robert E. Lee’s statue stood for 133 years. In this way, they become living monuments. Participants leave the room the way they entered. Walking up, they are reminded of how difficult it has been to get to where we are. Walking down, they’re encouraged to think of how easy it is for us to forget. Passing one another on the double-helix stairway, they’re reminded of today’s ongoing struggle for justice and equality. Near my home in Brooklyn is the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch that stands at Grand Army Plaza at the main entrance to Prospect Park as a tribute to defenders of the Union. It includes the figure of a crouching African-American man who seems to be surveying and assessing the battle situation. He is confidently poised, holding his gun with his arm comfortably propped up across his knee next to a cannon, calmly awaiting the action to come. He is never a victim. For me he is truly an alchemist, a person who transforms or creates through a seemingly magical process, who has the power to transform things for the better. He inspired this piece, which I call “The Spirit of Persistent Resistance of the Liquid Land.” It could alight anywhere and activate and occupy any of the recently divested plinths of Confederate monuments. As a New Orleanian, I see the Live Oak as more than just a common tree found in my city. It’s a marker of years past and years to come. To me, it represents the different races of people who came together to create a unique culture. To embrace the diversity of New Orleans is to embrace your neighbor’s culture while also celebrating your own. I’m glad that the Beauregard monument has been taken down. When I imagine a replacement monument that reflects the diversity and creolization of New Orleans, I imagine an abstract Live Oak tree interpreted four ways, with each version covered in a soil type that is found in Louisiana. Driving on the roundabout, passers-by see the Live Oak Tree in its three-dimensionality. Each side has a unique look, but they all come together, forming a kind of family tree. It is not enough to simply rename our buildings, tear down our statues and de-accession the relics of our flawed past. What do we do with the monuments of men whose values stand in utter contradiction to the Constitutional edicts that we hold so dear? I suggest what I call “Monumental Inversions” —  sculptural amendments to our national monuments. The current iterations of this series I’ve created are made of wood, glass and marble. Mold making is a fundamental stage for most sculptural work, but molds are rarely counted as works of art in their own right. Sculptural positives — the work they produce — are the objects to which we ascribe value. Presented as part of the final piece, molds suggest the latent potential of those immutable values from which American ideals are cast. Molten glass is blown into empty wooden molds, charring the surface. What emerges are distortions of the original sculptural reference. These “distorted replicas” are emblematic of our struggle as a society to conform our realities to the ideal. Keep the statues. Keep the men on their horses, or at the top of the steps on Wall Street, or with a right hand forever tucked into a fitted vest, or with a finger pointed to a horizon of stolen riches. Because we need a visual reminder of our stubborn tendency to elevate mediocrity. Think of it as an educational defense against the kind of racism-obscuring erasure we continue to see — like textbooks that rename trans-Atlantic human trafficking the “Triangular Trade.” Around each monument, I propose a sanctuary for African gray parrots. A wrought-iron flight cage with elevated walkways, providing a perched perspective, and featuring a cacophony of feathered talkers with unusual catchphrases. Or we could mimic a preschool project by coating the offending objects with peanut butter, shaking seed on the surface — massive feeders across the nation. George Washington Carver would be proud.

2018,"More Earthquakes Strike an Indonesian Island, Cutting Power and Spreading Panic","MATARAM, Indonesia — A series of earthquakes including a powerful 6.9 magnitude tremor struck the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday, the United States Geological Survey said, killing one person, cutting power and causing people to rush from buildings in panic. The quakes, which could be felt on the neighboring island of Bali, came two weeks after another 6.9 earthquake killed 460 people on Lombok. While some buildings were damaged, there were no immediate reports of widespread damage or other casualties from tremors that started in the morning and continued intermittently into the evening. ""I was in a restaurant when the shaking started,’’ Teddy Aditya, an official with Indonesia’s search and rescue agency, said in Mataram, the main city in Lombok. “The lights went out. They are still out. Everyone is still outside, not going back in. We are urging the public not to panic and to stay away from buildings and big trees.’’ One person died in the first earthquake on Sunday morning, a 6.3 magnitude tremor, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said via Twitter. Mount Rinjani, where hundreds of trekkers were stranded after the July 29 quake, has been closed and there were no tourists there, Mr. Nugroho added. The Geological Survey revised down the biggest tremor in the evening to 6.9 magnitude from magnitude 7.2 and estimated the epicenter to have been in northeastern Lombok. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency said there was no risk of a tsunami. Lombok, just east of Bali, Indonesia’s most famous tourist destination, has been rocked by a series of quakes and aftershocks since July 29, including the 6.9-magnitude tremor on Aug. 5. More than 430 people died in the earthquake two weeks ago, and the damage was estimated at about $342 million, authorities said.",The New York Times
2018,More Strikeouts Than Hits? Welcome to Baseball’s Latest Crisis,"This could be the first season in major league history to feature more strikeouts than hits, a slowdown that worries many league officials. CreditCreditDaniel Zakroczemski One thing you learn from studying baseball history is that people have always predicted the sport’s demise. Over and over, the game weathers every perceived crisis and continues to thrive. More than 70 million fans will attend major league games this season; another 40 million or so will go to minor league games. Countless more watch the sport on television and online. And yet attendance is down, and more and more balls are being kept out of play. Some longtime observers consider the shifting landscape — hitters swinging for the fences, pitchers throwing everything with maximum effort, fielders standing in unusual spots — and wonder what has happened to their game. “Keith and I were talking, and I said, ‘You know, our window is probably three years until we can’t work anymore,’ because the game is going to be so different,” said Ron Darling, the former Mets pitcher and broadcast partner of Keith Hernandez, the former Mets first baseman. “I mean, what was fair is foul, and what’s foul is fair.” This could be the first season in major league history to feature more strikeouts than hits, a slowdown that worries many league officials. Thirty years ago, batters compiled nearly 13,000 more hits than strikeouts. Last season, that edge dwindled to about 2,000. This season, through Wednesday, it was nearly even, with hits only slightly ahead: 30,678 hits, 30,569 strikeouts. 1980 2018 9.06 hits 8.47 9 8.44 per team, per game average 7 5 4.80 strikeouts 1980 2018 9.06 hits 8.47 9 8.44 per team, per game average 7 5 4.80 strikeouts 1980 2018 9.06 hits 8.47 9 8.44 per team, per game average 7 5 4.80 strikeouts 1980 2018 9.06 hits 8.47 9 8.44 per team, per game average 7 5 4.80 strikeouts Statistics through Wednesday Source: Baseball-reference.com By The New York Times Fifteen years ago, only seven qualified pitchers averaged 8.4 strikeouts per nine innings. Now, 8.4is the major league average. Collectively, batters are hitting .248, the lowest average since 1972, the year before baseball introduced the designated hitter. “There’s going to be a breaking point,” Erik Neander, the general manager of the Tampa Bay Rays, said. “In terms of purely watching a baseball game, seeing a few hundred pitches a night that aren’t put in play, there’s not a lot about that that’s entertainment. People don’t come to see the umpire call a ball or a strike or a foul ball. I think it’s something we have to be mindful of, because this is an entertainment business, and we are here for the fans.” Fans may be sending a signal that the modern game — focused so much on power pitching and power hitting — is losing its appeal. Attendance across the majors is down an average of about 1,500 per game, with 19 teams experiencing a drop from last year. When he talks with fans, Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month, he hears the same concerns over and over: the downtime between balls in play and the rise of strikeouts, shifts and bullpen usage. “I think everyone realizes what’s going on,” Manfred said. The worry, for baseball, is that the changes on the field could make the product less appealing for future customers. While declining interest is often tied to the local team’s outlook, especially if that team is rebuilding, the increasing emphasis on keeping balls out of play — by throwing the ball past hitters or bashing it over the fence — seems out of touch with modern tastes. “I just wonder if the issue has to do with the parts that appeal to people now in sports,” said the Houston Astros’ Charlie Morton, who reinvented himself as a power pitcher and became a first-time All-Star last month at 34 years old. “Do people like the chess game, or do they like quick action?” In football and basketball, analytics and rule changes have promoted more action: the passing game rules the N.F.L., and 3-pointers reign in the N.B.A. In baseball, though, the reverse holds true. For a pitcher, the surest way to get an out is to strike out the opponent, thus eliminating all fielding variables. For a batter, the easiest way to score a run is to do it with one big swing. Home runs made up 10 percent of the hits in the 2014 season. That percentage spiked in ensuing years, rising to 11.7 percent in 2015, 13.3 percent in 2016, and a stunning 14.5 percent last season, which had a record number of homers. This season, home runs account for 13.6 percent of hits through Wednesday. “We know now, just like we did 15 years ago, that home runs are the best way to score runs, the most efficient way to get back to home plate,” said David Forst, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a surprise contender thriving with a power-packed lineup. “That’s sort of our style, and those are the hitters we go after. The patience and power profile is something we’ve never tried to get away from.” Forst’s boss, Billy Beane, the team’s executive vice president for baseball operations, helped spark teams’ reliance on data as the subject of “Moneyball,” Michael Lewis’s landmark book in 2003. The lesson of the book was in the importance of finding undervalued assets to gain an edge; it was not purely an ode to numbers. But every team, to varying degrees, now employs a team of analysts seeking to uncover hidden value in the data. No team mines the data more diligently than the Astros, whose general manager, Jeff Luhnow, came to the executive ranks with an Ivy League education, an extensive business background and no professional playing experience. Luhnow acknowledged that extreme infield shifts spring directly from data, which — quite logically — encourages fielders to play in spots where batters are most likely to hit the ball, and thus encourages batters to hit balls over the shift and into the seats. But the power game, Luhnow said, has more to do with athleticism than analytics. “Look at these guys last night,” he said before a recent game, after a succession of unheralded Oakland pitchers had dominated the Astros’ brawny lineup. “I mean, where are these guys coming from? How are you supposed to hit off these guys? And every team we face has guys starting in the sixth inning throwing 100 miles an hour with breaking balls. “Granted, technology’s allowing them to fine-tune their repertoire and know how to use it, but holy cow, the development of these athletes — in the past you’d see one out of 100 guys in the big leagues like that. Now, they’re more common than they’re not. Of course, Nolan Ryan and those guys always existed, but there was maybe one in a division. There weren’t four or five in every bullpen.” Amateur pitchers often train specifically to build velocity, inspired by examples like Trevor Bauer, the Cleveland Indians right-hander who made himself into a star with help from the data-driven Driveline Baseball program near Seattle. Teams covet hard throwers and select from that ever-expanding pool, flooding their farm system with heat — not just in the bullpen, and not just with fastballs. “I was in low-A last year and you saw guys in the mid- to upper-90s starting,” Buddy Reed, a top outfield prospect for the San Diego Padres, said. “Usually you see that out of the pen, and the starters would be 89 to 93, which is a lot different. Now you’ve got to be ready, like, right away — because not only is their fastball good, but they’re throwing harder sliders, harder curveballs and harder changeups, too, with a lot of movement.” Reed spoke last month in Washington before the Futures Game, which featured eight home runs (doubling the record for the 20-year-old event) and 16 strikeouts. Two days later, the major leaguers set a record for homers in the All-Star Game, with 10 in 10 innings, while fanning 25 times. Velocity was the story. Fifteen of the 18 pitchers in the All-Star Game threw a pitch at least 96 miles per hour, and everyone threw at least 93.8 m.p.h. — one m.p.h. faster than the average major league fastball, according to Fangraphs. The 92.8 average matches last year’s for the highest in Fangraphs’ data, which dates to 2002. “We try to adjust as hitters, but it’s a different style of ball now,” Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Lorenzo Cain said. “Guys are throwing a lot more breaking balls in hitter’s counts. You can’t really cheat to a fastball anymore. I feel like pitching is going to continue to get better and better. As far as hitting, I don’t know how that’s going to go.” Defying the strikeout trend is rare; those who do it often earn World Series rings. The 2015 Royals and the 2017 Astros had the fewest strikeouts in the majors and wound up winning the championship. But it is not easy, even for hitters who have managed to cut their strikeout rates in recent years, like Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds. “Hitting is much harder than it was when I entered the league,” said Votto, a 12-year veteran. “Lots of things feel different. The strike zone feels a little different, the shift is something. In the past, at times when you were struggling, you’d think about hitting a one-hopper through the infield and that was a hit and that would get you going. But now, with each and every adjustment to the game, it feels like there’s fewer and fewer options. Especially as a left-handed hitter, you have to be very near perfect to be successful.” The sinker has gone out of vogue, partly because the pitch, which can tail off the plate, cannot reliably be called for a strike. Encouraged by launch-angle data and the narrower strike zone, many hitters have tailored their swings to lift the low pitch. The north-south approach to pitching — fastballs up and curveballs down — now reigns, although the overall percentage of fastballs keeps dropping, from 64.4 percent in 2002 to 55.2 percent this season, and slider usage is rising. More pitchers are scrapping traditional patterns, and have the stuff to do it. “I think pitchers are better than ever right now,” said David Ortiz, the former Boston Red Sox slugger, dismissing the notion he hears from other retired players that the game was better in the old days. “Bro, the talent out there right now is stupid crazy. You see guys throwing 100, snapping breaking balls, throwing good changeups in hitters’ counts.” Pitchers, naturally, would prefer to be appreciated for their skills rather than treated as a problem. Baseball has a long history of stacking rules against the pitchers: banning the spitball in 1920, lowering the mound in 1969, creating the D.H. in 1973 and tacitly condoning steroid use in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “Baseball has a way of correcting itself,” Sean Doolittle, the Washington Nationals’ closer, said. “Any response we have would be an unfair, kneejerk reaction to this thing. Why aren’t we talking about how awesome pitchers are? We’re really good. We have guys throwing harder than ever with nastier stuff. Celebrate that. It’s not bad.” Hitters understand the futility of trying to score with a flurry of hits against dominant pitchers and over-shifted fielders. League officials have no way to regulate velocity or suppress the quality of breaking balls, but they could mandate that two infielders play on either side of second base, effectively killing the shift. Now that so many teams use shifts, Luhnow said, the competitive advantage is all but gone; he would be open to experimenting with a ban in the minors. The players’ union would probably oppose the idea in the majors, and has so far resisted invitations from Manfred to discuss possible on-field changes. “You can’t change the way the competitive people that run clubs are thinking about the game because they think they’ve figured out the way to win more games,” Manfred said. “The only option available to us is to have dialogue with the people that play the game every day and figure out what rules, if any, ought to be put in place to kind of check, or manage, these organic developments that are ongoing.” Last winter’s sluggish free-agent market has made many players suspicious of owners’ motives and reluctant to cooperate on fundamental changes. Players are generally protective of the game, believing that on-field trends merely reflect the ability of highly skilled athletes to respond to the owners’ incentives. “No matter what the game throws at them, they are talented enough to adjust to it,” Tony Clark, the executive director of the players’ association, said. “And they have.” In other words, with analytics encouraging power pitching and power hitting — and the patience to wait for pitches to drive and accept the risk of strikeouts — the players are simply giving front offices the game they want. “It’s all about scoring the most runs and creating wins,” Max Scherzer, the Nationals’ three-time Cy Young Award winner, said. “That’s what drives this. This is how you win baseball games. If you’re trying to win 90 to 100 games, this is the formula. That’s how the G.M.s have formulated it.” With that formula, at times, comes a lack of nuance from a game that should have so much to offer — daring base runners, far-ranging fielders, pitchers finding ways to last deep into games. Strikeouts may not be boring and fascist, as Crash Davis memorably said in “Bull Durham,” but they are eclipsing everything else in the game. For the moment, anyway. “Any time something’s different, people want to categorize it as good or bad, and it’s probably neither,” Bauer said. “It appeals to a certain fan base more and it appeals to a certain fan base less. “And there will be adaptation, for sure. Hitters aren’t just going to sit here and continue getting punched out for years and years and years. They’re going to make some sort of adjustment to that. It’ll all equal out.”",The New York Times
2018,More Than 100 Cars Burned in Mass Arson Attack in Sweden,"GOTEBORG, Sweden — The Swedish authorities on Wednesday were investigating the burning of more than 100 vehicles on the nation’s west coast, in what they said was a coordinated arson attack by groups of young men. The attack began shortly after 9 p.m. Monday, when several cars were reported to be on fire in the main square of Vastra Frolunda, a suburb of Goteborg, Sweden’s second-largest city. By the time those blazes were over, “33 cars had been lit on fire and about 50 cars had been damaged,” Thomas Fuxborg, a spokesman for the Swedish Police, said in a phone interview. A few minutes after the fires broke out in Vastra Frolunda, there were reports of cars on fire in Hjallbo, a district in northeast Goteborg. Fires were also reported in Kronogarden, a district of Trollhattan, about 45 miles north of Goteborg, the police said. “We think these attacks were coordinated using social media,” Mr. Fuxborg said, adding that the police were investigating the crimes as acts of arson, vandalism, rioting and incitement to violence. “Society is going to react very harshly against this,” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, told Radio Sweden, adding: “We have raised the punishment for vandalism. We will also propose this fall to address the attacks on the police that often occur in the wake of this kind of activity.” The car fires are likely to become a political issue as Swedish elections loom. Generally, health and medical care, schools and education, integration and immigration, the environment, and care for the elderly top the priorities for most Swedes. But a recent poll showed that 10 percent of the population lists law and order as the most important issue in the vote on Sept. 9, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported on Saturday. Mr. Lofven, a Social Democrat, is running for re-election, and he spent Tuesday afternoon visiting the affected area in Vastra Frolunda. On Tuesday, the police arrested a 16-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man in connection with the fires there. A third man who had fled to Turkey was picked up at an airport there late Tuesday, said Christer Fuxborg, a police spokesman. Setting fire to vehicles in Scandinavia is not uncommon, but the phenomenon has stymied the police and criminologists. “On average, there are four incidents a day in Sweden, and August is the month where we tend to have the most burning cars,” said Manne Gerell, a criminologist affiliated with Malmo University. In the summer of 2016, Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, experienced more than 70 car fires within a few weeks. The police took to using drones to search for the culprits. On Monday, when the fires began in Vastra Frolunda, Krista Koppel, 74, was in her apartment nearby. She said that she had heard the sound of firecrackers and people shouting outside and had gone to her balcony on the eighth floor, where she has a view of the parking lot. “I saw about six to eight male persons totally covered in black,” she said. “They were smashing the rear windows in the cars. Then they had some Molotov cocktails and they threw them into the cars — about 20 cars in total.” She added that her car had also been damaged. When they ran out of Molotov cocktails, the perpetrators went away, she said. Ms. Koppel, who has been living in her neighborhood for 40 years, said she had always felt safe — until Monday. “I was very upset, and I cried, and I thought why was this happening? It was so terrible,” she said. “Of course, nobody dared to go outside and stop them. There were so many of them, and you don’t know if they have guns.” In Hjallbo, a group of eight to 10 boys and young men set fire to some 15 cars at six addresses, Thomas Fuxborg, the police spokesman, said. In Kronogarden, which has a history of “confrontations between police and youth gangs,” he said, seven cars were damaged “and about 40 youths threw stones at police officers and rescue workers and blocked the entrance to the area with burning car tires.” Another car was set on fire in Alafors, a rural community between Goteborg and Trollhattan, and a moped burned in Lysekil, a coastal community north of Goteborg, he added. In a region that frequently tops quality-of-life indexes, such social unrest has left police officers scratching their heads as they struggle to find the root cause of the fires. Residents cite disparate theories to explain the attacks, including blaming them on Russians trying to foment unrest before the election. Dr. Gerell, the criminologist, said that Monday’s car fires were similar to the Malmo blazes, but that they did not seem to follow the usual pattern of social unrest. “Usually, when there’s lots of burning cars, you also have rioting occurring simultaneously,” he said. “That was not the case in Malmo in 2016, nor does it appear to be the case in Goteborg.” The attacks in Goteborg were widely recorded and spread on the internet, he noted, and instead of a crowd of angry youths, they appeared to be more systematic. “It looks kind of calm and organized,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,More Than Cutting Costs: Travel Managers Now Consider Employee Comfort,"Itineraries Corporate managers used to focus on one thing when it came to employee travel: saving money. But now, given the nature of travel — crowded planes, tighter seats, security hassles — corporate managers are considering employee comfort as part of the deal. A plane trip that includes layovers might save money, said Andrew Sheivachman, business travel editor at Skift, a travel industry news and research site. “But if that person emerges from the plane too tired to work, or ends up burned out on corporate travel, it’s not worth the trade-off.” Cost continued to be the most important factor in airline contracts, according to a 2016 research report, “The Evolution of Airline Agreements,” by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives. But more than half of respondents expected traveler comfort to become more important in future agreements with airlines. “Experiences matter,” Mr. Sheivachman said. “You’re not just looking at the dollars, you’re empowering your employees to do a good job.” Aside from seat comfort, meal service and faster Wi-Fi, there isn’t much room to innovate the offerings inside the aircraft, Mr. Sheivachman said. But beyond the plane, airlines can offer perks like matching frequent-flier status earned on another airline and offering access to airport lounges, early boarding, seat upgrades and priority help with requests like midtrip ticket changes. “If you are sending someone around the world and they aren’t well taken care of, that reflects badly on the company and the corporate culture,” Mr. Sheivachman said. These are more than V.I.P. perks, said Mary Huddleston Tabacchi, professor emerita at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration. “Ideally, a corporate flier needs to arrive well rested to do business for their employer.” Chris Sabby, a director of CWT Solutions Group, which helps companies analyze their travel spending, including modeling changes to their travel policies, noted that business travel is an important part of employee retention. If a company is deciding how long a flight must be before an employee can purchase a business class seat, or how to dole out lounge access to its traveling employees, Mr. Sabby said his group, which is part of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, will offer information on costs, as well as a more subjective analysis on how the change will affect the business travel experience. According to a study released last fall by the Global Business Travel Association, 79 percent of all business travelers, and 88 percent of millennial business travelers, said their job-related travel experience affected their overall job satisfaction. The travel association’s convention this month in San Diego will feature multiple sessions discussing traveler stress, wellness and how travel policies can affect the workplace. The perks do have costs, so it’s up to the corporate travel managers to establish policies determining who receives the benefits. “It might be the executives, it might be the road warriors who travel the most, and it might be travelers in the divisions that bring in the most money,” Mr. Sabby said. Dan Landson, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines, said the airline had increased its focus on corporate travel. Its team that works with corporations to analyze their business travel and offer individualized plans has grown to more than 80 people from 30 in the last year and a half. The team can, for example, offer discounted fares or match a passenger’s status with other frequent flier programs. Direct nonstop travel, minimizing total trip time, is as important as any perk, Mr. Landson said. Before Southwest started operating flights from the Cincinnati airport in June 2017, it spoke with travel managers from several Fortune 500 companies in the area, as well as other businesses to learn when and where their employees traveled most. There’s untapped potential in helping corporations of all sizes improve their travel, Mr. Landson said. California, for example, has thousands of companies whose employees want to make day trips within the state and get back home that night. Southwest takes those factors into account when planning its flights, he said. David Oppenheim, vice president of sales at Alaska Airlines, said corporate travel managers were looking for three main things — “flight schedules to take them where they want to go at the right time, great value for their company that pairs with a great experience for their travelers as well as special benefits for their corporate travelers that take some of the hassle out of flying.” Alaska Airlines has had a special check-in line for Microsoft employees at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for three years and added a lane for Amazon employees in the last few months. “Airlines are more interested in being creative and entertaining unique requests,” Mr. Sabby said. An airline, for example, might offer more intrastate upgrades for fliers in a competitive marketplace like Los Angeles. Companies are surveying their employees to see if they feel as if they are being cared for on the road, said Mike McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Group. Business Travel News, an organization that focuses on the managed corporate travel industry, created a free tool called the Traveler Happiness Index about 18 months ago that companies can use to see how their travelers are feeling about their business trips. So far, about 1,000 travelers have answered the questionnaire on what is important to them in their business travel, and how their employer is delivering on those areas. Each company can see the details from its own employees and compare results to the entire group that answered. While the tool was intended for companies to use directly, “We’ve also seen an increase in interest in this tool from travel management companies and consultants to use with their clients,” said Elizabeth West, editor in chief of Business Travel News. The focus on cost savings ebbs and flows, largely with the strength of the economy, Ms. West said, but there is value in having happy, productive business travelers.",The New York Times

2018,"Morgana King, Jazz Singer and ‘Godfather’ Actor, Is Dead at 87","Before March 1972, Morgana King was known as a jazz singer with an impressive vocal range and an ability to put a distinctive spin on an eclectic selection of songs. But by late that month, although she remained an accomplished singer, millions of moviegoers thought of her as Vito Corleone’s wife. Ms. King had never been in a feature film before playing Mama Corleone in “The Godfather,” which after its release that month became one of the most acclaimed movies of all time. She was in “Godfather II” as well and had a smattering of other television and film credits, but music was always her passion. She had been singing since she was a teenager and had a breakthrough in 1964 with her much-admired version of “A Taste of Honey,” the title track of an album she released that year. It brought her a Grammy nomination for best new artist; the award went to the Beatles. “She has, she says, a four-octave range,” John S. Wilson wrote of her in The New York Times in 1970, “and she draws on all its resources as the basis for a vocal style that is an astounding mélange of humming, singing and vocalizing, creating tapestries of supple sounds that float in the air, that slither sinuously around a melody, that dip down to some visceral foundation or soar softly off into the stratosphere as an ethereal mutter.” Ms. King knew she made a distinctive impression, especially on the younger fans she began noticing in her audiences after “The Godfather.” “I am an experience,” she told The Chicago Tribune in 1990. “Very individual. Kids like that.” Ms. King died on March 22 in Palm Springs, Calif., where she lived, having stopped performing in 2000 and receded from the public eye. She was 87. The cause was non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the Riverside County Coroner’s Office said. Her death had not drawn wide public notice until The Washington Post reported it this week. Maria Grazia Morgana Messina was born on June 4, 1930, in Pleasantville, N.Y., and grew up in Upper Manhattan. Her parents, Ignatius and Isadora Messina, had emigrated from Catania, on Sicily. Her father was an ice and coal merchant who played classical guitar and gave her a grounding in opera and symphonic music. Her mother imparted traditional Sicilian songs. She began singing in hospitals and U.S.O. clubs as a teenager and by 16 had graduated to nightclubs, some less reputable than others, adopting the name Morgana King because her mother did not want her to use the family name for performing. At 17 she married Tony Fruscella, a jazz trumpeter with a drug problem; she often found herself supporting their daughter, Graysan. “I took care of my kid when my husband was stoned out of his bird,” she told JazzTimes in 2016. She and Mr. Fruscella, who died in 1969, divorced in 1956, just as Ms. King’s career was beginning to ascend. She had begun recording albums — her 1950s releases included “For You, for Me, for Evermore” and “Morgana King Sings the Blues” — and she had started to get better bookings. By 1959 she was the featured vocalist at Carnegie Hall in front of “eight feminine jazz instrumentalists” (as The New York Times put it) for a concert called “Jazz Female.” In the early 1960s she married the trombonist Willie Dennis. They toured Brazil with Buddy Rich’s band, an experience that opened new musical worlds for her. “I’m Sicilian,” she told The Times in 1970, “and I suddenly realized that all my life I’d been hearing bossa nova, because it’s very Moorish, very Arabic, like the music my mother sang around the house. I feel that music.” Her “A Taste of Honey” album led to television appearances on “The Andy Williams Show” and others, but she did not have much time to enjoy the success: In 1965 Mr. Dennis was killed in a car crash in Central Park. She reduced her musical activities considerably for three years, and when she did work, her music had a new layer to it. “Since Willie’s death, there’s a new dimension whenever I sing,” she said in 1970. “There are heavy spiritual feelings now.” In 1969 she was severely injured in a car crash of her own — “broken ribs, torn stomach, crushed left side, reconstructed mouth,” she told The Washington Post in 1981. She moved to Palm Springs, hoping the climate would aid in her lengthy rehabilitation. In an audio commentary with a DVD release of “The Godfather,” Francis Ford Coppola, the film’s director, said of the casting of Ms. King, “She just made me think of the kind of handsome, authentically Sicilian woman that would be his wife” — referring to Vito Corleone, who was played by Marlon Brando. The role of Mama Corleone is relatively small. But Ms. King found that the three weeks she initially was told she would be needed for filming stretched longer, as she was sought out on all matters Sicilian because of her heritage. “I knew the culture, the psychology,” she once said. “I felt more like a technical adviser on the film, the way everyone kept turning to me with questions.” In the second “Godfather” movie, her character dies, but the scene of the viewing of the body exceeded the limits of what she was willing to do. “I wouldn’t go in the casket,” she told The Boston Globe in 1977. “ ‘What lines can I speak from a casket?’ I asked them. So the person you saw in the coffin was the mother of the director, Francis Ford Coppola.” Ms. King’s daughter died in 2008. She is survived by a grandson. Her albums ranged across the musical landscape. William Buchanan of The Boston Globe called “It’s a Quiet Thing,” released in 1966, “a mood piece album all the way, with Miss King really digging deeply into the heart of the song and the meaning of the lyrics.” The next year, “I Know How It Feels to Be Lonely” delved into pop hits of the day like Donovan’s “Sunshine Superman” and the Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby.” Her later albums included “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” (1991) and “This Is Always” (1994). In her 1981 interview with The Post, Ms. King summed up her approach to musical choices, and life in general. “I am my own captain and this is my ship,” she said. “I don’t want anybody messing with my steering wheel or my navigation.”",The New York Times
2018,Moroccan Pop Star Faces 3rd Rape Charge in France,"PARIS — A Moroccan pop star already facing several accusations of sexual assault has been charged again this week with rape on the French Riviera, after a woman accused him of assaulting her in his hotel room. The singer, Saad Lamjarred, who is popular across the Arab world, was arrested on Sunday in Gassin, near the seaside resort of Saint-Tropez, famous for its jet-setters and night life. After he was questioned by the police in Saint-Tropez, on Tuesday he was charged with rape and placed under formal investigation, according to the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan, a French town farther north in the Var region. Pierre Arpaia, a deputy prosecutor in Draguignan, said that the singer had been released on bail of 150,000 euros, or about $175,000, and that he had been barred from leaving France without authorization. Mr. Arpaia would not comment on the specifics of the case but said in an email that the plaintiff, who has not been publicly identified, was a 28-year-old woman. The singer denied the accusation “with energy and confidence,” according to Jean-Marc Fédida, his lawyer in France. According to Mr. Fédida, Mr. Lamjarred said that he met the woman on Saturday night at a nightclub in Saint-Tropez, and that they had a consensual sexual encounter at his hotel. “Mr. Lamjarred disputes that there was any violence toward the plaintiff, and no material evidence taken from the plaintiff’s body or from Mr. Lamjarred’s supports the theory of a rape,” Mr. Fédida said in an email. “Mr. Lamjarred’s room, which the plaintiff came to voluntarily, was thoroughly searched by the investigators, who found no traces of a struggle.” Mr. Lamjarred was already facing two separate accusations of rape in France, both of which prompted the opening of an investigation. Neither case has yet gone to trial. In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers. Defendants placed under formal investigation do not automatically stand trial; magistrates can drop cases they believe show insufficient evidence. In the first of those cases, a Frenchwoman named Laura Prioul accused Mr. Lamjarred of beating and raping her in a Paris hotel room in 2016, after meeting her at a nightclub. Ms. Prioul, who recorded and released a video last year about her accusations, was vilified online and faced threats and smears from fans of Mr. Lamjarred. Ms. Prioul’s case led another woman to go public with her own accusations of rape. The Franco-Moroccan woman, who has not been identified by the French authorities, accused Mr. Lamjarred of hitting and raping her in 2015 at an apartment in Casablanca. In 2010, Mr. Lamjarred was also accused of rape in New York, but left the United States while he was free on bail. A prosecutor dropped those charges in 2016, after the American accuser withdrew her complaint, reportedly after reaching a settlement in a lawsuit. The son of a Moroccan musician and a Moroccan actress, Mr. Lamjarred rose to fame in 2007, after finishing second place on the talent show “Super Star,” a Lebanese version of “American Idol.” Several of the video clips for his songs have amassed hundreds of millions of views online. A French-language song he released in July, “Casablanca,” has more than 56 million views on YouTube. Mr. Lamjarred has received support from King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who, according to the Moroccan state news agency, helped him hire a legal team after Ms. Prioul’s complaint. Mr. Lamjarred recently made a brief appearance in a music video by RedOne, a Moroccan producer and songwriter, in which an array of the country’s artists wished the king a happy birthday.",The New York Times
2018,"Morris Park, Bronx: Where Congeniality Flourishes ","Living in The area has welcomed waves of newcomers, but still looks much as it did when the boxer Jake LaMotta and the TV host Regis Philbin lived there. 10 Photos View Slide Show › Three years ago, Orlando Marrero was newly divorced and taking comfort at Patricia’s of Morris Park, a maternal hug of an Italian restaurant in this eastern Bronx neighborhood. Mr. Marrero, who is now 54 and works as a marketing specialist for a health insurance company, mentioned to his server that he was looking for a new home. She introduced him to a real estate agent who found him a convertible two-bedroom apartment in a brick multifamily house on Hone Avenue, for $1,150 a month. An older Italian-American man across the street welcomed him with coffee and cake. “There is no barrier here to where you come from or who you are,” said Mr. Marrero, who was born in the Bronx and raised in Puerto Rico, and had previously lived on Pelham Parkway, just north of the neighborhood. Referring to his new block, he said, “I think I’m the only Hispanic here, and I’ve been very well received.” Morris Park is a place where village-like congeniality continues to flourish among urban asphalt and flux. First the site of a racetrack and airfield, then an Italian-American stronghold with pizza and calamari to rival that of Arthur Avenue, Morris Park presents changing faces in a largely unvarying streetscape.

By The New York Times The neighborhood has lost its Orthodox Jewish community and acquired large Latino and Albanian ones, but looks much as it did when Bronx sons like the boxer Jake LaMotta and the television host Regis Philbin lived in the area. Brick and vinyl-sided houses are scaled for one to three families, and the many independent shops lining Morris Park Avenue include Italian bakeries and candy stores that might have served the great-grandparents of today’s young customers. Carla Diana, 50, an industrial designer and educator, moved to Morris Park from the Fordham area of the Bronx when she was seven. Impressed with the openness, compared to her old neighborhood, she recalled exclaiming to her parents, “I never thought we would move to the country!” (Today, Morris Park’s population density is about 18,400 per square mile, compared with 32,500 in the Bronx overall.) Two years ago, after decades away, Ms. Diana returned to live in her family home with her year-old son, Massimo. She found Morris Park much the same. If, as a child, she hadn’t fully appreciated the convenience of the Bronx Zoo (a seven-minute bike ride away), she certainly did now. However, it was when Ms. Diana recently put her home on the market, after being offered a job in Michigan, that she was struck with another realization: The Bronx is hot. A crowd of potential buyers came to see the two-bedroom apartment in a 1960s co-op building on Paulding Avenue, for which she was asking $160,000. “I got an offer right away,” she said, accepting $145,000 because she was handling the transaction herself and didn’t have to pay a realtors’ fee. “It just seems that the Bronx’s moment has arrived,” she said. Morris Park is well positioned to capitalize on interest in the borough. Residents not only have subway and express bus service, but expect to have their own Metro-North station on the New Haven line in the next several years. Last month, a ferry route opened between Clason Point Park, about 20 minutes away, and Manhattan. The neighborhood has also been long rated among the safest in New York. According to city data that is updated weekly, crime in the 49th precinct, which includes Morris Park, has declined 8.5 percent in the last two years and 27.6 percent in the last eight. In the year ending on July 31, the incident rate was 11.5 per 1,000 residents, a lower figure than in the 26th precinct of Manhattan, which includes Morningside Heights, or the 17th precinct, which includes Murray Hill. “A lot of people are trying to get in,” said John DeFonzo, the manager of the Morris Park Avenue outpost of Patsy’s Pizzeria, who lives in the attached brick house on Rhinelander Avenue that his grandmother bought 70 years ago when she arrived from Italy. “In the last year and a half, when I see new faces, nine out of 10 times they’re new people living in the neighborhood.” But Albert D’Angelo, who headed the Morris Park Community Association before becoming chair of Bronx Community Board 11 in July, sees a fine line between opportunity and opportunism. Some outside investors, he noted, are turning multifamily homes into illegal boardinghouses, crowding the community, exacerbating traffic problems and straining resources. Mom-and-pop stores prevail because a shortage of parking spots has discouraged larger businesses from opening on the commercial stretches of Morris Park Avenue and Williamsbridge Road, Mr. D’Angelo added. Congestion is one reason the community association is fighting a city plan to narrow vehicle lanes and introduce bicycle lanes on Morris Park Avenue. He predicted that the new Metro-North station will help solidify Morris Park’s reputation as a desirable middle-class district. “There are very, very few neighborhoods in the city where you can grow up, go to school, go to college and hang out with friends that can be your friends for 40 to 50 years,” he said. Morris Park’s boundaries are Pelham Parkway to the north, Bassett Avenue to the east, Sacket Avenue to the south and White Plains Road to the west, Mr. D’Angelo said, which means that Kwame Ture (born Stokely Carmichael), the civil rights leader who lived in Van Nest, an area that many in Morris Park consider annexed, can be claimed as a denizen. The neighborhood has grocery stores, big-chain pharmacies, a public library, the bowling alley where “Men in Black 3” was filmed and a renowned Columbus Day parade. The blocklong Loreto Playground has basketball, handball and bocce courts. Anchoring the neighborhood’s northeastern corner is a hospital complex that includes the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Jacobi Medical Center, and supplies employment for many in the community. Joseph Vega, an agent with Pantiga Group, one of several real estate companies on Morris Park Avenue, described a “sellers’ market,” with more and more clients coming “big time” from Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Inventory is low, he said, especially for two- to three-family properties. As of Aug. 26, Realtor.com had 24 active listings in Morris Park. (The narrowly defined map showed the western boundary at Bronxdale Avenue and northwest boundary at Neill Avenue.) The least expensive of the properties, which were pulled from multiple sources, was a brick two-bedroom house built in 1956 listed at $435,000; the most expensive was a five-unit 1920 building listed at $1.8 million. The average sales price of 37 single and multifamily houses sold in Morris Park between Feb. 28 and Aug. 10 was $608,482. Among this group, the median sales price was $580,000. Mr. Vega estimated that home prices, in general, have increased 25 to 30 percent in the last two years. Morris Park’s low, sober buildings and wide avenues are a backdrop for vibrant multicultural signifiers: halal food vendors, hookah lounges, barber shops offering fades and straight shaves, and at least one bakery window filled with wedding cakes. Not much is green here, but then nature explodes, painting the sky at sunset. Morris Park has several public, charter and parochial schools. P.S. 108 enrolls about 570 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. On 2016-17 state tests, 46 percent met standards in English versus 31 percent citywide; 51 percent met standards in math versus 31 percent citywide. P.S. 83 enrolls about 1,760 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. On state tests, 39 percent met standards in English versus 33 percent citywide; 37 percent met standards in math versus 27 percent citywide. Icahn Charter School 2 enrolls 324 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Each grade has two classes with 18 students per class. St. Clare of Assisi School enrolls about 500 students in prekindergarten through eighth grade. The annual tuition per student is $6,000. Our Saviour Lutheran School enrolls about 185 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The annual tuition per student ranges from $5,000 in elementary school to $6,500 in high school. The neighborhood is served by the 5 subway train, which stops at the Morris Park and Bronx Park East stations, as well as the 2 train, which stops at Bronx Park East. The BxM10 express bus runs along Eastchester Road and Morris Park Avenue to Manhattan. In 1889, John Albert Morris, a New Jersey businessman, bought 188 acres next to a swamp to build a thoroughbred racecourse called Morris Park. The operation closed in 1904, nine years after Morris’s death. The track was taken over by automobile racers and also used as the first formal airfield. A 1910 fire destroyed much of the property.

2018,Mortar Fire Punctures Afghan President’s Speech on Peace,"KABUL, Afghanistan — More than two dozen mortar rounds landed in Kabul on Tuesday as the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, was addressing the nation under the trees of his palace about a cease-fire he had offered the Taliban. Flanked by his security ministers after finishing a prayer to mark the beginning of the Muslim festival Eid al-Adha, Mr. Ghani braved the shells exploding nearby to once again plead for an end to the 17-year war, which is taking lives in record numbers. His ministers craned their necks to peer up at the sound of each blast. “We announced a cease-fire, but conditioned on the fact that it would be a mutual cease-fire,” Mr. Ghani said. “This was the consensus of our people.” Although the mortar shelling was claimed by the Islamic State, hopes that the Taliban would reciprocate in a cease-fire dimmed on Tuesday as the group remained quiet on Mr. Ghani’s offer. There was, however, movement on peace efforts on a different front. Russia announced on Tuesday that it had invited all parties to the conflict to talks in Moscow on Sept. 4. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said that the Taliban had accepted the invitation, although a spokesman for the group said he had to consult its leadership before commenting. Any Moscow talks involving the Taliban would be a remarkable display of Russia’s recent warming to a group it has labeled as terrorist since 2003. Coming at a time when American officials are trying to build momentum around separate talks in Qatar, the announcement also raises questions as to whether Russia is seeking to disrupt American leadership. Hashmat Stanikzai, a spokesman for the Kabul police, said that around 9 a.m. militants had started firing from the district behind the presidential palace. Many shells landed near the palace, with some reports suggesting that two even landed inside. Others struck the diplomatic quarter, which contains Western embassies and the NATO coalition’s headquarters. Afghan forces blocked the areas where the militants were holed up, even using helicopters to target them. Local news media reports suggested that the militants had used a truck to transport mortars to fire on different parts of the city. Nine insurgents fired around 30 mortar rounds from two locations, according to a statement from Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell, spokesman for the NATO coalition in Afghanistan, who added that Afghan forces had dealt with the threat quickly. Four of the nine insurgents were killed, he said, and the other five surrendered to Afghan forces. It is rare that assailants in such attacks are detained. Afghan officials hoped the men in their custody, as well as the communication equipment seized, will help bring clarity to whether recent urban attacks claimed by the Islamic State can be traced to the same networks that operate for the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, the lethal arm of the insurgency. “If they are thinking the rocket attack will keep Afghans down, they are wrong,” Mr. Ghani said. Since a rare, overlapping cease-fire two months ago brought Afghans a brief bit of quiet, Mr. Ghani and his international partners have been working toward a second lull in the fighting around Eid al-Adha. When the Taliban assaulted a major city just 90 miles from Kabul, it put the fate of a second cease-fire in limbo. Mr. Ghani went ahead with an offer, but this time conditioned it on the group’s reciprocating. The Taliban have remained quiet on the offer. Instead, they abducted more than 100 Afghans on the highway in the north of the country on Monday. By the end of the day, they had released most, except for 21 who were reportedly members of security or government forces. In private, Taliban officials said they were unlikely to declare a cease-fire this time, largely because it had been difficult to contain their fighters during the last one. Many of them even traveled to cities and took part in celebrations, suggesting to the Afghan government that the insurgents are as tired of the war as officials are. In recent months, a strong push has been made to end the Afghan conflict by getting the Taliban to the negotiating table. American diplomats met with Taliban officials in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, where the insurgents keep a political office, in the hopes of shifting their long-held condition that they would negotiate only with the Americans first. Now, Moscow is increasing its own involvement, and it has reached out to the Taliban. “We have never concealed the fact that we maintain contacts with Taliban members — they are part of Afghan society,” said Mr. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, at news conference in the southern Russian resort city of Sochi. The Taliban rejected a similar invitation to talks in April 2017, according to Russian news media reports. New Moscow talks would include a number of nearby countries like India, Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The United States was also invited, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Heidi Hattenbach, a State Department spokeswoman, said the Americans would not attend. “As a matter of principle, we support Afghan-owned and led initiatives to advance a peace settlement in Afghanistan,” she said. Officially, Russia has given various reasons for its outreach in Afghanistan. They include protecting Russian citizens there — although it is unclear there are many — and countering the spread of Islamic militancy. But President Vladimir V. Putin has made no secret that he wants to challenge American leadership wherever possible in the world. Russian efforts have included supporting political organizations in Europe critical of the United States, dispatching the country’s military to Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, and stepping up its involvement in the Mideast and Africa. Barnett R. Rubin, a scholar of Afghanistan and former senior adviser to the United States and the United Nations, said in an interview that Russia’s move was consistent with its efforts “to help broker a peace agreement that does not include a permanent U.S. military presence” in Afghanistan. Still, Mr. Rubin said, the Americans should consider taking part in a Russian dialogue. “The U.S. should get inside the process and help the Afghan government shape it,” he said. “We shouldn’t start a rivalry over who should be in charge of the peace process.” Afghanistan remains a sensitive domestic issue for Russia given the Moscow’s disastrous intervention there in 1979, leading to a protracted war that it ultimately lost. That debacle helped speed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Senior Afghan officials said if the Taliban take a seat at the table along with representatives of countries in the region, it would be a significant development. The officials said their government’s decision to attend would probably depend on whether the Taliban would agree to formally meet with representatives of the Afghan government during the talks. The Taliban have long refused to sit down with Afghan officials in any public manner.",The New York Times
2018,"Moshe Mizrahi, 86, Who Won an Oscar for ‘Madame Rosa,’ Is Dead","Moshe Mizrahi, an Israeli director whose “Madame Rosa,” one of several movies he made in France, won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 1978, died on Aug. 3 at a hospital in Tel Aviv. He was 86. His son, Daniel, said the cause was pneumonia. Mr. Mizrahi, who was born to a Jewish family in Egypt that emigrated to Palestine when he was a teenager, did not begin directing feature films until 1970. But he started impressively: Two films that he shot in Israel — “I Love You Rosa” (1972) and “The House on Chelouche Street” (1973) — were nominated for Oscars for best foreign-language film. (Neither won.) So when Mr. Mizrahi asked Simone Signoret, the French star known for her smoldering sexuality, to star in “Madame Rosa” as an aging former prostitute and Holocaust survivor — a frumpy character with frizzy hair who wears unappealing makeup and dresses — she put aside her resistance to the part because she admired his work. “I tried to persuade him to do something else,” Ms. Signoret told The New York Times in 1978, recalling Mr. Mizrahi’s approach to her. “I tried to buy him, but he bought me.” Citing his upbringing in Egypt and Palestine (and later Israel), she added: “He’s immersed in the two cultures, Arab and Jews. They’re his two loves. I surrendered.” Based on a novel by Romain Gary, the movie follows Rosa as she raises the children of other prostitutes in a small apartment in Paris and grows particularly close to Momo, an Arab boy. The Los Angeles Times film critic Charles Champlin wrote in his review that “one of the most impressive aspects of Mizrahi’s skills as a filmmaker is his ability to convey the real world at its most sordid without creating a movie that is itself sordid, or nearly so.” Ms. Signoret won the César Award, France’s equivalent of the Oscar, for best actress. And “Madame Rosa” remains the only winner of the Oscar for best foreign-language film directed by an Israeli (although it counted as France’s victory). As an Israeli, Mr. Mizrahi felt ambivalence about winning the award because his film was made in France, and one of the four films it beat was “Operation Thunderbolt,” Israel’s entry in the category. “Because I won for a non-Israeli film, it made me ‘not one of us,’ ” he told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz in 2009. “Outside Israel, the Oscar did help, but of course that fades over the years.” He would continue to make films in Israel, France and elsewhere. He directed “Every Time We Say Goodbye” (1986), with Tom Hanks, on location in Jerusalem, and “War and Love” (1985), a Holocaust story set in Poland that featured Kyra Sedgwick, was filmed in Hungary. Moshe Mizrahi was born on Sept. 5, 1931, in Alexandria, Egypt, to Haim Victor and Dora (Behar) Mizrahi. His father, a store clerk, died of an abscess when Moshe was 9, forcing his mother to do housework to support her four children. Entranced by movies early on, Moshe saw as many as seven films a week in Alexandria, mostly from the United States. “At some point,” he told Haaretz, “I discovered there was such a thing as directors, and that they were the magicians who made the movies.” Daniel Mizrahi said in an email that his father “credited growing up in cosmopolitan Alexandria as being decisive in establishing his humanistic and pluralistic worldview, and he was a firm believer and supporter of the possibility of good will and understanding between Arabs and Jews.” The family left for Palestine in 1946. During the Israeli war for independence two years later, Mr. Mizrahi’s brother, Shabtay, was killed in an Egyptian bombing raid. Mr. Mizrahi did not stay there for long. In 1950, courtesy of a Jewish group that paid his way, he moved to Paris, where he satiated himself on films noir and westerns and hoped one day to work in America. Returning to Israel, he worked as a newspaper reporter and wrote Hebrew movie subtitles before heading back to Paris in 1958. There he found work in television and was eventually hired by Telfrance Films, where he rose to production manager and producer. When he turned to film directing, he used some of his family’s lore in telling cinematic stories. For “I Love You Rosa,” he drew on his maternal great-grandmother’s experience for a story set in the late 19th century about a young widow (Michal Bat-Adam) obliged by Old Testament law to marry her brother-in-law, who is only 11 years old. In his review for The New York Times, A. H. Weiler wrote that Mr. Mizrahi “sticks to his theme and avoids religious or distaff proselytizing,” adding, “He is a refreshingly professional craftsman who allows a viewer his own judgments.” A year later Mr. Mizrahi directed “The House on Chelouche Street,” whose story echoed his own: A widow moves her family from Alexandria to Israel before its independence. Those films helped establish his reputation for creating strong matriarchal characters. “I was raised in a Mediterranean type of culture where women were predominant,” he told The Los Angeles Times in 1982. “The households were filled with powerful mother figures — grandmothers, aunts and all the rest. It was the kind of background that helped me feel my material thematically.” He married Ms. Bat-Adam, a screenwriter, actress and director, in 1980, after she had appeared in five of his pictures. They continued to collaborate for many years, she as an actor in his films and he as an actor and producer in some of hers. In “Rachel’s Man” (1975), Ms. Bat-Adam played the title role, while Mr. Mizrahi directed and wrote the script with his former wife, Rachel Fabian. In addition to his son and wife, Mr. Mizrahi is survived by his daughter, Orit Mizrahi; two sisters, Silka Erez and Lea Pinto; and two grandchildren. Mr. Mizrahi continued to direct until 2007, when he made “Weekend in the Galilee” in Israel, his first film in 11 years — and also his final one. He had been teaching cinema at Tel Aviv University since the 1990s, which occupied him as directing assignments became scarce because of financing and other issues, his son said. But Mr. Mizrahi suggested that he had fallen out of step both with Israeli and with French culture — and it did not seem to bother him. “Anyway, if you’ve directed quite a few movies,” he said in remarks cited by Tablet magazine after his death, “it’s not that big of a tragedy if you never direct another one.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Motherhood and the Back-to-College Blues,"Summer is ending, and all my baby birds are leaving the nest. Ms. Renkl is a contributing opinion writer. NASHVILLE — It is dusk in August, and the voices of the robins fill the air. All spring I watched these birds building their nests and raising their nestlings, those sharp-eyed babies making harsh, monosyllabic demands. All summer I watched the robins teaching their fledglings to flutter up from the ground and into the tree limbs, or at least the inner branches of a dense shrub, as quickly as they could. Now the young birds have grown past the one-note call of desperation they made under their parents’ care. All the robins, young and old, are singing the same song now. At twilight it is a mournful sound — something less than heartbreaking, something more than melancholy. Or maybe this edging sadness has nothing to do with robins. Summer is ending, and my younger sons — the only two still at home even part of the year — are heading back to college, and I can hardly bear to see them go. When they were younger, the connection I felt to them was visceral. During those early days of carrying a child — in my body or in my arms — I came to feel like one-half of a symbiotic relationship. It’s been years since then, but motherhood still thrums within me like a pulse. My youngest child is 20 years old and 6 feet tall, but still I catch myself swaying whenever I’m standing in a long line, soothing the ghost baby fussing in my arms. I haven’t forgotten how exhausting it was to be the parent of young children or how often I was frustrated by the close rooms and constricted plans of our lives in those days. I haven’t forgotten how repetitive that life was, how often I felt unable to draw a deep breath. And yet I sometimes let myself imagine what a gift it would be to start all over again with this man, with these children, to go back to the beginning and feel less restless this time, less eager to hurry my babies along. Why did I spend so much time watching for the next milestone when the next milestone never meant the freedom I expected? There will be years and years to sleep, I know now, but only the briefest weeks in which to smell a baby’s skin as he nestles into my neck on dark, sleepless nights. Summer is ending, and my own nest is emptying again. Metaphors of loss are everywhere. The limping old dog who was my sons’ perfect childhood companion died last month, and now I take my after-supper walk alone. I watch the sun dropping behind my neighbors’ houses, and I listen to the robins’ song. It’s too late for most songbirds and too early for owls. The robins have the stage to themselves in this margin between light and dark. Summer is going, and daylight is going, and now my children are on their way again as well. Already they are packing the minivan we bought when the youngest was in second grade. The house that all summer has been loud with life will fall almost silent. My husband and I will drive them to their dorms on the other side of the state, take a few minutes to unload, and then turn around to head home again. I will lift a hand as we pull out, though I know they will already be turning away, turning toward their beckoning new life. It has been years since the last time they looked back after leaving a car. This is what we raised them for, and I’m grateful for their independence, for the interesting lives they’re making for themselves in the world. I will adjust again to the quiet, and be grateful for the freedom it brings. In a few days they will call to check in; their brother will drop by; they’ll be home for the holidays before I know it. While they are away, I’ll be living my own full and busy life, just as they are living theirs. And yet this sense of loss keeps murmuring in my ear. It says nothing so simple as “Your children are leaving, and you will miss them terribly.” Instead it hisses, “All the things you learned and all the ways you changed as their mother — what will you do with them now?” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,Mount Fuji’s Got Mail. A Bone-Rattling Bulldozer Ride Brings It Down.,"Japan Dispatch ATOP MOUNT FUJI, Japan — Search for “Top of Mt. Fuji” on Instagram, and you’ll discover thousands of posts documenting the hikers who have made it here to the summit of Japan’s best-known volcano. But for many trekkers, sharing photographs of their feat on social media is way too new school. Instead, they would rather send an old-fashioned piece of snail mail from the tiny post office atop Mount Fuji, one of the few places in Japan where a postmark is still more coveted than another “like” on Instagram or Facebook. “We thought it would have more meaning,” Toshiyuki Kasahara, 43, said of the postcards that he and his two sons, Yushun, 8, and Seijin, 6, deposited in the mailbox to send home after arriving on the summit last month. “It’s a substantial record that they can keep.” Mount Fuji — or “Fuji-san” in Japanese — is considered sacred in Japan, and its snow-capped visage has been memorialized in countless artworks, making it an international symbol of the country. About 300,000 people climb it each year, including school groups, corporate teams and tourists from around the globe. Making it to the top of Japan’s highest mountain takes a vigorous four- to six-hour hike, but it does not require much special equipment or skill. For those who reach the summit, one reward is the view: a breathtaking sweep of the mountain and the clouds skittering above; many climbers time their arrival to coincide with the sunrise. The post office atop Mount Fuji is also a popular attraction for many summiteers, and close to 18,000 people visited it last summer, sending nearly 97,000 pieces of mail. At a time when many post offices across Japan are experiencing steep declines in mail volume, the mountain’s outpost thrives. But transporting all that mail down the 12,388-foot peak takes considerable effort, even in the absence of rain, sleet or snow. That’s where the bulldozer comes in — or, technically speaking, a close cousin of one. Two or three days a week during the 40-day span of the summer hiking season that ends in August, a weather-beaten crawler tractor (a bulldozer minus the blade in front) trundles up the 2.8 mile Fujinomiya trail to collect crates of postcards and letters. After descending 4,500 feet in altitude, the tractor hands off the mail to a regular postal van. Officials at Japan Post, which runs more than 24,000 post offices across the country, said the Mount Fuji branch collected about 12.1 million yen, or nearly $109,000, in revenue last year, but declined to say how much it costs to service this vertiginous route. With digital messages and social media supplanting regular mail, the postal unit of Japan Post lost nearly ¥385 billion, or about $3.5 billion, last year. (The banking and insurance divisions were profitable.) Motohiko Matsumi, postmaster of the Mount Fuji branch, said as long as hikers climbed the mountain, the postal service would want to keep open its most famous, and highest elevation, branch. “The people who climb Fuji-san want to make a special memory,” Mr. Matsumi said. “So we are not so much worried about this particular post office.” To experience firsthand what’s involved in delivering mail from the summit, I climbed aboard the tractor last month for the bone clattering four-hour round trip up and down the mountain. The company that operates the vehicle, Fuji Concrete Service, not only collects the mail, but also delivers food and drinks six days a week to the huts along the path where hikers stop for meals, bathroom breaks and naps. The crawler tractor rumbling up Mt. Fuji. Motoko Rich/The New York Times Embarking from what is known as the new fifth station — which is where the paved road ends, at 7,900 feet, and hikers often start their climbs after arriving by car or bus — workers piled a front-loading bucket and the back of the tractor with boxes of curry mix, potato chips, soybean bars, beer and vitamin drinks, as well as toilet paper, plastic spoons and tanks of gas. Also on board were 10 people being shuttled up the mountain, some clinging to metal railings and others sitting on dirt-encrusted jump seats. The passengers included staff members for the various rest huts, as well as a doctor and medical student heading to a four-day stint at a first aid clinic. Yuichi Furuya, 52, has driven the tractor six days a week for the last seven years. When he fired up the deafening engine and nosed the machine onto the rock-strewn dirt path, it quickly became apparent that his view from the glass-enclosed cab was completely blocked by the overfilled bucket in front. But this hardly slowed him down. Dressed in a tan jumpsuit and popping tabs of chewing gum into his mouth, Mr. Furuya deftly switched the gears of his machine as if he were playing a musical instrument. Dirt spewed from beneath the tractor, blowing into every crevice of the cab. “About 40 percent of the route is inside my head,” he said. The rest he navigated by peering down at the ground and watching the trail embankments. Through hairpin turns and jostling that threatened to dislodge internal organs, Mr. Furuya occasionally made a call on his cellphone and flipped through delivery invoices with one hand while keeping his left hand on the gearshift. All the while, he listened to a soundtrack of electronic dance music, his fingers tapping out rhythms on his right thigh. “I am young at heart,” said Mr. Furuya. “I listen to music that calms me down.” The rattling finally stopped when we reached the mountaintop and crowded into the tiny post office. Two workers were at the counter selling postcards, stamps and certificates to hikers who wanted an official commemoration of their climb. Postal workers take shifts lasting five to seven days at the Mount Fuji branch, sleeping on bunk beds in back. While the mountaintop post office is certainly one of the more unique branches, the postal logo is ubiquitous throughout the country. Japan’s postal system got its start in the 1870s, when the country was establishing its national identity, and the post office was often the first institution of the central government to open in villages. Over time, the postal system, which also offered popular banking services, grew to be the world’s largest financial institution and a source of political patronage for Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party. In 2005, the prime minister at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, staked his leadership on a plan to privatize the postal system. Although he managed to get a bill through Parliament, the plan has since been modified to maintain significant government involvement, particularly in mail delivery. The government retains a significant stake in the holding company, which also has banking and insurance arms. With so many post offices operating in communities where the population is declining dramatically, the network of 24,000 branches is “absolutely not sustainable,” said Patricia L. Maclachlan, the author of a history of Japan’s post office. In comparison, the United States, about 26 times larger than Japan by area, has some 31,000 post offices. The post office atop Mount Fuji opened in 1906. Originally, postal workers carried the mail down the trail by foot. The crawler tractor has been making the trek for the last half-century. On the day I made the trip last month, Mr. Furuya and an assistant collected 11 plastic crates, each holding about 2,000 pieces of mail, and loaded them into the back of the bulldozer. Maj. Craig Gulledge, 34, who serves in the United States Air Force at the Yokota Air Base on the fringes of Tokyo, had made the climb in under four hours and dropped by the post office to send postcards to his wife, parents and a nephew and niece. “No one ever sends mail anymore,” Major Gulledge said. “So this is a classic cheap souvenir.”",The New York Times
2018,"Moving From Buyer to Seller, Major League Soccer Tests a New Revenue Stream","You can learn a lot about a soccer league from its transfer spending. According to FIFA, the top six soccer associations by net transfer spending in 2017 were England, Germany, China, France, Italy and the United States. Five of those make perfect sense. The Premier League, the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A are four of the top five leagues in the world, where clubs regularly pay huge sums to acquire the best players. China’s Super League recently tried to spend its way — some say recklessly — into becoming a global player. And then there is Major League Soccer. Despite its stated ambitions, M.L.S. is not considered one of the best leagues in the world. For years it pursued an attention-grabbing, star-centered strategy similar to China’s: in 2017, American teams bought $69 million worth of players last year while bringing in only $2.4 million in sales. But with a wave of youthful South American signings and a slick-dribbling Canadian teenager, M.L.S. is trying to change all that and produce some much-desired cash for a league that continues to lose money each year. The player who may shift the narrative is Alphonso Davies, 17, a left-footed winger who has already made 63 appearances for the Vancouver Whitecaps, the first when he was only 15. Davies was born to Liberian parents in a Ghanaian refugee camp and emigrated to Canada at age 5. Groomed in the Whitecaps’ academy and the pride of a recent M.L.S. focus on so-called homegrown players, Davies was poised to emerge as the league’s brightest young star until last week, when Vancouver and the league announced that he would join the German powerhouse Bayern Munich in January in the most lucrative player sale in M.L.S. history. Bayern paid the Whitecaps $13.5 million for Davies’s rights, an amount that could rise to $22 million if he meets certain performance criteria in Germany. In his first game after the deal was announced, Davies had two goals and two assists, at least temporarily quieting those who don’t believe a 17-year-old M.L.S. player can hack it in the Bundesliga. Davies said in an interview on Monday that consistent minutes in M.L.S. at a young age had been vital to his development, even as he acknowledged “everyone’s fear of going to the big club and not making it.” For now, Davies, like most young players making such a move, is focusing on the upside. “If you go there at a young age,” he said, “you can develop way more than if you go there already in your prime.” Davies’s transfer fee is the highest ever paid for a M.L.S. player, surpassing — even at its low end — the reported $10 million that the Spanish club Villarreal paid for striker Jozy Altidore. That was a decade ago. The endurance of that milestone has been something of an indictment of M.L.S. player development, of the league’s inability to produce players who bigger clubs in bigger leagues wanted to buy. As worldwide transfer spending more than doubled in just the past five years, it had seemed strange that, even by accident, M.L.S.’s significant investments in player development had not developed and sold a player who some club, somewhere would have valued more than Villarreal did Altidore. M.L.S. began requiring its teams to establish academies in 2006, and each team now oversees hundreds of youth players, sometimes down to 7-year-olds. Most have dedicated training facilities and residency programs. M.L.S. has supported these academies with initiatives like paying to send youth coaches to learn at France’s famed Clairefontaine training center. It is the maturing of this system that, the league hopes, will eventually produce more players like Davies. Bob Lenarduzzi, the president of the Whitecaps, said his team tried to mimic European clubs like Ajax and Lyon, who are successful because of the players they develop, not the players they buy. It quickly became clear that Davies would not be a Whitecap for life. “With someone like him it is just the natural evolution,” Lenarduzzi said. Selling homegrown stars could completely change the economics for M.L.S., as there aren’t many opportunities for immediate revenue growth. The league’s national television deal, which runs through 2022, pays each team an average of just $4 million annually, and most teams receive even less for their local television rights. Only so many fans can be packed into a stadium. Ticket prices rise only incrementally, even in a city like Atlanta, the site of Wednesday’s M.L.S. All-Star Game, where demand is high and crowds of 70,000-plus are not uncommon. On the other hand, the average M.L.S. academy costs about $3 million to operate annually, meaning the sale of even a single player like Davies can cover years of developing more players just like him. Also, the $13.5 million the Whitecaps received for Davis is $5 million more than their total player payroll for the season. It is more than the total season salary of all but four teams. For M.L.S., producing players in the fashion of Portugal’s Primeira Liga, the Netherlands’s Eredivisie, or the Brazilian or Argentine leagues would be a major achievement. There is one major stumbling block. Generally, when players sign their first professional contract or are transferred abroad, the club or clubs that trained them must be compensated out of the fee by the signing club. That means that besides paying Vancouver for Davies, Bayern Munich also paid a much smaller fee to the Edmonton Strikers, where Davies played before joining Vancouver. While these so-called solidarity payments — meant to encourage even the tiniest clubs to aid in the development of top players — are how things work for clubs in Canada and the rest of the world, it’s not how things work in the United States. The United States Soccer Federation doesn’t enforce transfer compensation or solidarity payments. The reason is complicated and involves a two-decade-old lawsuit and child labor laws, but the upshot is that American clubs do not receive compensation simply for training a young player. They must sign them to their first professional contract. M.L.S. supports bringing the United States in line with the rest of the world, according to Commissioner Don Garber. “M.L.S. is a winner in the solidarity payment world, and I have no objections to it,” he told reporters on Monday. There are other positive signs besides Davies, though, that M.L.S. is becoming more ingrained into the broader world soccer economic system. Already this year, Jack Harrison, Cyle Larin and Érick Torres have transferred abroad in deals worth more than $1 million each, and Red Bulls midfielder Tyler Adams seems likely to join them soon. But it is deals like the Davies move, and possible transfers involving players like Josef Martinez, the league’s leading scorer, that have the potential to diversify the league’s economics, and pave the way for even more investment. Garber certainly thinks so. In an interview with ESPN before the All-Star Game, he noted his owners’ multimillion-dollar investments in player development, and he called the Davies transfer a “transformational moment” for M.L.S. “I think we suffer a bit in the eyes of the international football community,” Garber said. “I don’t think we get the respect we deserve in terms of what’s happening here. I think they’re intrigued. I think that they do respect what’s happening on the commercial side. But I don’t there’s enough respect for what’s happening on the competitive side.”",The New York Times
2018,"Moving On, Part 1 — With Claire Bidwell Smith","As our final season draws to a close, the Sugars have been thinking about what it means to say goodbye and let go. In this first episode of our two-part series on moving on, the Sugars and Claire Bidwell Smith answer two letters from people struggling to move past their grief after the death of their loved ones. The first letter comes from a woman who recently discovered that her best childhood friend died by suicide. In the wake of the news, she spent hours pouring over letters from her friend, and realized that there were signs of trouble early in life. Now she’s haunted by the fact that she failed to intervene years ago. “I keep ruminating on how Alejandra might have killed herself and where she was when she did it,” she writes. “I feel so much guilt from my complacency.” A second letter writer, who calls herself “Wracked by Guilt,” feels similarly about the death of her mother. “How do I get over the sickening feeling that I played a role in my mom’s death?” she asks. “How is it possible for me to stop trying to place blame and simply accept the situation?” Claire Bidwell Smith is a licensed therapist specializing in grief, and the author of several books, including “The Rules of Inheritance.” She writes and speaks about grief regularly, and offers online grief support in addition to her private practice.

I’ve married and had children with two addicts,” begins a letter signed by “Mommy Messed Up.” Over the years, her second husband began to withdraw and stash money inside of old bottles. Now Mommy Messed Up is ready to end their toxic relationship. The only problem is she’ll have to disrupt her children’s lives for a second time. “I’m fine with breaking my own heart,” she writes. “But how do I break my boys’ hearts?” In this second part of our series on moving on, the Sugars discuss how we can release ourselves from our past mistakes. Dr. Harriet Lerner drops in to answer a second letter from a woman who is haunted by her abortion, a decision she laments now that she’s experiencing early menopause.

2018,"Mueller Asks for Jail Time for Papadopoulos, Saying He Repeatedly Lied","The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has told a judge that a former adviser to the Trump campaign repeatedly lied about his contacts with Russian operatives and “caused damage” to the government’s inquiry. In a document filed Friday evening, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said that the former adviser, George Papadopoulos, misled investigators about the “timing, extent and nature” of the meetings. During one of them, Mr. Papadopoulos was told that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” The memo said that Mr. Papadopoulos’s attempts to mislead the F.B.I. had a significant effect on the open investigation into whether President Trump or his advisers coordinated with Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. “The defendant lied in order to conceal his contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries during the campaign,” the memo said. It happened early in the investigation “when key investigative decisions, including who to interview and when, were being made.” In particular, the document said that during a January 2017 interview with the F.B.I., Mr. Papadopoulos misled agents about his conversations with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who investigators believe reached out to Mr. Papadopoulos on behalf of the Russian government. “The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States,” the memo said. “The government understands that the professor left the United States on Feb. 11, 2017, and he has not returned to the United States since then.” Mr. Mueller’s memo recommended that Mr. Papadopoulos be imprisoned for up to six months; a judge is expected to issue a ruling on his sentence in early September. Thomas M. Breen and Robert W. Stanley, lawyers for Mr. Papadopoulos, said in a statement that they were “not able to comment on the government’s sentencing submission at this time.” During a meeting in spring 2016, shortly after he was named as an adviser to the Trump campaign, Mr. Papadopoulos was told by Professor Mifsud that the Russians had thousands of incriminating emails about Mrs. Clinton. It has long been a mystery whether Mr. Papadopoulos told anyone inside the Trump campaign about the Russian dirt, and the document filed Friday does not answer the question. Mr. Papadopoulos did, however, make reference to the Russian dirt during a conversation he had in a London bar in May 2016 with the senior Australian diplomat in Britain. The Australians passed the information to the United States and, in July 2016, the F.B.I. opened its investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Papadopoulos was arrested in July 2017 after he arrived in the United States from a vacation in Europe. He was questioned for several days and eventually pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. Mr. Mueller’s memo said Mr. Papadopoulos did not provide “substantial assistance” to the investigation, and that “much of the information provided by the defendant came only after the government confronted him with his own emails, text messages, internet search history and other information it had obtained via search warrants and subpoenas.” Thirty-two people have been charged by Mr. Mueller’s office since it took over the investigation in May 2017. The only defendant to be sentenced so far is the lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to making false statements about his conversations with a former Trump campaign official. In April, a judge sentenced him to 30 days in prison. Mr. Mueller’s office has not yet filed a sentencing memo in the case of Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. He pleaded guilty in December to making false statements to investigators about his contacts with the Russian ambassador and agreed to cooperate with the authorities. Mr. Flynn was scheduled to be sentenced this year, but that has been delayed, suggesting that he is still cooperating with the government.",The New York Times
2018,Mueller Passes 3 Cases Focused on Illicit Foreign Lobbying to Prosecutors in New York,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has referred three investigations into possible illicit foreign lobbying by Washington insiders to federal prosecutors in New York who are already handling the case against President Trump’s former lawyer, according to multiple people familiar with the cases. The cases cut across party lines, focusing on both powerful Democratic and Republican players in Washington, including one whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly targeted — the Democratic superlobbyist Tony Podesta. The cases are unlikely to provoke an outburst from Mr. Trump similar to the one he unleashed in April after prosecutors raided the home and office of Michael D. Cohen, then the president’s lawyer. But these cases do represent a challenge to Washington’s elite, many of whom have earned rich paydays lobbying for foreign interests. They also tie into the special counsel investigation of Mr. Trump: All three cases are linked to Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, whose trial on financial fraud charges began Tuesday in Alexandria, Va. Mr. Manafort earned tens of millions of dollars lobbying for Ukrainian politicians with ties to Russia, and he drew other Washington lobbyists and lawyers into the work. Now, all three cases being taken on by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan are examining whether those lobbyists failed to register as foreign agents, as is required by law, and how they were paid, said people familiar with the investigations. The cases involve Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama before leaving to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; former Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who joined Mercury Public Affairs, a lobbying firm, after leaving Congress; and Tony Podesta, a high-powered Washington lobbyist whose brother, John D. Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The three men have not been charged with any crimes, those familiar with the cases said. But the cases have progressed far enough that Mr. Mueller’s team had subpoenaed or requested documents from all three firms, starting last year, and his investigators had interviewed Mr. Craig, people familiar with the investigations said. All three men were informed in the late winter or early spring that Mr. Mueller was handing off the investigations to prosecutors in New York, the people briefed on the cases said. The referrals were first reported by CNN, and none of the men could immediately be reached for comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller, declined to comment. A former senior official at the Justice Department, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation, said that the special counsel has referred some cases under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to the federal prosecutors in Manhattan and to other parts of the Justice Department. The former official would not provide details of the cases. But the official did say that prosecutors in the department’s criminal and national security divisions periodically meet with Mr. Mueller’s team to discuss whether cases are appropriate targets for the special counsel, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether any associates of Mr. Trump aided the Russian campaign. Mr. Mueller’s specific mandate appeared to be why prosecutors in New York took on the investigation into Mr. Cohen, who helped Mr. Trump navigate thorny personal and business dilemmas in more than a decade serving as his fixer. Mr. Cohen now finds himself under legal scrutiny on issues far afield for Russian election interference, such as his ownership of taxi medallions and whether he paid hush money to a pornographic film star who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mueller and others at the Justice Department appear to have determined that the examination of lobbying for foreign powers, like Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, could fall beyond the special counsel’s mandate. But it was unclear why the jurisdiction for the lobbying cases was changed. Unlike Mr. Cohen’s business, which was based in New York, the lobbying took place in Washington, though payments for the work from overseas most likely flowed through New York. Under American law, anyone who lobbies or conducts public relations on behalf of a foreign interest in the United States must register with the Justice Department. The law carries stiff penalties, including up to five years in prison. But it had rarely been enforced, and thus widely ignored, until recently. Now, it appears to have become a weapon for prosecutors. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, was facing possible charges of violating the law over his secret work for the Turkey during the campaign before he agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller last year. The three cases referred to prosecutors in New York appear to be another sign that the Justice Department intends to more strenuously enforce the law. Yet, as the cases show, such investigations often confront prosecutors with interlaced financial arrangements that can prove difficult to untangle. The Podesta Group, Mr. Podesta’s firm; Mercury Public Affairs, where Mr. Weber worked; and Skadden, where Mr. Craig practiced, were all recruited by Mr. Manafort to assist with his work in Ukraine on behalf of that country’s president at the time, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was considered a Kremlin ally. But two of the firms — the Podesta Group and Mercury Public Affairs — were retained through a nonprofit group in Brussels, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine. The nonprofit was directed by Mr. Manafort, and the firms lobbied in Washington on behalf of the nonprofit for what Mr. Manafort billed as Mr. Yanukovych’s efforts to move Ukraine into the West. The firms were paid more than $1.1 million each for the work. But they did not initially register to lobby with the Justice Department as foreign agents. Doing so would have required them to make detailed disclosures of the lobbying activity they had performed. They instead had filed less detailed lobbying reports with Congress, based at least partly on misleading characterizations that Mr. Manafort’s deputy later admitted to providing. The firms retroactively registered to lobby for foreigners with the Justice Department in 2017. The Podesta Group collapsed in part because of the scrutiny from the case. Skadden was hired directly by Mr. Yanukovych’s government to analyze the prosecution of one of Mr. Yanukovych’s leading political rivals, former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Led by Mr. Craig, the firm published a report in 2012 that was used — mostly without success — to try to allay concerns about Mr. Yanukovych’s leadership in Washington. Skadden also did not register its activity under lobbying rules, despite Mr. Craig himself being involved in promoting the report to journalists and members of Congress — activity that experts said should have prompted registration requirements. Mr. Craig left Skadden in April as investigators made inquiries about his work with Mr. Manafort. While the departure was presented as voluntary, a lawyer familiar with the situation said that Mr. Craig was forced out. Mr. Mueller’s team repeatedly referenced the work of the firms in his filings in Mr. Manafort’s case, including accusing Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy of using an offshore account to “funnel $4 million to pay for the report” from Skadden. Mr. Mueller’s team also indicted a Skadden lawyer who worked with Mr. Manafort on the report. The lawyer pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his communications with a former Trump campaign aide, and has already completed a jail sentence.",The New York Times
2018,Mueller’s Digging Exposes Culture of Foreign Lobbying and Its Big Paydays,"WASHINGTON — The mandate given to Robert S. Mueller III and his team was broad: to investigate not just Russian election interference but also any related crimes they might unearth. So when this group of seasoned prosecutors began rooting around Washington, they pounced on a ripe target — lobbyists taking millions of dollars from foreign governments. At the trial of Paul Manafort, an unflattering picture has emerged of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants from both political parties winning big paydays for work on behalf of a Kremlin-aligned former Ukrainian strongman. Some spent the money on cars and homes, prosecutors said, and a jacket made of ostrich for Mr. Manafort. The vigor with which Mr. Mueller has investigated the flows of foreign money from Ukraine, Turkey and other countries into Washington could be as much a part of his legacy as special counsel as whatever he discovers about possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign or presidential obstruction of justice. The Manafort case is part of a broader inquiry into the lucrative work done on behalf of the former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and Mr. Mueller has handed some elements of the investigation to prosecutors in Manhattan. Beyond the special counsel’s office, the Justice Department has also recently been pursuing foreign influence cases with greater urgency. All of this has prompted lobbyists to hunt for advice about how to comply with laws governing that sphere, long viewed as toothless. “The phone rings much more often with this question than it did two years ago,” said Tom Spulak, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm who advises on lobbying compliance. Over the past year, Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department have pursued numerous cases both under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, and related to foreign influence operations more broadly. FARA prosecutions were once almost unheard-of, according to a Justice Department inspector general report: For nearly a half-century, from 1966 until 2015, the department pursued only seven. In addition to Mr. Manafort, the recent cases include the special counsel’s indictments against Russians who disseminated stolen information and used disinformation to influence how Americans perceived the candidates in the 2016 presidential election. Also among them is the complaint against Maria Butina, the Russian accused of acting as a foreign agent and plotting to gain Republican support for pro-Russia policies. Even the case against Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, included allegations that he had lied to investigators about lobbying work he did on behalf of the Turkish government. Taken together, the cases shine a light on foreign influence operations that have become deeply embedded in Washington, and the culture of lobbyists who get rich helping their foreign clients affect how laws and policies are made in the capital. To be sure, federal law enforcement officials took a more aggressive stance on foreign influence before the appointment of Mr. Mueller. They increased enforcement of FARA as part of a move to do “everything we could to meet the counterintelligence mission of the Justice Department,” said David Laufman, the former chief of the department’s counterintelligence and export control section who oversaw the enforcement surge. The department began to write more aggressively worded letters to lobbyists seeking information about their work. After receiving letters of inquiry from the Justice Department last year, four Russian news media companies, including RIA Global and RTTV America, have registered as agents of a foreign principal under FARA. In retaliation, Russia passed a law to designate international news media companies as foreign agents. But because of the intense attention it has drawn, Mr. Mueller’s investigation shined a spotlight on the waves of foreign money washing through American politics in a way that the other Justice Department efforts never could. The number of new primary FARA registrations grew to 102 in 2017 from 69 in 2016, and was on pace to rise again in 2018, according to figures from the Justice Department published by the law firm Holland & Knight. The first days of Mr. Manafort’s trial offered exhibit after exhibit of this lavish world, beginning with his extravagant purchases, including cars, Persian rugs and expensive clothes. It also revealed bipartisan largess. One 2014 email presented in court on Tuesday showed the Democratic consultant Thomas A. Devine proposing a “day rate” of $10,000 to do work in Ukraine on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned former president who was a longtime client of Mr. Manafort. “You would need to make the travel arrangements, and transfer the $50G before the trip,” he wrote to Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s partner for the Ukraine work. “If you want me to come on Monday and leave Thursday it would be $40G.” Mr. Devine, who is known as Tad, went on to become the chief strategist for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist. In addition to the investigations of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, who pleaded guilty in February to numerous financial crimes and became a cooperating witness in the special counsel investigation, Mr. Mueller’s team pursued three other investigations into lawyers and lobbyists who did work in Ukraine. The cases involve Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama before leaving to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Tony Podesta, an influential Washington lobbyist whose brother, John D. Podesta, was chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign; and former Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who joined the lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs after leaving Congress. None have been charged with any crimes. Mr. Mueller’s referral of those cases several months ago to federal prosecutors in New York was revealed in news reports on Tuesday. Whereas the public once thought of the Justice Department’s counterintelligence mission as primarily trying to catch foreign spies seeking to obtain government secrets, the department has made clear in a recent cybercrimes report and congressional testimony that influence has become as great a threat. The government’s case against Ms. Butina, which was not brought under FARA, could be a template for future prosecutions, said a former Justice Department official, who predicted they could spread to influence peddling from Eastern Europe and China as well as Russia. Ms. Butina was charged with acting as a Russian agent, a more serious crime than a typical FARA violation. The charge allowed prosecutors to impanel a grand jury and issue subpoenas to subjects of investigations — tools not available in most FARA inquiries. Bills to give the Justice Department the power to compel records in FARA cases are sitting in Congress but have gained little traction. The lobbying industry last faced intense scrutiny after the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff was caught up in a sprawling corruption and bribery investigation. He went to jail in 2006 for fraud. That case put a temporary chill on the industry, and some Washington lobbyists made up for lost business with foreign clients trying to exert influence on American politicians. The Justice Department will continue to pursue foreign influence operations inside the United States, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, vowed last month. Russian schemes to influence the presidential election, he said, are “just one tree in a growing forest.”",The New York Times
2018,Mughal Men Ruled South Asia — and One Man Was Ruled by a Woman,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. EMPRESS The Astonishing Reign of Nur Jahan By Ruby Lal Illustrated. 308 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95. The story of Nur Jahan, the daughter of Persian immigrants who became queen of the Mughal Empire, approaches the status of legend in South Asia. She has been the subject of comic books, a Bollywood movie and innumerable tall tales. What has been missing is an accessible biography that explains how a woman came to amass power and influence in a patriarchal dynasty that ruled much of what is now India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Ruby Lal sets out to fill in some of those gaps with “Empress: The Astonishing Reign of Nur Jahan.” A professor of South Asian studies at Emory University, Lal collects and catalogs the thin, contradictory and unreliable records of Nur’s life, which began in 1577 and ended in 1645. She relies heavily on court records, the autobiography left behind by Nur’s second husband, the emperor Jahangir, and contemporaneous accounts by foreign diplomats and others. Nur herself, named “light of the world” by Jahangir, left behind little in her own voice, which has long frustrated historians, Lal included. Despite the spare record she has to work with, Lal paints richly detailed scenes from Nur’s life. About her first wedding, to Ali Quli, a Mughal official, Lal writes, “The mansion would have been festooned inside and out with lace, tinsel, strings of bells and colorful embroidered fringes; the trees in the courtyard would be hung with garlands of marigolds and jasmine.” Lal ably guides the reader through the rich drama and intrigue of Nur’s later life with Jahangir, whom she married after Quli was killed. Though she was just one of Jahangir’s wives, she became his favorite and was often by his side as he traveled his empire. We know that she held a special position, unlike that of any other woman, because she issued royal decrees and coins were minted bearing her name, something done for sovereigns, not their wives. Her rise created tensions in the court and the royal family, which were documented by foreign envoys, who often wrote with disdain about Nur’s influence over Jahangir and described him as an alcoholic. Britain’s ambassador, Thomas Roe, concluded that Nur “governs him, and wynds him up at her pleasure.” While filled with particulars, “Empress” can, at times, feel disjointed as Lal breezes over some of the larger developments and changes in Nur’s life. While she dwells extensively on the milieu of the harem, she spends little time explaining what led Jahangir to elevate Nur above his other wives. The most we get is the assumption that Jahangir was impressed by Nur’s generosity and good will and that she had added influence because her father and brother held important positions at court. Later Lal abruptly reveals that Nur concluded that Shah Jahan, a son of Jahangir by one of his other wives and widely considered the heir apparent, was a threat to her power, even though she had earlier written that Nur and Shah Jahan were getting on well. The failure to comment on the intervening period is an odd oversight, given that this familial rift would become very consequential when Shah Jahan rebelled against and succeeded his father. Lal is clearly constrained by the paucity of the material she has to work with. But she seems too reluctant to draw inferences and make analytical deductions. She might not be able to say definitely what transpired between Nur and Jahangir or Nur and Shah Jahan, but she could tell readers what she thinks is the most credible and plausible account. Still, Lal has done a service to readers interested in the Mughal period and the many forgotten or poorly remembered women of Indian history. She has helped shine a little light on an enigmatic character many think they know but few actually understand.",The New York Times
2018,Mulvaney Looks to Weaken Oversight of Military Lending,"The Trump administration is planning to suspend routine examinations of lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act, which was devised to protect military service members and their families from financial fraud, predatory loans and credit card gouging, according to internal agency documents. Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, intends to scrap the use of so-called supervisory examinations of lenders, arguing that such proactive oversight is not explicitly laid out in the legislation, the main consumer measure protecting active-duty service members, according to a two-page draft of the change. The agency’s move comes as a Senate committee prepares to vote on the nomination of Kathleen Kraninger to succeed Mr. Mulvaney as chief of the consumer watchdog, which is responsible for protecting consumers from financial abuse. The proposal surprised advocates for military families, who have urged the government to use its powers to crack down harder on unscrupulous lenders. The consumer bureau conducted dozens of investigations into payday and other lenders during the Obama administration without any significant legal opposition, and no lenders are currently challenging its oversight based on the law, according to administration officials. The bureau will still bring individual cases against lenders who are found to charge in excess of the annual interest rate cap of 36 percent mandated under the law, and continue to supervise lenders under other statutes. But it will scrap supervisory examinations, which are the most powerful tool for proactively uncovering abuses and patterns of illegal practices by companies suspected of wrongdoing, former consumer bureau enforcement officials said. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney, said the rule change came from a top-to-bottom review of the bureau’s procedures geared at curtailing what the administration, along with lending industry executives, have criticized as overly aggressive enforcement by the bureau’s first director, Richard Cordray. The agency’s supervisory exams have been critical in uncovering previous instances of wrongdoing and led to several of its biggest fines. In 2014, the bureau fined one of the largest payday lenders in the country, Ace Cash Express, $10 million after determining the company, based in Texas, steered low-income borrowers, including those in the military, into a succession of financially damaging high-interest loans. Instead of conducting examinations that might find similar patterns, the bureau will now rely solely on complaints funneled through its website, hotlines, the military and people who believe they have been victims of abuse. “It will go from a proactive system to something that is completely reactive,” said Christopher L. Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who served in a variety of top positions at the bureau from 2012 to 2016. “Over time, it is going to have a real impact on the lives of these people who devote their lives to the service of our country.” Mr. Czwartacki, who said Mr. Mulvaney is urging Congress to quickly pass a measure that would give him the power to resume supervisory examinations, noted that the agency’s goal was “to protect service members, but we also have to abide by the law.” “We are 100 percent committed to seeing that happens,” he added. But the banking and payday industries are likely to fight any such legislation and quick passage is anything but guaranteed. The industry has been lobbying to loosen enforcement for years, in part by trying to exempt an array of fees from the 36 percent rate cap. Industry groups, while expressing broad support for protecting members of the military from financial predators, have tried to chip away at restrictions imposed on lenders under the law. In June 2017, the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade association that represents banks, sent the Defense Department a lengthy list of changes to the law that would benefit its membership. “It’s basically about greed,” said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who is a co-sponsor of the bill. “The industry has been pushing for this because they want to make more than 36 percent — I mean, who needs more than 36 percent to make a profit?” “We need a constant and systematic review of these companies — not just individual cases brought by the executive officer of a unit, reporting one incident at a time,” said Mr. Reed, who observed financial abuses firsthand when he served as a company commander in the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, N.C. in the 1970s. Many service members enter the military in their late teens or early 20s with little credit history, and are often targeted by auto loan financiers, credit card companies and retail stores that hide high financing costs behind low down payments and short-term teaser rates. Over the last decade, Department of Defense studies have found that military members, their families and veterans are four times as likely to be targeted by unscrupulous lenders. Money woes, the studies also found, are a significant source of morale problems among service members. Since its creation under the Obama administration in 2011, the consumer agency has returned more than $130 million to service members, veterans and their families and handled more than 72,000 complaints per year, according to the agency. The first head of the board’s service member lending division was Holly Petraeus, who worked with the Pentagon to close loopholes in the law, resulting in a slate of rules changes in 2015 that restricted the amounts and rates of auto, payday and tax-refund anticipation loans. “When I drive down the strip outside a military installation and count 20 fast-cash lenders in less than four miles, that’s not a convenience, that’s a problem,” she said in a news release at the time. Earlier versions of this article misidentified the Consumer Bankers Association. It is a trade association that represents only banks, and not auto, payday and other retail lenders.",The New York Times
2018,Murder Mystery in Ancient Monastery Reverberates in Coptic Church,"WADI NATRUN, Egypt — Christian monks living in the solitude of Egypt’s deserts have always faced the threat of attack from outside. In the early centuries, they built drawbridges and windowless towers to repel marauding nomads. More recently, barricades and armed police officers ring the monasteries to guard against Islamic State suicide bombers, who target Christians. But now, to the shock of the faithful, it turns out that danger also lurks inside the monastery walls. The death of Bishop Epiphanius, the abbot of the fourth century Monastery of St. Macarius, last month has set off an ecclesiastical murder mystery worthy of a Dan Brown novel. More than a simple whodunit, the case has exposed simmering tensions of a theological, if not personal, nature in an influential corner of the Coptic Orthodox Church. A scholar of ancient manuscripts with a frizzy beard typical of Orthodox clerics, Bishop Epiphanius, 64, was found at dawn on July 29, lying in a pool of blood outside his monastic cell. Injuries to his skull indicated he had been hit on the head with a blunt object, possibly a pipe, the police said. The intrigue deepened days later when the Coptic authorities defrocked a younger monk, Isaiah, who had clashed with the bishop in the weeks before his death. Soon after that, another monk, Faltaous, 33, slashed his wrists and tried to throw himself from a four-story building. Faltaous was hospitalized and treated for his injuries. On Aug. 11, Egyptian prosecutors said Isaiah had been charged with the murder of Bishop Epiphanius after confessing to the crime. Two days later they said that they had detained Faltaous for questioning. Beyond that, not much more is known. The police have sealed off the monastery to interview 150 people, including staff members, monks and bishops. The Coptic patriarch, Pope Tawadros II, has issued orders apparently aimed at tightening discipline among the country’s 2,000 monks. New admissions to the monasteries have been suspended for a year; monks require permission to travel outside; and they have been given a month to close their Facebook and Twitter accounts. “In the light of what has happened, we need to give the monks their space and let them return to a focus on monastic life,” said Archbishop Angaelos of London, a prominent Coptic leader, speaking by phone. “They do not need social media accounts.” The bishop’s death has become the subject of feverish news coverage in Egypt and, in private among Copts, much speculation. What would motivate two monks to plot against their bishop in a remote desert monastery, presuming they are the culprits? Possibilities floated by Coptic officials, experts and monks in interviews include theological disputes, financial misdeeds and even talk that the two monks had a close personal relationship they feared might be exposed. One senior church official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that, during a search of the monastery, Egyptian police officers had uncovered compromising material on a cellphone that could offer a motive. He declined to provide details. “This is about more than just the death of a bishop,” said Ishak Ibrahim, an expert on the Coptic faith at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an advocacy group. “It’s a shock to the entire church.” At the nearby Monastery of St. Pishoy, seven miles from the scene of the bishop’s death, monks declined to comment, citing orders from superiors. But like everyone else they were eager to discuss the rumors privately. “It’s is very unfortunate. I see these as two men who have been touched by the tongue of Satan,” said a deacon providing a tour of the monastery. But he added, “we cannot judge them.” “All of us are weak,” the deacon went on. “And if they repent, Jesus will accept them.” Acknowledging the intense public interest, church leaders say they are trying to strike a balance between transparency and allowing the investigation to take its course. “It’s difficult because this is entirely unprecedented,” said Archbishop Angaelos, who had a brief moment of global celebrity when he delivered a prayer at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. “We need to pray for wisdom, peace and an exposition of the truth.” The Copts, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt’s roughly 97 million people, are more usually in the headlines as victims of persecution. Since December 2016, Islamic State suicide bombers have attacked several Coptic churches. In May 2017 gunmen killed at least 28 Coptic pilgrims as they traveled by bus to a monastery. A failed suicide bombing at a church in northern Cairo last weekend left just the bomber dead but was a reminder of the threat. Bishop Epiphanius’s death opens a window on the cloistered world of the desert monasteries, which have enjoyed a major revival in the past 50 years and have come to occupy a central place in the Coptic faith. Four of the most famous monasteries are in Wadi Natrun, north of Cairo, an area once known for the salty lakes that provide the sodium carbonate used by the ancient Egyptians for mummification, now dotted with farmland reclaimed from the desert. Bishop Epiphanius was viewed as a senior figure in a reformist Coptic movement that has been gaining momentum inside the church under Pope Tawadros, said Samuel Tadros, an expert on the Coptic Church at the Hudson Institute in Washington. His appointment, in May, to position in which he would work as a liaison with the Catholic Church was seen as a sign that conservatives were being sidelined, Mr. Tadros said. But Bishop Epiphanius also faced opposition inside his own monastery. Earlier this summer the bishop considered expelling Isaiah, the monk now in custody, for “ongoing violations,” Archbishop Angaelos said. “He had been given several opportunities to cease what he was doing and to stop those violations,” said the archbishop, declining to specify the nature of the violations. After the bishop was killed, the monk was defrocked, he added. The scandal has shattered the image of the monks as austere servants of God, devoted to prayer and solitude, that is held by many Copts in Egypt. Some question whether Copts are ready for the full truth about why the bishop was killed. “I had no doubt from the beginning that this was personal,” said Mr. Tadros, citing confidential information he received from Coptic officials about the case. “Yet the ramifications of the murder are likely to continue with the church for a long time.” Pope Tawadros promised in a sermon last week that the truth about the murder would come out, no matter how difficult. The last time Coptic clerics featured in such a sensational story in Egypt was in 2001, when a tabloid newspaper published pictures of a naked former monk with a woman, alongside accusations that the man had had sex with the woman on a church altar. The article led to rowdy street protests by outraged Copts who saw it as a slur on their faith. The uproar led to the newspaper being pulled from news stands, and its publisher being sentenced to three years in prison. For now, the St. Macarius monastery is closed to outsiders. One monk, speaking by phone from the monastery, said the police were still questioning witnesses. He acknowledged there had been tensions before the killing, but declined to say much more. “We have problems,” he said. “But we do not want to speak about it.”",The New York Times
2018,Muslim Job Applicant Who Refused Handshake Wins Discrimination Case in Sweden,"STOCKHOLM — A Muslim woman in Sweden who said she was discriminated against in a job interview for refusing to shake hands on religious grounds has been awarded financial compensation by a labor court. The woman, Farah Alhajeh, 24, was interviewing for a job as an interpreter at Semantix, a language services company, in the city of Uppsala, north of Stockholm, in May 2016, when the person conducting the interview offered to introduce her to a male boss. Ms. Alhajeh said she placed her hand on her heart as a greeting, smiled, and explained that she avoided physical contact because she was Muslim. She was shown to the elevator. “It was like a punch in the face,” Ms. Alhajeh, who was born in Sweden, said by telephone from her home in Uppsala on Thursday, a day after the ruling. “It was the first time someone reacted, and it was a really harsh reaction.” A Swedish labor court agreed, ruling on Wednesday that the company had discriminated against Ms. Alhajeh, and ordering it to pay 40,000 kronor, or about $4,350, in compensation. The case, brought by Sweden’s equality ombudsman, raised numerous thorny issues in a country already wrestling with questions of immigration and integration. Among them: whether a female Muslim employee could refuse to shake hands as a greeting in the workplace, said Martin Mork, who leads litigation at the ombudsman’s office. Ms. Alhajeh, the labor court said in a statement, “adheres to an interpretation of Islam that prohibits handshaking with the opposite sex unless it is a close member of the family.” The court concluded that “the woman’s refusal to shake hands with people of the opposite sex is a religious manifestation that is protected under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.” But the company with which Ms. Alhajeh had interviewed argued that its staff members were required to treat men and women equally, and that it could not allow a staff member to refuse handshakes based on gender. The labor court ruled 3 to 2 on Wednesday that while the company was right to require that employees treat men and women equally, including in how they greet others, it could not require that the greeting in question involve shaking hands. What matters, they said, was consistency in how men and women were greeted. “The court struck a balance between the interest of gender equality and religious freedom in the workplace,” Mr. Mork said. But Lars Backstrom, who represented the company in the case, said the labor court’s ruling had gone against Swedish laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace because of gender. “The Muslim woman did not take the boss’s hand because he is a man,” Mr. Backstrom wrote in an email. “When it comes to employees who meet clients and other external people, it’s up to the employers to decide whether employees can manifest their religious or political affiliations.” Ms. Alhajeh said that she was pleased with the decision. She said that she greeted men and women the same way in mixed company, by bringing her hand to her chest. But if she is meeting only with women, she might shake hands, she said. “We live in a society where you have to treat women and men the same,” she said. “I know that because I am Swedish.” “I have to practice my religion in a Swedish way that’s acceptable,” she added. This is not the first time that the issue of handshakes has drawn attention and controversy in Sweden. In 2016, a Muslim member of the Green Party withdrew his candidacy for a seat in the party’s leadership after he was publicly criticized for refusing to shake hands with women, including a television journalist who was going to interview him. “I stand for equality among people,” Stefan Lofven, the prime minister, told Parliament in April 2016, according to the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. “For me, it’s the same as women and men having the same opportunities. It also means that in Sweden, we greet each other. One shakes hands with both men and women.” Mr. Mork of the ombudsman’s office acknowledged the importance of such greetings in his country. “In Sweden, one shakes hands,” he said. But, he said, “This is very much viewed under the lens of integration and gender equality.” “It has become a little bit of a symbol question for how Sweden deals with its religious minorities,” he added. The question of balancing local custom with religious freedom has also been playing out in other countries recently. In 2016, the authorities in the Swiss canton of Basel-Landschaft ruled that two Syrian boys who studied at a public school in the town of Therwil could not refuse to shake their teacher’s hand on religious grounds. Shaking a teacher’s hand before and after class is part of Switzerland’s social fabric, and the canton authorities said that parents whose children refused to obey the tradition could be fined up to 5,000 Swiss francs, or about $5,020. On the other hand, a school in Sydney, Australia, caused an uproar last year by adopting a policy allowing Muslim schoolboys to refuse to shake hands with women, as long as they instead placed a hand across their chest. And this year, France’s top administrative court ruled that an Algerian woman’s refusal to shake hands with male officials at a French naturalization ceremony was sufficient grounds for denying her citizenship.",The New York Times
2018,"Muthuvel Karunanidhi, 94, Screenwriter Turned Politician, Dies","NEW DELHI — Muthuvel Karunanidhi, who parlayed his vocation as a prolific writer of films about the downtrodden into a political career that challenged the upper caste’s hold on Indian politics, died on Aug. 7 in Chennai, India. He was 94. Doctors at Kauvery Hospital, where he died, said Mr. Karunanidhi suffered multiple organ failure after being admitted in late July. India’s longest-serving legislator, Mr. Karunanidhi was elected to the state of Tamil Nadu’s assembly 13 times, serving from 1957 until his death. He was also the state’s chief minister five times — for a total of 19 years — starting in 1969. Although his political career was concentrated in Tamil Nadu, Indian’s southernmost state, his influence was felt nationwide. When India gained independence from Britain in 1947, it was struggling to achieve coexistence between its Hindu and Muslim populations while establishing central government control. Mr. Karunanidhi instead championed federalism as the best way to unify and protect India’s multiple ethnic, linguistic and religious populations. An atheist, he challenged the monopoly that India’s upper castes had on politics and what he described as the elitism of the country’s founding party, the Indian National Congress. He promoted a caste-based quota system for government jobs and for students in government schools, as well as subsidies for the poor. His policies were soon replicated in other states across India. His positions brought him immense popularity among the lower castes. The streets of Chennai were clogged with supporters bidding a tearful goodbye to the man they called Kalaignar (Tamil for “the artist”) as his body was taken for burial. President Ram Nath Kovind of India mourned his passing on Twitter, writing, “Our country is poorer today.” Flags flew at half-staff on Wednesday, the day after his death, which was declared a national day of mourning. Tributes poured in from the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Karunanidhi played a crucial role in bringing the downtrodden people to the social mainstream by giving them political space,” said R. Rajagopalan, a Tamil journalist based in New Delhi. Mr. Karunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in the village of Thirukkuvalai in Tamil Nadu. His parents belonged to the Isai Vellalar caste, a community of musicians who play at temples and social events. The tradition was passed down for generations within his family, and he was expected to adopt it in India’s hierarchical society. But he rebelled. He became involved in politics at 14, as the country inched toward independence, when he organized a student movement in his state against the imposition of Hindi as the national language of India. The student movement was a precursor to the larger anti-Hindi protests in Tamil Nadu that Mr. Karunanidhi went on to lead in 1965. Those protests, which at times descended into riots, forced the central government to scrap plans to enforce Hindi nationally. Tamil, Mr. Karunanidhi’s mother tongue, is one of 22 languages officially recognized in India’s constitution. He went on to lead the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party in 1969, a movement that originally wanted independence for Tamil Nadu from India. Under Mr. Karunanidhi, the party scrapped its separatist demands and embraced a strong federal system to preserve India’s ethnic and linguistic differences across its many states, a system that persists today. From an early age, Mr. Karunanidhi took part in theater productions, including writing plays. He later moved into writing for the cinema. His policies were a reflection of his screenplays, many of which took as their subject the uplifting of Tamil Nadu’s most desperate citizens. His first movie, “Rajakumari,” released when he was 23, tells the story of a love affair between a princess and a poor young man. His scripts, which generally excoriated India’s upper castes while creating heroes and heroines out of the impoverished and championing secularism, were considered pioneering. “After the entry of Karunanidhi into film, Tamil cinema completely changed,” Kaviperarasu Vairamuthu, a poet, writer and lyricist, said in an interview. “He brought Tamil cinema closer to the plight of the poor.” Mr. Karunanidihi’s survivors include his wife, Dayalu Ammal, two daughters and four sons, among them his political heir apparent, M. K. Stalin. The power of cinema in Tamil Nadu has led several of the state’s most prominent actors and screenwriters to pursue political careers. One of Mr. Karunanidhi’s biggest political rivals in Tamil Nadu was the famous actress Jayalalithaa Jayaram of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, who died in 2016.",The New York Times
2018,My Armenia,"Favorite Place A poet returns to his ancestral country where, after the recent “velvet revolution,” the sense of a new era is palpable. A summer evening in Yerevan’s Republic Square.CreditCreditDanielle Villasana for The New York Times Each time I’ve come to Yerevan in the past decade the city has surprised me with its evolving elegance and cultural richness. The downtown has an energy that is a long way from the sleepy Soviet city I first visited in the 1980s. Walking the shady avenues off Republic Square on a recent visit, I found the city has become a hip place, with wine bars, microbreweries, cafes, art galleries, boutiques selling crafts and carpets, an ever-new array of restaurants, as well as upscale hotels and clothing stores. The new mood is defined by the millennial generation’s role in the velvet revolution of this past spring. After weeks of peaceful protests, the civil society has pushed from power an old regime that much of the nation viewed as dysfunctional and corrupt, representing a continuation of old Soviet mentalities. When Nikol Pashinyan, a prominent journalist, activist and former parliamentarian became prime minister on May 8, a sense of a new era enveloped the country. In June I sat in a vine-trellised courtyard restaurant and art gallery on Abovian Street with Armen Ohanyan, a young fiction writer, and Arevik Ashakharoyan, a literary agent. I was hearing Armenia’s new voices of optimism. “Soviet minds are a thing of the past,” Mr. Ohanyan said. “The new generation, born after the fall of the Soviet Union, is playing a big role in the new democracy,” Ms. Ashakharoyan said. “We are tech-savvy and have no ties to the corrupt Soviet past.” “We feel a new future,” Mr. Ohanyan added. “The reign of oligarchs is over.” Having written about Armenia for decades, their words resonated. I am a poet and nonfiction writer of Armenian ancestry and have been to Armenia five times in the past decade. My trips are often connected to my work — a translation of one of my books, a lecture tour, a symposium. I started the day grazing on a classic Armenian breakfast spread at the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan, an elegant hotel on Republic Square with fine local cuisine: bastermas (spicy, cured beef); paper-thin or thicker warm lavash; local cheeses; jams with strawberries or apricots or walnuts; thick yogurt; cherries, apricots, blackberries and melons from local orchards; fruit nectars and orange, red and brown rolls of thick grape molasses stuffed with walnuts (sujuk); and black tea from a samovar. The presentation was beautiful and the Caucasian sun poured through the windows. Like its cuisine, the country has a long, rich history. Armenia, which became an independent republic in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, is a small, landlocked nation in the southwest Caucasus, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country today is what remains of a once-ancient empire that stretched from the Mediterranean to the Caspian Sea in the first century B.C., before it was conquered by the Romans. It was the first nation to make Christianity its state religion, in 301. Conquered by Byzantines, Persians, Mongols and Seljuks, then colonized by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th century, Armenians were subject to large-scale massacres in the 19th century, during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and were the victims of what genocide scholars regard as one of the first genocides of the modern era, by the Ottoman Turkish government in 1915. (Turkey denies that the killings were genocide.) Armenia became a Soviet Republic in 1920, endured Stalin’s purges and repression, a massive earthquake in 1988 and a war with neighboring Azerbaijan in the 1990s that has flared up again in recent years over the province of Nagorno-Karabakh. By all rational odds, Armenia should not be on the map today. Having survived such a harsh history, Armenia has emerged as a democracy that cherishes the many layers of its past. Today, the capital, Yerevan — which dates to the seventh century B.C. and was founded on the walls of the Urartian city of Erebuni— is a blend of ancient culture, artisan tradition, modern architecture and high-tech, postmodern style, exemplified by the new condominiums and high-end shops on the pedestrian Northern Boulevard. On Sept. 29 and 30, Yerevan will celebrate its 2,800th anniversary, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. In the ruins of the ancient fortress on Erebuni Fortress Hill, fragments of murals with images of sacred animals evoke the late Bronze Age. The Erebuni museum has a fine collection of artifacts, including a huge wine storage container that documents Armenia’s winemaking tradition from the Bronze Age. Those amphoras prompted me to visit the Ararat Brandy Factory, an imperial monument to the Armenian passion for the grape, set on a perch overlooking Victory Bridge, which spans the Hrazdan River. I love walking the beautifully lit cavernous halls filled with Caucasian oak barrels. Ararat Brandy has been a major export for more than a century, and its velvety depths were made legendary by Winston Churchill, who drank it daily for decades. I left with a glow of delight after the brandy tasting that concludes the tour. Yerevan is a city where many avenues are named after Armenia’s great figures: the early 20th-century poet Yeghishe Charents, the fifth-century historian Movses Koranatsi, the 19th-century novelist Katchadour Abovian, the composer Komitas (1869-1935), to name a few. It’s a city of great museums, including the Matenadaran, which has a rich collection of medieval illuminated manuscripts and books in Armenian, the National Gallery and the History Museum of Armenia. I always head first for the intimate museums dedicated to major figures. The Saryan museum, for example, has two floors of works by the avant-garde landscape and modernist painter Martiros Saryan (1880-1972). In a stately stone house, the Sergei Parajanov Museum is a celebration of the great 20th-century filmmaker and visual artist’s work: mixed media collages, paintings, conceptual installations and miniature drawings on matchbooks and bottlecaps from the time he was imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for “decadent” art and homosexuality. I always get a good workout climbing the 572 steps of the Cafesjian Center for the Arts (also known as Cascade). It’s a dramatic complex rising up from the tree-shaded, cafe-abundant Tumayan Street in five monumental limestone tiers of fountains, topiary gardens and sculptures. If you tire of the climb, you can slip inside and take the escalator, and soak up one of the most important collections of modern glass in the world, as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. No one should come to Yerevan without visiting the extraordinary Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial, also known as the Tsitsernakaberd (meaning swallow’s fortress) Memorial Complex. It is situated on a hill that overlooks the city and Mount Ararat, Armenia’s national symbol, just across the border in Turkey. georgia 30 miles Dilijan National Park Avan Zoraget Dilijan Haghartsin azerbaijan Sevanavank armenia Lake Sevan turkey Areni Cave Mirhav Inn mount ararat Noravank Tatev Charents Arch Caves of Goris Geghard armenia Erebuni Museum Garni Matenadaran Cafesjian Center for the Arts armenia Saryan Museum Hrazdan River Babylon Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial Yerevan Anteb Vostan History Museum of Armenia Sherep Sergei Parajanov Museum National Gallery Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan Victory Bridge Vernissage Ararat Brandy Factory 1/2 mile By The New York Times Built of sleek gray basalt, its elegant new wing was designed by the museum’s director, Hayk Demoyan, and his wife, the designer Lucine Matevosian. The wide circular exhibit halls wind from a top floor down to a second floor. Photographic images, maps and documentary footage on various screens accompany text that explore the history of the horrific events that took the lives of more than a million Armenians in 1915. From the museum visitors walk the stone walkway to the dramatic Memorial — towering twin obelisks (a symbol of eternity) and 12 20-foot high stone pillars — to lean over a large circular area where an eternal flame burns and sacred music plays. Back in Yerevan for the evening, I dined with friends and found the cuisine more inventive than ever. Restaurants blend the traditions of the Armenian Caucasus with the Middle East as refugees from Syria and Iraq make their impact. At Sherep, one of the hottest new places, with a chic open kitchen and late-night jazz, I had mountain sorrel soup; tender stuffed grape leaves; eggplant sautéed in olive oil and rolled up with minced walnuts, dill, garlic and yogurt; and succulent baby lamb chops. At Vostan, in a beautiful old Russian-period stone building on Abovian Street, I feasted on pink, succulent, wood-grilled Lake Sevan trout. My travels frequently take me beyond Yerevan. Wherever you go in Armenia, you are journeying through an open-air museum where churches and monasteries, even a Hellenic temple, are built into the cliffs or perched at the edges of canyons or green gorges, with searing vistas framed by the ever-blue sky. Thousand-year-old lace-like carved stone crosses (khatchgars) emerge from fields of roadside poppies. Because Armenia is defined by mountains, canyons, gorges, forests, rushing streams and rivers, lakes, grassy highlands and dales, it has become a prime destination for hikers. The new Transcaucasian Trail (T.C.T.) runs from Georgia through Armenia into Azerbaijan, and offers extraordinary trails from the Dilijan National Park in the northern mountains to the caves of Goris in the south. Many trails intersect with ancient monasteries and churches. For a small country Armenia has an amazing diversity of flora and fauna; about 240 species breed in Armenia and nearly 400 move through the country, making Armenia a birder’s paradise. On a sunny morning, I headed east from Yerevan in a minivan with my superb guide, Katar Taslakyan, and a driver, Raphael Hovakimyan, whose musical selections — jazz and R&B — filled the van. About 40 minutes later, we stopped at Charents Arch, an impressive monument to Armenia’s great modern poet Yeghishe Charents (1897-1937). From there, we got a stunning view of the glistening, grassy highlands and snow-capped Mount Ararat. In another 15 minutes, we were at Garni, a beautifully proportioned Greco-Roman temple believed to have been built by King Tiridates I to the sun god Mihr. The vistas from Garni, which is perched at the lip of a gorge, are spectacular. We drove on until the conical dome of Geghardavank (the Monastery of the Spear) emerges from behind a stone wall. A Unesco World Heritage site (like many monasteries in Armenia), the medieval church was built partly out of the side of a mountain. Monks’ caves adorned with stone crosses and arches dot the cliff face. I walked into a chapel and stared at the animal carvings on the wall as light fell through the round opening in the dome, a feature in Armenian medieval churches that creates a mysterious dark light and a heightened sense of the cosmic. A stream from the mountain runs through a wall, and pilgrims and tourists pass their hands through it. At Geghard, as with most Armenian medieval churches, you enter a distinctive organic architecture, in which building and carvings flow with the contours of nature. Unlike the Gothic cathedrals of Europe, these churches are smaller in scale and designed as intimate spaces. Here, you feel the stones are speaking to you, the light grazes you. The next day we drove south from Yerevan into the fertile Ararat Valley. In June, the apricot orchards are popping with Armenia’s bright yellow national fruit and the vineyards are green. On this clear morning, Mount Ararat rose from a bank of clouds and the hot sun was mitigated by cool breezes. Farther south, in Vayots Dzor province, our van climbed the road to Noravank, a complex that includes two medieval churches, one of which was designed by the architect and artist Momik. Again, I’m blown away as monks’ caves appear in jagged red cliffs that remind me of Arizona, and the milky tan limestone of the Myrig Adzvadzeen church glistens in the sunlight against a brilliant blue sky and rising mountains. The chapel at Noravank is luminous with light pouring through the windows. Gazing out those windows to green hillsides, red cliffs, blue sky, I felt the shimmer of the sublime. Four miles from Noravank, I went from spiritual to chthonic, as I walked up the steps of a craggy cliff to the Areni cave where, in 2007, the earliest known clay amphoras (karases) — some 6,100 years old — were discovered. Armenia is considered the birthplace of winemaking. Archaeologists are still working there, and the Copper Age karases are well-displayed in the cave where they were once used. Winemaking runs deep in the Armenian vein, and the famous Areni grape with its thick skin is the source of some of the best new wines anywhere. Throughout my visit, I had various full-bodied reds that were smooth, dry and with complex flavors enhanced by Caucasian oak barrels, reminding me of some fine pinot noirs of Oregon and certain red Burgundies. Among the better-known labels are Areni, Kataro, Karas, Trinity, Zohah. After a night on the Goris River at Mirhav, a beautifully appointed inn with antique Armenian artifacts and rugs, we drove to 11,000 feet through a fantasia of chirping nightingales, swooping eagles and clouds lifting off the green valley to the world’s longest nonstop, reversible tramway in order to reach Tatev, a ninth-century monastery. As a Baroque concerto spilled through the tramway’s speakers, our glass car floated four miles above villages and ancient churches, by cliffs and grassy mountains and past gliding hawks toward the monastery, with its two conical domed churches perched at the cliff’s edge. Heading north past potato fields and farmlands, meadows of poppies and royal blue delphiniums, we drove up the western shore of Lake Sevan, one of the largest high-altitude lakes in Eurasia. Its turquoise water is a resort for bathers and fishermen, and an important source for fishing, irrigation and hydroelectric power. At a lakeside restaurant called Dzovadzots, I had a perfect whitefish soup. A half-hour north, the ninth-century Sevanavank monastery, with its two small beautiful, earth-colored churches on a peninsula, is worth the climb up the steps from the shore below. Just north of Lake Sevan, we crossed into the alpine mountain region of Tavush where streams and hiking trails wind through the lush forests of Dilijan National Park. The stunning monastery of Haghartsin is nestled on a forested mountain. The spa town of Dilijan, situated in the park, is an atmospheric place out of a Chekhov story. Its chalet-style buildings with gable-tiled roofs, open-air theater and mountain views made it a popular vacation spot for wealthy Russians in the 19th century; today it is a retreat for artists. One of the creative entrepreneur and philanthropist James Tufenkian’s four unique hotels is housed in a complex of restored 19th-century houses. From there, we drove to Avan Dzoraget, another Tufenkian hotel, beneath the mountains on the Debed River. Sleek and imaginative, and appointed with Tufenkian carpets, its spacious rooms have lovely views. The restaurant overlooking the river offers a sumptuous repertoire: sautéed local greens and onions with yogurt; smoky eggplant dip blended with tahini; spelt with wild mushrooms; a tongue-melting sou boreg (thin flat noodles layered with Armenian cheeses), chicken cooked with dried plum and pomegranate sauce; superb dry white wine. Back in Yerevan the next evening, I walked through an arch onto an old cobblestone street off bustling Amirian Street and found Anteb, a Syrian-Armenian restaurant, where we had spicy, crepe-thin lahmajuns (Armenian pizza); a piquant muhamara (walnut, pomegranate molasses and red pepper dip) that you scoop up with hot, puffy lavash; and kuftas, crisp shells of cracked wheat bursting with lamb and herbs. The next night my friend Ashot took me to Babylon, an Arabic-Iraqi restaurant where our feast included crispy boregs (phyllo dough wrapped around cheese), meatless stuffed grape leaves and the most tender lamb kebabs I’ve had outside my mother’s kitchen. I never leave Yerevan without meandering through the Vernissage, the open-air market in a park along Aram and Buzant streets where there are stalls and stalls of ceramics, folk and contemporary art, rugs, textiles, jewelry and more. I bought two small antique Caucasian kilims before I wandered back to Republic Square, where I end most evenings. At night the Square, with its monumental rosy tufa stone buildings, is lit up; the fountains spew through colored lights, music plays, people dance. It’s a nightly ritual in Yerevan in the warm-weather months — a down-home celebration to end a day, and a resilient response to the harsh history of this new nation that has emerged from an ancient civilization.",The New York Times
2018,My Article Was Censored. I Found Out Why.,"A reporter covering an art show didn’t expect to see her Times article blanked out in Qatar’s print edition. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. One Thursday morning, days after an article I had written for The New York Times’s Arts section had run, I received a message from a contact in Doha, Qatar, alerting me to a haunting image circulating the web. The image showed The Times, opened to the Culture section. But beneath the Culture heading, where my article was supposed to appear, there was instead a large, white, empty box. Most of the page was blank. I stared at the image; I had never seen a newspaper with a big blank box in place of an article. And as my eyes scrolled to the bottom of the big white box, they widened. There, in small type, was a note: “The Opinion piece, ‘A Fire Killed 32 at a New Orleans Gay Bar. This Artist Didn’t Forget,’ by by Shannon Sims, is exceptionally removed from the Doha edition of The New York Times International Edition. It is available on the web at NYTimes.com.” The note seemed strange for a variety of reasons. For one, I hadn’t written an opinion piece, but instead a reported article about an art show. There was the accidental use of “by” twice. But, above all, the note stood out because it seemed to suggest that my article had been censored. But by whom? And how? And, most important, why? The article covered a New Orleans museum show as a whole, but focused on one artist’s contribution: an exhibit exploring an overlooked, dark chapter of the history of the L.G.B.T.Q. community in New Orleans. The artist, Skylar Fein, researched the tragic killing of 32 people at a gay bar in 1973, and he recreated both the feeling of the bar and the limited — and sometimes homophobic — news coverage around it at the time. The article featured images of Mr. Fein’s exhibit and the artist shot by a local photographer, William Widmer. Though the images may be suggestive (a shirtless man, for example), they are not explicit. In fact, the article was similar in many ways to other Arts pieces that have been published in The Times, and not particularly edgy. Nevertheless, although the article appeared in print editions of The Times around the world, it was “exceptionally removed” by the printer in Doha, Qatar. Why? “It’s a perfectly reasonable question for any reader seeing a blanked out article in their newspaper,” said Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, the president of international for The New York Times Company. In his role, he oversees the Times Company’s international business. The Times partners with local printers for both the printing and the distribution of 175,000 copies of the international print edition daily. That arrangement “works perfectly well in most markets,” Mr. Dunbar-Johnson said. But there are two or three markets “where there are censorship issues,” he said. Qatar is one of them. Mr. Dunbar-Johnson also pointed to incidents of censorship — either the removal of an entire article or the removal or “blacking-out” (sometimes simply with a black permanent marker) of specific words or images in an article — in the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Pakistan in recent years. As in the case of my article, in most countries the issue is “sensitive” content. In Pakistan, though, if the local printer feels that an article will put a journalist in a life-threatening situation (some local journalists there have been killed as a result of their reporting), they will blank out an article, Mr. Dunbar-Johnson said. Recently, The Times withdrew from Thailand because, according to Mr. Dunbar-Johnson, the printer was threatening not to distribute the paper. (Times print readers in Thailand now receive papers a day or more late, shipped in from other countries.) Mr. Dunbar-Johnson said it was “with a heavy heart” that The Times must sometimes withdraw from printing in a country. And then there’s China, where The Times’s website has been blocked on the mainland for several years. Print editions are printed and shipped from Hong Kong, before going before a censorship body in mainland China that determines whether the paper will be distributed that day. (Mr. Dunbar-Johnson estimated that once a month The Times is not distributed in mainland China for this reason.) These repeated incidents bring up an important question: Is The Times self-censoring? That is: Foreseeing trouble with the local printer, does The Times choose not to run certain articles, or do editors ever decline to commission stories that they think would be too sensitive for local printers? Mr. Dunbar-Johnson is unwaveringly clear: “I must stress we never ever self-censor. We never make a decision about what goes into The New York Times based on what any government in the world says.” Instead, the local printers, following the laws or policies in the countries where they work, alter The Times, either excluding whole articles or “blocking out” the problematic phrasing or content. The Qatari printers did not respond to The Times’s requests for comment. But Qatari legislation might offer some clues. In Qatar, homosexuality is criminalized: Men can be imprisoned for years for sodomy. The law also has provisions for “inducing” a man to commit “immoral” acts. The local printers may simply be playing it safe. There is another reason to be concerned. When I saw that my article was censored, I thought of the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar will host. Heightened journalistic attention will descend upon the country. What will that mean for readers? Censorship, regardless of the reason, is a concern for observers of journalism in Qatar. Justin D. Martin, a professor of journalism at Northwestern University’s Doha campus, said he had never seen anything of this scale in Qatar. “I picked up the paper and, at first, thought it was a printing mistake,” he said. To Mr. Martin, the Qatari censorship strategy makes little sense. “Any reader can see that this is a tactless censorship, especially because The New York Times has that comment at the bottom,” he said. And many of those readers can access the same article online. “It is incredibly dumb of these governments to do this,” Mr. Dunbar-Johnson echoed, “because it just gets people to read the pieces they have taken offense to.” Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.",The New York Times
2018,My Decades on the Nazi Trail,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. One lunchtime in early 1985, I was in the cafeteria of the old Times building on West 43rd Street when a cashier called me to the phone. This had never happened before. The foreign editor was on the line with an urgent assignment: Find Josef Mengele. True, I’d made a beat of writing about Nazi war criminals. But the notorious Auschwitz doctor of death had been missing for 40 years. Now I had to interrupt my lunch? The editor, Warren Hoge, was serious. The worldwide hunt was heating up. I should get on it right away. The Times, justifiably accused of underplaying wartime revelations of the emerging Holocaust, had since become aggressive in covering, and uncovering, Nazi perpetrators, starting markedly in the 1960s. So it was with this week’s Washington announcement that a 95-year-old widower living in Queens, Jakiw Palij, had been deported for concealing his history as a Nazi guard at the Trawniki labor camp in German-occupied Poland where some 6,000 Jews were massacred in 1943. The last remaining Nazi with an active court case, he had been under investigation since 1993 and ordered expelled in 2004. But no country would take him. Germany has finally taken responsibility. I knew how difficult these cases were. As a college student on a summer abroad in 1961, I had lined up outside a Jerusalem courtroom and sat in on the trial of Adolf Eichmann. I had just joined The Times as a copy boy in 1964 when Joseph Lelyveld (later to become executive editor) followed up on a tip from the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and exposed a Queens housewife with a murderous Nazi past, Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, who had concealed her Austrian prison sentence for atrocities at the Ravensbrück concentration camp. It would take nine years to revoke her citizenship and extradite her to West Germany, where she spent almost six years on trial before being convicted of two killings at the Maidanek death camp and being sentenced to life. Released early, she died in 1999 at 79. In 1973, after a posting in West Germany, I met the former chief trial attorney for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Vincent A. Schiano, who had brought the case against Mrs. Braunsteiner Ryan, and another against a former financier of the Romanian fascist Iron Guard, Nicolae Malaxa, a California neighbor of then-Senator Richard M. Nixon. Now accused of unspecified irregularities and demoted, Mr. Schiano and his chief investigator, Anthony J. DeVito (a cousin of “The Godfather” author, Mario Puzo), resigned, alleging they had been officially undermined by government superiors who seemed bent on thwarting their Nazi cases. Immigration officials protested, but it opened the door on long-secret Cold War machinations by U.S. intelligence agencies to recruit and shelter Hitler’s top scientists and reliably anti-Communist Eastern European Nazi henchmen. Indeed, one of the 38 people on a list the government was now prodded to investigate was a renowned space medicine doctor in Texas, Hubertus Strughold, accused of conducting human-guinea-pig experiments on prisoners at Dachau. On my own tip from Mr. Wiesenthal, I had just interviewed another — Bishop Valerian D. Trifa of the Romanian Orthodox Episcopate of America outside Detroit, who had delivered the opening prayer in the U.S. Senate in 1955. Shown photos of himself in the uniform of a wartime Romanian Iron Guard student leader and anti-Semitic speeches with his name, he contradicted his statements to immigration authorities and implicated himself in a 1941 Bucharest pogrom that murdered 300 Jews in a kosher slaughterhouse. Among those outraged at The Times’s revelations was the Brooklyn Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, who won passage of the 1978 Holtzman Amendment facilitating deportation for collaborators of Nazi persecutions. It was the grounds for removing Mr. Palij this week. She was also instrumental in creating a Justice Department office of special investigations to process Nazi cases. As for Mengele, I was still searching in June 1985 when a report circulated that his remains had just turned up in Brazil. I scoffed. How convenient amid the growing manhunt. A perfect way to throw off his pursuers. Of course, it turned out to be true. Mengele had drowned in the sea off São Paulo in 1979 and been secretly buried by Nazi cronies. Clues to his longtime whereabouts had lurked in correspondence missed by investigators. Quickly, I was on my way to Brazil, where forensic tests would write a conclusive end to the story.",The New York Times
2018,My Father Staged His Suicide to Look Like a Murder,"Ties Even with answers about his sensational death, I have unresolved questions about his complicated life. I chose to sit in the overflow seating at my father’s funeral. Through a fuzzy speaker I listened as his new family eulogized a person who woke up every day with a smile on his face. His stepson wept as he declared that he considered my father, Alan Abrahamson, his real father. That was in January, when authorities believed my father had been murdered during his morning walk to meet a friend for a cup of coffee. A man and his two dogs had discovered a lifeless body in a Florida field. A single shot to the chest, and no sign of a weapon. The death made sense to no one, including the Palm Beach Gardens police department. “These things don’t happen here,” a detective told me. Six weeks later, I received a phone call. The police had determined that the bullet wound was self-inflicted. My estranged father, who woke up with a smile on his face every day, had been meticulously planning his suicide since 2009. According to a 73-page police report, he spent years researching terms like “Nembutal lethal dose” and “antifreeze poisoning” before he landed on what he must have thought was a foolproof plan: He tied a gun to a helium-filled weather balloon. A launch simulator showed that the balloon could have sailed more than 95,000 feet into the air before bursting over the Atlantic Ocean. Alan Abrahamson died alone, at age 71, beside a patch of purple weeds. The exhaustive report included details like the way his head was pointing — to the west. But it didn’t include answers to the questions that haunt me when I’m pumping gas or packing my 3-year-old’s lunch. Did he go to sleep the night before he died? What was his last thought before pulling the trigger? Was he crying? Did he die thinking I didn’t love him? The last time I saw my dad was nearly two years before he took his life. We met for dinner in New York City, where my husband, Dave, and I were living at the time. Our daughter, Nora, was 9 months old. We sat in a booth and Nora chewed on saltine crackers. When the server took our order, my dad said he would just have a cup of lentil soup. He patted his gut. “I’ve got to slim down for Ben’s wedding,” he told me. Ben was the stepson. I was relieved that it would be a quick meal because our conversations were strained. But part of me was sad, too. “Are you happy?” he asked me. I told him I was. I loved being a mom. I loved Dave. Living in a 550-square-foot studio not so much, but we were looking to leave Manhattan. I returned the question. “Oh, very much so,” he said. “We drink every night. It’s one big party!” He began to gush about his golf cart and swimming pool. The police report showed that three days after our dinner, he typed “undetectable suicide methods” into his phone. This was not the first such search. From what little my dad said about his childhood, it seemed lonely. He was largely raised by a live-in housekeeper. My father never hit me. He rarely yelled. But he was withdrawn and distant. He went to work, then came home for food and stared at the television. I thought it was us, I thought we were not enough for him. And now I think he must have been depressed. That is how depressed people behave. But my dad cried at college drop-off. He didn’t mean for me to see. I called out one final goodbye from the porch of my dorm, and when he turned around there were tears in his eyes. He wiped them away quickly. It was the first and last time I would ever see him cry. The summer I turned 21, he visited me in Santa Cruz, Calif., where I was living with friends and taking classes. He was trying to make up for lost time but it was too late. It felt awkward. We were overly polite, and ran out of things to talk about. On the last day of his trip, we went to a sunset happy hour. “This is the best part of fatherhood,” he said, raising his glass. “Being able to have a beer with your kid.” The comment stung. It stayed with me. “I don’t need another drinking buddy,” I wanted to say. “I need a dad.” He didn’t know how to be one. He himself had never been parented. It wasn’t his fault. Deep down I always understood that. He and my mother separated the following summer after 28 years of marriage. That was 2003. I chose my mom. I didn’t have to take sides, but I did. I flooded his email with hateful letters, blaming him for everything wrong in my life. “You were a terrible father,” I wrote. “I will never forgive you. I won’t go to your funeral.” Things only got worse when he remarried and developed a close relationship with his stepchildren. For them it seemed he couldn’t do enough. I spent hours staring at pictures on Facebook. The proud dad at graduation. The proud father of the bride. I wondered what made them better than me. I concluded that the difference was, he didn’t have to raise them. They were grown-ups. He could drink beers with them. But I believe he loved them very much. My anger began to lessen when I got married in 2014. I once read that a good relationship can heal old emotional wounds, and for me that proved true. We began to text and there were even occasional visits — like that time we met for lentil soup — but things were never great. I never met his family. During his murder investigation, I was interviewed as a person of interest. On Thanksgiving, his last one on earth, he sent me a message asking if I wanted to talk. “If so, I’ll call,” he wrote. I never replied. Another read: “Have so much I want to talk about. Maybe one day if you are ready.” I ignored that too. I didn’t feel like dealing with it; there was just too much to unpack. Another day. People have asked me, “Was it harder when you thought he was murdered?” And my answer is no. The suicide is harder. It is so much harder. I thought he died in his prime, a happy guy on his way to meet a friend for a coffee. And my dad knew that. He knew a homicide would be easier for us. He knew we would blame ourselves for missing the signs. He knew I would blame myself, the estranged daughter who had not called him on his birthday in 15 years, who told him she was getting married but then said, “It’s best that you don’t come.” My father was tormented by something. By what, we don’t know. Detectives were unable to find a motive. But he spent nine years obsessively searching for ways to end his life. My dad told us so much about himself in his method. He tried to protect us all. That is how he said goodbye. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

2018,My Patient’s Sisters,"It was vividly clear, in every touch and gaze, that a patient’s family had made the right decision. I quickly scrolled through my patient’s electronic medical record before going into the room to meet her. She was a 53-year-old woman whose heart suddenly stopped a decade ago. When it happened, her brain was deprived of oxygen for 20 minutes; heroic efforts thrust her back to life. But she was left with, as the doctors wrote in her chart, “no chance for meaningful neurological recovery.” She would be permanently attached to a life-sustaining machine. She would never walk, talk, eat, hug or kiss. She would never actively interact with the world around her, never understand anything again. The doctors documented that, at the time, they “discussed withdrawing life support with the family.” They refused. I wonder if they fully grasped what her life would be. That day, the staff at the nursing home where she lived had sent her to our emergency room because she needed a new feeding tube, which is how she took in all her medications and nutrition. When I walked to her bedside, she looked worse than I imagined she would. She was contracted, her limbs thin and wasted from disuse. Her eyes and head roved around, without intention, back-and-forth in a semicircle. Her mouth hung open, a continuous drool. But that wasn’t the biggest surprise. Two women were carefully tending to her. The taller one, her curly hair cut into a triangular bob, was smoothing a vitamin E rose-scented ointment over the patient’s atrophied legs. The smaller woman was helping to turn the patient, holding her on her side so that no part of her body was spared the sweet lotion. I’ve found that most nursing home patients arrive at the hospital without loved ones. Even in life-or-death situations, we sometimes struggle to find a family member — or anyone at all — who is designated to make health care decisions. The longer the patient has been in the nursing home, it seems to me, the less likely relatives are readily available. But the two women by my patient’s side were her sisters. After an hour, a girl in her late teens also showed up — my patient’s daughter. Getting a replacement feeding tube, when a patient has had it for so long, is usually straightforward and low-risk. The tract in the stomach is well formed, and it’s a fairly simple and quick bedside procedure. Yet there were more family members by her side than are usually present for my sickest patients. I spoke with the sisters for a while. The taller, curly-haired woman told me, in Spanish, that she’s visited her sister every morning and night for the last 10 years. She was matter-of-fact about it. The shorter woman lived in Massachusetts, but she made it a point to come at least once a month to see her sister in the nursing home. It would be easy to dismiss this as the family’s lack of insight into the patient’s true clinical state, which was admittedly my first thought. But this wasn’t so. At one point, my patient’s face appeared to contort into a grimace. “Is she in pain?” I asked. “It’s hard to tell, but I don’t think so,” one of the sisters responded. “She doesn’t really feel much.” The other sister nodded. Everyone in the room seemed to acknowledge the extent of the damage to her brain. We talked some more about their family, about her care at the nursing home. The questions I couldn’t muster asking were: Do you think her life has meaning? Do you think you made the right decision, all those years ago? But by the end of my patient’s stay in the E.R., I think I already knew what their answer would be. When I was an intern, I recall getting into a lively conversation with a neurosurgeon, a friend who had already finished his training, about the family’s right to choose what they wanted in these situations. I argued that we couldn’t possibly understand or decide for them what was best, when patients are neurologically devastated like this. Who could speak for another’s cultural and religious beliefs, their personal values? He felt entirely differently, explaining that, as a neurosurgeon, he cared for these patients all the time and that I was too inexperienced in my training to understand. He felt that they are kept on machines for way too long, that their lives amounted to nothing, that if he had it his way it would be our job as physicians to pull the plug — to make the decision for them, regardless of what the family wanted. A heated argument ensued, ending somewhere between him calling me naïve and me telling him he was insensitive and coldhearted. Years later, I no longer disagree with him, at least not with the same wholehearted conviction. Whenever patients similar to the one I saw that day come into the hospital, my colleagues and I inevitably shake our heads and say to each other, “Don’t let me end up this way. When the time comes, just let me go.” To us, it’s not a life worth living. Of course, we’re also under pressure to care for our other patients, and feeling the strains that our health care system places on all of us. I can’t say my interaction with this family has changed my overall position on what I would do in a similar situation. If it were me, making the decision for myself or anyone in my family, I would have withdrawn life support. If my patient’s family had asked me what they should have done back then, I would have told them that they should have let her go. But it was vividly clear, in her sisters’ and daughter’s every touch, their every gaze, that they were still here, right by her bedside, twice a day for a decade — that they made the right decision back then. For this family, it didn’t really matter at all what I thought. Sometimes we as doctors forget that.

2018,"My Voice Got Deeper. Suddenly, People Listened.","RITES OF PASSAGE My feminist mother taught me to speak up. Now, as a trans man, I am trying to make space for women to be heard. A few months after I began injecting testosterone, I discovered that one of the startling new privileges of my male body was that I could silence an entire room just by opening my mouth. Despite the fact that my voice pitched baritone low, when I spoke, people didn’t just listen, they leaned in. They perched their heads in their hands and tilted toward me for a better angle. It was as if whatever I said, however banal, was surely worth that strain of a neck, or the hurried quieting of all other thoughts. For me, a 31-year-old trans man who had spent most of my life in a body that was tolerated at best and ridiculed at worst, this was a shocking turn of events. Before I transitioned, my short hair and men’s clothes frequently baffled people. When we think of trans people, we often imagine someone neatly journeying from one side of the gender binary to the other: woman to man or man to woman. But for me, it was a lot more nuanced. I was a tomboy kid, a swaggering teen steeped in queer culture, then a masculine adult. I dated women, and my ex and I were once held at gunpoint by a man who went on to target two other straight couples, shooting the men. That night, my voice — high, sharp, an immediate tell — saved me. When I spoke, something clicked in the gunman’s eyes, and he immediately let us go. But my voice also made me invisible. I was frequently interrupted and talked over, especially by men, and especially at work. I had to fight harder to make a point. Early in my professional life, I was sometimes simply squeezed into silence. One boorish co-worker at a transcription job I had in graduate school made it his business to reiterate to me, in tedious detail, whatever it was our boss had just told us to do, and it was easier to stand sentry, nodding politely, until he went away. I noticed he never did the same to the man who sat on the other side of him. I moved to Boston in 2011, and my first week of work at a newspaper there coincided with my first shot of testosterone. The effects of the hormone were remarkably fast, and every morning I’d look at myself in the mirror with reverent awe, charting the muscle forming, the spray of hair covering my chest, the stubble on my lip. It was so sweet, after a lifetime of blurring my eyes in order to look at my reflection, to find myself looking back at me. I read somewhere once that first phase of identity formation is figuring out who you are, but the next one — the one we rarely talk about, especially in stories about trans people — is finding your place in the world. To be seen for the man I was felt glorious, sure, but also jarring. There were the “Hey, brother”s from gas station employees, the oddly subservient “Sir”s from salesmen who wanted something from me and the presumption of camaraderie from men at the gym, on the train, at work. Sometimes this friendliness led to vulnerability, like the time a beefy guy I sat next to on a plane gulped down two gin and tonics and then told me, tearily, that his wife was leaving him. But there were also more sobering moments, like the time I found myself on a dark street with a woman who quickly crossed to the other side. Growing up, my mother taught my sister and me to speak up, to be assertive and to take up space. She was a physicist from humble beginnings who went on to be an executive at General Electric, where she faced skepticism, hostility and the loneliness of often being the only woman in the room. When she died suddenly, at 69, four years after my transition, I dealt with the hole in my chest by trying to honor her legacy: flying higher, achieving more and charging through the glass ceiling that had ultimately caged her potential. But that glass ceiling didn’t apply to me so cleanly anymore. The evidence was everywhere. Joining a group of women engaged in excited banter at lunch, for instance, I noticed that my own enthusiastic interruptions halted entire conversations. In fact, my voice hijacked rooms all the time. I could hold an entire meeting hostage as I worked through a half-formed idea, watching as heads swiveled toward me in silent, animal unison, waiting patiently for me to finish even as I stumbled through a thought. In the past, I might not have had the confidence to even volunteer a thought without rehearsing it first. Now, more than once, I would catch myself midramble and wonder: Am I mansplaining? I frequently thought of my mother, managing the men who told her how to do her job, or entertaining the wives of her employees during dinner so as not to appear “too threatening.” I began to see that I had a choice about the kind of man I wanted to be, and the kind of man I didn’t. I began by tallying the evidence: noting who I talked over more often in meetings (women, at a rate of three to one), cataloging whose emails I was quicker to respond to (men) and whose opinions I was less likely to push back on (men, almost always). Something had to change, and it was me. I began to ask for all kinds of feedback, especially from women. How could I be a better boss? Co-worker? Partner? Friend? I was running a small team of mostly women by then, and it was through feedback from a quieter female co-worker that we decided to add a round-table question to our weekly meetings, allowing everyone to answer. It led to much more productive team conversations in which everyone felt more heard. A friend pointed out that it was almost always women who pushed for the acknowledgment of other women in her workplace, so I made it a practice to highlight the accomplishments of my female co-workers to my supervisors, even if the achievement wasn’t public facing — especially then. I also made a point to try to see the often invisible labor that women frequently take on: organizing the birthday parties and the book clubs. Remembering to make the coffee. Making a point to amplify each other in meetings — that is, repeating each other’s ideas and making sure that proper credit was given — insisting that one another be heard. And so I amplified. I made coffee. I listened. And in the process, I got better at doing the things that, as a man, I had been recently socialized not to do: asking for help, giving credit for it and admitting that I didn’t have all the answers. When I failed to meet a goal, I tried to be open about it so that I could learn, rather than get defensive. I also worked to preserve the qualities I liked most about myself before my transition: vulnerability, openness, empathy. Not too long ago, I was at a meeting where I didn’t need to speak at all. It was humbling, at first, to witness ideas being raised, one by one, by my colleagues. But then I flashed on my previous life, when I was sure that the most feminist thing I could do was speak up. Now, my silence wasn’t a weakness but its own power. My new body, my new life, wasn’t about silencing anyone. It was about making room for others to be heard.

2018,"Myanmar Generals Should Face Genocide Charges Over Rohingya, U.N. Says","GENEVA — Myanmar’s army commander and other top generals should face trial in an international court for genocide against Rohingya Muslims and for crimes against humanity targeting other ethnic minorities, United Nations experts said on Monday after a yearlong investigation. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar’s army, is one of six generals named as priority subjects for investigation and prosecution by a United Nations Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar in a report detailing military campaigns involving atrocities that “undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.” The three-member panel leveled the most serious charge, genocide, over the ferocious campaign unleashed by the Buddhist-majority security forces against Rohingya Muslims a year ago. That campaign, in the state of Rakhine, sent more than 700,000 fleeing across the border to Bangladesh. Myanmar has rejected allegations of widespread atrocities, asserting that its security forces were simply responding to attacks by Rohingya militants on Myanmar police posts and an army station on Aug. 25 last year. But the panel said there was enough information to warrant investigation and prosecution of senior officers “so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide.” In an 18-page report released on Monday, the panel described the Rakhine operations as a “foreseeable and planned catastrophe” building on decades of oppression of Rohingya Muslims. Myanmar has long falsely classified the Rohingya as “Bengali” immigrants from Bangladesh, denying them citizenship and making them vulnerable to attack, including previous assaults in 2012 and 2016. The panel found evidence of genocidal intent in the operation, citing the prevailing rhetoric of hate directed at the Rohingya and statements by military commanders as well as “the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence.” The panel said estimates of 10,000 deaths in the Rakhine campaign were conservative and cited harrowing witness accounts of mass killings, gang rapes of women and young girls and the wholesale destruction of villages by the military, known as the Tatmadaw. Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and other civilian authorities “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes” by failing to use their positions to stop them, the panel said. Elsewhere, “scorched earth” operations by the military against Kachin and Shan ethnic minorities in northern Myanmar revealed similar patterns of attacks and sexual violence against civilians, the panel said. The three-member panel — led by Marzuki Darusman, a former Indonesian attorney general — is to present its report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva next month along with an annex that runs more than 400 pages and includes witness testimony of atrocities and detailed satellite imagery analysis. The accounts, collected from victims and eyewitnesses, “will leave a mark on all of us for the rest of our lives,” Mr. Darusman told reporters in Geneva. Myanmar refused access and cooperation to the investigation, which based its report on 875 interviews and documents compiled in numerous field missions to Bangladesh and neighboring countries. “Only verified and corroborated information was relied upon,” it said. The panel report detailed attacks carried out by a Rohingya militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, including the raids last August, and it reported abuses carried out by other ethnic armed groups in the north. But it said that “military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children and burning entire villages.” The Tatmadaw’s tactics were “consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats” in Rakhine State and in Myanmar’s north, it said. The United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, has previously condemned the army’s actions as ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide, but the panel’s unequivocal assertion is likely to increase pressure for immediate international action. The panel said the United Nations Security Council should refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court or set up an international tribunal like those that investigated genocide and atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. It also urged the Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and penalize those most responsible for crimes with travel bans and a freeze on assets. The panel members said on Monday that the Tatmadaw commander should resign as a first step toward achieving accountability for the military’s crimes, but there was no immediate sign of any change in his position of power. Over the weekend, General Min Aung Hlaing returned from Russia, where he attended a military forum and shopped for weapons. Both Russia and China have shielded Myanmar from formal criticism from the Security Council. In addition to the six generals named in the report, the United Nations panel is providing a “non-exhaustive” list of people accused of atrocities to the high commissioner for human rights. The list is to be made available to any international body pursuing accountability. This month, the United States unveiled a new set of targeted sanctions against military officers who are believed to have directed the violence against the Rohingya. But no member of the country’s top brass, such as General Min Aung Hlaing, was named. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has set up several commissions to look at the root causes of the violence in Rakhine State, but none has resulted in any serious action or even an admission of the scale of the slaughter. Two foreign diplomats quit one panel, saying they did not want to take part in a whitewashing of serious crimes. The United Nations mission said the dominant position of the Tatmadaw, which ruled Myanmar for nearly half a century and still enjoys absolute impunity even as it shares power with a civilian government, meant that yet another Rakhine commission formed by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi “will not and cannot” deliver a meaningful outcome. “The impetus for accountability must come from the international community,” it said. A conspicuous failing of Myanmar’s civilian authorities identified by the panel was their failure to curb virulent hate speech by religious and national hard-liners on social media platforms, notably Facebook. “Facebook’s response was slow and ineffective,” the report said, although a panel member, Radhika Coomaraswamy, said the company had since taken a more active role in policing hate speech in Myanmar, assigning more people to monitor it and take it down. On Monday, Facebook announced that it was taking additional steps in response to criticism that it had done too little to stem hate speech and misinformation in Myanmar. Acknowledging that it had been “too slow to act,” the company said it was banning 20 people and groups, including General Min Aung Hlaing, linked to the crisis in Myanmar. The U.N. panel’s report also calls for accountability within the United Nations, delivering a scathing assessment of its failure to respond to the abuses unfolding in Myanmar and calling for a comprehensive independent inquiry “as a matter of urgency.” United Nations officials in Myanmar failed to put in place the organization’s policy on human rights, preferring to give priority to development and quiet diplomacy, the panel said, echoing criticisms of the United Nations in Sri Lanka during the bloody closing stages of its war against Tamil Tiger rebels. “That approach has demonstrably failed; the United Nations as a whole failed to adequately address human rights concerns,” the panel said. Even now, it added, the approach taken by United Nations agencies in Myanmar “displays few signs of any lessons learned.”",The New York Times
2018,Myanmar Official Line: Rohingya Are Returning. But Cracks in That Story Abound.,"Myanmar Dispatch MAUNGDAW, Myanmar — We waded through floodwaters, past soldiers hefting rifles, and climbed into a prefabricated hut. Inside, a row of men sat huddled against the wall as armed police and immigration officers stood over them. They were, we had been given the impression, among the 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who had fled northern Rakhine State in Myanmar for Bangladesh last year in an exodus that the United States and other countries condemned as ethnic cleansing. 200 mileS INDIA CHINA BANGLADESH MYANMAR Maungdaw LAOS Rathedaung RAKHINE THAILAND Yangon Bay of Bengal By The New York Times Now, dozens had been repatriated, officials said, thanks to the good will of the Myanmar government, which wanted to show off its commitment to welcoming back the Rohingya and the rows of barracks it had prepared for the returnees. But like nearly every interaction on a recent government-led trip for journalists to the epicenter of the crisis, cracks appeared in the official story line. The men at one of the country’s three repatriation centers shook their heads when asked if they had peacefully come back to Myanmar from Bangladesh. They said they had not been repatriated at all. In fact, they said, they had never even left this waterlogged stretch of marsh and mountain in Myanmar, and had been swept up in the government’s broad repression of the Rohingya minority. One day, last year, three of the men said, soldiers had arrested them in their village in northern Rakhine State. Five and a half months later, they were released and charged with illegal immigration. “They accused us of coming from Bangladesh, but we have never been to Bangladesh,” Abdus Salim said. “Rakhine is our home.” U Win Khine, the lead immigration officer, looked apologetic. Maybe they were liars, he said. He refused to call the men Rohingya, referring to them as Bengali to imply they belonged in neighboring Bangladesh. “Bengalis are not from our country because they have different blood, skin color and language from us,” Mr. Win Khine said. “We have no Rohingya here.” Outside of Myanmar, the tragedy of the Rohingya is clear. Over the decades, the Muslim minority has been stripped of its rights — to attend college, to access medical care, to move freely — by a Buddhist-chauvinist, army-dominated government. Most have no citizenship. When Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army encampment last August, killing a dozen security personnel, a paroxysm of violence against Rohingya civilians followed within hours: mass executions, rapes and village burnings by security forces that United Nations officials have suggested could constitute genocide. Rakhine Buddhist mobs abetted in the bloodletting. But on this rare trip to northern Rakhine, under the watchful eye of armed guards, the official narrative diverged from the internationally accepted reality. The Rohingya had burned their own residences, we were told by officials and civilians alike. They were terrorists — and if they were not terrorists, they were women and children manipulated by shadowy groups in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the Islamic world. Yet even as we were shepherded through the muddy, still charred countryside of Rathedaung and Maungdaw, two townships in northern Rakhine, the discussions grew sticky with contradictions. We stopped in a village once populated by Rakhine Buddhists, Rohingya Muslims and the Mro, a formerly jungle-dwelling ethnic minority. Eight Mro were killed last August by Rohingya insurgents, the Myanmar authorities have said. Why hadn’t the international media covered these murders, local officials on our tour asked? But they didn’t address the thousands of Rohingya who human rights groups say were killed last year. Like everywhere else we went, officials in the village insisted that the Rohingya here had torched their own houses in order to garner global sympathy. But at one point we spoke freely with local residents, and a girl, who would be in danger if her name were revealed, said she missed a Muslim friend who had lived a few houses down. “The Rakhine burned their houses down,” she said, referring to civilians from the Buddhist ethnic group that gives Rakhine State its name. “My friend is gone forever.” A man corrected her quickly. “You’re supposed to say the reverse,” he admonished. “You should say they burned their own houses down.” Outside, another child, playing soccer barefoot in the rain, was more emphatic. “I saw it with my own eyes, how the Rakhine burned down all the Muslim houses,” he said, detailing how a car belonging to a Rohingya family was lit on fire because the looters didn’t know how to drive. “Who would burn down their own houses?” the boy added. “That’s stupid.” A new school and Buddhist pagoda had been built on what was once the village’s Muslim quarter. The remaining residents have been gifted new homes by the government, rows of prefabricated houses that looked incongruous in one of the poorest places in Asia. In the town of Maungdaw, U Kyaw Win Htet, the assistant director of the Maungdaw District General Administration Department, gave a briefing on the area’s changing demographics. A year ago, Maungdaw District had a population of 800,000. Now, there were 416,000 people. Before, the township was 90 percent Muslim. Now it was barely half. Why did the Muslims leave? Mr. Kyaw Win Htet, a Buddhist, said he wasn’t sure. “I think they didn’t want to live here anymore,” he said. “But the reason why, only they themselves know.” Did the local government have death tolls from last year’s violence, broken down by ethnicity? Mr. Kyaw Win Htet said he did not know. Had he ever visited any of the hundreds of burned Rohingya villages? No, he had not. Did he know of any Muslim employees of his government department, given that nearly most of the district’s population had been Rohingya? No, he did not. Later, Mr. Kyaw Win Htet admitted that the “Bengali issue” was not his bailiwick. His expertise was flood control. He had been assigned to talk to us only because his boss was away. Earlier this week, the Myanmar government formed yet another commission to investigate what exactly had happened in northern Rakhine. Half a dozen such committees have been convened so far; none has determined anything substantive. Meanwhile, the country’s leadership continues to deny there was any state-sponsored campaign to remove the Rohingya from Myanmar. At one swollen river crossing, a few Rohingya ventured through the murky water. We had gotten out of the car because it wasn’t clear whether the vehicle could manage the current, and an elderly woman, Suma Bibi, and her husband splashed by. I wanted to talk to her so we ducked under the roof of a border guard hut to escape the rain. She was shaking. “I am afraid,” she whispered, jutting her chin at the armed policeman standing behind me. “I don’t want to be close to people like that.” Ms. Bibi said she had tried unsuccessfully to escape to Bangladesh when her village was destroyed by fire. “I want to leave,” she said. “But I cannot.” We had with us an armed guard, Cpl. Ko Hla Phyu, who wasn’t pleased when we talked to Muslims or showed too much interest in the scorched wrecks of mosques. The corporal said he knew all about the “terrorists,” who had created havoc in northern Rakhine. When the photographer with us, Adam Dean, defied his instructions and jumped out of the car to take pictures of a charred village, he remarked that if Adam’s head wasn’t bulletproof, it would be advisable to return to the car. “I will lay down my life to make sure the terrorists don’t get my gun,” he said, cradling his battle rifle. The final day of our government tour, we stopped at the Taung Pyo border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, where thousands of Rohingya have been caught behind barbed wire in a kind of buffer zone between the two countries. The Myanmar government claims Muslim militants operate from this narrow strip of territory, a charge these displaced Rohingya deny. On earlier occasions, from the Bangladesh side, I had talked with Dil Mohammed, the leader of this marooned community. Mr. Mohammed had gone to the University of Yangon, Myanmar’s finest. He once had a nice house. Now he was stateless, homeless and soaked by the monsoons and the occasional surge of sewage. But he laughed when he saw me peering through the fence from Myanmar. “Before, you were on that side,” Mr. Mohammed said in his courtly English, pointing to Bangladesh. “Now you are on this side.” A Myanmar border guard shifted the aim of his muzzle, and Mr. Mohammed stepped aside into a squelch of mud. “But I am still here in the same place,” he added. “Do you think that will ever change?”",The New York Times
2018,"Myanmar, John McCain, Pope Francis: Your Tuesday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. More turnover in Sydney, calls for genocide charges in Myanmar and a manhunt continues in Queensland. Here’s what you need to know: • Australia’s new era. Malcolm Turnbull will resign from Parliament on Friday. Among those lining up to vie for the former prime minister’s seat in the Sydney electorate of Wentworth is Christine Forster, the sister of another former prime minister, Tony Abbott. Scott Morrison (above with his family), who took Mr. Turnbull’s post last week in a Liberal Party feud, has talked openly and often about his evangelical Christian faith — a rarity in Australian politics. His critics, our correspondent writes, “have questioned both his readiness for the top job, and how he could reconcile his faith with some of his stances, like his hard-line views on immigration.” Mr. Morrison faces the colossal challenge of trying to build a culture of reconciliation in time for the federal election due by next May. Crikey identifies six things Mr. Morrison should do to compete against the Labor Party, starting with explaining why Mr. Turnbull was removed. (The article is paywall-free for Times readers.) _____ • Calls for genocide charges in Myanmar. The country’s top military officials should face trial in an international court for genocide against Rohingya Muslims and for crimes against humanity targeting other ethnic minorities, a U.N. panel said after a yearlong investigation. The panel detailed military campaigns involving atrocities that “undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law” and said that Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and other civilian authorities “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes” by failing to use their positions to stop them. In a video op-ed, Fortify Rights, a nonprofit organization based in Southeast Asia, presents raw images of atrocities that Rohingya refugees gathered on their cellphones. And the verdict was postponed in Myanmar’s closely watched prosecution of two Reuters reporters accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act while they investigated a massacre. Saying the judge was ill, a court official said the verdict would come Sept. 3. _____ • An outpouring for John McCain. Tributes came from his adopted state of Arizona, above, across the nation and around the world for Mr. McCain, the Republican senator who died of brain cancer on Saturday. President Trump, who had battled Mr. McCain over the direction of the country, finally broke his silence with a message of respect, and the White House, which had returned the American flag to full-staff on Monday, but was pressured to put it back to half-staff. Mr. McCain appeared to have planned to have the last word. A close aide issued a pointed statement from the senator, which said in part: “We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down.” _____ • “I will not say a single word about this.” In a news conference on the papal plane back to Rome, Pope Francis sidestepped questions about a claim by a former Vatican ambassador that he helped cover up abuse allegations against an American cardinal in 2013. “I believe the statement speaks for itself,” he said. “And you have the sufficient journalistic ability to make your conclusions.” Watch the video. The unsubstantiated allegations and personal attacks amounted to an extraordinary public declaration of war by traditionalists at a particularly vulnerable moment in Francis’ papacy. _____ • An unexpected hostage. As the U.S. and China spar over trade, some scientists worry that the vital exchange of medical supplies and information could slow, hampering preparedness for the next biological threat. It may have already started: For over a year, the Chinese government has withheld lab samples of a dangerous virus — a type of bird flu called H7N9 — from the U.S., where specimens are needed to develop vaccines and treatments. A disease specialist at Harvard Medical School warned that the American “ability to protect against infections which can spread globally within days” was being undermined. • Reviving Nafta: The U.S. and Mexico agreed to revise key portions of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement — but it’s complicated. Canada is still on the sidelines, and many issues are unresolved. • The Pentagon, perhaps to compete with China’s strategy, says artificial intelligence is a national priority, and has called on the White House to “inspire a whole of country effort.” The question: What’s Silicon Valley’s role? • Russia is unveiling a floating nuclear power plant that proponents say could be cheaper and safer, and that could be a weapon against climate change. It also has its skeptics. • U.S. stocks were up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The top U.S. air commander in the Middle East urged the Saudi-led coalition to be more transparent about an airstrike this month in Yemen that killed more than 40 children. “They need to come out and say what occurred there.” [The New York Times] • The search continues in a crocodile-infested area of Queensland for a group of foreign nationals who abandoned a fishing boat north of Cairns. Fifteen passengers have been detained; the authorities are scouring the mangroves for the rest. [The Guardian] • More on a “yoga ball killing”: An overview of a Hong Kong trial in which a Malaysian anesthesiologist is accused of using an exercise ball filled with carbon monoxide to kill his wife and daughter. [The New York Times] • Tennis, anyone? The U.S. Open started with an upset: the loss by top-ranked Simona Halep. [The New York Times] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Recipe of the day: Liven up a salmon dinner with a bright coleslaw using ginger, lemon and scallion. • It’s never too early to plan for retirement. Even if you’re a high schooler. • Give your kids some culture. And a vacation. Simultaneously. • Wedding-shopping adventures in India: A bride-to-be returns to both Delhis, New and Old, to shop for her wedding in a bumpy, smog-filled trip, in-laws in tow. Her goal: “to reflect our distinctly American way of life, while nodding to our heritage.” • Honeybees are hurting. Nature’s dominant pollinator is under siege, straining the business of agriculture. Now farmers are turning to alternative species to help pollinate their crops. • And there is almost certainly ice on the moon, new research shows. The ice — very muddy, mixed with lunar dust — is inside craters near the north and south poles. But we still don’t know how deep it goes, or how exactly it got there. The world’s first female zoo director, Belle Benchley, was born on this day in 1882. In 1925, Ms. Benchley was recently divorced and looking for a job in order to provide for her son. A former teacher, she landed a temporary job as a bookkeeper at the San Diego Zoo, which had opened in 1916 and was growing. The job turned into a tenure of more than a quarter century that would permanently change the now-famous institution. She quickly began to do more than her job description required, sometimes instinctively identifying sick animals, even before keepers or veterinarians did. The zoo’s founder, Dr. Harry Wegeforth, offered her the top job of executive secretary in 1927. “You might as well run the place,” he reportedly told her, “because you’re already doing it anyway.” At the time, she was the only female zoo director in the world. During the more than 25 years she spent on the job, Ms. Benchley wrote four books, wrote and edited the zoo’s magazine, “Zoonooz,” and became the American Zoological Association’s first female president. “The Zoo Lady” retired in 1953 at age 70. In 1972, Ms. Benchley died in San Diego, where she was buried. Her gravestone features the face of a smiling gorilla.

2018,N.C.A.A. Alters Rules for Agents and Draft in Wake of Basketball Corruption Scandal,"College basketball players who declare for the N.B.A. draft will be allowed to hire agents after two N.C.A.A. boards adopted a series of reforms to the sport’s rules on Wednesday. The changes, which also could apply to certain high school players if the N.B.A. changes its draft rules, were made as the N.C.A.A. continues to grapple with the fallout of the federal indictments last year that suggested extensive corruption in recruiting at the nexus of apparel companies and agents. But the governing body stopped short of making the more fundamental changes to the amateur model that some have long sought. In a stark departure from the N.C.A.A.’s longtime ban on agents’ involvement, the reforms would permit college players who declare for the draft to employ agents, and they would extend the same exception to certain high school seniors whom U.S.A. Basketball deems elite — but only if the N.B.A. changes draft rules that currently bar players from going directly from high school to the pros. Also notable: Players who declare for the N.B.A. draft but are not selected will be allowed to return to their college teams. Under previous rules, players with college eligibility remaining who wanted the option of returning to college could not hire an agent and had to withdraw from the N.B.A. draft well before it took place. The N.C.A.A. board of governors and the Division I board of directors also approved alterations to the summer basketball calendar meant to increase the transparency, and perhaps reduce the influence, of summer showcases typically sponsored by the same apparel companies — Nike, Adidas and Under Armour — that sponsor most top college basketball teams. New disclosure requirements for those companies as well as for coaches are intended to reveal just who is paying for what, and how much. And the boards proposed changes to the N.C.A.A.’s governance and penalty structure, some of which need to be ratified at its annual convention in January: increasing penalties; making university presidents and chancellors accountable for violations; adding the first independent members to the N.C.A.A. board of governors; and permitting N.C.A.A. inquiries to use information found by other investigative bodies. This last change could allow the N.C.A.A. to rely on the work currently being done by federal prosecutors, who have tools like subpoenas and the threat of jail time at their disposal during investigations. “These changes will promote integrity in the game, strengthen accountability and prioritize the interests of student-athletes over every other factor,” Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., said Wednesday in a joint statement with the chairs of the board of governors and the Division I board of directors. The new rules followed recommendations made in April by a panel that Emmert convened to investigate the corruption crisis and that was led by the former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. That group’s most eye-catching suggestion was the elimination of the so-called “one-and-done” rule, the requirement that N.B.A. draftees be 19 years old or a year removed from high school. That rule, created for the 2006 draft, birthed a system in which the most talented college players competed in college during their freshman seasons and then left to play professionally. Change on that front will have to wait for action from the N.B.A. and its players’ union; it is not expected before at least 2020. In a statement, the N.B.A. said, “We will review the N.C.A.A.’s planned reforms and continue to assess, along with our Players’ Association, the potential for any related N.B.A. rules changes.” Last September, prosecutors in the United States Southern District of New York charged nearly a dozen individuals, including assistant coaches at major programs, a former Adidas executive, middlemen and others. In some cases, assistant coaches were said to have steered players toward a money manager who had bribed the coaches; in others, Adidas employees were accused of funneling money to prospects’ families in exchange for pledges to commit to teams sponsored by the company and to sign endorsement deals with Adidas once the players turned pro. Several complaints have implicated prominent basketball teams in Adidas’s stable: Kansas, Louisville (whose former head coach, the Hall of Famer Rick Pitino, lost his job amid the charges) and Miami. Documents and bank records from the investigation, obtained in February by Yahoo Sports, implicated at least 20 top men’s basketball programs. The federal investigation has brought attention to open secrets in men’s college basketball, including the involvement of agents and the power the gigantic apparel companies exert over the system by showering many millions of dollars every year on both college teams and precollege grass-roots leagues. The accusations also raised anew the question of whether to allow some athletes to collect compensation beyond a scholarship and an educational stipend. While Rice’s group, and Rice personally, suggested such fundamental reform made sense, it declined to make any suggestions in this area, citing pending antitrust cases targeting the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on compensation.",The New York Times
2018,N.C.A.A. Drops Michigan State Inquiry Over Nassar,"The N.C.A.A. has dropped an investigation of Michigan State’s role in the Lawrence G. Nassar scandal, in which the former university doctor is alleged to have sexually abused hundreds of girls, including prominent gymnasts like Simone Biles as well as Michigan State athletes, saying that the university does not appear to have violated association bylaws. The N.C.A.A.’s vice president for enforcement, Jonathan F. Duncan, said that an inquiry into Nassar, who last year pleaded guilty to sexually abusing seven girls, and another inspired by an ESPN report in January of sexual assault allegations against football and men’s basketball players, had “not substantiated violations of N.C.A.A. legislation,” Michigan State said on Thursday. In a statement, Athletic Director Bill Beekman said: “N.C.A.A. member organizations have a specific set of rules to which we hold each other accountable. And while we agree with the N.C.A.A. that we did not commit a violation, that does not diminish our commitment to ensure the health, safety and wellness of our student athletes.” Also Thursday, Kathie Klages, a former Michigan State gymnastics coach, was arraigned on charges of lying to the police. The Michigan attorney general’s office has said Klages knew of an allegation against Nassar as early as the late 1990s. But when interviewed by investigators, she denied knowing of any before 2016, when allegations were widely reported, first by The Indianapolis Star. The N.C.A.A. initiated an investigation of Michigan State over Nassar in January, when Nassar’s high-profile sentencing in his state criminal case captivated the country, as dozens and dozens of women, including Olympic medalists, confronted him in court with what they said he did to them. In its January letter, the N.C.A.A. cited bylaws obliging member institutions to protect the welfare of their athletes. But actually bringing charges was always a long shot, and it would have been virtually unprecedented to have done so under the cited bylaws. The N.C.A.A.’s main enforcement responsibilities regard amateurism and competitive balance.

2018,N.F.L. Preseason: What We’ve Learned So Far,"Some of the best players don’t play, and some players about to be cut do. Coaches hide the bulk of their playbooks. Intensity is low. N.F.L. preseason games often bear little resemblance to the high-stakes football that follows them. But that doesn’t mean that the first bunch of games on Thursday night didn’t teach us something about teams, players and the season ahead. Here are some highlights. Barkley, the No. 2 overall selection in this year’s draft, had one run against the Browns on Thursday night that set Giants fans dreaming. On the game’s first play, he took the ball from Eli Manning, briefly looked stuck, then found a hole and dashed for 39 yards. The rest of Barkley’s runs were pedestrian. And some Penn State runners have not carried their college form over into the N.F.L. (Blair Thomas, Ki-Jana Carter, Curtis Enis). “Just a run, you know?” Manning told reporters. “Let’s not go berserk yet, all right?” It may be too late. Berserk mode is already activated. The Browns were 4-0 in the preseason last year, and the Patriots were 1-3. That didn’t teach us much. But that doesn’t stop people from looking at the exhibition scores and drawing conclusions. Most of the games Thursday night were close, but there was one exception: the Ravens thumped the Rams, 33-7. Start off with the caveats: Almost no key Rams players got in the game, including quarterback Jared Goff. The signal calling was handled instead by Brandon Allen (a sixth-rounder in 2016 who has had no-regular season snaps) and Sean Mannion (one N.F.L. start in three years). And the Ravens were playing their second preseason game and seemed to have less rust. The Rams had been attracting a lot of preseason buzz after a breakthrough 11-5 season. They have some work to do when the starters begin to play. Jackson’s passing numbers didn’t amaze (7 for 18, 119 yards), but he got Ravens fans excited with his running game. Jackson avoided a sack, scrambled away, dodged some defenders, and scored a 9-yard touchdown. “I made a guy miss and tried to do what I do best, tried to get in the end zone,” Jackson told reporters. “It was excellent.” For now, he is still listed third on Baltimore’s depth chart, behind Joe Flacco and Robert Griffin III. Baker Mayfield won the Heisman Trophy last season and was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. But skepticism about him remains, especially since he was joining the hapless Browns. After one preseason game, Cleveland fans are breathing a bit easier. Mayfield was 11 for 20 for 212 yards, with two touchdowns and no interceptions. And the Browns beat the Giants, 20-10. As for the other member of the heralded quarterback rookie class in action Thursday, Josh Allen of the Bills was 9 for 19 for 116 yards and a touchdown — weaker numbers than his competition, Nathan Peterman (9 for 10) and A.J. McCarron (7 for 10). Sam Darnold of the Jets plays Friday and Josh Rosen of the Cardinals makes his debut on Saturday. No one is quite sure how the N.F.L.’s new rule on helmet hits will affect the season. We got a hint on Thursday when Shamarko Thomas of the Colts was ejected after making helmet-to-helmet contact with David Moore of the Seahawks. “I’m very disappointed,” Colts Coach Frank Reich told reporters. “We don’t teach that. That was a good call, that was the appropriate call, he should have been ejected.” Remember him? One of the top signal-callers in the game missed all of last season with shoulder problems. Not coincidentally, the Colts were 4-12. On Thursday, Luck started the preseason opener, completing 6 of 9 passes for 64 yards. It was a careful start, but a welcome one for Colts fans. Ryan Tannehill also made a return after missing 2017 with a knee injury. He was 4-for-6, playing just one series for the Dolphins. Bills receiver Kelvin Benjamin stirred up a little tempest earlier in the week by disparaging his former teammate, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, telling The Athletic that: “It was a bad fit from the get-go. You would have put me with any other quarterback, let’s be real, you know what I’m saying? Any other accurate quarterback like Rodgers or Eli Manning or Big Ben — anybody!” Newton approached Benjamin before the Panthers-Bills game on Thursday, but Benjamin showed a disinclination to chat. “I wasn’t even trying to listen,” Benjamin told the Panthers website. It doesn’t look like the controversy over national anthem protests is over, as a handful of players knelt or raised fists again, drawing the ire of the president.",The New York Times
2018,N.F.L. Protests During Anthem Stir Emotions Even Before the Season,"The N.F.L. season has not even officially begun, but after just a handful of exhibition games tensions are rising over players’ protests during the national anthem and the league’s handling of the issue. After a few Miami Dolphins players demonstrated during the playing of the anthem at an exhibition game on Thursday, a county police organization announced it would no longer participate in a discounted ticket program offered by the team. At the same time, Tre Boston, a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, suggested in an interview with The Ringer that N.F.L. team owners had colluded against safeties, implying that they were doing so to justify not signing Eric Reid, who protested alongside Colin Kaepernick when both played for the San Francisco 49ers. The two statements illustrated how relations between some fans and the N.F.L., and between the league and certain players, remain raw. And with the issue showing no signs of fading, the contentious atmosphere makes it even less likely that owners will be able to find a solution that satisfied all sides. The statement by the Broward County Police Benevolent Association came after Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson of the Dolphins took a knee during the anthem on Thursday. The association said it had received discounts from the Dolphins to attend the game, at which first responders were honored. The group said it “entered into this partnership with the understanding that the Dolphins organization would require their players to stand for the national anthem.” But after the demonstrations, which also included Robert Quinn raising his fist, the police group said it would not take part in the discount ticket program and encouraged police benevolent associations in neighboring Dade and Palm Beach counties to follow suit. It is unclear, however, when the police group reached that understanding with the team. The league changed its policy in May to require all players to either stand for the anthem on the field or stay in the locker room while the song is played. But the N.F.L. suspended that policy in late July while it negotiated with the N.F.L. Players Association on potential revisions. The Dolphins declined to comment. Boston, one of the best free-agent safeties on the market this off-season, suggested in an interview with The Ringer that the owners had conspired to suppress salaries for free-agent safeties. That is the same contention made by Reid, who has filed a grievance against the N.F.L. and remains without a team, like Kaepernick. Last month, Boston signed a one-year contract worth $1.5 million with the Arizona Cardinals. “How did we get to a point where this is what we were worth?” Boston asked. “You can put my stats up against some of the best of them you’re going to get me in the $7 million-plus range.” Boston has been outspoken in the past about police shootings — one of the focuses of the anthem protests. Two years ago he urged a unified response from his Carolina Panthers teammates after a police shooting in Charlotte, N.C. He is not the only safety who settled for an underwhelming contract this off-season. Kenny Vaccaro, another highly regarded free agent, signed a one-year deal with the Tennessee Titans for $1.475 million. Reid remains unsigned. During the off-season, he was invited to Cincinnati to speak with the Bengals, where the team’s owner, Mike Brown, reportedly asked Reid whether he would continue to protest during the national anthem.",The New York Times
2018,N.J. Transit: We Let You Down. And It’s Not Over Yet.,"NEWARK — After hearing angry commuters sound off about a summer filled with cancellations of trains, officials of New Jersey Transit, the nation’s second busiest railroad, admitted on Wednesday that they had let their customers down. “Over the past week or so, we have not been able to dependably offer the level of service that we hoped for,” Kevin Corbett, executive director of the statewide transit agency, said at a meeting of New Jersey Transit’s board of directors in Newark. But along with that admission came a warning that will not make riders happy: The shortages of trains and the engineers to drive them could persist into the fall. “Although I hate to say it, these are issues that won’t be solved overnight,” Mr. Corbett said. New Jersey’s transportation commissioner, Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, said the directors were considering ways of helping to ease the pain for transit riders but had not considered offering discounts or refunds to customers, many of whom pay more than $400 a month. “We jumped into a firestorm in January,” said Ms. Gutierrez-Scaccetti, an appointee of New Jersey’s governor, Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, who was elected in November and took office at the start of the year. “There’s stuff coming at us from multiple directions, and we’re doing the best we can to address all of it.” Mr. Murphy, who was returning on Wednesday from a family vacation in Italy, was scheduled to meet with Mr. Corbett in Newark on Wednesday to discuss New Jersey Transit’s troubles. As a candidate, Mr. Murphy blamed the agency’s deteriorating performance on his Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, and he vowed to spend more money to improve the service. Mr. Corbett said that Mr. Murphy understands the bind the agency is in and that it will take a long time to fix its problems. “Phil gets it,” he said. “He understands there’s no magic wand.” On Wednesday, the directors approved a $2.32 billion operating budget for the 2019 fiscal year that includes an increase in state aid that will allow New Jersey Transit to increase its work force by 114 workers, including some additional engineers, Mr. Corbett said. Last week, New Jersey Transit announced that it would temporarily shut down its southernmost rail line, which runs between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, in September, and redeploy crews to other lines. Mr. Corbett called that a “drastic action,” but added that the line carries fewer than 2,000 of the transit system’s more than 900,000 daily riders. Ms. Gutierrez-Scaccetti and Mr. Corbett, who was also appointed by Mr. Murphy, were responding to a crisis of the agency’s own making. It has been losing engineers, to retirement and other railroads with higher pay, much faster than it has replaced them, Mr. Corbett said. That failure has left the railroad without enough of them, particularly in the summer, when some are on vacation and others take unscheduled days off. The unplanned absences have forced the railroad to abruptly cancel 20 or more trains a day in the last few weeks, frustrating commuters who depend on them to get to and from work. Mary Migacz told the commissioners that, counting this morning, her usual 6:14 a.m. train from Rahway to New York City had been canceled six times in three weeks, adding a half-hour to her trip each time. “Last summer was a breeze. This summer will be the summer of hell,” Ms. Migacz, who lives in Colonia, N.J., told the commissioners. She was alluding to extensive track repairs at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan last summer that required trains to be rerouted and prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to forecast a “summer of hell” for commuters. That work caused significant disruptions, but it was announced in advance and additional alternatives were provided to help commuters cope. New Jersey Transit also gave discounts to customers whose trains were detoured away from Penn Station. Some commuters have complained that the spate of cancellations this summer has been more disruptive because of the lack of sufficient warning to allow them to make other plans. After a train is canceled, the next train to come along is often overcrowded or already full, they complain. Mr. Corbett, who commutes by train from Morristown to Newark, said he felt the customers’ pain. He said one of his morning trains had been canceled this summer. But he said his commute last summer, to his previous job on the Upper East Side, was more torturous. “It was a zoo,” he said, referring to having his daily train to Penn Station rerouted to Hoboken Terminal, where he had to switch to the PATH train to Manhattan. “It was a dogfight every day. It was ugly.” He said the primary cause of New Jersey Transit’s current problems is that it had to divert a lot of resources toward meeting a year-end deadline for installing an automatic-braking system throughout its network. Federal regulators have ordered all passenger railroads to adopt the technology, known as positive train control, to prevent crashes. But Mr. Corbett said he was shocked to find upon his arrival that New Jersey Transit had completed less than 10 percent of the installation of positive train control. Now, he said, more than half of the work has been done and the installation should be completed by Dec. 31. If not, New Jersey Transit could be banned from operating on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, which runs up the spine of the state and through Penn Station. The installation has been compounded by the unusually high number of unscheduled days off taken by the railroad’s engineers this summer, Mr. Corbett said. He said he and other representatives of the governor had implored the engineers’ union to press their members to show up but that, ultimately, the railroad was at their mercy. He said New Jersey Transit had about 335 engineers and needed about 50 more. That explanation did not appease Nancy Munoz, a Republican member of the State Assembly from Summit. Ms. Munoz told the directors on Wednesday that “when New Jersey fails to plan, everyone’s plans suffer.” She added, “There have to be better options than canceling trains at the last minute or shutting down lines altogether.”",The New York Times
2018,N.R.A. Joins Questioning of Florida Sheriff in ‘Stand Your Ground’ Case,"MIAMI — After a Florida sheriff decided not to arrest a white man who the authorities say killed an unarmed black man in a confrontation over a handicapped parking spot, outrage came from expected places: the victim’s family, civil rights organizations and Democratic politicians eager to repeal Florida’s controversial self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground. But what was far more unusual was the perceived criticism from the powerful state lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, as well as Republican legislators who helped write the law. They disputed the sheriff’s interpretation and implied that perhaps the gunman should have been arrested. Faced with increasing questions about his actions, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri of Pinellas County addressed his critics on Tuesday in a lengthy news conference, defending his decision not to arrest Michael Drejka in the shooting of Markeis McGlockton. “I didn’t get it wrong,” the sheriff said. His decision to let Mr. Drejka go free has reopened the debate in Florida over Stand Your Ground, a 2005 law that first rose to national attention after the 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American teenager whose killer the police initially declined to arrest, citing the law. In an election year already suffused with gun politics, Democrats have called for a federal investigation and traveled to Clearwater, the site of the McGlockton shooting, to rally support for legislative change. Florida lawmakers have repeatedly expanded the state’s far-reaching self-defense laws. Just last year, the Legislature made it easier for defendants to invoke the “stand your ground” protections. Instead of defendants having to prove that they were acting in self-defense, the new law shifts the burden to prosecutors, who now must prove by “clear and convincing evidence” that the use of force was not justified. The legislators who created Stand Your Ground say there is nothing wrong with the law — only, perhaps, with the way in which it is being applied. But Sheriff Gualtieri, a Republican who supports the law, said on Tuesday that the law might require “some changes.” “There’s room to tweak it, to tighten it up in some areas,” he said. “Tweaking it so that it is less ambiguous, it’s clearer, and could be applied a little bit more easily than what we’re having to go through here.” In any case, he said, he should have emphasized early on that his decision to let Mr. Drejka go free does not mean the state attorney won’t eventually charge him with a crime. Deputies expect to turn over their case file to prosecutors this week. The state attorney’s office declined to comment on Tuesday. Surveillance video from the July 19 shooting shows Mr. Drejka, 47, approaching a car parked in a handicapped space outside a Circle A convenience store. He starts arguing with the woman sitting in the car — Britany Jacobs, 25, Mr. McGlockton’s girlfriend — about parking without a handicap permit, according to the sheriff. Mr. McGlockton, who had been in the store, exits, approaches Mr. Drejka and pushes him to the ground. Mr. Drejka pulls out a gun. Mr. McGlockton, 28, appears to take a few steps back. Mr. Drejka shoots him once in the chest. Mr. McGlockton’s funeral on Saturday drew 250 people, including a Democratic candidate for governor. Another Democrat, Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the only black candidate in the governor’s race, called on Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in order to suspend the Stand Your Ground law. “The consequence of confusion over how Stand Your Ground is applied in this state can result in the loss of life of otherwise innocent people,” Mr. Gillum said. The governor, a Republican, has declined to comment on the shooting beyond expressing his condolences. His spokesman said Tuesday that Mr. Scott “expects that every Florida law be enforced and applied fairly by law enforcement and state attorneys, who are elected Floridians. If the Legislature wants to make any changes to clarify Florida’s laws next legislative session, they can do so.” Sheriff Gualtieri and Bernie McCabe, the state attorney for Pinellas and Pasco counties, are listed as co-hosts for a Tuesday night fund-raiser for Mr. Scott’s campaign for the United States Senate. Sheriff Gualtieri hoped to be joined at Tuesday’s news conference by representatives from the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and an alliance of African-American church ministers in a show of unity that might have quelled ongoing alarm over the shooting. But the two organizations bailed on the news conference, citing a Politico report published Monday that quoted the N.R.A. and G.O.P. lawmakers disputing the sheriff’s interpretation of Stand Your Ground. “It’s very rare that the N.R.A. and the Republican lawmakers who drafted and passed Stand Your Ground tell a sheriff that his version of Stand Your Ground is not applicable in this case,” Benjamin L. Crump, an attorney for Mr. McGlockton’s family, told The New York Times in an interview on Tuesday. “Michael Drejka should have been arrested that day, just like Markeis McGlockton would have been arrested had he pulled the trigger.” The unusual criticism from the gun lobby and legislators friendly to its cause came in response to several statements by the sheriff in a news conference on July 20, the day after the shooting. Sheriff Gualtieri said, among other things, that his office could be held liable in civil court for arresting a perpetrator who went on to successfully assert a Stand Your Ground defense. Marion Hammer, the N.R.A.’s longtime Tallahassee lobbyist and a key figure in promoting Florida’s emergence as a laboratory for gun-friendly legislation, said in an email to Politico that the law allows sheriffs to make arrests if they think they can prove a crime has been committed. “Nothing in either the 2005 law or the 2017 law prohibits a sheriff from making an arrest in a case where a person claims self-defense if there is probable cause that the use of force was unlawful,” Ms. Hammer said, according to Politico. “Nothing in the law says a person can sue the sheriff for making an arrest when there is probable cause.” She did not respond to a request for comment from The Times on Tuesday. The sheriff had also said that the law created a “largely subjective standard” for how a person who felt threatened could use deadly force in self-defense. The standard is objective, said state Senator Dennis Baxley, who helped write the law when he was in the state House. “It’s a reasonable person standard, and that means that any — any — reasonable person could look at the fact pattern and concur that he was threatened,” Mr. Baxley said in an interview on Tuesday. Sheriff Gualtieri, who has a law degree, said Tuesday that while he knows the standard is objective, “There’s a subjective component.” He noted that he must consider not only the surveillance video, shot from an angle to the right and behind Mr. McGlockton, but also the view from Mr. Drejka’s perspective, on the ground in front of Mr. McGlockton, as well as other evidence. The sheriff, who is white, dismissed any suggestion that his decision was driven by race, calling that “nonsense.” He pointed to two white defendants his office arrested in 2017 and 2012 who were later let go after the state attorney’s office declined to prosecute based on Stand Your Ground. An attorney for the 2017 defendant, a woman arrested on charges of second-degree murder in connection with the death of her abusive husband, notified the sheriff on May 15 that she intends to sue in civil court for false arrest and false imprisonment “without sufficient probable cause.” In a telephone interview with The Times, the sheriff said the pending litigation did not affect his decision in the McGlockton case, and instead he has evaluated the evidence. In the parking lot confrontation, he said, Mr. Drejka appeared to have “stuck his nose where it did not belong.” “Do I think that I would have shot in that situation? No,” the sheriff said. “But just because I would not have, or don’t believe I would have, doesn’t mean he’s not within the boundaries of the law.” In an earlier version of this article, a caption with a photograph misstated when the shooting of Markeis McGlockton occurred. It was on July 19, not July 22.",The New York Times
2018,N.R.A. Suit Claims Cuomo’s ‘Blacklisting’ Has Cost It Millions of Dollars,"The long-running battle between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and the National Rifle Association, which says it has lost millions of dollars because of state officials’ political agenda, entered another round of legal wrangling and public posturing this week. Mr. Cuomo announced on Friday that the state was moving to dismiss a lawsuit the N.R.A. filed in federal court in May, which he called “frivolous.” The lawsuit, which accused state officials of “blacklisting” the gun rights organization, was amended with sharper language last month. At issue is whether New York regulators violated the constitutional rights of the N.R.A. by preventing financial institutions and insurers in the state from doing business with the organization. In the lawsuit, the N.R.A. accused Mr. Cuomo, as well as the New York State Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Maria T. Vullo, of discrimination that violated the organization’s right to free speech. Last month’s amended complaint included more details about how state regulators have squeezed the organization. The N.R.A. said officials had discouraged banks and insurers, including Lockton Companies and Chubb Group Holdings, from working with it. If insurers remain wary, the organization said, it could be forced to shut down some of its programs, such as its online video channel, NRATV. “Defendants’ conduct indeed shocks the conscience,” the complaint said. Mr. Cuomo’s response on Friday was terse: “If I could have put the N.R.A. out of business, I would have done it 20 years ago.” While the complaint said the N.R.A. had “suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages” because of New York State officials, it did not make specific claims about the organization’s current financial standing. Much of the argument revolves around Carry Guard, an insurance program started by the N.R.A. last year that was meant to cover legal fees for people who fired a weapon in self-defense. New York financial regulators began investigating the program in October. That investigation was continuing when a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February. Survivors of the shooting have led protests in support of stricter gun control. Politicians have voiced their support, including Mr. Cuomo, who stretched out on a sidewalk to participate in a “die-in” with students in Lower Manhattan in March. Several businesses including car rental services, airlines, technology companies and insurers announced that they were cutting ties with the N.R.A. Three months after the Parkland shooting, the Department of Financial Services announced that Lockton and an affiliate would pay a fine of $7 million while Chubb and a subsidiary would pay $1.3 million for underwriting Carry Guard. According to the department, the program “unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for acts of intentional wrongdoing.” Days later, the N.R.A. filed its initial complaint, arguing that the state’s aims went far beyond its opposition to Carry Guard. “From the outset, it was clear that the investigation was meant to advance Cuomo’s political agenda by stifling the N.R.A.’s speech and retaliating against the N.R.A. based on its viewpoint on gun control issues,” it said, claiming that its constitutional rights had been violated through conspiracy and implicit censorship. Last month’s amendments added two more accusations: that state officials had interfered with potential revenue and that they had violated the N.R.A.’s freedom of association. “Defendants seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional rights advocates,” it said. “If their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed.” In announcing the filing to dismiss the suit, Mr. Cuomo said that “while the N.R.A. tries to play the victim, New York stands with the real victims — the thousands of people whose lives are cut short by gun violence every year.” The N.R.A. is a staunch, sometimes incendiary defender of the Second Amendment with a long record of hobbling regulatory efforts, grading legislators on their voting histories and running ads suggesting that the rights of gun owners are forever under siege. During the 2016 presidential election cycle, the N.R.A. spent $20 million to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and another $11 million in support of Donald J. Trump. Public records from that year showed that the organization’s expenses exceeded revenues by about $46 million. Donations to the organization spiked after the Parkland shooting, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. William Brewer, a partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors who is lead counsel in the organization’s lawsuit against the New York officials, said on Saturday that the N.R.A. is growing and “in good financial standing.” “However, the conduct of defendants, from the home state of the N.R.A., now threaten the financial growth and overall trajectory of the organization,” he said. On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo doubled down in his opposition to Carry Guard, announcing a “national effort urging states across the country to follow New York’s lead and outlaw” the insurance program. “At a time when Washington has completely abdicated its responsibility to protect the American people, states must lead,” he said in a statement.",The New York Times
2018,N.Y.U. Prevails in Case That Said It Let Retirement Plans Reap Excess Fees,"New York University has prevailed in a lawsuit that accused it of failing to properly oversee employee retirement plans and causing thousands of workers to pay millions of dollars in excess fees. In a decision issued on Tuesday, Judge Katherine B. Forrest of Federal District Court in Manhattan found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they suffered any losses or that N.Y.U. acted imprudently. While Judge Forrest ruled in favor of N.Y.U. on all claims, she did find “deficiencies” in the processes used by the university’s retirement plan committee. They included, she said, “a concerning lack of knowledge relevant to the committee’s mandate” displayed by several of its members. The suit was among about a dozen filed against prominent universities by Jerome Schlichter, a lawyer known as a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over roughly the past 12 years, Mr. Schlichter has brought more than 20 suits on behalf of workers enrolled in 401(k) retirement plans, and is widely recognized for helping to lower plan fees across corporate America. His most recent set of suits has largely involved 403(b) plans. The accounts, named for the section of the tax code under which they operate, are similar to 401(k) plans but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals. The N.Y.U. employees bringing the case, which they sought to have certified as a class action, accused the university of failing to meet its obligations under a federal law that requires employers that sponsor retirement plans to manage them in the best interests of employees. The plaintiffs argued that employees had collectively lost $358 million as a result of the alleged failure. John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said the university was pleased with the outcome. “N.Y.U. maintained from the time the plaintiffs first publicized this case that it was baseless, and the judge’s finding supports that,” he said. Mr. Schlichter, the managing partner of Schlichter, Bogard & Denton in St. Louis, said in a statement that his clients would appeal. “We respectfully continue to believe that retirement plan participants at universities that operate as nonprofits have the same rights and protections under the law to build their retirement savings as workers at for-profit companies,” he said. Broadly speaking, the 403(b) suits brought by Mr. Schlichter allege that the universities, as plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer their plans and did not replace more expensive, poorly performing investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the suits argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars. The N.Y.U. case involves two 403(b) plans covering faculty, research administration employees and members of the medical school staff. It was the first of Mr. Schlichter’s suits targeting universities to proceed to trial, according to the court decision. The plaintiffs claimed N.Y.U. did not use its leverage to select a single low-cost record keeper for administrative tasks like sending statements to employees, leading to years of excessive fees. The suit also singled out certain investments offered by the plan, including the TIAA Real Estate Account and CREF Stock Account, arguing that they underperformed. (A spokesman for TIAA said the company looked forward “to continuing to provide high-quality products and services” for N.Y.U. and its employees.) A spokesman for Mr. Schlichter said he had nine cases involving university 403(b) plans pending in federal court. Two others — against the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern University — have been dismissed. Mr. Schlichter plans to appeal those rulings, his spokesman said.",The New York Times
2018,NADA Cancels Its New York Art Fair,"The New Art Dealers Alliance, or NADA, announced on Wednesday that it would cancel its annual New York art fair — one of many in a crowded scene that flares up each March around the Armory Show at the Piers — and open a new gallery for its members outside the city. NADA, a nonprofit organization that advocates contemporary art, has been a showcase for emerging talent and trailblazers for over 15 years. The group, based in New York, still has a year-round calendar of events and programs, including a major fair in Miami that will return in December, with no intention of scaling back. In lieu of its New York fair, NADA will “dedicate additional resources to gallery programming during the March Art Week,” it said in a statement, “with the ultimate aim of increasing both foot traffic and visibility of gallery exhibitions among its members.” In addition, NADA said that it planned to open a gallery space for its own exhibitions, with works from its member galleries. NADA didn’t specify where, and didn’t immediately respond to an interview request. “Producing alternative models for the public to engage with contemporary art has always been central to NADA’s mission,” Heather Hubbs, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement. NADA’s fair, which moved to West SoHo in 2017, has been well-established in New York; in March it exhibited works from 100 galleries from 17 countries. But it has faced increasing competition as small independent fairs, with a similar focus on contemporary art, proliferated in recent years. In an interview, Michael Plummer — who with his partner, Jeff Rabin, is a co-owner of Tefaf New York, a major player in the local and global art fair scene, said that NADA’s location likely didn’t help its prospects. “They were downtown, while the Armory Show is at the piers,” he said, referring to the contemporary and modern art fair held on Piers 92 & 94, closer to Midtown. “It’s also a time of year when it’s not necessarily easy to get around town,” he observed. “They had more obstacles than they did in Miami Beach.” Mr. Plummer added that NADA faces an uphill battle as a nonprofit competing with for-profit art fairs; he called NADA fairs “refreshing” and a good counterbalance to behemoths like Art Basel. “I think whenever a fair pulls back it’s an unfortunate thing,” Mr. Plummer said. “So much sweat and love and tears go into it.”",The New York Times
2018,NASA Delays Parker Solar Probe Launch,"Early on Saturday, NASA postponed the launch of its Parker Solar Probe spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Another launch attempt is planned on Sunday at 3:31 a.m. Eastern, NASA said. Tory Bruno, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, the company that built the Delta 4 Heavy rocket carrying the spacecraft, summarized the events that tripped up the launch in a tweet: There are additional opportunities to blast off through Aug. 23 before the planets are too far out of alignment to accomplish the spacecraft’s planned course. The space agency has touted the mission as one that will “touch the sun.” Here is some background information on the spacecraft. The spacecraft will eventually pass within 4 million miles of the sun’s surface. That may still sound like quite a ways, but it’s close enough to skim through the sun’s outer atmosphere. Four million miles is about one-tenth the distance between the sun and Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system. The Parker Solar Probe is designed to expand our understanding of the sun, measuring electrical and magnetic fields, cataloging the ingredients of the solar wind and photographing the corona — the outer atmosphere that is millions of degrees hotter than the sun’s surface. Instruments on the spacecraft will be able to detect details that cannot be seen from farther away. At its closest approach, the outside of the spacecraft will reach 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, or about the melting temperature of steel. But a 8-foot-wide carbon composite shield will absorb the intense heat and keep the spacecraft and its instruments cool. The foam in the shield is so fluffy — 97 percent empty space — that it adds only 160 pounds of weight. A stream of charged particles — primarily protons and electrons — continuously flows outward from the sun through the solar system at a speed of about a million miles per hour. Earth’s magnetic field generates a bubble that deflects the solar wind around our planet and generates the beautiful aurorae, also known as the Northern and Southern lights, that flicker at night in the polar regions. Solar wind originates in the corona, but how it is generated is not fully understood. The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to fill in many of the blanks. It could devastate civilization. Occasionally, a huge explosion, called a coronal mass ejection, erupts from the sun, sending a larger-than-usual deluge of particles into space. In 1859, one of those explosions made a direct hit on Earth, disrupting telegraph wires in America and Europe. If the same thing happened today, it could cause continentwide blackouts, damaging transformers on the electrical grid, potentially requiring months to years to repair. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] In 2012, one of NASA’s sun-watching spacecraft, Stereo-A, detected an explosion comparable to the 1859 explosion. Fortunately, it was not aimed in Earth’s direction. The Parker Solar Probe is fairly small for a spacecraft, about the size of a car and weighing 1,500 pounds at launch. The spacecraft needs to be accelerated to break away from Earth’s gravity at high velocity. Thus, it is launching on top of a Delta 4 Heavy rocket, one of the most powerful currently available. On its first plunge to the sun, the probe will pass within about 15 million miles of the sun. That’s close enough for the instruments to collect some useful data, but the greater excitement will come later. The probe will also zip close to Venus, using that planet’s gravity as a brake to sap energy from its motion and allow it to spiral inward, closer to the sun. After seven such course changes, the probe will be in an 88-day elliptical orbit of the sun, with a closest approach of about 3.8 million miles. In total, the spacecraft will complete 24 orbits, and the mission is to end in 2025. On the later orbits, the strong pull of the sun’s gravity will accelerate the probe to 430,000 miles per hour, which will be the fastest human-made object ever. Until last year, the spacecraft was known as Solar Probe Plus. NASA renamed it for Eugene N. Parker, a retired University of Chicago astrophysicist who was the first to predict the solar wind. It is the first time NASA has named a mission for a living person. _____ Michael Roston contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2018,NASA Names Astronauts for Boeing and SpaceX Flights to International Space Station,"NASA has named the astronauts chosen to fly on commercial spacecraft made by Boeing and SpaceX to and from the International Space Station, the research laboratory that orbits around Earth. Their voyages are scheduled to begin next year, and they would be the first American astronauts to launch from United States soil since 2011. NASA retired its space shuttle fleet that year, and started sending astronauts to the I.S.S. aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, at a cost that has risen to $81 million per seat. “What an exciting and amazing day,” Jim Bridenstine, NASA’s administrator, said at the announcement at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. (Watch the full video here.) But a Government Accountability Office report published last month raised alarm bells that the project is running behind schedule, and could miss key deadlines. The delays could even result in a gap in American access to the space station, because NASA has contracted for seats on Soyuz only through November 2019, the report found. On Friday, NASA said that if uncrewed test flights go smoothly, the astronauts will fly before then, on roughly two-week test flights and later on missions of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. NASA worked closely with the companies to engineer both spacecraft. “The opportunity to fly in a new vehicle is any test pilot and astronaut’s dream,” Mike Hopkins, an Air Force colonel who will fly aboard the Crew Dragon on its first long-term mission, wrote on Twitter. Such missions usually last five to six months. Colonel Hopkins had previously spent 166 days on the I.S.S., and conducted two spacewalks. He’ll be joined by Victor Glover, a Navy commander who will be making his first trip into space. The test flight astronauts on the Crew Dragon, both of whom joined NASA in 2000, will be Col. Bob Behnken of the Air Force and Doug Hurley, a retired Marine Corps colonel. The Crew Dragon will launch aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The uncrewed test is planned for November; the test flight with crew aboard is set for April 2019. The astronauts assigned to the Starliner’s first mission are Sunita Williams, who retired as a Navy captain, and Cmdr. Josh Cassada of the Navy, who will be making his first voyage into space. Captain Williams has spent 322 days aboard the I.S.S. since becoming an astronaut in 1998. While she was there in 2007, she completed the Boston Marathon — on a treadmill — in 4 hours 24 minutes, marking the first time an entrant had finished the race from orbit. On the test flight for the Starliner will be: Eric Boe, a former space shuttle pilot who retired from the Air Force; Christopher Ferguson, a Boeing astronaut who left NASA in 2011; and Lt. Col. Nicole Mann of the Marine Corps. It would be the first space trip for Colonel Mann. The Starliner will launch aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The uncrewed test flight is scheduled for late 2018 or early 2019. The test flight with crew is scheduled for mid-2019. Douglas Stanley, head of the National Institute of Aerospace in Hampton, Va., said it’s crucial for the United States not to depend on Russia to conduct space research. “We’re very pleased to see it happen,” he said. “We think its very important for the nation to have a domestic capability to launch astronauts.” Maintaining the I.S.S. costs the federal government up to $4 billion a year, and NASA is working on plans to privatize it. The Trump administration proposed eliminating direct federal funding for the station by 2025, and allocating money to commercial entities who could operate it. But NASA’s options may be limited by the international agreements that established the station in 1998. Both Boeing and SpaceX are also working with Bigelow Aerospace, a Las Vegas company that intends to launch private space stations into orbit, to be leased to nations or companies. The contracts for travel to the I.S.S. were awarded in 2014. Boeing received a $4.2 billion contract, and SpaceX’s was for $2.6 billion. The contracts call for six missions, with as many as four astronauts per mission, for each company. John M. Logsdon, the founder of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, noted that buying a service from commercial providers is a major departure from how the space program has operated historically. He applauded the move. “It’s a step toward broadening the means of access to space so it’s not just a government monopoly,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,NASA’s New Horizons Spacecraft Takes First Picture of Distant Rock It Will Visit,"trilobites The mission’s scientists were pleasantly surprised that the camera aboard the robotic probe could see the Kuiper belt object, known as 2014 MU69, so soon and from so far. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft still has 100 million miles to go, but it has taken its first snapshot of the space rock that will be its date for New Year’s Day 2019. Mission scientists said they were a bit surprised that the camera on New Horizons was able to make out the tiny object, no more than 20 miles wide, so soon and from so far away. The image shows a dim dot amid a background of distant stars. Over the coming months, the dot, which has the designation 2014 MU69, will become brighter and larger as New Horizons approaches. Calculations originally indicated that the spacecraft would not be able to reliably spot the target until at least mid-September. “We thought it’s worth giving it a shot a month early,” said Harold A. Weaver Jr., a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the principal investigator of the long distance camera aboard New Horizons. At first glance at any one image, all that can be seen are stars. But in 48 images taken by New Horizons, the scientists were able to subtract the starlight, leaving behind a speck of MU69 right where they expected it to be, at the edge of a much brighter star. “The whole team is jazzed now,” Dr. Weaver said. In an email, S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, said, “This is good news because it helps our navigators better plan trajectory corrections.” [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] On Jan. 1, 33 minutes after the ball drops in Times Square, the spacecraft is to zip within 2,200 miles of MU69. It will be the first close-up observation of a small Kuiper belt object, one of the clumps of ice and rock beyond the orbit of Neptune. Three years ago, New Horizons visited the largest Kuiper belt object: Pluto. That revealed a complex and dynamic world with towering mountains of ice, flat-as-a-sheet plains and possibly even a subsurface ocean. MU69 is of curiosity to planetary scientists because it is expected to be the opposite: small, simple, unchanging. Almost pristine and undisturbed since the birth of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, it will provide clues of the early building blocks that coalesced into planets. Until now, scientists have only seen MU69 through images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. They gathered more data last summer by chasing shadows. By fortuitous circumstance, MU69 passed in front of three stars within a two-month period, causing the stars to momentarily blink out. The duration of those blinks, as the shadow of MU69 moved across Earth’s surface, would give clues about the size and shape. On the first two tries, the scientists were not quite in the right place and missed the shadow. On the third, they succeeded. The results suggested that MU69 is long and thin in shape or actually two objects in orbit around each other. Later, they suggested MU69, as small as it is, might have a tiny moon. This month, MU69 again passed in front of a star, and New Horizons dispatched observers to Senegal and Colombia. The team again reported success and is in the middle of analyzing the data. But that means that the predictions of MU69’s orbit appear to be spot on. For now, “That’s really all we can say,” Dr. Stern said. In March the mission scientists gave the MU69 an unofficial nickname: Ultima Thule, which in medieval times meant “beyond the known world.”",The New York Times
2018,"NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Is Named for Him. 60 Years Ago, No One Believed His Ideas About the Sun.","Eugene N. Parker predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The NASA spacecraft is the first named for a living person. CHICAGO — It was 1958. Sputnik had launched only a year earlier, the first human-made object to circle the planet. But the beach ball-size spacecraft had no instruments to measure anything in space. The study of what was up there was largely limited to what scientists could observe from the ground. It certainly looked like the vast expanses between planets were empty. And that is what most scientists believed. But not Eugene N. Parker, then a 31-year-old, no-name professor at the University of Chicago. In a foundational paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, Dr. Parker described how charged particles streamed continuously from the sun, like the flow of water spreading outward from a circular fountain. Almost no one believed him. “The prevailing view among some people was that space was absolutely clean, nothing in it, total vacuum,” Dr. Parker recalled during an interview at his home. The scientists who had reviewed the paper rejected his idea as ludicrous. Dr. Parker appealed to the journal’s editor, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a prominent astrophysicist also at Chicago, arguing that the reviewers had not pointed out any errors, just that they did not like the premise. Dr. Chandrasekhar overruled the reviewers. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Four years later, Dr. Parker was vindicated when Mariner 2, a NASA spacecraft en route to Venus, measured energetic particles streaming through interplanetary space — exactly what Dr. Parker had predicted. Scientists now call that stream of particles the solar wind. Sixty years after Dr. Parker’s paper, NASA is about to launch a spacecraft that is to dive into outer wisps of the sun’s atmosphere and gather information about how our star generates the solar wind. It is the Parker Solar Probe, named after Dr. Parker, now 91 years old. It is the first time that NASA has named a mission for a living person. Dr. Parker, two decades into his retirement from the University of Chicago, is frailer now than when he made a trip to the North Pole with his son Eric in 2004. His apartment here, overlooking the Museum of Science and Industry, is decorated with some of his intricate wood carvings. He still gets around. Last October, he traveled to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where the spacecraft was built, for a “Parker, meet Parker!” encounter. Four generations of Parkers have traveled to Florida to watch the liftoff, scheduled for pre-dawn Saturday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station during a 65-minute window that starts at 3:33 a.m. NASA TV will broadcast the launch beginning at 3 a.m. Eastern time. [Update: The launch was postponed, and could occur on Sunday.] *** Dr. Parker did not set out to revolutionize the science of the sun. He did not even have much interest in interplanetary science although he was seeking a research career. But academic jobs were scarce. Dr. Chandrasekhar put in a good word for him when a Chicago physics colleague, John A. Simpson, was looking to hire someone to help study the mysterious particles known as cosmic rays. The thinking was that even though cosmic rays originate far away in other galaxies, the cascades of collisions they cause close to Earth might reveal something about the contents of the interplanetary neighborhood. That led to solar physics. “I discovered it was a fascinating subject,” Dr. Parker said. Since the 1800s, scientists did know that at least sometimes explosions from the surface of the sun affected Earth. That included one on Aug. 29, 1859. That day, two English amateur astronomers, Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson, independently observed a “white light flare” emanating from the surface of the sun. Less than a day later, Earth’s magnetic field was knocked awry. Across America and Europe, telegraph wires sparked and failed. Fewer than 18 hours elapsed between the flare and the geomagnetic storm on Earth. That meant whatever had exploded off the sun must have traveled at more than 5 million miles per hour. Scientists had no idea what that might be. Comets provided another clue. The tail of gas and dust coming from a comet does not flow behind the comet as one might expect, but instead its direction always points away from the sun. A German astronomer, Ludwig Biermann, suggested that particles emitted from the sun — what he called solar corpuscular radiation — were shaping the comet tails. (“Corpuscular” is a fancy word that means “consisting of tiny bits of something.”) “That is an important piece of information,” Dr. Parker said. “All comet tails have this property so in all directions at all times, the sun is emitting something or other.” Dr. Parker’s crucial insight was that this flow of particles would follow the same dynamics as wind and water. The calculations showed that the flow started slow near the sun and accelerated as it moved farther away, passing Earth at supersonic speeds. “That really stuck in people’s craw,” he said. That is what he wrote down in his 1958 paper. “It was widely disbelieved,” Dr. Parker said. “I even had people say, ‘Well, you know, it was a great idea, too bad it was wrong.’ I said, ‘I don’t see why it’s wrong.’” The skepticism did not worry him. Fluid dynamics is a direct derivation from Newton’s laws of motion. After Mariner 2, “everyone agreed the solar wind existed,” Dr. Parker said. *** While Dr. Parker moved on to other problems in astrophysics, a close-up visit to the sun has been on NASA’s to-do list since the 1950s. Over the decades, various sun-watching spacecraft have observed the sun, but always from a distance. In 2005, at NASA’s request, engineers at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. proposed the Solar Probe, a mission that would swoop within 1.8 million miles of the sun. But it would have cost more than $1 billion at the time and it required a plutonium power source that NASA didn’t want to use. Because of the intense heat, the mission would have been over after two flybys. NASA sent the engineers back to see if they could trim the price tag to under $750 million and eliminate the plutonium. To do that, the spacecraft would not fly as close. But that had a major benefit; the spacecraft would make 24 orbits instead of two, gradually moving inward, and gather much more data. NASA gave the go-ahead and renamed the revised concept Solar Probe Plus. Earlier NASA missions have been given new names shortly before or after launching to honor scientists or noteworthy people in NASA’s history. Last year, Dr. Parker got a phone call from Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator for the science directorate, saying that NASA wanted change the name to Parker Solar Probe. Dr. Parker said he was surprised and seemed bemused that NASA was asking for his permission. “I said, ‘Of course, I don't mind,’"" Dr. Parker said. The data from the Parker Solar Probe could help explain the remaining mysteries of how the sun works, in particular how the sun’s atmosphere — the corona — reaches millions of degrees Fahrenheit while the surface of the sun is a relatively cool 10,000 degrees. Dr. Parker is curious about the data but does not expect to come up with the answers. “I've retired,” he said, “so someone else can swipe that one.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a laboratory. It is the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, not the Applied Research Laboratory.",The New York Times
2018,"NATO, Extreme Heat, Chess: Your Friday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A NATO revelation, scorching heat that’ll only get worse, and a 9-year-old chess star who may have to leave Britain. Here’s the latest: • When President Trump refused to sign off on the final communiqué of a G-7 meeting in Canada, there were warning signs that he might do the same at the NATO summit meeting last month. He didn’t — and now we may know why. Senior U.S. officials pushed to finalize a NATO deal before the meeting even began, in an effort to ensure that Mr. Trump did not reject it. The rushed machinations were another sign of the lengths to which the president’s top advisers will go to protect the alliance from Mr. Trump’s antipathy. Also from Washington comes what Vice President Mike Pence called “the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces.” He shared details about Mr. Trump’s proposed new branch of the military: the Space Command. _____ • You think it’s hot now? Just wait. Globally, this is shaping up to be the fourth-hottest year on record — the only years hotter were the three previous ones. The devastating effects have been felt from California to Greece to Japan. Above, a woman shading herself from the sun in New York. And it’s too early to call it the new normal. Heat waves are bound to get more intense and more frequent as emissions rise, scientists have concluded, threatening basic necessities like food supply and electricity. _____ • He’s been called Britain’s “greatest chess prospect in a generation.” But Shreyas Royal, a 9-year-old prodigy born in India, is being forced to leave the country. Shreyas’s family is fighting to stay in Britain after his father’s work visa runs out. The case hinges on Britain’s strict enforcement of its immigration laws, the nature of his father’s visa and even the question of whether chess is a sport. “It is just bureaucracy gone mad,” said the president of the English Chess Federation. _____ • The former Uzbek fishing port of Muynak is more than 75 miles from the shores of the Aral Sea. Abandoned boats are long rusted. Salt still sticks to your skin. The sea vanished from Muynak around 1986, partly because of industrialized agriculture and climate change. Yet tourism is booming. “A lot of people want to see an ecological crisis,” said the head of the Uzbek branch of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. • Hundreds of companies have asked the Trump administration for exemptions from its sweeping aluminum tariffs. One of the few that briefly succeeded was a Russian firm currently subject to Treasury Department sanctions. Meanwhile, Russia’s ruble plunged after the U.S. announced new sanctions on the country. • The Infowars app is trending after Google, Facebook and Apple purged content from the right-wing conspiracy site from their platforms. • Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note9, its latest big-screen smartphone.

The Sarajevo Film Festival begins today in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The red carpets, more than 200 screenings and hundreds of thousands of euros in prizes are a far cry from the festival’s origins during the siege of Sarajevo and the Bosnian War in the 1990s. In 1993, Haris Pasovic, a Bosnian director, helped organize a gathering with the title “Beyond the End of the World,” which was inspired by one of the films that were screened: “Until the End of the World,” by the German director Wim Wenders. At the time, a reporter asked Mr. Pasovic, “Why are you holding a film festival in the middle of a war?” “Why are they holding a war in the middle of a film festival?” he replied. In an interview the next year, he said, “People have to have food for their souls.” The gathering lasted 10 days, but screenings continued through a separate organization, culminating in the inaugural Sarajevo Film Festival in the fall of 1995. About 15,000 people risked their safety to watch 37 films from over 15 countries, some of which were smuggled in by their own directors. Soon after the first festival closed, the Dayton peace accord was signed, ending the Bosnian War.

2018,NPR Is Criticized After White Nationalist Ranks the Races by Intelligence on Air,"An NPR interview with the organizer of last year’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., ignited complaints on Friday about how news organizations cover white nationalism. In a “Morning Edition” segment, the radio host Noel King interviewed Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who is planning a rally in Washington this weekend on the anniversary of last year’s rally, which was the scene of racist chants and deadly violence. Ms. King preceded the discussion, which was part of a weeklong series about the anniversary of the Charlottesville rally, with a warning: “Some of what you’re about to hear is racist and offensive.” She was correct. In the interview on Friday, which lasted about five minutes, Mr. Kessler relayed junk science and ranked the intelligence of various races. Ms. King at times pushed back and interrupted Mr. Kessler. Before he made his remarks on race-ranking, which he has supported by citing a political scientist, she said the scholar’s work had been “debunked by scientists and sociologists, and is deemed racist by many.” She asked Mr. Kessler: “You said that you’re not a white supremacist, but you do think there are differences between races. What are the differences?” After he answered with his intelligence rankings, claiming black people were the least smart, she said: “You don’t sound like someone who wants to unite people when you say something like that. You sound like someone who wants to tick people off.” Critics said the interview allowed Mr. Kessler too much leeway to spread his message. “The interview appropriately used some degree of skepticism, but not enough,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, was among those who suggested Mr. Kessler never should have been interviewed. NPR is far from alone among news organizations wrestling with how to cover the rising threat of white nationalism while not inadvertently lending the movement credibility. The New York Times, for one, fielded criticism in November of a profile of a white nationalist, prompting a response from The Times’s national editor and the reporter. Mr. Greenblatt said that simply ignoring the white nationalists and supremacists was not an answer. The A.D.L. has documented an increase in extremist activity in recent years, and he said it was important for news outlets to cover the story so people can understand how bigotry spreads. But journalists have a responsibility to avoid becoming accidental conduits of hate, he said. Mr. Kessler’s views, he added, could have been conveyed without directly interviewing him. “I don’t think it’s helpful to hand the microphone to an individual like Kessler, who has demonstrated again and again he’s not really interested in contributing to the public conversation,” Mr. Greenblatt said. NPR stood by the report on Friday. Terence Samuel, the deputy managing editor of NPR News, said in an interview that he was “proud of the job Noel did this morning.” “I think it’s important for us to cover race and racism, and quite frankly, if you’re going to do that, you have to talk to racists,” he said. “It’s uncomfortable, but we do that all the time.” Kenya Young, the executive producer of “Morning Edition,” said editors were satisfied that Ms. King had asked the right questions and pushed back sufficiently. And she disagreed with criticism that Mr. Kessler shouldn’t be interviewed. “I don’t know how you tell this story without talking to the person who was at the center of it,” she said.",The New York Times

2018,"Nafta Is Suddenly in Doubt, and Canada Reels","TORONTO — First the American president started a trade war with Canada, one of the United States’ closest allies and trading partners, imposing tariffs on the country’s steel and aluminum. Then, he called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak,” shattering what was expected to be his moment of glory on the world stage at the Group of 7 conference in Quebec. Now, President Trump has gone behind Canada’s back and negotiated what he calls a trade deal with Mexico, leaving Canada on the sidelines. He has also threatened to impose hefty tariffs on cars, one of Canada’s most important exports. The power play has sent the country reeling, with trade lawyers trying to gauge how much of Mr. Trump’s threat was negotiation bluster versus directive, and economists sorting through what a world without the North American Free Trade Agreement would mean for Canada. Most conclude that an end to Nafta in itself would not severely harm the country’s economy, although it could chill international investment — but that Mr. Trump’s threatened 25 percent auto tariff would be disastrous. “This would be enough to throw us into a recession because the auto industry is so important to Canada,” said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency. “We are in uncharted territory here.” It’s the biggest rift yet in the relations between the two nations, and one that could have the biggest practical import. In recognition of the stakes, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, cut short a visit to Europe and rushed to Washington to shoulder her way back into the bargaining room, although her spokesman said that the government’s position had not changed, and that it would only sign a deal that was good for Canada. At the same time many leaders in Congress, which must approve any trade pact, have expressed reservations about leaving Canada out. And if Mr. Trump intends to partner only with Mexico, he will also need congressional approval to bring Nafta to a close. That Mexico has seemingly usurped Canada’s place as the primary trading partner with the United States struck many in Canada as deeply offensive. Only a year ago, the debate in Canada was whether to abandon Mexico at the negotiation table. In the end, Canadian politicians insisted that any deal would need to involve Mexico, even though it was then the focus of Mr. Trump’s ire over trade and immigration. The first iteration of Nafta was the Free Trade Agreement, signed between the United States and Canada in 1988, six years before the accord was expanded to include Mexico. Since then, the Canadian economy has become so intertwined with its larger American neighbor to the point that three-quarters of Canadian exports go across the border. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] But times have changed since Nafta abolished the high tariffs of 30 years ago. The later agreement that created the World Trade Organization has reduced tariffs to the point that even without Nafta, the majority of goods crossing the Canadian-American border would not face significant price increases. Economists at the Royal Bank of Canada predicted that the cost to Canada’s economic growth of leaving Nafta — based on tariffs alone — would lower Canada’s economy by about a 1 percent spread over 5 to 10 years. However, the true strength of Nafta for Canada’s economy has been the international investment it draws. That is why Canadian negotiators have always been insistent on maintaining the deal’s procedures for appealing American trade actions against Canada, and why Prime Minister Trudeau has called Mr. Trump’s demand that any new agreement contain an expiration date an absolute deal-breaker for his country. “That gives international businesses assured market access, which is key to making Canada an attractive place to invest to serve the North American market,” said Dan Ciuriak, the former deputy chief economist in Canada’s foreign affairs and trade department. “For business, uncertainty is a cost.” In the tentative deal announced Monday, both the United States and Mexico agreed to a type of expiration clause, reviewing the pact every six years that would extend its lifetime for 16 more years, officials said. Whether the extension of an expiration date will appease Canadian negotiators is unclear. Trump administration officials said the tariff appeals process had been removed from the tentative trade agreement with Mexico. Canada is highly unlikely to accept that omission because its creation was the dealmaker for the original Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trump’s threat of a 25 percent duty on Canadian-made cars and auto parts is a powerful one, however, as the overwhelming majority of Canadian production ends up in American showrooms. An analysis by the Toronto-Dominion Bank forecast that 160,000 jobs would be lost, most of them in Ontario, the country’s most populous province. Ontario would also see an economic slowdown similar to that prompted by the 2008 financial crisis. The United States and Mexico have said they would like to sign a deal by Friday, but many Canadian trade lawyers argue that the deadline is untenable, given that many of the chapters in the phonebook-sized agreement remain in limbo. Lawrence L. Herman, a Toronto trade lawyer and former Canadian diplomat, said Canada’s only strategy this week is to essentially buy time — showing a willingness to negotiate more aggressively — making it unlikely that Congress would accept any request from the Trump administration to accept a trade agreement without Canada. While both the American and Mexican presidents want to complete a deal quickly, Canada has a federal election in just over a year from now. That means Mr. Trudeau will have to balance whether a trade deal full of Canadian concessions is better than an end to Nafta and heavy tariffs on the country’s important auto industry. “The best option is Canada kicks the can down the road, shows the deadline is artificial and calls Trump’s bluff,” said Mr. Cross, the former government economist who is now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group in Ottawa. “But that’s very, very risky.” Mr. Trump’s unpredictable negotiating tactics might have given him the upper hand this week, but in the long run, this same quality could undermine Nafta’s potential relevance to Canada. “I hope Minister Freeland leaves Washington without signing a deal,” said Mr. Ciuriak, who is now a senior fellow with the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. “If you are not prepared to follow the rules, signing onto an agreement hardly gives you any protection,” he said. “Tomorrow’s Tweet can undo anything you just signed.”",The New York Times
2018,"Nafta, Google, Trump: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “This is a really big deal.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, above, said they were moving “full steam ahead” to try to save a trilateral agreement on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Ms. Freeland said she was “encouraged by the progress that the U.S. and Mexico have made, particularly on cars and labor.” The last-ditch discussions came a day after the Trump administration announced it had revised the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada out, which could leave its economy reeling. Ms. Freeland must decide by Friday whether to join the revised pact. So far, the biggest changes deal with how to avert automobile tariffs, a topic closely watched around the world. _____ 2. Primaries: In Arizona, Joe Arpaio is among the Republicans facing off for a shot at replacing Senator Jeff Flake, an outspoken Trump critic. And there are governors’ races there and in Florida. We’ll have live results this evening. In the meantime, here are the top issues to watch. And a panel of judges ruled again that North Carolina’s congressional map was unconstitutional, and was unfairly drawn to favor Republican candidates. The decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. _____ 3. President Trump attacked Google because search results turn up news stories from mainstream news organizations, which tend to be critical, rather than supportive views from lesser-known organizations. He hinted that he might take action, and later expanded his criticism to include Facebook and Twitter. “I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful,” he said. And Monday night, at the White House State Dining Room, Mr. Trump urged evangelical leaders to use their pulpits to help Republicans win in the midterm elections. That’s according to an audiotape of his remarks provided to The New York Times by someone who attended the event. _____ 4. It’s hard to separate Elon Musk from Tesla, the company he leads. He’s the force behind the decisions at the company, responsible for everything from its push into renewable energy to the design of the air vents in its newest electric car. But after a tumultuous month, when Mr. Musk’s impulsiveness sent investors and the market into a frenzy, many are wondering: Is that kind of chaos good for the company? And California’s state Legislature voted to require that 100 percent of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources. The bill gives the state until 2045 to meet the goal. _____ 5. The toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in stark numbers: A new report found that nearly 3,000 more deaths than expected occurred in the months after the storm — about a 22 percent spike. It’s the first official independent assessment of the disaster, where in some cases the damage unfolded over several months. Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned the study after The Times and other media outlets and researchers last year estimated that the death count far exceeded the government’s official toll of 64. _____ 6. “I never got to meet her, I never got to tell her that I love her. But I’ll be damned if I ain’t gonna say goodbye to her.” That was one of the thousands of Aretha Franklin’s fans who paid their respects — and registered the impact her music had on their lives — at a public viewing in Detroit. They began gathering Monday night at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History for Tuesday’s viewing, in a line that stretched for blocks. There will be another 12-hour viewing on Wednesday. A private, invitation-only funeral will be held on Thursday. _____ 7. American Roman Catholic leaders are in open conflict over the explosive allegations that Pope Francis knew about, and ignored, accusations of sexual abuse against a now-disgraced American cleric. The accusations came in a letter from the Vatican’s former envoy to the U.S. Our Rome bureau chief writes, “With the letter — released in the middle of the pope’s visit to Ireland — an ideologically motivated opposition has weaponized the church’s sex abuse crisis to threaten not only Francis’ agenda but his entire papacy.” (He speaks about the story on “The Daily” podcast.) And Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s attorney general, spoke about his role in pushing forward the grand jury investigation that found decades of Catholic abuses and cover-ups in his state: “It just was the most purposeful thing, short of giving life to our four children, I’ve ever done in my life.” _____ 8. News from the U.S. Open: It’s too hot. With temperatures climbing into the 90s, the tournament instituted a new heat-wave rule for men’s matches, allowing them to take a 10-minute break between the third and fourth sets. (There was already one in place for women after the second set.) Caroline Wozniacki, the No. 2 seed, above, earned her first victory in nearly two months, beating Sam Stosur, 6-3, 6-2. Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic will also take to the courts today. We’ll have live updates of the matches. _____ 9. Louis C. K. made a surprise appearance at the Comedy Cellar in New York over the weekend. Was it #MeTooSoon? It was his first performance since admitting last year to sexual misconduct with women in the comedy world. He did a 15-minute set that touched on what the club owner called “typical Louis C. K. stuff” — racism, waitresses’ tips, parades. “It sounded just like he was trying to work out some new material,” the owner said, “almost like any time of the last 10 years he would come in at the beginning of a new act.” _____ 10. And finally, a story you don’t hear every day. Thousands of bees swarmed part of Times Square (not all that far from your briefing writer, who was mercifully indoors). They zoomed around and then settled on a hot-dog vendor’s stand. Well, the New York City Police Department has beekeepers. Officer Michael Lauriano sucked up the insects with a large vacuum cleaner.

2018,"Nafta, John McCain, Coca-Cola: Your Friday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Justice Department on Thursday supported the claims of plaintiffs in a lawsuit that contends the university’s affirmative action policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants. In the case, which could have far-reaching consequences in college admissions, Harvard is accused of capping the number of qualified Asian-Americans to advance less-qualified students of other races. Harvard said it was “deeply disappointed” by the Justice Department’s decision. • We reported in July on how the lawsuit had shed light on little-known aspects of Harvard’s admissions process. • The industry awaits details of the preliminary agreement that President Trump and Mexican leaders announced this week, but analysts say that most companies will be able to comply with the conditions that have been disclosed. The preliminary deal would require companies to produce at least 75 percent of automobiles, measured by value, in North America to import cars into the U.S. duty free. That’s up from 62.5 percent under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Automakers would also have to use more local steel, aluminum, glass and other parts. • Mr. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs has sent other leaders scrambling. The European Union made a significant concession on Thursday, saying it would cut its existing penalties on automobiles to zero, provided the U.S. did the same. • The senator’s body will lie in state today in the Capitol Rotunda. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at a ceremony honoring Mr. McCain, who didn’t want President Trump to attend his funeral remembrances. Here are the latest updates. Mr. McCain’s coffin arrived in Washington on Thursday night, after a memorial service in Arizona that evoked his willingness to break with the Republican Party to defend what he believed were his country’s founding principles. • “He would not stand by as people try to trample the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment,” said Grant Woods, Mr. McCain’s first congressional chief of staff. Here are photographs from the week’s tributes to Mr. McCain, who died on Saturday of brain cancer. • As the world warms because of human-induced climate change, most of us can expect to see more days when temperatures hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit. See how your hometown has changed since the year you were born, and how much hotter it may get. • Separately, Orlando, Fla., is planning to generate all of its energy from carbon-free sources by 2050. • Led by neo-Nazis, a two-day demonstration this week in the city of Chemnitz came after an Iraqi and a Syrian were suspected in the killing of a German man. More marches are planned for Saturday amid an outpouring of anti-immigrant sentiment. • Germany has struggled to absorb nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders in 2015. • President Trump canceled raises for federal employees next year. “We must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course,” he said. • NBC News tried to stop Ronan Farrow’s reporting on the alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein last year, a former producer with the network’s investigative unit said. NBC denied the characterization, saying Mr. Farrow’s work was not broadcast-ready when he decided to take his reporting to The New Yorker. • Coca-Cola said today that it planned to buy Costa, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, for $5.1 billion. • President Trump’s charges that Google shows anti-conservative search bias is wrong, our tech columnist writes. But Google may well be biased against minorities and others who lack real-world power. • Do you respond to emails during your work commute? Maybe that should count as part of your workday. • U.S. stocks were down on Thursday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Small things can have big ramifications. • A few improvements will make an open office more bearable. • Recipe of the day: Homemade tiramisù can be transcendent. • In memoriam Paul Taylor was one of the greatest choreographers of modern dance. His works entered the repertoire of numerous dance companies, and his own company has been one of the world’s superlative troupes. He was 88. • The week in good news A mix-up on Twitter catapulted a popcorn seller in Texas into the hearts of Australians. It’s one of seven stories that inspired us. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with this week’s news? Test yourself. • Ready for the weekend The success of “Crazy Rich Asians” shows that movie audiences are starved for romantic comedies. We wrap up some of the other lessons for Hollywood as the summer movie season draws to a close. You can find all of this week’s film reviews here. On TV, we try the Amazon Prime series “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” starring John Krasinski, and offer other watching suggestions. Nine months after the comedian Louis C.K. admitted to sexual misconduct, he returned to the stage last Sunday. Is that too soon? Comedy clubs are ready to welcome him, but one of our critics isn’t so sure. We also suggest nine new books and, if you’re in New York City, a slate of cultural events. Lastly, on this long holiday weekend, we tip our hats to performers and others who work to enrich our cultural experiences. • Honey, I swept the floor! Why do so many husbands boast about completing simple chores? For one, it’s all about branding. Read this week’s Modern Love column. • No late-night TV this week Most of the comedy hosts are taking a break, so our roundup is, too. • Quotation of the day “He’d part company with you if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing that this project is bigger than yourself.” — Joseph Biden, former vice president and senator, during his eulogy for John McCain. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we’re reading Sheri Fink, a correspondent, recommends this investigation from BuzzFeed: “Christine Kenneally (full disclosure, a friend) spent four years piecing together witnesses’ and victims’ disturbing memories of physical and sexual abuse — and deaths — at St. Joseph’s, a Catholic orphanage in Vermont. The story excavates legal cases, probes the complexity of memory, and highlights similar patterns in orphanages that span the world.” Tennis tournaments can lead to debates about gear, and this year’s have been no exception (see: Serena Williams, catsuit). But few controversies can compare to the furor at the U.S. Open in 1977 over the so-called spaghetti racket. Michael Fishbach, a player from Long Island, qualified for the U.S. Open with a racket described by The Times as “doublestrung and reinforced with fishnet line, adhesive tape and plastic tubing, creating the spaghetti effect.” That made the ball spin and bounce in unpredictable ways. Mr. Fishbach, ranked 200th, upset his first- and second-round opponents. He lost in the third round, though even his opponent, John Feaver, said he was confounded by the bounce off Mr. Fishbach’s racket: “You don’t know what’s going on with the bloody thing.” Talk of a ban gained traction at another tournament, after a player walked off the court in protest during a match against Ilie Nastase, who was using a spaghetti racket. The United States Tennis Association banned the racket soon after, and the International Tennis Federation followed the next year, adopting a rule that defined a tennis racket for the first time. “The purpose, of course, is to get rid of the spaghetti racquet,” The Times wrote. Jillian Rayfield wrote today’s Back Story. _____ There will be no Weekend Briefing on Sunday and no Morning Briefing on Monday for Labor Day. We will return on Tuesday.

2018,"Nafta, John McCain, Pope Francis: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “They used to call it Nafta.” That was President Trump announcing that the U.S. and Mexico had agreed to revise key portions of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Above, packaging avocados for export in Michoacan. Mr. Trump, who has called Nafta the “worst” trade deal in history, said the new one would be called “the United States Mexico Trade Agreement.” But Nafta, of course, also includes Canada. The White House appears eager to pressure Canada to rejoin talks, and the Canadian foreign minister is due in Washington on Tuesday. _____ 2. John McCain “suffered fools poorly,” a former aide said, and his constituents in Arizona admired him for it. Above, memorials outside the mortuary holding his body in Phoenix. A pointed farewell statement, released on the senator’s behalf, said in part: “We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down.” And as many flags around the nation remained at half-staff to mourn Mr. McCain, the White House raised the flag back to full-staff, then lowered it again amid an outcry. _____ 3. Two people were killed when a gunman opened fire on Sunday at a video game tournament in Florida. He wounded numerous others before killing himself. The shooting, the start of which was streamed online, thrust e-sports — a young, growing and often little understood industry — into the national spotlight. Here’s the lowdown on e-sports and how they’ve become so popular. _____ 4. American officials are facing increasing questions about their support for the Saudi-led air war against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which began in 2015 and has sent the country spiraling into humanitarian disaster. The top U.S. air commander in the Middle East urged the Saudi coalition to be more transparent about an airstrike this month that struck a school bus, killing more than 40 children. Above, the funeral. “There’s a level of frustration we need to acknowledge,” said Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian. “They need to come out and say what occurred there.” _____ 5. Rudy Giuliani was once called “America’s mayor.” Now he’s better known as President Trump’s pit bull. Above, the two at a groundbreaking ceremony for a Trump building in 1995. Our team of reporters traced how he went from icon to shrewd — some say “untethered” — tactician. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani laid out for the first time his strategy for representing the president (for free, by the way). Since Mr. Trump is essentially having his day in court, he argued, his “jury is the public.” And Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, and Michael Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, are accused of falsifying construction permits in an attempt to force out rent-regulated tenants across New York City. _____ 6. On the papal plane back to Rome from Ireland, Pope Francis was asked about a claim that he helped cover up abuse allegations against the former Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick. The pope sidestepped. “I believe the statement speaks for itself,” he said. “And you have the sufficient journalistic ability to make your conclusions. It’s an act of trust.” Watch the video. Our Rome correspondent writes that the pope’s vague answer has only heightened a desire to know the facts. Here are the basics on the accusations. _____ 7. Juul, the e-cigarette company, says it never sought to lure teenage users. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether Juul marketed its devices to youth to get “customers for life.” The attorney general of Massachusetts, also investigating the company, contends that Juul has been luring teenagers to try the product and has introduced many to nicotine. The article highlights a public health dilemma. Cigarettes remain the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. But does encouraging people who are addicted to switch to the less harmful e-cigarettes inadvertently entice a generation of nonsmokers to try them? _____ 8. A shopping trip to marry the past and present. The writer Sheila Marikar and her intended, both children of Indian immigrants, planned their multiday Hindu wedding for California. But they did the shopping for it in Delhi. The trip “would root us back to our cultural homeland, this cacophonous place of silk hawkers and honking horns and a deal around every corner, where heavy velvet lehengas hang from shop windows like so many skinned chickens,” she writes in this essay for our Travel section. _____ 9. The U.S. Open began with a shock. Ninety minutes into the tournament, Simona Halep, the No. 1 seed in the women’s draw, lost to Kaia Kanepi, a 33-year-old Estonian who was ranked 44th. Above, Halep smashing her racket on the court. In honor of the tournament’s 50th anniversary, we put together a U.S. Open Special Report. Among the highlights: an interactive tour of the National Tennis Center, including the new Armstrong Stadium. _____ 10. Finally, our critic-at-large Amanda Hess returns to the small screen with new episodes of her video series, “Internetting.” Join her on a trip down the rabbit hole of weird internet content, into a universe of extreme bodybuilders, online astrologers and “unboxing videos” which show consumers simply … taking stuff out of boxes. There are 74 million such videos on YouTube. She ponders what they say about how capitalism feeds — and creates — consumerist desire.

2018,"Nafta, Pope Francis, Russia: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Canada scrambles for a trade deal, Russia prepares for military exercises and the U.S. Open is very, very hot. Here’s the latest: • “This is a really big deal.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, above, said officials were moving “full steam ahead” to try to save a trilateral version of a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Ms. Freeland said she was “encouraged by the progress that the U.S. and Mexico have made, particularly on cars and labor.” The last-ditch discussions came a day after the Trump administration announced that it and Mexico had made changes to Nafta and threatened to leave Canada out, which could leave its economy reeling. U.S. officials have given Ms. Freeland until Friday to decide whether to join the revised pact. So far, the biggest changes deal with how to avert automobile tariffs, a topic closely watched around the world. _____ • Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò accused Pope Francis of ignoring reports of abuse, plunging the church into chaos. And then he vanished. Last week, the former chief Vatican diplomat in the United States worked side by side with a conservative Vatican reporter to draft a 7,000-word letter that called for the pope’s resignation, accusing him of covering up sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. But once the letter was complete, Archbishop Viganò told the reporter, “Now that I have finished, I can leave, and leave Rome too.” The archbishop, above, seems to be settling old scores, our Rome bureau chief writes. A conservative traditionalist, Archbishop Viganò found himself iced out after Francis was elected pope. He clashed with superiors when he was sent from the Vatican to the United States, stripping away any chance at a cardinal’s hat. _____ • 300,000 troops and 900 tanks. Russia will hold its biggest military exercise since the height of the Cold War, the Kremlin says, citing an international climate that is “frequently aggressive and unfriendly toward us.” The Soviet-era drills, which include both land and air units, once aimed at preparing for war with China but are being reshaped. Now, Beijing is taking part. They will start on Sept. 11. Also out of Russia: The death of Senator John McCain will leave the Kremlin and its propaganda machine without its cherished punching bag and the central protagonist in their favorite conspiracy: “Russophobia.” _____ • “It felt like five billion degrees.” With temperatures climbing above 35 degrees Celsius, the U.S. Open instituted a new heat-wave rule for men’s matches for the first time, allowing them to take a 10-minute break between the third and fourth sets. (There was already one in place for women after the second set.) By the time the evening matches started last night, four male players had retired, citing the heat.

2018,"Nafta, Primary Elections, U.S. Open: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.S. and Mexico have agreed to revise key parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, leaving Canada’s role in the three-country pact uncertain. President Trump threatened on Monday to impose vehicle tariffs on the U.S.’ northern neighbor if it did not “negotiate fairly.” American lawmakers reacted with confusion and concern, uncertain if the agreement was legal or advisable, and some business leaders said Canada’s inclusion was crucial. The question now becomes whether a trilateral accord becomes a bilateral one, or whether Mr. Trump’s threats pressure Canada to return to the negotiating table and accede to many of his demands. The Canadian foreign minister will be in Washington today for talks. • Mr. Trump called the preliminary pact “maybe the largest trade deal ever,” but our fact-check says that’s false. • President Trump bowed to public and private pressure by praising Mr. McCain on Monday, two days after the Arizona senator’s death, and by ordering the flag at the White House to be flown at half-staff. The tributes were the first from the White House, one of few Washington institutions that hadn’t saluted the senator. Mr. Trump had refused repeated requests from senior officials, including his vice president and his chief of staff, to make a stronger statement. • Mr. McCain’s final words to the nation were delivered through a top aide on Monday. “We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe,” he wrote. Read his farewell statement. • Vatican intrigues usually remain behind medieval walls, but an unusually public quarrel that emerged over the weekend could threaten Pope Francis’ papacy. Some critics of Francis are calling for his resignation, after an 11-page letter by the Vatican’s former top diplomat in the U.S. blamed a “homosexual current” in the church hierarchy for rampant sexual abuse. The pope’s defenders say the unsubstantiated allegations are being used as part of a larger agenda against him. Church leaders in the U.S. are also in open conflict over the matter, with some rushing to the defense of the former diplomat, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò. • Need the basics?

In 1925, Ms. Benchley was recently divorced and looking for a job to provide for her son. A former teacher, she landed a temporary post as a bookkeeper at the San Diego Zoo, which had opened several years before and was growing. The job turned into a tenure of more than a quarter-century that would permanently change the institution. She quickly began to do more than her job required, sometimes instinctively identifying sick animals before keepers or veterinarians did. The zoo’s founder, Dr. Harry Wegeforth, offered her the top job of executive secretary in 1927. “You might as well run the place,” he reportedly told her, “because you’re already doing it anyway.” During the more than 25 years she spent on the job, Ms. Benchley wrote four books, and wrote and edited the zoo’s magazine, Zoonooz. “The Zoo Lady,” as she came to be known, retired in 1953 at age 70. In 1972, Ms. Benchley died in San Diego, where she was buried. Her gravestone features the face of a smiling gorilla.

2018,"Nancy Tuckerman, 89, Trusted Aide of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Dies","Nancy Tuckerman, a lifelong friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who became her social secretary when she was the first lady and continued to be her spokeswoman until her death in 1994, died on Wednesday in Salisbury, Conn. She was 89. The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her niece Phyllis Gay Palmer. Ms. Tuckerman was the first lady’s social secretary for only a few months, arriving at the White House in the spring of 1963, a bit more than two years into President John F. Kennedy’s term. But those months were eventful. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 In August of that year the Kennedys’ newborn son, Patrick, died shortly after birth. In November the president was assassinated in Dallas, and Ms. Tuckerman found herself helping the first lady deal with the trauma, the funeral preparations, an avalanche of mail and more. “She was very much in command of herself, aside from the shock,” Ms. Tuckerman said of the first lady a year later in an oral history recorded for the John F. Kennedy Library. “Obviously she was in a certain amount of shock, but she could operate and she could make sense, and she realized that she had to make certain decisions, and she did them simply beautifully.” Ms. Tuckerman, who was 34 when she went to the White House, nine months older than the first lady, was still at her friend’s side three decades later, by which time Mrs. Kennedy had become Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a form of cancer. Ever the loyal lieutenant, Ms. Tuckerman was not one to gossip about her famous friend and always sought to protect her privacy. Just a few weeks before Mrs. Onassis died on May 19, 1994, Ms. Tuckerman had told reporters asking about her hospitalization: “She goes in for routine visits, routine treatment. That’s what this is.” She acknowledged that she had deliberately played down the severity of Mrs. Onassis’s condition to prevent a news media sideshow. “I said what I thought was appropriate,” she told The New York Times on the day of Mrs. Onassis’s death. “We were trying to protect her and the children, because they could not make visits with ease.” Nancy Ludlow Tuckerman was born on Oct. 24, 1928, in Manhattan. Her father, Roger, was a stockbroker, and her mother, Betty Thompson Tuckerman, was an event planner. She said she first met Jacqueline Bouvier at 8 or 9 when both were students at the Chapin School in Manhattan. Later they were roommates at Miss Porter’s School, a college preparatory school in Farmington, Conn., where young Jackie tried with only limited success to teach her to ride a horse. Next to Jackie’s 1947 yearbook photo, it says that she can generally be found “laughing with Tucky,” Ms. Tuckerman’s nickname. Ms. Tuckerman had been a travel agent in New York City for about 10 years when her old friend, now the first lady, asked her to become her social secretary, taking over the job from Letitia Baldrige. “‘Tuck’ Replaces ‘Tish’ on Mrs. Kennedy’s Staff,” read a headline in The Times over a United Press International article announcing the news. “Miss Tuckerman is attractive with golden brown hair, blue eyes and a comely five foot five figure,” the article said, a sentence indicative of the tenor of the day. Reporters may have viewed the social secretary’s job with a certain condescension, but it required serious organizational skills, since Mrs. Kennedy was proving to be a popular first lady and the focus of countless requests. “I think we received about 800 letters a day,” Ms. Tuckerman said in the oral history. She also supervised other staff members and organized dinners and other White House functions. She took over the job just as the busy spring season was ending and Mrs. Kennedy’s pregnancy was leading her to reduce activities. But in early September 1963 she had her first chance to stage a major event, a dinner for the king and queen of Afghanistan. She and Mrs. Kennedy decided to include something new for a White House event: a fireworks display. The president, though, was hesitant. “He thought about it a great deal,” she said in the oral history. “In fact, he thought about it so much that he called me constantly to find out if the fireworks came from Japan, how long they would last and many other things — whether by law in Washington you could set them off other than the 4th of July.” A day before the event, the president, still nervous, told her to cut the fireworks display to five minutes, from 10. “The man who was setting off the fireworks didn’t quite understand or else he decided to make it more spectacular by putting the same amount of dynamite into five minutes because we’d paid for it,” she said. The result was a cacophonous show that rattled the whole city. “The switchboard in Washington, the police boards, everything was jammed up,” she said. “People thought the end of the world had come.” Less than three months later, on Nov. 22, Ms. Tuckerman was at the White House planning another dinner to be held three days later, this one for the chancellor of West Germany. She was painstakingly plotting where each of the 120 guests would sit when someone came in and told her about the shooting in Dallas. She kept the staff, though benumbed, focused, since everyone immediately had a long list of practical things to think about, including planning for the funeral and determining when Mrs. Kennedy would move out of the White House and where she would go. “Nobody collapsed, and you never discussed anything — never said ‘Why are we doing this’ or ‘Who do you suppose shot the president’ or ‘Who is doing what job?’,” she said in the oral history. “You just had so much to do that you never stopped to talk to anybody. At least that’s the way I felt.” Her immediate task was coordinating a small staff that responded to the letters of condolence that were coming in by the sackful. “It fluctuated for about a month between 20 to 30 to 40,000 each day,” she said. Ms. Tuckerman continued to act as a spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis and the Kennedy family, denying a divorce rumor involving Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis here (they had married in 1968), deflecting inquiries about whom a Kennedy child was dating there. She took a public relations job with Olympic Airways, which was owned by Mr. Onassis, and in the early 1970s helped arrange for that company to sponsor an early version of the New York City Marathon. “One of the things she was most proud of,” Ms. Palmer said, “was that she made sure it included women,” the participation of female runners in such races still being a matter of contention. In 1975 she became a book editor at Doubleday, and three years later Mrs. Onassis did as well; the two often worked together over the next 15 years. Ms. Tuckerman died at an assisted-living center and leaves nieces and nephews as survivors. (A White House predecessor, Mary Jane McCaffree Monroe, who was social secretary to Mamie Eisenhower, died on July 23.) Ms. Tuckerman never wrote a White House tell-all, but she did make use of what she had learned from a lifetime of traveling in select social circles for a different sort of book project. In 1995 she and a co-author, Nancy Dunnan, updated “The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette,” which had not been revised since 1978. They added material on subjects that Amy Vanderbilt, whose original guide was published in 1952, probably never imagined, like etiquette when on a cellphone or in the gym. (“Although it can be tempting, don’t stare at fellow exercisers while they are working on the machines.”) She was self-deprecating about her etiquette expertise, however. “The rules of basic etiquette are guided by two principles: being practical and being considerate,” she told USA Today in 1995. “I mean, it’s not that difficult. Anybody could write an etiquette book.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary misspelled the surname of Ms. Tuckerman’s predecessor as Jacqueline Kennedy’s social secretary. As the obituary correctly says, she was Letitia Baldrige, not Baldridge.",The New York Times

2018,Naomi Osaka’s Breakthrough Game,"Feature The 20-year-old is poised to burst into the top tier of women’s tennis. Can she also burst Japan’s expectations of what it means to be Japanese? CreditCreditChristopher Griffith for The New York Times. Styling by Paul Frederick; hair by Yoichi Tomizawa; makeup by Lennie Billy. The temperature in Boca Raton had soared above 90 degrees, but on a side court at the Evert Tennis Academy, Naomi Osaka was just digging into one of her last training sessions before the summer hardcourt season. Wearing leggings and a tank top — her magnificent mane of frizzy blond-tinted hair emerging from the back of her Adidas cap — the 20-year-old smacked crisp topspin groundstrokes with her coach, Sascha Bajin, a German of Serb descent best known for working as Serena Williams’s hitting partner for eight years. On the sideline, Osaka’s Japanese mother, Tamaki, sat in the shade in a denim jumpsuit and sunglasses, her daughter’s miniature Australian shepherd sitting by her feet. Pacing on the grass alongside the court was her Haitian-born father, Leonard Francois, a taciturn man in a baseball cap who trained her from age 3 and still tracks nearly every shot she hits. Some version of this simple scene — dutiful parents, a gifted child, the metronomic thump of a ball — plays out every day at tennis courts and sports fields across the world. Only in this case, the parents’ unlikely union has led to the emergence of one of the most intriguing young stars in sports today: an athlete who has grown up in one place (the United States), represents another (Japan) and, for some, symbolizes something as large as the world’s multicultural future. In playing under the flag of an island nation noted for its racial homogeneity, Osaka challenges assumptions about whether and under what circumstances a biracial person might be accepted as truly Japanese. For her part, Osaka, shy and quirky, with a penchant for unexpected candor, seems focused solely on becoming the next Serena. Her ambition, she once told a reporter, was “to be the very best, like no one ever was.” After a beat, realizing that her interlocutor was not tuned to her frequency, she explained: “I’m sorry; that’s the Pokémon theme song. But, yeah, to be the very best, and go as far as I can go.” On this searing afternoon, Osaka was amping up the velocity of her shots. “Ninety seconds!” shouted her conditioning coach, Abdul Sillah, looking at his stopwatch. Osaka and Bajin were halfway through their first three-minute drill, a baseline rally that lasts about 10 times longer than an average exchange in a match. The drill is meant to make the legs and lungs burn without affecting the pace and placement of the athlete’s groundstrokes. It also happens to goad Osaka’s competitive pride. After about 80 shots, by my count, neither she nor Bajin had missed. As the clock slogged on — “Two minutes!” Sillah said, then “Two and a half minutes!” — it was clear that each was trying to make the other crack. Osaka let out a shriek as she scrambled to return one of his deep shots down the line. As the last seconds ticked away, Osaka crushed a forehand crosscourt for a winner. “I hit with Serena almost every day for eight years, and Naomi’s weapons are just as big,” Bajin says. “She’s not afraid of center stage, either, and that’s why I believe she has greatness within her.” As the U.S. Open begins this week, Osaka may be a premature pick to lift this year’s trophy, but the prospect also wouldn’t be entirely outlandish. At 20, she is the youngest woman in the world’s Top 20 — and Japan’s highest-ranked female player in more than a decade. Serena Williams declared two years ago that Osaka was “very dangerous.” So it wasn’t a complete surprise when she put together a spectacular run in March at Indian Wells, in California, demolishing three current or former world No.1s on the way to her first W.T.A. title. Those upsets catapulted her up the rankings, from No. 68 at the end of 2017 to 17 by early August. “Ever since I can remember, I played better against bigger players on bigger courts,” she told me, her high, soft voice a contrast to the ferocity she displays on court. Tsuyoshi Yoshitani, a sports reporter with Kyodo News, says: “Naomi is like no Japanese player ever before. I think she will be the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam.” Yet Osaka’s rise is accompanied by a curious tension: She is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, representing a country whose obsession with racial purity has shaped her own family’s history. Though born in Japan, Osaka has lived in the United States since she was 3. She is not fully fluent in Japanese. Yet nearly a decade ago, her father decided that his two daughters would represent Japan, not America. It was a prescient move. Osaka’s success — and her tweeted affection for Japanese manga and movies — has endeared her to Japanese fans hungry for a female tennis star. What makes Osaka so complicated for Japan is precisely what makes her so appealing to many fans and corporate brands around the world. The young woman with the fearsome forehand and 120-mile-per-hour serve may not simply be the future of women’s tennis. “When I look 15 years into the future, I see Naomi having a great tennis career, perhaps even with Grand Slam titles,” Stuart Duguid, her agent at I.M.G., says. “But I also hope that she’s changed cultural perceptions of multiracial people in Japan. I hope she’s opened the door for other people to follow, not just in tennis or sports, but for all of society. She can be an ambassador for change.” In mid-June, Osaka’s mother, Tamaki, posted a tweet that was different from all the tennis, food and puppy updates that had filled her page before. This tweet featured a collage of three photos: one of Francois, shortly after the two met, wearing a black-and-white track suit; one of a younger Tamaki, smiling in a leather jacket; and one of their two toddler girls, with cherub-cheeked Naomi in front, two braids falling across her face. Above the nostalgic photos, Tamaki wrote a message that seemed at odds with the happy images: “was ‘disgrace’ to the family, had been in the desert&jungles for decades, I’m still surviving.” It was followed by two emojis — a flexed arm and a red heart — and a hashtag: #HappyLovingDay. June 12, the date the tweet was posted, is also known as Loving Day. It commemorates the 1967 Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia, which nullified antimiscegenation laws in 16 states (including Florida), the last places in America where people could go to jail for marrying across racial lines. The ruling had no impact on Tamaki, who was born a few years later in Japan. But her sense of solidarity came from an experience so profound that her Twitter handle has long been the date of her wedding and the word “liberty.” Japan’s long history of guarding against foreigners dates back to the 1630s, when the Tokugawa shogunate cut off the archipelago from the rest the world. The sense of separatism cultivated over the centuries remains strong today, especially in places like Nemuro, the coastal town where Tamaki grew up. In a country with one of the least ethnically diverse populations in the world, Nemuro — on the eastern tip of Hokkaido, Japan’s northern island — is a bastion of homogeneity. Tamaki’s world would open up, however, after her mother sent her to a high school in Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital. Among the early wave of foreigners coming to Sapporo around 1990, Tamaki met a handsome college student from New York. Leonard Maxime Francois was Haitian by birth and one of only a handful of black men in all of Hokkaido. The two started dating, keeping their relationship secret from her parents for several years. Tamaki says that when she was in her early 20s, her father wanted to talk about omiai, the matchmaking process that would lead to her arranged marriage. The truth then spilled out: Tamaki was already seeing someone — a foreigner who also happened to be black. Her father erupted in outrage, excoriating her for bringing disgrace on the family. The couple moved south to Osaka, where both Tamaki and Francois, whose Japanese was improving, found work. For more than a decade, Tamaki would have virtually no contact with her family. (Tamaki’s father could not be reached for comment.) Two daughters, Mari and Naomi, came in quick succession, born 18 months apart in Osaka. One evening in 1999, when the girls were just toddlers, Francois became transfixed by a broadcast of the French Open featuring the American prodigies Venus and Serena Williams, then 18 and 17, who teamed up to win the doubles title that year. Francois played little tennis. But Richard Williams, the sisters’ father and coach, had played none at all. And Williams had created a plan to turn his daughters into champions, teaching them how to serve big and hit hard from every corner of the court. “The blueprint was already there,” Francois told me. “I just had to follow it.” Naomi Osaka has few memories of her early years in Japan. The family left for the United States when she was 3, moving in with her Haitian grandparents on Long Island. There, with access to a gym and free public courts, Francois was able to initiate his plan in earnest. Girded with instructional books and DVDs, he made the girls hit hundreds, then thousands, of balls per day. “I don’t remember liking to hit the ball,” Naomi told me. “The main thing was that I wanted to beat my sister.” When they played sets, Naomi lost every time, usually 6-0. “For her, it wasn’t a competition, but for me, every day was a competition,” she says. “Every day I’d say, ‘I’m going to beat you tomorrow.’ ” It took 12 years before that watershed moment finally came. (Mari, whose early career has been slowed by injury, is now ranked No. 350 in the world.) For Osaka, the five years on Long Island evoke cultural memories too. “I grew up surrounded by both Haitian and Japanese culture,” she says. Her father’s parents, who spoke no English, filled the air with Haitian Creole and the aroma of spicy Haitian stews. Her mother spoke to her and her sister in Japanese, preparing seaweed-and-rice-ball snacks for them at school and dressing them in kimonos for international day. Their Asian side won out in another essential way. Instead of taking their father’s last name, the girls used their mother’s name — a Japanese surname that, improbably, is the same as the city of their birth. It was mostly a practical matter when they lived in Japan, helpful for enrolling in schools and renting apartments. But as the girls grew up in America, their name would become a constant reminder of the homeland that they would one day represent. The family moved to southern Florida in 2006 to focus on tennis full time. As other children went off on the school bus, the sisters trained most of the day on the Pembroke Pines public courts and were home-schooled at night. The girls grew in strength and talent, and in time, Tamaki decided they should meet their Japanese family, from whom she had been largely estranged for nearly 15 years. And so, when Naomi was about 11, she and her sister visited their grandparents in Japan. It wasn’t as joyful a homecoming as Tamaki might have hoped. Her parents took an interest in the girls, she says, but ridiculed their regime of home schooling and tennis training. Tennis was a hobby, they grumbled, not a profession. Back in Florida, the girls skipped many of the usual circuit of junior tournaments and, eventually, started competing against older players on the pro satellite tours, just as the Williams sisters had done. With a growth spurt in her early teens, Naomi soon towered over Mari. Video clips of the girls’ matches and training began circulating among coaches and agents, but neither sister had an impressive junior ranking or much tournament experience. The United States Tennis Association showed little interest in helping them develop. Rather than vie for support with hundreds of other talented young players in America, Francois made a pivotal decision: His daughters, from age 13, would play for Japan, the nation they left behind nearly a decade earlier. “My dad thought that since I grew up around my mom and I have a lot of Japanese relatives ... I don’t know. ...” says Osaka, letting the sentence drift off. Despite growing up in United States, with all the cultural references of a typical American youth, she told me: “I don’t necessarily feel like I’m American. I wouldn’t know what that feels like.” Her sister speaks almost fluent Japanese, but Osaka’s grasp on the language is more tenuous. “I don’t know if you guys know this, but I can understand most Japanese, and I speak when I want to,” she tweeted earlier this year, adding: “That applies to my family and friends.” She says she is too shy — and too much of a perfectionist — to speak the language publicly. Her reluctance can create awkward moments at news conferences, with Japanese reporters asking questions that she answers in English. The decision to play for Japan has had major repercussions in Osaka’s life, from the way she is perceived in Japan and the United States to the size of the endorsement contracts she can now command as a top Japanese athlete ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Though some in the tennis world wondered whether the decision was influenced by commercial prospects — the Japanese star Kei Nishikori’s massive endorsements were no secret — the family insists that the girls were too young and unproven for that to be a factor. The Japan Tennis Association, facing a drought of top female players, offered them an opportunity. But for Tamaki and Francois, who spent many years in Japan himself, it was natural for the girls to play in the country where they were born, even if the parent’s own memories of the place were tinged with anger and regret. The bearded man on stilts bellowed into a microphone, exhorting the crowd to chant her name: “Na-omi! Na-omi!” The hype machine was revving up for a World Team Tennis match, a nonranking format designed to turn the sport into popcorn-eating entertainment. In the stands of the Washington arena on this July evening, cheerleaders in slit white miniskirts and tight red tops swung their pompoms while young men paraded around twirling enormous cutout posters of Osaka’s likeness. Above the tennis court — a Mondrian-like matrix of green, purple, blue and red boxes — four giant screens broadcast images of its headline act on the court below. For the women’s singles match, one first-to-five-game set, Osaka was pitted against Taylor Townsend, an American ranked 44 places below her. It was expected to be a comfortable win for Osaka and her team, the Washington Kastles, but the circus atmosphere — and the pressure to win every game for a team that had brought her in just for this event, to help propel a playoff run — seemed to throw her off. Her first three service returns careered out of the court. As the errors piled up, a sore right calf got worse. At one point, the Kastles’ announcer pumped up the crowd. “Refuse to lose!” he yelled. “Get ’em up, get ’em up, get ’em UP!” Osaka still lost in a tiebreaker, dumping the final ball in the net and trudging off the court. Two hours later, Osaka sat courtside, stone-faced, as her Kastles teammates pushed the overall match into a deciding doubles tiebreaker. Mari had been waiting to go with her to the Beyoncé and Jay Z concert in Maryland that night. The sisters had been planning this outing for months, but the W.T.T. match was blowing right through the opening act. Earlier this year, when Osaka thought she might miss Beyoncé’s tour, she tweeted: “Tell me why Beyoncé decides to have a concert in Miami at the same time as the US Open. I’m legit gonna cry.” As the match dragged on, Osaka huddled with her personal team to discuss the situation. Her trainer warned against staying out late and dancing on her sore leg just two days before the summer’s first hardcourt tournament began. Her father agreed. Osaka and her sister, conferring quietly in Japanese so the others wouldn’t overhear, made the final decision together. After so many years of training and studying together, with few other friends or distractions around, Mari and Naomi have developed an indissoluble bond. Early on, Mari was the focus of attention. A childhood picture shows her hitting balls with her father while Naomi, her hair in curlers, wanders the court with a broom. Mari had phenomenal drive and balance — she even mastered the unicycle — and could hit the ball on the rise at an early age. Naomi showed little promise at first and was sometimes relegated to a side court with her mother while Leonard trained Mari. In a way, this shielded her from the pressure that piled up on Mari as their parents learned by trial and error how to coax the most out of their daughters. Today, as Naomi arrives at top tournaments and Grand Slams with a sizable entourage, Mari usually travels alone to low-level satellite events, often in small towns and cities. Even so, the sisters constantly conspire to hang out. Last year, the two played doubles together in a Tokyo tournament. “Here comes trouble, and make it double,” Naomi tweeted. In July, they joined the mobs at the Overwatch esports final at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, screaming every time a competitor was (virtually) shot. And they scored tickets for a Drake concert at Madison Square Garden just days before the start of the U.S. Open. On this night in Washington, as the W.T.T. carnival ended, Osaka slipped into the locker room and emerged moments later wearing a chocolate-colored pantsuit, her hair unleashed Beyoncé-esque. The Kastles’ owner was holding a team meeting on court, but the two sisters strode toward the exit without looking back. All the tennis fans could see at first were Osaka’s bright pink visor and her bundle of hair, bobbing up and down rhythmically. It was her first match of the summer hardcourt season, and Osaka was arriving at the Washington Citi Open’s grandstand court with her head down, blasting Kendrick Lamar on her headphones. The afternoon crowd — with a contingent of Japanese fans and journalists — applauded her arrival, but Osaka couldn’t hear them over Lamar’s lyrics. Music is part of the ritual that Osaka has used to block out distractions, gird for battle and confer good fortune. “I’m superstitious,” she told me. “If I win, I keep listening to the same song. I only change it when I lose.” Osaka hoped to listen to Lamar for many days to come, perhaps all the way to the summer’s culminating event, the U.S. Open. Pulling off her headphones, Osaka gave a bow to the umpire and to her first-round opponent, the Croatian-American Bernarda Pera. The polite Japanese gesture, a regular part of Osaka’s routine, has a gentility that seems at odds with the power she flexes on court and the stern expression on her face. “I think everybody who sees me would think that I’m really scary or something,” she told me. “But I’m not!” Osaka’s right calf was now wrapped in white tape, and she worried about her explosiveness off that side. As she pulled a racket from her bag, shouts of encouragement rang out from her biggest cheering section: Team Naomi, led by Bajin, her upbeat coach. Osaka glanced over at her crew, and her face transformed into a shy smile. “She plays better when she’s happy,” Bajin says. “If she’s only 60 percent happy on a given day, we’ve got to supply the other 40 percent.” If there’s any pattern to Osaka’s career thus far, it is that she tends to perform well on the big stage — and get distracted on the smaller ones. Last year, Osaka dismantled the defending champion Angelique Kerber in the first round of the U.S. Open 6-3, 6-1 and went on to the third round. This year, just three days after claiming the title in Indian Wells, she beat Serena Williams in the first round of the Miami Open. “I kind of wanted to impress her,” she said later. “I just wanted to make her say, ‘Come on!’ one time, and I think she did, so I’m really happy about that.” Their post-match encounter at the net was one of the few conversations the two had ever had. Once before, Osaka had chanced upon Serena in the locker room but was too awe-struck to say hello. “I had my headphones in anyway,” she told me, “so I just pretended I couldn’t see or hear anything.” The first round in Washington presented a different challenge. Pera, ranked No. 95, is a solid player who could test whether Osaka’s focus on consistency and foot speed was working — and whether her calf injury would hinder her, as an abdominal strain had before Wimbledon. At 2-1 in the first set, Osaka winced as she stretched wide for a shot, reaching down to rub her calf. She recovered and, with a series of bullet forehands and serves, finished off the set 6-2 in a half-hour. But then she lost her mojo. Pera broke her serve twice with a series of deft drop shots. Osaka laughed sarcastically at her own missed shots, but she fought back each time, ultimately tying up the set, 6-6. At 5-4 in the tiebreaker, she cracked a backhand winner down the line, clenching her first with a “Come on!” that would have made Serena proud. A point later, the match was over. Team Naomi put a positive spin on the match. “It was better for her to struggle a little bit,” Bajin said, “because it showed she can come through adversity.” Even so, Osaka didn’t look her dominant self. In the second round, against the Polish counterpuncher Magda Linette, she forced a third set by reeling off a series of high-risk winners. During the break, she massaged her ears and did some Zen deep-breathing exercises. It didn’t help: Her patience seeped away, and so did the deciding set, 6-3. In the next two U.S. Open warm-up tournaments, in Montreal and Cincinnati earlier this month, Osaka lost in the first round each time, leaving observers to wonder how she might rebound on the big stage of the U.S. Open. After a couple weeks of Twitter silence, Osaka reappeared on Aug. 16 with a heartfelt tweet. “So the last couple of weeks have been really rough for me,” she wrote. “I had a lot of pressure entering the hardcourt swing because I felt a lot of expectation on me from Indian Wells and I didn’t feel like the underdog anymore.” But now she said she had recovered “that fun feeling playing tennis.” She signed off: “See you in NY.” In Japan, a mixed-race person is known as hafu (from the English word “half”). In the 1990s and later, when most hafu were of Asian and Caucasian parents, they gained visibility in the modeling and entertainment industries. But the word took a different turn in 2015, when a half-Japanese, half-African-American woman named Ariana Miyamoto won the Miss Universe Japan pageant. Miyamoto used her status to raise awareness for her discriminated segment of the population. Many young Japanese applauded the step forward, but some online commentators could not accept that a hafu could be seen as the face of Japanese beauty. One wrote: “Her face is foreign no matter how you look at it!” The realm of sports has been more welcoming. Unlike Miyamoto, Osaka has been embraced by Japanese media, companies and fans hungering for a female tennis star. Nissin, one of the world’s largest instant-noodle companies, has already signed her to a lucrative deal, as has Wowow, the tennis channel that broadcasts her matches in Japan. The Osaka camp plans to announce a large new endorsement deal before the U.S. Open, and other Japanese multinationals are circling. Osaka’s biggest payday may come at the end of the year, when her Adidas shoe-and-apparel contract expires — just in time for the prelude to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. If Osaka played under the American flag, it’s very unlikely that these opportunities would exist. Japanese companies would have no reason to court her and U.S. brands would have other higher-ranked young guns to consider, like Madison Keys and Sloane Stephens. But as Japan’s top-ranked player, Osaka has the full attention of the country’s top brands, whose sponsorship fees can run far higher than those of their Western counterparts. There’s a reason Nishikori, despite never having won a Grand Slam title, surpassed bigger stars like Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in endorsement income over the past year, with $33 million, according to Forbes. Only Roger Federer earned more. “Kei’s been a trailblazer for Naomi,” Duguid, her agent from I.M.G., says. “He’s opened doors for tennis in Japan and across Asia.” But with Osaka’s combination of youth, authenticity and cultural diversity, he says, “she might have more global appeal.” Osaka has already shifted attitudes in one small town in Hokkaido. In 2014, when Osaka, then 16, scored a stunning upset over the former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur, her grandfather noticed the jubilant coverage in the Japanese media. His disparagement of Osaka’s tennis dreams has gradually shifted into support. He has sent Osaka text messages, phone greetings and earrings (because she told him all the top players are pierced). In April, after her breakthrough in Indian Wells, he even spoke to reporters in Nemuro to about her Japanese roots. “I heard people on Twitter saying, ‘Does she really have relatives in Japan?’ ” he said, “so I thought I should come out.” Hanging from Osaka’s tennis bag is her grandfather’s latest gift: an omamori, a small silk pouch on a string, blessed at a temple and designed to bring good luck. Osaka may be the highest-profile hafu at the Tokyo Olympics, but others will very likely be there, too. A top sprinter, Abdul Hakim Sani Brown of the University of Florida, is the son of a Japanese mother and a Ghanaian father. The father of Rui Hachimura, a 6-foot-8 basketball star at Gonzaga University, is from Benin, while the tennis doubles specialist Ben McLachlan’s father is from New Zealand. “Ten to 20 years ago, we didn’t see many mixed-race athletes,” says Yoshitani of Kyodo News. “But I think Japan is changing slowly. It’s more international now. The older generation doesn’t change its habits or mentality. But the young generation has a different outlook.” Still, Osaka stands apart from other Japanese players. The only two Japanese female players to reach the Top 10 — Ai Sugiyama (No. 8 in 2004) and Kimiko Date (No. 4 in 1995) — maximized the potential of their smaller stature, relying less on power than on defensive skills, sharp volleys and footwork, and mental toughness. At the Federation Cup competition in April, Osaka’s game and powerful 5-foot-11 frame stood in stark contrast to the other Japanese singles player, Kurumi Nara, who is just 5-foot-1. “Everything about Naomi breaks the mold,” says Kenshi Fukuhara, a producer with Wowow. “Physically, she’s so much more powerful than other Japanese players. She looks more like Serena, but she’s very Japanese inside.” Nao Hibino, a 23-year-old Japanese player who has been ranked as high as 56, appreciates all the attention Osaka has brought to women’s tennis in Japan. But she still finds it hard to conceptualize her as a Japanese player. “To be honest, we feel a bit of distance from her because she is so physically different, she grew up in a different place and doesn’t speak as much Japanese,” says Hibino, who first played Osaka when she was an unpolished 16-year-old. “It’s not like Kei, who is a pure Japanese player.” Miyako Kamei, a middle-aged Japanese fan watching Nishikori warm up on a back court at the Citi Open in Washington, said, “We all support Naomi, but Japanese fans tend to like those players who have come up purely on Japanese power.” Living on the hyphen — balancing Japanese, American and Haitian cultures — is something Osaka has done all her life. And she has become aware that her mixed identity may bring her more fans around the world. “Maybe it’s because they can’t really pinpoint what I am,” she has said, “so it’s like anybody can cheer for me.” In Japan, sports fans already know who Osaka is: She’s the rising star playing for the land of the rising sun. Her Japanese might not be perfect, her appearance not traditional. But the barriers may ultimately be no match for success. “If Naomi wins a Grand Slam, the other things won’t matter as much,” Fukuhara says. “All of Japan would embrace her.”",The New York Times

2018,National Enquirer Had Decades of Trump Dirt. He Wanted to Buy It All.,"Federal investigators have provided ample evidence that President Trump was involved in deals to pay two women to keep them from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about affairs that they said they had with him. But it turns out that Mr. Trump wanted to go even further. He and his lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, devised a plan to buy up all the dirt on Mr. Trump that the National Enquirer and its parent company had collected on him, dating back to the 1980s, according to several of Mr. Trump’s associates. The existence of the plan, which was never finalized, has not been reported before. But it was strongly hinted at in a recording that Mr. Cohen’s lawyer released last month of a conversation about payoffs that Mr. Cohen had with Mr. Trump. “It’s all the stuff — all the stuff, because you never know,” Mr. Cohen said on the recording. The move by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen indicated just how concerned they were about all the information amassed by the company, American Media, and its chairman, David Pecker, a loyal Trump ally of two decades who has cooperated with investigators. It is not clear yet whether the proposed plan to purchase all the information from American Media has attracted the interest of federal prosecutors in New York, who last week obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen over a $130,000 payment to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, and a $150,000 payment to a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But the prosecutors have provided at least partial immunity to Mr. Pecker, who is a key witness in their inquiry into payments made on behalf of Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. In providing the guilty plea, Mr. Cohen had said the payments to the women came at Mr. Trump’s direction as part of a broader effort to protect his candidacy. The discussed purchase of American Media’s broader cache of Trump information appears to have been part of the same effort. The people who knew about the discussions would speak about them only on condition of anonymity, given that they are now the potential subject of a federal investigation that did not end with Mr. Cohen’s plea. Lawyers for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen declined to comment for this article as did American Media. It is not known how much of the material on Mr. Trump is still in American Media’s possession or whether American Media destroyed any of it after the campaign. Prosecutors have not said whether they have obtained any of the material beyond that which pertains to Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford and the discussions about their arrangements. For the better part of two decades, Mr. Pecker had ordered his staff at American Media to protect Mr. Trump from troublesome stories, in some cases by buying up stories about him and filing them away. In 2016, he kept his staff from going back through the old Trump tip and story files that dated to before Mr. Pecker became company chairman in 1999, several former staff members said in interviews with The New York Times. That meant that American Media, the nation’s largest gossip publisher, did not play a role during the election year in vetting a presidential candidacy — Mr. Trump’s — made for the tabloids. Mr. Pecker also worked with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen to buy and bury Ms. McDougal’s story of an affair with Mr. Trump, a practice known as “catch and kill.” Mr. Cohen admitted as much in making his guilty plea last week. In August 2016, American Media acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her career as a fitness specialist. But American Media never published her allegations about a relationship with Mr. Trump. Shortly after American Media completed the arrangement with Ms. McDougal at Mr. Trump’s behest, a troubling question began to nag at Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, according to several people who knew about the discussions at the time: What would happen to America Media’s sensitive Trump files if Mr. Pecker were to leave the company? Mr. Cohen, those people said, was hearing rumors that Mr. Pecker might leave American Media for Time magazine — a title Mr. Pecker is known to have dreams of running. There was perennial talk about American Media’s business troubles. And Mr. Trump appeared to take a world-wearier view of the wisdom of leaving his sensitive personal secrets in someone else’s hands: “Maybe he gets hit by a truck,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Pecker in a conversation with Mr. Cohen, musing about an unfortunate mishap befalling his good friend. Mr. Cohen captured that conversation on a recording that his adviser released roughly a month before his guilty plea, which included two counts of campaign finance violations relating to the payments to Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. The recording was given to CNN after Mr. Trump’s main lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, acknowledged its existence to The New York Times. When The Times first reported that the recording had been discovered by the F.B.I., people close to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump initially described it in the narrow context of Ms. McDougal’s deal. But Mr. Cohen, in fact, indicates in the audio that he and Mr. Trump are speaking about an arrangement involving far more. “I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info, regarding our friend David,” Mr. Cohen says in reference to Mr. Pecker. The plan got far enough along that Mr. Cohen relays in the recorded conversation that he had discussed paying for all the information from American Media with the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. “I’ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,” he says, adding about Mr. Pecker, “We’ll have to pay him something.” In the end, the deal never came together. When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty, prosecutors said in court documents that Mr. Cohen and American Media did enter into a deal in which Mr. Cohen agreed to pay the company $125,000 for the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story. After the deal was signed but before Mr. Cohen paid, prosecutors said, American Media backed out of the arrangement and warned Mr. Cohen to shred the paperwork (he did not). Prosecutors said there had been discussions between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen in which Mr. Cohen said American Media would be reimbursed for the payment to Ms. McDougal. The notoriously frugal Mr. Trump balked at doing so, causing Mr. Pecker anxiety about explaining the payout to his board, according to a person briefed on the discussions. It was unclear whether Mr. Trump ever provided a reimbursement. Mr. Weisselberg ultimately provided information about Mr. Cohen under a deal that protected him from self-incrimination. As prosecutors continue in their investigation, Mr. Weisselberg could serve as a particularly helpful guide through the Trump Organization’s operations. Mr. Pecker, whose company is expected to be of continued interest in the investigation, has a similar arrangement with prosecutors. Potentially as worrisome for Mr. Trump and his advisers, Mr. Pecker could be a particularly knowing guide through any other potentially illegal efforts made to protect Mr. Trump’s candidacy from his own less savory exploits. “The only thing better than a single piece of evidence is multiple pieces of evidence,” said Jeff Tsai, a lawyer now in private practice who, as a Justice Department public integrity section lawyer, had served on the team that prosecuted Senator John Edwards on campaign finance charges in 2012. He added, “Look to whom the government is reportedly giving immunity to. Those individuals are the ones who would have knowledge about what, if anything, the campaign at the highest, or lowest, or any level in between had on this issue.” People with knowledge of American Media’s operations, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, described the files on Mr. Trump as mostly older National Enquirer stories about Mr. Trump’s marital woes and lawsuits; related story notes and lists of sensitive sources; some tips about alleged affairs; and minutia, like allegations of unscrupulous golfing. As The Associated Press reported last week, some of the information was kept in a safe devoted to particularly sensitive material. Many of the older National Enquirer stories are often not accessible through Google or databases like Nexis. Several former American Media staff members said that at the very least, the material the company had on Mr. Trump would have put its flagship, The Enquirer, in a prime position to dominate on coverage of Mr. Trump’s scandalous past.",The New York Times
2018,Nearing Retirement? Here’s a Book to Help You Maximize Your Social Security Benefits,"Newsbook With the number of older Americans filing for bankruptcy on the rise, here are three books to help you understand retirement and what is driving the Social Security debate. One details the scope of the issues, while another guides readers on how to maximize their benefits. Plus, a satirical novel imagines a wacky Social Security based scenario. RUNNING ON EMPTY How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItBy Peter G. Peterson 239 pp. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. (2004) In this book, Mr. Peterson, a former Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon administration and chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, outlines the state of the American economy, writing that “we can no longer afford denial” about our aging society. He argues that a society has a collective responsibility for long-term fiscal prudence and suggests reforms to the Social Security system, including “to change people’s behavior in positive directions — for example, to get them to plan ahead, to save more, and to live healthier lives.” GET WHAT’S YOURSThe Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social SecurityBy Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Philip Moeller and Paul Solman336 pp. Simon & Schuster. (2015) This practical guide to navigating the Social Security system cuts through the fat (there are more than 2,500 rules associated with the benefit) and covers everything from how to file for Social Security to the strategies for claiming the highest possible income. The writers advise on when to retire and note the most common benefits, as well as how to take advantage of others that are lesser known, like the divorced spousal benefit. This book would be useful for anyone approaching retirement. BOOMSDAYBy Christopher Buckley336 pp. Twelve. (2007) In this novel, Cassandra Devine, a young blogger who belongs to “Generation Whatever” (millennials), offers a controversial solution to an imminent Social Security crisis: financial incentives for Boomers who agree to kill themselves when they reach 70 rather than retire. Called “voluntary transitioning,” the plan spreads quickly among 20-somethings and becomes the leading issue in a presidential campaign, with a cast of characters taking up either side of the cause.",The New York Times
2018,"Nearly a Year After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico Revises Death Toll to 2,975","A long-awaited analysis of Hurricane Maria’s deadly sweep through Puerto Rico prompted the government on Tuesday to sharply increase the official death toll. The government now estimates that 2,975 people died as a result of the disaster and its effects, which unfolded over months. The new assessment is many times greater than the previous official tally of 64, which was not revised for nearly a year despite convincing evidence that the official death certificates failed to take full account of the fatal and often long-range impacts from the storm across the island. The revision came just hours after the release of a new assessment of excess deaths in the roughly six months after the storm, conducted at the government’s request by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. Their report found that nearly 3,000 more deaths than expected occurred in the wake of the storm — 22 percent more than the number of deaths that normally might have occurred in that period. At issue has been how to assess the severity of a storm whose devastating impact on fundamental needs — water, electricity, communications and medical care — seemed to rival or exceed that of the deadliest recent storms to hit the United States, but whose official fatality count until now was far less severe. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, is thought to have killed anywhere from 1,000 to more than 1,800 people. The government’s latest revision brings to a close a year of debate and scientific scrutiny over fatality estimates that had seemed to vary widely — in some cases by thousands. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló faced constant political challenges over the disparity between the official death toll, released within weeks of the disaster, and what was apparent to most scientific researchers and reporters who investigated deaths. The inability to provide a reliable death count seemed, to many critics, to echo the dysfunction apparent in the island’s lack of preparation or any swift, effective response from the local and federal governments. Relief supplies were bottled up at the port, gas and food were in short supply, and electrical power was cut off to large sections of the island for months. Full power was restored to the last homes only this month. On Tuesday, Mr. Rosselló said he would move immediately to improve the process for certifying deaths and communicating information among public and private health workers. “Everybody’s going to be held accountable and everybody’s going to be expected to make changes,” he said at a news conference in San Juan. He added that the island would establish a registry for people who are likely to be the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and those who rely on kidney dialysis. The White House released a statement saying that the federal government supported Mr. Roselló’s “efforts to ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities resulting from last year’s hurricanes.” In a visit to the island around two weeks after Hurricane Maria, when the official death toll stood at 16, President Trump contrasted the number with the “hundreds and hundreds of people that died” after Hurricane Katrina. “Everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s taken place in Puerto Rico,” he said. The new research, which was performed independently of the government, compared the actual death rate with what would have been expected had the storm not occurred — a method used in several earlier analyses. In December, The New York Times found that 1,052 more people than usual died in the 42 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall. A study by Harvard researchers published in The New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year estimated the death toll could range from 800 to more than 8,000 people, and was based on a household survey. The results of the new study make clear what the government had recognized even before the official expansion of the death toll, officials said on Tuesday. “Hurricane Maria was a catastrophe of historic proportions, as never seen or lived before in the United States,” Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in an emailed statement. He said the new analysis “is sobering, and its insights make clear that Congress and FEMA must work with us to establish a better system for the preparation and distribution of supplies ahead of future disasters.” The George Washington University researchers released very few details of their methodology or analysis, making it difficult to assess the quality of their work, which was carried out at a cost of $305,000 and also included an analysis of how the government certified deaths and communicated about them. They wrote that “national and international experts in different fields” had reviewed their methods. The report has not yet been subjected to the more rigorous process of being published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, though it has been submitted for publication. The new study has two main differences from most previous analyses. Researchers looked at deaths for a longer time period, from last September — when two hurricanes, Irma and Maria, hit the island in close succession — until this past February. Deaths continued to be elevated throughout this period. The researchers also adjusted their calculations for what they estimated to be an 8 percent drop in the population after the storm and prolonged power failures, when thousands of people fled for the mainland. Using data from the territory’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics as well as from a government survey of airline travelers, the researchers estimated that nearly 280,000 fewer people were living on the island in February as the previous September. That exodus made it even more significant that deaths had increased compared with previous years. People in poorer municipalities and older men had a higher risk of death throughout the study period, the researchers found. “The lesson from this is that efforts for assistance and recovery need to focus as much as possible on lower-income areas, on people who are older, on people who are more vulnerable, because of having fewer of their own resources,” Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute, said at a news conference on Tuesday. She said a similar analysis has not been carried out in previous disasters. “I think we fail to appreciate the multitude of ways these major disasters impact people’s health and lives.” The researchers also tried to understand why the official death count was so low, despite the overall spike in deaths. In completing death certificates, which were the basis for the official count, doctors followed conventions that considered the disaster a factor only if it directly contributed to a death — for example, through “structural collapse, flying debris, floods and drownings.” The doctors at the time were not aware of new guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released the month after the hurricane, which recommend that doctors also consider a natural disaster’s indirect impacts — for example, from delayed access to health care. Some doctors told the researchers in interviews that they were confused about the new guidelines, or concerned that listing the hurricane as a contributor was too subjective, or could raise questions of liability. “Most physicians have no formal training in completing a death certificate and thus are not aware of appropriate death certification practices, especially in a disaster setting,” the study found. The researchers found this problem was not isolated to Puerto Rico. “The lack of training on death certificate completion is also a problem on the mainland,” they wrote. “To date, there are no formal courses on death certification in natural disasters for persons who fill out death certificates.” The researchers also concluded that while there were delays in registering deaths that ranged from about a week to a month, those delays did not appear to have affected the overall quality of the process. The vital statistics office was damaged and lost power after the storm. Records were kept on paper until electronic systems could again be used. The researchers reported that when vital records personnel noticed that the number of deaths per day was higher than normal, but that few death certificates related those deaths to the hurricane, the department tried to disseminate the C.D.C. guidelines to hospitals, doctors and funeral home directors by email and in meetings. Dr. Gilbert Burnham, a professor of international health and founder of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, said the study was a good complement to the earlier Harvard research in that it factored the exodus after the storm into the excess death assessment. “The protracted higher mortality, particularly among males, is interesting and opens many questions about potential causes,” said Dr. Burnham, who has performed similar studies assessing deaths, including in Mosul, Iraq. “A key finding in the study was the lack of preparedness for disasters,” he added, including “the failure to communicate events and risks, which led to a loss in credibility.” The proposed next phase of the George Washington study will examine the death certificates recorded in the months after the hurricane and will try to determine, through interviews with family members and others, whether individual deaths should be attributed to the storm. Researchers said they did not know when that next phase would be completed. The research was performed in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. The actual number of excess deaths was statistically estimated to be in the range of 2,658 to 3,290.",The New York Times
2018,"Nebraska Plans First Execution in 21 Years. Not So Fast, Drug Company Says.","Carey Dean Moore, who faces the death penalty next week for killing two taxi drivers in Omaha in 1979, has stopped fighting his looming execution. But his life may be extended by a German drugmaker that says it produced two of the drugs that are to be injected into Mr. Moore’s veins. Fresenius Kabi, one of Germany’s largest companies, has asked a judge to block the use of its drugs in Nebraska’s first execution in 21 years and its first-ever lethal injection. Use of the drugs, the company says, will cause grave harm to its reputation if products intended to help treat people are used to kill. A hearing is planned for Friday afternoon in Federal District Court in Lincoln, and if the judge grants the company’s request for an injunction it could delay the execution, scheduled for Tuesday. Two drugs Fresenius says it manufactured, along with two other drugs, are set to be used in Mr. Moore’s execution. Fresenius says it takes no position on capital punishment, but that it has strict contracts with distributors that ban sales to prisons for executions or to anyone other than hospitals and other medical users. It says Nebraska illegally obtained both a muscle relaxant and a drug that, when given at extremely high doses, can stop a beating heart. In Nebraska, any delay could further complicate matters because the state’s supply of one of the drugs, potassium chloride, expires in three weeks, and its supply of the other, cisatracurium, expires on Oct. 31, according to Scott R. Frakes, the state corrections director. The drugs used in lethal injection have become increasingly difficult to obtain as pharmaceutical companies try to clamp down on their use and death penalty opponents argue that new drug protocols are unproven or inhumane. On Thursday night, Tennessee carried out its first execution since 2009, putting Billy Ray Irick to death for the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl in 1985. The state used a combination of drugs that Mr. Irick’s lawyers had argued could make the condemned feel like they were burning alive and drowning. According to The Tennessean newspaper, Mr. Irick “was coughing, choking and gasping for air” and “his face turned dark purple as the lethal drugs took over.” In its lawsuit, Fresenius has raised the specter that use of the drugs could lead to a botched execution, saying that its drugs, when obtained improperly, are at risk of being handled or transported in ways that leave them adulterated and chemically altered. For example, it says cisatracurium, the muscle relaxant, loses effectiveness when not refrigerated in the carton between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, but that Nebraska’s execution protocols call for the drugs to be stored at “room temperature storage conditions.” The company says it determined it was the maker of the potassium chloride because an inventory of drugs kept by the state showed that its stockpile came in vials of 30 milliliters. Fresenius says it is the only manufacturer that packages the drug in vials of that size. “We made no sales to the Department of Correctional Services, nor have any of our authorized distributors,” Fresenius Kabi wrote in a statement. “So we can only conclude Nebraska may have acquired this product from an unauthorized seller.” Nebraska is fighting separate legal efforts to force it to disclose where it got the drugs. A statement issued by Attorney General Doug Peterson said the drugs “were purchased lawfully and pursuant to the state of Nebraska’s duty to carry out lawful capital sentences.” But neither the statement, nor state officials on Thursday, said which company manufactured the drugs, what temperature they are being stored at or whether an injunction would delay the execution. The offices of Mr. Peterson and the Nebraska governor, Pete Ricketts, did not respond to messages on Thursday. The planned execution of Mr. Moore, 60, is also notable because it would be the first-ever lethal injection in the United States that uses fentanyl, a powerful opioid that is at the heart of the nation’s overdose crisis. Mr. Moore has ceased efforts to prevent his execution. It is also the second time in a month that pharmaceutical manufacturers have sought to block a state from using their drugs in an execution. In July, the execution of Scott Dozier in Nevada was delayed after a drug maker, Alvogen, said one of the drugs in the state’s execution protocol had been obtained illicitly. Two other companies that also make drugs that Nevada wants to use in the execution, Sandoz and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, have also sought to block the state from using their products. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, a human rights organization in London, said there is now consensus in the pharmaceutical industry that it should fight to prevent its products from being used in executions. “We’ve come to a tipping point in terms of the industry’s desire to see their contracts and rights respected and enforced,” Ms. Foa said. On top of that, she said, state governments are undermining public health by using murky or illegal drug distribution channels to traffic in powerful narcotics and other drugs. “That’s scandalizing in a climate where we’re seeing a hundred people dying every day from the opioid epidemic,” she said. The drug companies’ aggressive maneuvers have put officials in some death penalty states on the defensive. In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Nevada Supreme Court in the Dozier case, 15 other states contend that the drug companies’ arguments are groundless. Their lawsuits “do not even need to succeed on the merits in order to achieve the desired outcome and prevent an execution,” their brief states. “Instead, they merely have to obtain an injunction preventing a state from carrying out an execution on the scheduled date. And that alone might delay an execution long enough that a state’s drugs could expire.” Leslie Rutledge, the attorney general of Arkansas, one of the 15 states, argued that the companies “are being pressured by anti-death-penalty advocates to stop supplying the drug to carry out lawful executions,” adding: “The families of these victims deserve justice.” The other states supporting Nevada’s effort to execute Mr. Dozier over the drug companies’ objections are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Need a Politics Cleanse? Go Ahead and Treat Yourself.,"Overwhelmed by current events? You can skip a few weeks without losing track of the plot. Mr. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute. Have you felt less popular lately than you once were? Are people avoiding you? Are your party invitations getting lost in the mail? Maybe it’s your breath. Or, just maybe, it’s because you can’t stop talking about politics. “That’s impossible!” you say. “Sure, I talk about politics a lot and have strong opinions. But all my friends agree with me.” It turns out that it doesn’t matter. Many studies of late have found that partisan rancor is increasing. But how do we feel about people on our own side who talk a lot about politics? That’s the question addressed by three political scientists in a new study in the journal Public Opinion Quarterly. Using “feeling thermometers” — the quantitative measure of how warmly people feel toward others — the researchers found that we don’t care much for rabid partisans, even if we agree with them. Why? In their words, “Although some Americans are politically polarized, more simply want to avoid talking about politics.” How bad has it become? “Many people,” they write, “do not want their child to marry someone from their own party if that hypothetical in-law were to discuss politics frequently.” So feel free to go on about politics all you want — to your cat. Forever. What to do? Start with a politics cleanse: For two weeks — maybe over your August vacation — resolve not to read, watch or listen to anything about politics. Don’t discuss politics with anyone. When you find yourself thinking about politics, distract yourself with something else. (I listen to Bach cantatas, but that’s not for everybody.) This is hard to do, of course, but not impossible. You just have to plan ahead and stand firm. Think of it as ideological veganism. On the one hand, your friends will think you’re a little wacky. On the other hand, you’ll feel superior to them. In discussing this proposal with friends and colleagues, I detect an inchoate fear. It goes something like this: “If I tune out politics, I may be happier, but it’s irresponsible. The fascists” — my conservative friends here say “communists” — “will run across the country with abandon.” This is a version of John Stuart Mill’s maxim, “Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends than that good men should look on and do nothing.” Is that how you feel? Here’s the truth: If you stop talking about politics for a couple of weeks, nothing will change, except you might get invited again to parties. You have nothing to lose but your loneliness. And besides, whether you know it or not, you probably need a break. Afterward, with a bit more perspective, you can come back to current events. Three predictions: First, you’ll find that politics is a little like a daytime soap opera, where you can skip a couple of weeks without losing track of the plot. Second, you’ll see the outrage-industrial complex in media and politics more clearly for what it is: a bunch of powerful people who want to keep you wound up for their own profit. Third, like any reformed addict, you’ll see how much time you were wasting and how much you were neglecting people and things you truly love. After you come back from your politics cleanse, how can you keep from falling back into your old patterns? Resolve to pay attention to ideas, not just politics. They aren’t the same thing. Ideas are like the climate, whereas politics is like the weather. Ideas change cultures and nations over years and decades, while politics changes from moment to moment. Just as the weather can obscure truths about the climate, politics can make ideas harder to understand. Ideas, like the climate, require thought and study. Observations about politics, like opinions on the weather, require no expertise at all. The world is full of ersatz political weather forecasters. The world needs more people who are thoughtful about the climate of ideas. Perhaps most important, while politics creates animus and contempt, people can generally disagree about ideas without bitterness. A Reuters/Ipsos poll finds that nearly one in six Americans has stopped talking to family and close friends over politics. Millions more are distancing themselves from people over ideological differences, or curating their news and social media to avoid political disagreement. But I know of no one who has stopped talking to a family member over disagreements about the merits of the idea of a universal basic income. So if you are a politics addict and feeling lonely, here’s your formula to improve your life: Do a politics cleanse, and then focus more on ideas. After that, if the invitations are still getting lost in the mail? Then it’s probably your breath. Arthur C. Brooks is president of the American Enterprise Institute, a contributing opinion writer and the host of the podcast “The Arthur Brooks Show.”",The New York Times
2018,Need a Quick Inspection of a 58-Story Tower? Send a Drone,"With their low cost and ease of handling, drones are saving money and time on big construction projects. They could also save lives. John Murphy and Larry Shueneman of Coastal Construction fly a drone over a construction site at the Miami Worldcenter, in Miami.CreditCreditSaul Martinez for The New York Times As the head of a 700-year-old winemaking dynasty, Lamberto Frescobaldi is overseeing a construction project in one of his Tuscany vineyards using technology that would have seemed otherworldly to his ancestors: high-flying drones. Ubiquitous as toys for the gadget-minded — and sometimes for purposes like spying and dropping explosives — drones have become indispensable tools in construction and real estate. Their relatively low cost and ease of handling have made work more efficient for architects, landscape designers, surveyors, builders, structural engineers and brokers. By launching a drone over the Perano vineyard in the Chianti region south of Florence, Mr. Frescobaldi can examine the progress of a 25,000-square-foot garden being built atop one of his wine cellars. The rooftop garden is intended for wine tastings, a crucial marketing strategy for the vintner’s business, Marchesi Frescobaldi. The company, which has a half-dozen vineyards that produce 11 million bottles of wine each year, reported revenue of $120 million in 2017. Richard Shelbourne, a British landscape architect who designed the garden, said the drone images helped refine the project. “The garden design, which started in my head and was then calculated and set out on paper, could now be seen in full scale from the air, and all the lines and curves were in the right place,” he said. The drone allowed the men to observe the work of excavators and motorized barrows, and the construction of pergolas, fountains and terra-cotta walkways. After looking at the drone footage during construction, they decided to modify an entrance to the garden. “I asked my son to fly over a number of times, so I could imagine how it would be planted, to give it attention from a perspective that you usually do not have,” Mr. Frescobaldi said. “These modern devices, these videos — it’s progress.” Small, swift and agile, drones have all but replaced the more costly and less nimble helicopter for tasks that involve inspections, measurements and marketing images. Interest in drones is rising for both consumer and commercial use. Sales of drones increased 33 percent in 2017 over the prior year, according to the market research firm NPD Group. In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration allowed commercial drone use for a broad range of businesses, but with restrictions: Pilots must be at least 16 years old and pass a written test. On building sites, drones are saving money and time by providing digital images, maps and other files that can be shared in a matter of minutes, said Mike Winn, the chief executive of DroneDeploy, a company founded five years ago in San Francisco that creates software for, among other uses, operating drones with mobile apps. Drones are reducing the travel time for busy executives, Mr. Winn said. “The head office can see what’s going on, and the safety team, the costing team, the designers — all of them can contribute to the project, share data and comment on it, without actually going to the job.” They could also improve safety. In the days before drones, Mr. Winn said, measuring the roof of a house for solar panels would require “a guy with a tape measure to climb up there,” which often produced inaccurate results and, like anything involving heights, was dangerous. Such peril is magnified in the construction of skyscrapers, said John Murphy Jr., a contractor on the Paramount Miami Worldcenter, a 58-story condominium tower being built in downtown Miami. Before drones, Mr. Murphy said, workers seeking access to the exterior of a high-rise were “dropped over the side” in so-called swing stages, small platforms that hang from cables. Often used by window cleaners, swing stages are precarious in high winds. “No one wants to go out there,” he said. “It’s scary.” Falls accounted for 384 of the 991 deaths in the construction industry in 2016, according to the latest figures from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That number could be reduced over time by increasing the use of drones for quality-control inspections and similar missions. “We’re definitely limiting the exposure to workers,” said Mr. Murphy, who on a recent afternoon was at the Paramount site to supervise a drone inspection of window glazing on the tower. The drone’s camera was looking for possible leaks, water intrusion and “other things that you can’t see from the interior of the building.” Earlier, the drone was used to check the quality of steel connections in a bridge, 72 feet above the ground, that links the main tower to a parking structure. The utility of drones often begins long before the foundation is poured. They help planners decide where to place new buildings. And at the 87-room Foundry Hotel in downtown Asheville, N.C., the developer sent a drone to the precise height and location of a proposed fourth-floor balcony to help him decide how best to take advantage of the view. “A drone really helps us to conceptualize what a development is going to be, because sometimes it’s hard to do that just from a set of plans,” said Alexandros D. Papapieris, the development manager at McCall Capital, which is converting a 1925 office building in Bristol, Va., into the 65-room Bristol Hotel, set to open this fall. “Everyone loves a good aerial. Drones allowed us to paint a picture for the investors about why this was a good idea.” Careers are being transformed with the new technology. Pedro Domecq, a videographer in San Sebastián, Spain, bought his first drone in 2011. “It cost $6,000,” he said. “Now, they cost $1,000 and they’re much better.” Initially, Mr. Domecq used the drone to capture aerial videos of his picturesque Basque Country surroundings and share them on social media. Now, under the banner of his company, Heliworx, Mr. Domecq spends much of his time fulfilling contracts with builders. “It’s all much easier with a drone,” said Mr. Domecq, who has lately been producing high-definition aerial surveys for the construction conglomerate Acciona, which is building a high-speed railroad that will connect the Basque Country with Madrid. Mr. Domecq’s drone flights are aided by photogrammetry, in which three-dimensional digital models are created from overlapping photographs of a structure, landscape or object. Some of the flights involve mapping the paths to be taken underground by the many tunnels required for the railroad in the region’s mountainous terrain. Younger business owners see drones as a moneymaking tool. After graduating from college four years ago and starting a small video marketing company in Charleston, S.C., Matt Coda found himself being asked to produce industrial videos with a drone. His biggest coup was a contract for his company, Vive Media, to document the first phase of construction of a 280-acre container terminal for the South Carolina Ports Authority. For more than a year, said Mr. Coda, 26, he provided monthly progress reports to his client, the S.J. Hamill Construction Company, in the form of video updates. He flew the drone along the same two routes on the development site to show Hamill Construction the entire property as the project progressed. In May, Mr. Coda began working on the building site of the South Carolina Aeronautical Training Center, an $80-million, 224,000-square-foot structure at Trident Technical College in North Charleston. “It’s fascinating to see a project evolve,” said Mr. Coda, a certified drone operator. “But I’m grateful to be the one flying the drone and not doing the actual construction.”",The New York Times
2018,Need a Quick Read for Labor Day Weekend?,"Newsbook Summer doesn’t officially end for a few weeks, but for most of us, the transition to fall starts after Labor Day weekend; that’s when summer hours end, companies purge their stores of hot weather collections and many scramble to take their final beach trips. If you’re in the latter category, here are three quick reads for you to bring along. MY GERMAN BROTHERBy Chico Buarque. Translated by Alison Entrekin.208 pp. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. (2018) This translated work by the Brazilian writer and musician Buarque fictionalizes his lifelong pursuit of a lost sibling. His main character is Ciccio, a teenager living in 1960s São Paulo whose bookish parents leave him mostly to his own devices and to whom the rare books in his home’s library are forbidden. One day, he sneaks off with one of the volumes and finds a letter hidden in its pages where he learns that his father had an illicit affair that resulted in the birth of a baby boy. The discovery sets off a comical, decades long journey in search of the truth about his brother. THE DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUBBy Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez320 pp. St. Martin’s Press. (2003) This novel, which became a best seller and is the first in a series,” centers on a group of six Latinas who became lifelong friends after meeting as students at Boston University; they irreverently call themselves “las sucias,” a Spanish word that means “dirty girl” (think back to the “nasty women” of the 2016 election). They are: Lauren, a newspaper columnist who suspects her boyfriend of cheating; Sara, who is ostensibly living the perfect life as a wife and mother living in the suburbs; Amber, a rock singer who’s waiting for her big break; Elizabeth, the gorgeous black Latina whose high profile job as a television anchor complicates her personal life; Rebecca, who started a magazine called Ella but is in a struggling marriage; and Usnavys, a larger-than-life personality looking for love. The book follows their professional and romantic adventures, starting with their biannual reunion. CHEMISTRYBy Weike Wang211 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. (2017) Wang’s novel is about “an intelligent woman trying to find her place in the world,” said our reviewer. It follows an unnamed Chinese-American woman who is a chemistry Ph.D. student in Boston. The book opens with her boyfriend proposing to her, and she spends much of the book exploring why she does not feel compelled to say yes, as well as figuring out how to relate to her domineering parents. There is much science and history trivia interspersed throughout; it’s the way the narrator attempts to make sense of her life. According to our reviewer, “'Chemistry' will appeal to anyone asking themselves, How do I create the sort of family I want without rejecting the family I have?”",The New York Times
2018,"Neil Simon Drew Big Laughs, Then Came a Cultural Shift","An Appraisal In my high school’s production of “The Odd Couple,” I played Roy, one of slobby Oscar Madison’s poker buddies. For the costume, my mother let me pick from among my father’s second-best suits and slightly frayed dress shirts, which worked for the character (I grandly believed) because Roy was an accountant and my father was a banker. No matter that I had to hitch the trousers with a belt and suspenders to make them stay up; I still got my laughs. “His refrigerator’s been broken for two weeks,” ran one of my lines. “I saw milk standing in there that wasn’t even in the bottle.” Pow! The play was surefire. That was in 1975; it had not taken long for “The Odd Couple” to percolate through the soil of American culture — from its 1965 premiere, to the 1968 movie adaptation, to the 1970 ABC sitcom and, in a final burst of glory, to Harriton High. By then its author, Neil Simon, was surefire too: In 1966 he had four hit shows on Broadway at once. His domination of the field would continue for another 25 years, through “Lost in Yonkers” in 1991, making him the most successful American comic playwright ever and, for lack of much competition, probably the greatest. But Mr. Simon, who died Sunday at 91, didn’t know he was standing directly over a fault in American culture, one that even as he hit his stride started gapping and would eventually pull him down. Until then, he reliably provided the pleasure of exaggerated self-recognition, reflecting life but with palpable structure and better punch lines. In the theater, the shared assumptions between the playwright and his very homogeneous late-century audience — largely white and urban, often Jewish or at least Jewish-adjacent — had the redoubling effect necessary to raucous comedy. With expert actors (and his plays attracted the best: Maureen Stapleton, Walter Matthau, Nathan Lane, George C. Scott, Linda Lavin, Irene Worth and Mercedes Ruehl) those shared assumptions came to seem like common ground. Only it wasn’t really common ground. The initial bloom of Mr. Simon’s success soon soured, at least for critics. In the late ’60s and early ’70s, as independent films were diversifying their outlook and shaking off the formulas of Hollywood storytelling, Broadway boulevard comedies like “Last of the Red Hot Lovers” and “California Suite” — tales of the befuddled nouveau riche in a new world — began to look mass-produced and middlebrow. Mr. Simon had a seismograph’s sensitivity to criticism, but did not seem to understand the change in the environment. He thought that the diminishing reputation of his plays was a response to their continued commercial success. He tried to adapt to the new expectations, aiming highbrow but missing big with clunkers based on Chekhov (“The Good Doctor”) and the Book of Job (“God’s Favorite”). It was autobiography — and the darkening of his palette — that renewed him. The 1980s trilogy of “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” “Biloxi Blues” and “Broadway Bound” were commercial and critical successes; “Lost in Yonkers” won the Pulitzer Prize. The strengths of those plays are undeniable, yet to me they seem like transitional works that never transitioned anywhere. They come off as Depression dramas to which someone has added an intermittent and implausible laugh track. I prefer the early plays. That’s in part because they literally don’t write them like that anymore. The increasing premium critics have put on seriousness — as well as the fractionalization of the audience into clans with little in common — have almost wiped out the form; the last successful Simonesque comedy on Broadway was Larry David’s “Fish in the Dark,” a one-off. But I like those early works — “The Odd Couple” and also “Plaza Suite” and “The Sunshine Boys,” among others — because even though they are comedies, they are coherent as drama. The trick was structure: Mr. Simon’s sense of the situations he devised was so clear he could write boffo gags that did not seem to come from him, but rather from the character and conflict. Sometimes, in the way that can happen when writers momentarily grab the tail of the zeitgeist, the laughs were even prescient. This was especially true in plays that addressed, inadvertently or not, the shifting gender roles and politics of the Ms. Generation of feminists, as experienced by slobs who didn’t know what hit them. When Roy complains about Oscar Madison’s refrigerator he is talking about more than cleanliness. He is talking about the inadequacy of men. Remember that “The Odd Couple” concerns two divorcés — Oscar, a sportswriter, and a spectacularly fussy newsman, Felix Ungar — who wind up sharing an apartment miserably. It’s a play about the confusion and anger of men who can’t live with women or, apparently, without them. They have no way to see themselves for what they are — dinosaurs — and neither does the play, whose only women characters are a pair of twittery English sisters whom Oscar and Felix attempt to double date. Yet in all its unreconstructed old-school masculinity, “The Odd Couple” has integrity (making its laughs feel natural) and pathos (making its laughs feel meaningful). Same with Mr. Simon’s other comedies of the period. They may be unjust to the harridans, simps and playthings he stocks them with but they tell a real story of male collapse that was relevant to the culture at the time they were first produced, and might still hold up better than the later, more “serious” works. I think I understood that back in high school when, putting on my father’s clothes, I saw how poorly they fit. These kinds of men were already under siege, as everyone in “The Odd Couple” sensed without saying so. Which somehow made the laughs even bigger. slide show",The New York Times
2018,"Neil Simon, Broadway Master of Comedy, Is Dead at 91","Neil Simon, the playwright whose name was synonymous with Broadway comedy and commercial success in the theater for decades, and who helped redefine popular American humor with an emphasis on the frictions of urban living and the agonizing conflicts of family intimacy, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 91. His death, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, was announced by his publicist, Bill Evans. The cause was complications of pneumonia, he said. Mr. Simon was also reported to have had Alzheimer’s disease. Early in his career, Mr. Simon wrote for television greats, including Phil Silvers and Sid Caesar. Later he wrote for the movies, too. But it was as a playwright that he earned his lasting fame, with a long series of expertly tooled laugh machines that kept his name on Broadway marquees virtually nonstop throughout the late 1960s and ’70s. Beginning with the breakthrough hits “Barefoot in the Park” (1963) and “The Odd Couple” (1965) and continuing with popular successes like “Plaza Suite” (1968), “The Prisoner of Second Avenue” (1971) and “The Sunshine Boys” (1974), Mr. Simon ruled Broadway when Broadway was still worth ruling. From 1965 to 1980, his plays and musicals racked up more than 9,000 performances, a record not even remotely touched by any other playwright of the era. In 1966 alone, he had four Broadway shows running simultaneously. He also owned a Broadway theater for a spell in the 1960s, the Eugene O’Neill, and in 1983 had a different Broadway theater named after him, a rare accolade for a living playwright. 17 Photos View Slide Show › For all their popularity with audiences, Mr. Simon’s great successes in the first years of his fame rarely earned wide critical acclaim, and Broadway revivals of “The Odd Couple” in 2005 and “Barefoot in the Park” in 2006 did little to change the general view that his early work was most notable for its surefire conceits and snappy punch lines. In the introduction to one of his play collections, Mr. Simon quoted the critic Clive Barnes as once writing, “Neil Simon is destined to remain rich, successful and underrated.” But Mr. Simon gained a firmer purchase on critical respect in the 1980s with his darker-hued semi-autobiographical trilogy, “Brighton Beach Memoirs” (1983), “Biloxi Blues” (1985) and “Broadway Bound” (1986). These comedy-dramas were admired for the way they explored the tangle of love, anger and desperation that bound together — and drove apart — a Jewish working-class family, as viewed from the perspective of the youngest son, a restless wisecracker with an eye on showbiz fame. “The writer at last begins to examine himself honestly, without compromises,” Frank Rich wrote of “Biloxi Blues” in The New York Times, “and the result is his most persuasively serious effort to date — not to mention his funniest play since the golden age” of his first decade. In 1991, Mr. Simon won a Tony Award as well as the ultimate American playwriting award, the Pulitzer Prize, for “Lost in Yonkers,” another autobiographical comedy, this one about a fiercely withholding mother and her emotionally and intellectually underdeveloped daughter. It was also his last major success on Broadway. Mr. Simon and Woody Allen, who both worked in the 1950s writing for Mr. Caesar (along with Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart and Carl Reiner, among others), were probably equally significant in shaping the currents of American comedy in the 1960s and ’70s, although their styles, their favored mediums and the critical reception of their work diverged mightily. Mr. Simon was the populist whose accessible, joke-packed plays about the anxieties of everyday characters could tickle funny bones in theaters across the country as well as in 1,200-seat Broadway houses. Mr. Allen was the darling of the urban art-house cinema and the critical classes who created comedy from the minutiae of his own angst. But together they helped make the comedy of urban neurosis — distinctly Jewish-inflected — as American as the homespun humor of “Leave It to Beaver.” Mr. Simon’s early plays, often centered on an antagonistic couple of one kind or another wielding cutting one-liners in a New York apartment, helped set the template for the explosion of sitcoms on network television in the 1970s. (The long-running television show based on his “Odd Couple” was one of the best, although a bum business deal meant that Mr. Simon earned little money from it.) A line can be drawn between the taut plot threads of Mr. Simon’s early comedies — a slob and a neatnik form an irascible all-male marriage in “The Odd Couple,” newlyweds bicker in a new apartment in “Barefoot in the Park,” a laid-off fellow has a meltdown in “The Prisoner of Second Avenue” — and the “nothing”-inspired, kvetching-character-based comedy of the seminal 1990s sitcom “Seinfeld.” Mr. Allen and Mr. Simon, who shared roots in the urban Jewish lower middle classes, were also united by the classic funnyman’s ability to inspire belly laughs by the millions in other people while managing to find the dark clouds hovering insistently over their own fates, however apparently successful they might seem. Mr. Simon once wrote of approaching Mr. Allen in a restaurant when both men were at the height of their success to offer congratulations on Mr. Allen’s “Manhattan.” How was he feeling? “Oh, all right,” Mr. Allen answered. Mr. Simon wrote, “When I saw his dour expression, I saw my own reflected agony.” This, when Mr. Simon himself had two hit shows on Broadway, another play ready for rehearsals and two movies set for production. (Plus an ulcer, of course.) Agony is at the root of comedy, and for Mr. Simon it was the agony of an unhappy Depression-era childhood that inspired much of his finest work. And it was the agony of living in Los Angeles that drove his determination to break free from the grind of cranking out jokes for Jerry Lewis on television and make his own name. As he wrote in his 1996 autobiography, “Rewrites” (the first of two volumes), the plush comforts of Hollywood living might extend your life span, but “the catch was when you eventually did die, it surely wouldn’t be from laughing.” Born on July 4, 1927, in the Bronx, Marvin Neil Simon was the son of a garment industry salesman, Irving Simon, who abandoned the family more than once during his childhood, leaving Mr. Simon’s mother, May, to take care of Neil and his older brother, Danny. When the family was intact, the mood was darkened by constant battles between the parents. The tensions of the family, which moved to Washington Heights when Mr. Simon was 5, would find their way into many of his plays, notably the late trilogy but also the early comedies, including his first play, “Come Blow Your Horn” (1961), about a young man leaving home to join his older brother, a bachelor and ladies’ man. And when the family finally broke up for good, the young Mr. Simon went to live with cousins while his brother was sent to live with an aunt, circumstances reflected in “Lost in Yonkers.” “When an audience laughed, I felt fulfilled,” Mr. Simon wrote in “Rewrites.” “It was a sign of approval, of being accepted. Coming as I did from a childhood where laughter in the house meant security, but was seldom heard as often as a door slamming every time my father took another year’s absence from us, the laughter that came my way in the theater was nourishment.” Danny Simon, older by eight years, was the signal influence on Neil’s career. “The fact is, I probably never would have been a writer if it were not for Danny,” Mr. Simon wrote. “Once, when I was 15 years old, he said to me, ‘You’re going to be the funniest comedy writer in America.’ Why? Based on what? How funny could I be at 15?” Mr. Simon graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and attended New York University as an enlistee in the Army Air Forces Air Reserve training program. He continued his studies at the University of Denver while assigned to a base nearby. (His military experience inspired the second play in his late trilogy, “Biloxi Blues.”) At the time, Danny had begun working in publicity at Warner Bros. in New York. Neil joined him there as a clerk after his discharge from the Air Force. Together they began writing television and radio scripts, eventually making $1,600 a week providing gags and sketches for Mr. Silvers, Jerry Lester, Jackie Gleason and Mr. Caesar on “Your Show of Shows” and later “Caesar’s Hour.” “It was a real learning process,” Mr. Simon said of his days among the Caesarians, a group that has become a television legend and inspired Mr. Simon’s 1993 comedy “Laughter on the 23rd Floor,” starring Nathan Lane. “We were exhausted,” he said, adding, “On Monday, you would come in knowing you had six new skits to do.” The Simon brothers also wrote weekly revues for Camp Tamiment, the summer resort in the Poconos. It was there that Neil Simon fell in love with Joan Baim, a dancer and counselor. By the end of the summer, they were married. “Come Blow Your Horn,” the play Mr. Simon wrote to escape the slavery of gag writing for television comics, ran for 677 performances and gained him connections and notice. But it was with “Barefoot in the Park,” a comedy inspired by his and his young wife’s experiences living in a fifth-floor walk-up in Greenwich Village, that Mr. Simon became a Broadway name. It was the first Broadway show directed by Mike Nichols, then best known for his comedy work with Elaine May. Mr. Nichols would go on to become one of Mr. Simon’s most frequent collaborators, credited by Mr. Simon with helping to shape his early plays through the tryouts and rehearsals. Mr. Nichols won his first Tony Award for directing “The Odd Couple.” He also directed “Plaza Suite,” with George C. Scott and Maureen Stapleton, and “The Prisoner of Second Avenue,” with Peter Falk and Lee Grant. Mr. Nichols died in 2014. “Barefoot in the Park” made a star of Robert Redford, who was cast alongside Elizabeth Ashley. It played for close to four years and made a hot commodity of Mr. Simon in Hollywood. His agent, Irving Lazar, better known as Swifty, sold the movie rights for $400,000. (Mr. Lazar asked Mr. Simon whether he’d be willing to sell the play for $300,000. Mr. Simon jumped at the offer, and Mr. Lazar kept the rest.) The movie, with a screenplay by Mr. Simon, and with Mr. Redford and Jane Fonda in the starring roles, became a hit when it was released in 1967 at Radio City Music Hall, breaking the box-office record. That record would be smashed by the movie version of “The Odd Couple.” Both movies were directed by Gene Saks, who would direct many of Simon’s later plays, including the “Brighton Beach” trilogy and “Lost in Yonkers.” (Mr. Saks died in 2015.) Mr. Simon’s screenwriting career included dozens of titles, among them many adaptations of his plays. In addition to “Barefoot in the Park” and “The Odd Couple” (with the original stage star, Walter Matthau, and Jack Lemmon replacing Art Carney), he wrote the screenplays for “The Prisoner of Second Avenue,” with Mr. Lemmon and Anne Bancroft, and “The Sunshine Boys,” with Mr. Matthau and George Burns, as well as “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” “Biloxi Blues” and “Lost in Yonkers,” among others. He also wrote original movies, including, “The Out-of-Towners,” the period spoof “Murder by Death,” “The Goodbye Girl,” “The Cheap Detective,” “Max Dugan Returns,” “The Slugger’s Wife,” “Only When I Laugh,” based on his play “The Gingerbread Lady,” and most notably “The Heartbreak Kid,” a black comedy, based on a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, directed by Elaine May and starring Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd. Richard Dreyfuss won an Oscar for his performance in “The Goodbye Girl” as an impish, irritating actor with whom an unemployed dancer played by Marsha Mason moves in. The movie received a total of nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Mr. Simon’s screenplay. (He received four Oscar screenplay nominations in his career but never won.) Ms. Mason was Mr. Simon’s wife at the time. His first wife, Joan, died of cancer in 1973. He met Ms. Mason at an audition, and they were married four months later. He wrote about their relationship in the play “Chapter Two,” which was made into a movie starring Ms. Mason and James Caan. “It’s my favorite play for many reasons,” Mr. Simon once said of “Chapter Two.” “It was cathartic for me. In the two years Marsha and I were married, I gave her a rough time — still trying to hold on to my relationship with Joan. Marsha is beautiful and talented, and I found ways to find fault with her. One night in California, everything erupted into a terrible fight. I realized then what I was doing. That’s how I wrote the play.” Mr. Simon, who lived in Manhattan, was married five times. After his divorce from Ms. Mason, he married the actress Diane Lander in 1987. They divorced a year later but remarried in 1990, then divorced again. Mr. Simon married the actress Elaine Joyce in 1999. She survives him, along with his daughters Ellen Simon and Nancy Simon from his first marriage and his daughter Bryn Lander Simon from his marriage to Ms. Lander. He is also survived by three grandchildren and one great-grandson. Danny Simon died in 2005. Mr. Simon wrote the book for three successful Broadway musicals in the 1960s. “Little Me” (1962), with music by Cy Coleman and lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, was directed by Cy Feuer and Bob Fosse, choreographed by Mr. Fosse and featured Mr. Simon’s old boss Sid Caesar playing the multiple loves of an adventuress named Belle Poitrine. “Sweet Charity” (1966) reunited Mr. Simon with Mr. Fosse for a musical based on Federico Fellini’s “Nights of Cabiria,” with music by Mr. Coleman and lyrics by Dorothy Fields. “Promises, Promises,” based on the movie “The Apartment,” featured music by Burt Bacharach and lyrics by Hal David. “Promises, Promises” was Mr. Simon’s biggest musical success, running 1,281 performances. It was revived on Broadway in 2010. Mr. Simon returned to musicals in 1981 with “They’re Playing Our Song,” featuring music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager. His last musical book was for an unsuccessful stage adaptation of “The Goodbye Girl” in 1993. In his most productive period, Mr. Simon wrote plays at the rate of almost one a year and produced almost 30 over his career. Many of the later works, from the 1990s and beyond, were tepidly received and had brief Broadway runs. “Proposals” (1997), a quasi-Chekhovian comedy, and “45 Seconds From Broadway” (2001), his last new play on Broadway, a tribute to a fabled Rialto coffee shop, were quick flops. But “The Dinner Party” (2000) ran for almost a year. Mr. Simon made headlines in 2003 when Mary Tyler Moore abruptly left his play “Rose’s Dilemma” (2003) at Manhattan Theater Club. That turned out to be his last produced play. He also made news with the announcement of a kidney transplant in 2004. The donor was Mr. Evans, his longtime press agent and friend. Most recently, in the fall of 2009, Mr. Simon expressed surprise and dismay at the quick closing of a much-anticipated Broadway revival of his “Brighton Beach Memoirs.” It was intended to run in repertory with “Broadway Bound” but closed in a week when it received mixed reviews. “I’m dumbfounded,” he said. “After all these years, I still don’t get how Broadway works or what to make of our culture.” A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 It was a poignant comment from the man who more or less defined Broadway achievement for a couple of decades. But while quick flops were relatively rare in his career, Mr. Simon always fought to gain critical respect. Although he was nominated for 17 Tony Awards, he won just three: for author of “The Odd Couple,” and twice for best play, for “Biloxi Blues” and “Lost in Yonkers.” “I know how the public sees me, because people are always coming up to me and saying, ‘Thanks for the good times,’” Mr. Simon told The Times in 1991. “But all the success has demeaned me in a way. Critically, the thinking seems to be that if you write too many hits, they can’t be that good.” Looking back, Mr. Simon wrote with a still starry-eyed joy of his decision to embark on a playwriting career: “For a man who wants to be his own master, to depend on no one else, to make life conform to his own visions rather than to follow the blueprints of others, playwriting is the perfect occupation. To sit in a room alone for six or seven or 10 hours, sharing the time with characters that you created, is sheer heaven. “And if not heaven,” that master craftsman of the well-timed joke added, “it’s at least an escape from hell.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year “That Championship Season” won the Tony Award for best play. It was 1973 — not 1965, when Mr. Simon was named best author for “The Odd Couple.” An earlier version of this obituary contained an incomplete credit for the original Broadway production of the musical “Little Me,” for which Mr. Simon wrote the book. It was directed by Cy Feuer and Bob Fosse, not just by Mr. Fosse. An earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary, using information from Getty Images, misidentified one of the writers pictured with Mr. Simon and Sid Caesar.

2018,Netflix Tests Promotional Videos but Users See ‘Commercials’,"It’s easy for a Netflix subscriber to watch one episode after another of a favorite show: A viewer makes a selection and lets them keep on coming. Netflix might interrupt a binge after several hours of inactivity by asking “Are you still watching?” and a user has to respond to keep the episodes rolling. But now subscribers face a different interruption: promotional videos, which can last from 10 to 20 seconds. Almost like a commercial, they appear between episodes, reminding viewers not to miss a different show on Netflix. Netflix users were not happy. Netflix users complained they could neither skip nor mute the videos. But Netflix said on Sunday the company was not adding commercials but merely testing promotional videos, which can in fact be skipped. “We have been looking at ways to insert rich video into our experiences for several years,” said Smita Saran, a company spokeswoman. “These video promos are actually personalized recommendations for titles we think a member may enjoy watching,” Ms. Saran said. “In this particular case, we are testing whether surfacing recommendations between episodes helps members discover stories they will enjoy faster.” It was not clear how many subscribers were seeing the videos. Ms. Saran said that the company does not comment on where such tests are conducted but that they are customarily done globally. Netflix, which has over 100 million subscribers, reported last month that it signed up 674,000 new subscribers after forecasting that it would add 1.2 million. In the crowded market of streaming services, there’s an imperative for it to keep its subscribers from straying. Netflix runs hundreds of tests and some are incorporated into the service as features that subscribers can use, while others are invisible. For example, Netflix experimented with movie previews in which a trailer played after users hovered over a title. That became a permanent feature after being tested for years. The promotional videos being tested have been in the works for several years. The tests have to be successful with customers worldwide before they become permanent. Netflix said that it was interested in hearing from customers about its experiments but that it would ultimately be “looking at their behavior within the service.” For now, users can skip the promotional videos or watch them and be nudged toward a new series. Either way, Netflix will be making note.",The New York Times
2018,Netflix Won’t Offer Louis Farrakhan Documentary,"Netflix will not release a documentary celebrating the musical career of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who is notorious for his history of anti-Semitic comments. It appeared that “The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan: My Life’s Journey Through Music,” would be available for streaming on Netflix on Aug. 1, according to a now-deleted Monday Twitter announcement from Mr. Farrakhan’s account. It read: “On August 1st, watch the premiere of my music documentary ‘My Life’s Journey Through Music’ on @netflix.” The documentary also appeared on lists of coming programming for Netflix Britain. It did not appear on Netflix lists distributed in the United States, Australia or Canada. The film was not actually supposed to be scheduled, but, because of an “internal miscommunication,” appeared to be on various platforms, a spokesperson for Netflix said in an email. The Netflix spokesperson would not provide further details on Netflix’s relationship with the film. Mr. Farrakhan and representatives for the Nation of Islam did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In light of Mr. Farrakhan’s announcement, a number of Jewish organizations and people spoke out in media outlets and on Twitter, or said they reached out to Netflix directly. Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, said he immediately called up the Netflix chief executive, Ted Sarandos, who told him that a “glitch” had occurred, and the movie would not be released. Rabbi Hier said it would be terrible to give Mr. Farrakhan “legitimacy” on such a national level by streaming this documentary. “Documentaries should always be screened,” Rabbi Hier said. “But not by bigots and haters.” The biographical documentary, made in 2014 and originally titled “Let’s Change the World,” according to The Final Call, the Nation of Islam’s newspaper, tells the story of Mr. Farrakhan’s foray into playing violin. A trailer for the documentary posted on Facebook shows scenes from the movie that try to reframe criticism of Mr. Farrakhan, labeling him as “misunderstood.” Mr. Farrakhan has been watched by many since his ascent to his post as the leader of the Nation of Islam — a black nationalist political and religious movement — in the 1970s. He has been branded by the Anti-Defamation League as “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism.” In February, he gave a speech at a Nation of Islam convention, where, among other subversive statements, he said Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men.” In June, he lost his Twitter verification for posting a video in which he called Jews “satanic.” Supporters of Mr. Farrakhan expressed dismay in multiple Facebook posts at Netflix’s decision to cut his documentary, but to stream another one, “KKK: The Fight for White Supremacy,” which features members of the Ku Klux Klan speaking about their white supremacist ideology. Organizations including B’nai B’rith International (the oldest Jewish service organization in the world) and the World Jewish Congress (which represents various Jewish organizations in 100 countries around the world) expressed concern with the announcement of “The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan: My Life’s Journey Through Music,” and praised Netflix’s decision to cut it. Gary P. Saltzman, president of B’nai B’rith International, and Daniel S. Mariaschin, the organization’s chief executive, said in an email statement that they were “incredulous” when it appeared that a positive film about Mr. Farrakhan would stream on “such a tremendous platform.” “Broadcast and streaming platforms such as Netflix are under no obligation to carry a particular program,” their statement said. “They make choices every day on what to run and not run. Not running this promotion is the right decision.”",The New York Times
2018,"Netflix and Kenya Barris, Creator of ‘Black-ish,’ Reach a Deal","Netflix formally announced Thursday that it had struck a production deal with Kenya Barris, the creator of the acclaimed ABC comedy “black-ish.” The move was widely expected. Mr. Barris had spent several months negotiating an early exit from his ABC contract, which he and the network agreed to three weeks ago. The relationship between Mr. Barris and ABC soured after the network passed on several of his new shows. It also made the unusual move of refusing to air an episode of “black-ish” earlier this year that dealt with race relations in a particularly pointed fashion. With his new deal, Mr. Barris joins Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes, two prolific producers who also left their network television homes to join the free-spending streaming service and the creative freedoms it offers. “Kenya Barris is one of our great modern storytellers,” said Cindy Holland, the vice president of original content at Netflix. “Kenya uses his voice to make audiences more aware of the world around them, while simultaneously making them laugh.” In a statement, Mr. Barris said that after he started negotiating with Netflix he “started to believe that maybe this mom-and-pop shop with only 130 million subscribers might just be something.” Terms of the deal between Mr. Barris and Netflix were not announced. In addition to “black-ish,” which has been nominated for 13 Emmys, Mr. Barris is also the creator of the spinoff, “Grown-ish,” which broadcasts on Freeform. He also wrote the screenplay for the hit 2017 movie “Girls Trip.” Mr. Barris’s move to Netflix is the latest blow to ABC. Ms. Rhimes, the creative force behind shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” left the network last year and is now poised to oversee an ambitious slate of programming at Netflix. In May, ABC canceled one of its hit shows, “Roseanne,” after its star, Roseanne Barr, posted a racist tweet. And, once again, ABC finished in last place in the ratings among the big broadcast networks for the most recent television season.",The New York Times
2018,Netta Yerushalmy’s Cabinet of Dance Curiosities,"The choreographer Netta Yerushalmy has invented a recipe for her latest work, “Paramodernities”: Take six classic dances. Chop them up. Then tear open the modern canon, with equal parts love and fury. For her ambitious project, which opens on Aug. 8 at Jacob’s Pillow, Ms. Yerushalmy, 40, has created a collection of deconstructed works by choreographers, including Martha Graham and Bob Fosse. “I started by compiling people’s icons,” she said in a recent interview. “And then I was in the library for a long time: watching, watching, watching.” What was she looking for? “The point of view of the shapes and what the body was doing,” Ms. Yerushalmy said. “That’s what got me so hooked in wanting to do this.” Ms. Yerushalmy’s work melds daring ideas with lush movement that makes space for nuance and detail. For “Helga and the Three Sailors” (2014), Ms. Yerushalmy, who grew up in Israel, spent a year studying videos of herself dancing as a young child. She learned that movement and filtered it back into her work. “I did mimicry as a practice,” she said, “rather than making up moves.” “Paramodernities” is an extension of that. The seed for it was first planted in 2013 when Ms. Yerushalmy deconstructed Vaslav Nijinsky’s “Rite of Spring” for a centennial celebration in Berlin. For the six-part production, which is scheduled to be at New York Live Arts next March, each piece is set, not to music, but to text, read live, by scholars and writers who place the dances within the larger frame of modernism. The installments are Nijinsky’s “Rite”; Graham’s “Night Journey” (1947); Alvin Ailey’s “Revelations” (1960); a mash-up of Merce Cunningham works, including “Rainforest,” “Sounddance” and “Ocean” (1968-1990); dance numbers from the 1969 film of Fosse’s “Sweet Charity”; and George Balanchine’s “Agon” (1957). In creating the choreography, Ms. Yerushalmy invented a different movement score for each installment. “They’re all a little brainy,” she said with an apologetic grin. For “Rite,” she printed out Stravinsky’s score — even though she doesn’t read music — and cataloged the movements according to notes; a B-flat, for instance, means a jump. “Revelations” is based on the words of its spirituals. Ms. Yerushalmy assigned movement to phrases like, “fix me, Jesus,” and then wrote them on cardboard, cut them up and put them together randomly. “I didn’t want to be involved,” she said. “I just wanted to put it in the blender.” Pamela Tatge, the director of the Pillow, was intrigued from the start. “I’m very interested in finding ways for archival material to live,” she said. “Netta is examining these works today because she is making the case for how these choreographer’s ideologies figured in modernism.” For the dancer Marc Crousillat, watching cast members — drawn from the contemporary dance world — perform these works has been odd. “But it makes sense,” he said. “All of these dancers who have been around for a long time in the city are engaging in what has been around us in this very endearing way.” The project is one that “feels like it can go on and on,” Ms. Yerushalmy said. “What about Paul Taylor? What about José Limón, Mary Wigman and Pearl Primus?” And the project has changed her, too. She regularly attends Ailey and Graham company performances. And she arrived for our interview having just been at Cunningham technique class. “I have to take class to stay sane,” she said. “But this project brought me to that class. And I was swept in.” Below are edited excerpts from our talk. What is this project all about for you? I’m not making reconstructions, and I’m not doing a dance history thing. I’m trying to make something that doesn’t totally know what it is. In the end, it’s an unstable product. What has it shown you about yourself as a choreographer? I’m still figuring that out. There’s the total displacement of my authorship. Who’s making this thing? Is it mine? Is it the scholars? Is it Ailey’s? What is this? I didn’t really tell the dancers what to do. I said, “Here’s the video. Learn it.” So I’m authoring it, but in a very different way from anything I’ve ever made, so that feels destabilizing. I do know it feels worthwhile. Do you think that you’ll make people look at these dances and appreciate them more? My assumption is that people in the field are sort of like, why are you re-canonizing the canon? Why do we even say their names again? Choreographers often rebel against those who came before them. So why are you exploring their work in such great detail? Because I don’t take any of it for granted. I’m far enough away that it’s like a cabinet of curiosities. I’m not just like, oh, old hat — I know that. And I think it might be useful for the field to have an opportunity to view things in a different way and have a little tension around them. I’m also saying that it’s ours. How so? I’m not so concerned with keeping the legacies alive, but with taking something for myself and for everybody who’s trained and danced and been in a company. That’s how we learned to dance. Even if it was removed in some way? Totally. Early on, we were studying “Revelations” and Jesse Zaritt was very uncomfortable: Why am I, this white Jewish dude in the studio, trying to do all the stuff? By doing this movement, I can ask, “How is this me and not me at the same time?” I can figure out the ways in which I’m intimate with it. And does it belong to a culture or a protected technique that I don’t quite have access to? The whole project has a lot of these tensions. [Smiles happily] It doesn’t quite land.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Never Cook at Home,"Trust me, I know it’s a drag. Ms. Perelman runs the cooking blog Smitten Kitchen. I am a home cook in New York City. I have shared more than 1,400 recipes on my website, Smitten Kitchen, and I’ve written two cookbooks. I am the kind of insufferable person who squeals when the first tomatoes of the season show up at the farmers’ market and I post about them on Instagram with abandon. But there are many good reasons to never cook at home. I know because I bail regularly. First of all, those tomatoes are often staggeringly expensive, as they should be. Farming is brutally hard work. And the results are highly unpredictable, I’ve found in my few failed stints as a Gentlewoman Balcony Farmer. In a city where rents have never been higher, groceries also cost huge chunks of money. As long you can buy five dumplings in Chinatown for $1.25 — forever, I hope — it’s never going to be purely economical to cook at home. And what kind of monster wants to turn on an oven in August, anyway? That wheezing window air-conditioner can only do so much. Did your landlord find your grill on the fire escape and confiscate it, your only way to cook without melting in your apartment? Do you know what doesn’t overheat an apartment in August? A Popsicle for dinner. It’s also hard to cook dinner if work never ends. The extinction of a 9-to-5 workday has largely decimated whatever cushion of time one might use to prepare a meal. And when we get home, we’re more exhausted than ever. Netflix, not a sink full of dishes, beckons. Restaurant delivery is a glorious thing. Everything goes in the trash chute and you have zero dishes to wash. (Unless you’re the kind of civilized person who transfers takeout to plates, in which case, warmly, I believe you’ve brought these problems on yourself.) Cooking, especially a new dish, is a huge gamble. Did the recipe author forget that you don’t have line cooks doing your prep? Was the ninth ingredient in that recipe a confit you were supposed to have made weeks ago? Do they chide you for not using the “best” butter? So many potential pitfalls, all of which could be avoided by not participating. Even good recipes lie. The yields are often bananas. The cooking times are always dubious, too. A “20-minute recipe” seems to take me, on average, about 75 minutes. But everyone knows that cooking is really the least of the hurdles. Creating a meal alone — schlepping groceries, doing all the prep, all the dishes, and being stuck with days of leftovers — can feel like an education in why you should definitely not do that again anytime soon. Obstacles to cooking can come from inside the house, too. Any of the spouses, partners or roommates we have invited into our lives can come home any day and tell us that he or she has adopted a new diet and can no longer eat whatever you just unpacked from the grocery store or love the most. Let’s say you and this spouse or partner have worked out your mixed-dietary relationship and decide to build a mixed-dietary family? Adding more humans to your life means you will have to prepare food with more urgency, thus eliminating the joy it brings you. Maybe you have one of those types of kids who willingly eats kale. Enjoy your good luck, but keep this to yourself. You’ve beaten the odds and it’s impolite to brag. Most parents are mired in a daily battle against young people with untenable demands for a steady diet of macaroni and cheese and halved grapes. Also, sanctimonious cooks are annoying. You feed your children what? Honestly, nothing makes me crave a bowl of cold cereal for dinner like someone telling me the most important thing I can do for my kids’ health, IQ, the economy and even the earth they’ll inherit is to cook dinner every night. We’re in a time when there is such fandom, such fervor over cooking. But those high-speed hands-and-pans videos only remind me of what a slow, inefficient cook I am. Instagram pictures of flawlessly styled plates of food make even my most successful attempts at home look flat. Professional chefs show off elaborate recipes in cookbooks. Sometimes the most sensible act of rebellion tastes like a bowl of popcorn. I am supposed to say: You should cook anyway. Because it’s the right thing to do, we’ve been told ad infinitum. But I don’t want to. There are enough people lining up, eager to lecture or cast a side-eye at your bowl of popcorn. Here’s why I cook: I like the way that closely following a recipe can alleviate pressure after a long day of having to make all the decisions. I love how a dish that worked, or a meal that everyone liked, has the power to change my day. I like that pulling off a good meal when you least expect it is the fastest way to feel victorious, even when real life does not. I like the way that, even when I’m standing over the stove, cursing the recipe writer who suggested that onions might caramelize in 10 minutes, I’m totally absorbed. I’m not on group texts. I’m not following the outrage of the moment on Twitter. I’m getting a brief, needed respite and refuel from fretting over our democracy or forcibly separated families or any of the other horrible things humans do to one another. This thing — focus, concentration, a goal and the reward of something delicious I get to devour — is so rare in my day-to-day life, I’ll take it when I can. And if someone wants to do the dishes or schlep the groceries, or can give me their word that the recipe contains no surprises, I might do it again tomorrow.

From the author of “Corelli’s Mandolin” comes a story about love struggling to survive after war, as Daniel, a fighter pilot and Rosie, an army nurse, hold onto their marriage once the guns have stopped blazing. In which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now. “Before a recent vacation my sister, the most voracious reader I know, sent me Ian McGuire’s THE NORTH WATER. I’ve always loved the sea and tales that are set on it. ‘In addition to its many linguistic splendors, there is a particularly fetching bear,’ my sister’s inscription read. At its most basic level, the book is about a disgraced military surgeon’s turn on a whaling vessel under the command of a cursed captain. But as one who covers the tectonic shifts in information technology that are reordering the world, I found that the book also speaks unexpectedly to our own shambolic times. McGuire sets his novel at the twilight of the whaling industry and the dawn of the Oil Age. He writes as someone who knows that it’s in such moments of turbulence, with so much to gain and so much to lose, that humankind’s darker instincts emerge — its vanity and greed. As one of the book’s only moral characters says, ‘We build a great bonfire to warm ourselves and then complain that the flames are too hot and fierce, that we are blinded by the smoke.’” — Jim Rutenberg, media columnist",The New York Times

Read by Rebecca Hall. (Audible.) The classic story of Lucy Honeychurch, the young woman torn about whether to follow her passion or conform to social norms, interpreted by Hall, a mainstay of the British stage. In which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now. “Rachel Cusk is receiving a lot of attention for her new novel, ‘Kudos,’ and rightly so. It’s the final installment in her post-narrative, conversation-fueled trilogy, which, from start to finish, upends the foundations of captivating and meaningful fiction. But it’s Cusk’s earlier memoir, A LIFE’S WORK, about her first year of motherhood, that has earned a permanent and essential place on my nightstand this year. Reflecting much of my psychological experience as a new mother, the memoir scrutinizes pregnancy, childbirth, breast-feeding and other aspects of early parenting with a brutal but crucial honesty. Cusk repeatedly returns to the biggest challenge of all: the immediate and lasting chasm between a woman’s individual identity and her role as mother. ‘Birth is not merely that which divides women from men: It also divides women from themselves, so that a woman’s understanding of what it is to exist has profoundly changed,’ she writes. I am forever grateful to this tirelessly insightful classic for articulating the alternating anguish and transcendence that comes with this life’s work.” — Megan Twohey, investigative reporter",The New York Times

Charles, a trans woman, turns to a sort of Chaucerian-texting hybrid in an inspired effort to find language as unstable as her experience. “Bieng a tran is a queery of crisees,” she writes, “& r brused handes r manie.” In which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now. “As an excitable city kid some 20 years ago, I sometimes amused myself whacking a ping-pong ball against the walls of our apartment, over and over, pretending to carry on a match between two famous tennis players. ‘Sampras, Agassi, Sampras, Agassi.’ (I was the announcer, too.) The downstairs neighbors loved it. I was reminded of this recently after encountering OPEN, the 2009 autobiography of Andre Agassi, an athlete with a deeper history of irritating his company. At his most rebellious, he set fires in hotel rooms. He took crystal meth. He wore a hairpiece for some reason. But Agassi’s addition to the often loathsome heap of sports-hero lit, written with help from J.R. Moehringer (who refused to be credited as a co-author), transcends the genre with uncommon introspection. This is a story about a kind of mandated ambition — Agassi’s father barked at him until he ruled a sport he hated — and professional loneliness. Tennis players, coming unglued on court, can ‘look like lunatics in a public square,’ Agassi writes, ‘ranting and swearing and conducting Lincoln-Douglas debates with their alter egos.’ Lincoln, Douglas, Lincoln, Douglas.” — Matt Flegenheimer, national political reporter",The New York Times
2018,New & Noteworthy,"IF YOU LEAVE ME By Crystal Hana Kim. (Morrow, $26.99.) Kim’s debut novel tells a story of star-crossed love during the Korean War. A young refugee chooses security over her heart, setting in motion a plot that spans the war years and beyond, following the implications of her difficult decision. SUMMER By Karl Ove Knausgaard. (Penguin, $30.) The Norwegian chronicler of the minutiae of life concludes his seasonal quartet, a series of short diary entries addressed to his infant daughter about everything under the sun — in this book, lawn sprinklers, slugs, tears, ice cream and cynicism. READER, COME HOME By Maryanne Wolf. (Harper, $24.99.) The author of “Proust and the Squid” returns to the subject of technology’s effect on our brains and our reading habits. This is an even more direct plea and a lament for what we are losing, as Wolf brings in new research on the reading brain and examines how the digital realm has degraded her own concentration and focus. STRANGE PARADISE By Grace Schulman. (Turtle Point, paper, $17.) Schulman is an award-winning poet who writes in this memoir about caring for her ailing husband. She puts their relationship under the microscope and meditates on what it means to have a “happy marriage.” THE ONLY GIRL By Robin Green. (Little, Brown, $28.) A dishy memoir about life as the first woman on the masthead at Rolling Stone magazine during the sex and drugs heyday of the 1970s. In which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now. “Not long after President Trump took office last year, my nonfiction reading turned toward books about America’s past — probably my way of getting some intellectual distance from our increasingly acrimonious and insistent present. Recently I picked up Ron Chernow’s GRANT, a sober and admiring portrait of the peerless Civil War general and flawed 18th president. Chernow is a lucid, spare narrator of Grant’s military campaigns, but also of the political calculations intertwined with them, as Grant fends off incompetent politician-generals, appointed to gratify this or that wavering Northern constituency, and becomes Abraham Lincoln’s partner in managing public expectations for a quick victory. All this from a man who, at the war’s outset, was a failed farmer and middling leather-goods salesman. It is a reminder that every national crisis, even one so deadly and intractable as the Civil War, creates its own heroes. They are rarely whom you expect.” — Nicholas Confessore, political correspondent",The New York Times
2018,New Director Is Named for the Freer and Sackler Galleries,"Chase F. Robinson has been named director of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Smithsonian Institution’s museums of Asian art in Washington. He is currently the president of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a professor of Middle Eastern history and culture. The Smithsonian announced the appointment on Tuesday. Mr. Robinson succeeds Julian Raby, who retired in 2017. “Chase is an outstanding scholar with impeccable credentials and a notable educational leader who recognizes the importance of public institutions in advancing understanding as a widespread civic good,” David Skorton, the Smithsonian secretary, said in a statement. When asked about his move from academia to the museum world, Mr. Robinson acknowledged that there may be a learning curve, but, he said, “The walls that separate colleges and universities from museums and libraries and other cultural institutions, I think they’re perforating or even dissolving, particularly as new technologies emerge.” Both types of organizations are focused on reaching larger, more diverse populations and expanding their educational mission, he added. Mr. Robinson said he “feels a particular imperative in this age of increased cultural misunderstanding” to broaden and deepen the Freer-Sackler’s efforts to share Asian and Middle Eastern art and educate people about it. Before becoming president of the Graduate Center, Mr. Robinson served as provost and senior vice president. His books include “Islamic Civilization in Thirty Lives: The First Thousand Years” and “Empire and Elites after the Muslim Conquest: The Transformation of Northern Mesopotamia.” He will begin his new position on Dec. 10.",The New York Times
2018,New E.P.A. Rollback of Coal Pollution Regulations Takes a Major Step Forward,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up for our Climate Fwd: newsletter. WASHINGTON — Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, on Monday signed a plan to weaken regulation of coal-fired power plants, advancing a proposal that the coal industry has hailed as an end to burdensome regulation and environmentalists have criticized as a retreat in the battle to address climate change. Mr. Wheeler’s signature officially sets in motion one of the Trump Administration’s most significant rollbacks yet of former President Barack Obama’s climate change legacy, alongside an earlier decision to let automobiles pollute more. A senior E.P.A. official confirmed the signing late Monday. The agency is expected on Tuesday to discuss the details of its proposal, which it is calling the Affordable Clean Energy rule, to replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which was designed to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The long-anticipated Trump administration overhaul of those rules is likely to set the stage for years of legal clashes. President Trump is expected to head to West Virginia coal country, where in May 2016 that he donned a coal miner’s helmet and vowed to strip away regulations on the industry, on Tuesday and is likely to use the moment to tell supporters that he is following through on that promise. The new plan would all but erase Mr. Obama’s efforts to impose pollution controls on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution from coal-fired power plants in an effort to transition toward cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power. One of the proposal’s most significant changes would give authority to states to decide how much to cut emissions, while restricting what states can do to encourage greater efficiency and other modifications at coal plants. When the rule is submitted into the federal register on Tuesday the public will have 60 days to submit comments before it is finalized. Trump administration officials have long said that the Clean Power Plan exceeded the federal government’s authority. They have said that the new plan operates within the bounds of the 1970 Clean Air Act, which obliges the government to design a way to cut carbon emissions. Coal-industry leaders agreed, and have offered praise. “The proposed rule appears to provide electric cooperatives with a more achievable plan,” said Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, a powerful utility trade group whose members get more than 40 percent of their energy from coal-fired generation. Still, Mr. Matheson said, his member co-ops are already moving away from coal in response to economic reality: Other fuels have become more cost-effective. “The electric cooperative fuel mix for providing electricity is changing, with increased investments in natural gas and renewables,” he said. Indeed, experts said it was unlikely that the new rule would reverse the decline of America’s coal industry. More than 200 coal plants have retired since 2010, mainly because of competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. And dozens of additional retirements have already been announced for the coming years. At the same time, the new rule is expected to have significant implications for aging coal-fired plants across the country, offering incentives to keep them running longer or enabling them to avoid installing modern pollution controls. The end result, critics of the Trump plan said, would be a rise in not just the heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet but a potential rise in soot and other particulate matter that contribute to health problems such as asthma or pulmonary disease. “This egregious climate-denial plan fails to protect the American people from the serious risks of climate change,” said Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and “could send clean energy jobs to China.” The plan, he added, “goes even further and allows polluters to increase the amount of smog and soot they emit into the air our children breathe.” The agency said that the reductions under its proposal would be “comparable” to the Obama rule but “achieved in a legal and reasonable manner.” While the Clean Power Plan aimed to cut carbon emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, the Trump plan sets no national benchmark. By comparison, the Trump plan will cut carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 0.7 to 1.5 percent by 2030. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. The United States is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. The Clean Power Plan was intended to be the cornerstone of America’s pledge under the Paris Agreement on climate change, under which nearly 200 nations vowed voluntary measures to rein in emissions. Gina McCarthy, who led the E.P.A. under Mr. Obama, said that the Trump proposal “makes a false promise that we can actually return to coal as our major and compelling source for energy production, which is simply not the case,” she said. “This kind of signal setting does absolutely nothing to maintain the United States leadership.” The Clean Power Plan was finalized in 2015 but 29 states and the coal industry sued to stop the plan, arguing the federal government had exceeded its authority to regulate emissions. The United States Supreme Court stayed the rule and it never went into effect. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has rolled back a number of his predecessor’s key climate change regulations, most recently freezing fuel efficiency requirements for the nation’s cars and trucks. In recent weeks he has harkened back to his days on the campaign trail, contrasting his embrace of coal miners with the position of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who said in a 2016 campaign appearance in West Virginia, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” Mrs. Clinton later apologized for her comment. “You remember Hillary with the coal, right, sitting with the miners at the table? Remember? That wasn’t so good for her,” Mr. Trump said at a campaign fund-raiser last week.",The New York Times
2018,New Haven Overdoses Tied to Laced K2,"A park in the shadow of Yale’s Old Campus became the scene of a mass overdose on Wednesday as ambulance crews rushed from person to person, desperately treating dozens of semiconscious and disoriented drug users in New Haven. More than 70 people overdosed in the city during a 24-hour span, beginning Tuesday evening, and the authorities said they suspect a virulent batch of synthetic marijuana, possibly laced with an opioid, was the cause. The sheer number of overdoses caused a strain on the city, said Dr. Sandy Bogucki, the city’s director of emergency medical services. Emergency medical technicians, Dr. Bogucki said, were “sprinting from patient to patient in the park.” She said crews were transporting people more quickly than usual “just to turn the cars around and get them back out.” Anthony Campbell, New Haven’s chief of police, said the first overdoses were reported around 8 p.m. on Tuesday at New Haven Green, a downtown park near Yale University. By Wednesday morning, the police said they were notified of several other overdoses from synthetic marijuana, also known as K2, or Spice, not only in the park but in three other locations around the city, including in the Fair Haven and Westville neighborhoods. Officer David Hartman, a spokesman for the New Haven Police, said a “steady stream” of reported overdoses continued throughout the day. “We hope we don’t find any more,” Officer Hartman said. New Haven Police arrested two men on Wednesday in connection to the overdoses. Both were in possession of K2, the police said, and were charged with drug possession. City officials said at least two people had “life-threatening symptoms,” but there were no fatalities. Dana Marnane, a spokeswoman for Yale-New Haven Hospital, said at least 35 people were treated on Wednesday, some of whom have since been released. Five people refused treatment. As paramedics struggled to deal with the wave of overdoses, transporting dozens to Yale-New Haven and other local hospitals, law enforcement officials scrambled to identify what drug was causing people to collapse and to find the supplier. Chief Campbell said that agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration had taken a sample of the K2 to a New York laboratory for testing. Uri Shafir, a D.E.A. agent, said they have not yet released the results of the lab tests. John Alston Jr., the New Haven fire chief, said that the substance ingested by the victims was “some type of marijuana cigarette,” which normally is not treated with Narcan, or naloxone, the overdose-reversing drug. But he said the victims did respond to higher levels of the antidote drug once they got to local hospitals, which led investigators to “deduce that it was laced with something, some opioid compound, possibly fentanyl.” One overdose patient was brought to the hospital, released after being treated and went back to the Green and overdosed again, Chief Alston said. Rick Fontana, the New Haven director of emergency operations, said the drug appeared to be a bad batch of K2 laced with an opioid. “Whether it be a synthetic opioid or fentanyl, we are not sure at this time until we have confirmation on the analysis from the D.E.A.,” Fontana said. Emergency personnel were still present at New Haven Green early Wednesday evening, and planned to remain in the park throughout the night. Just over a month ago, on July 4, another batch of synthetic marijuana caused 14 overdoses, most of them at New Haven Green, the police said. Two years ago, a fentanyl-laced drug was linked to two deaths and 16 overdoses in New Haven. “It’s not unusual to see a large group of people overdosing, but not at this alarming rate,” Officer Hartman said. Often sold by corner stores in brightly colored packages under several brand names, K2 is made of a variety of dried plants and lawn clippings sprayed with industrial chemicals. Synthetic cannabinoids have been found in K2 blends, along with other chemicals known to cause severe kidney damage, nausea, elevated heart rates and vomiting. Mass overdoses on K2 have happened regularly in New York City over the past few years. In May, 56 people were treated for K2 overdoses in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, near the intersection of Broadway and Myrtle Street. During a three-day stretch in July 2016, at least 130 people across New York City were hospitalized after overdosing on K2, with at least 33 people becoming sick in a neighborhood along the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick.",The New York Times
2018,New Medicare Cards Are Being Issued. Here’s What You Need to Know.,"Your Money Adviser As people across the country receive new, safer Medicare cards in the mail, advocates are warning about fraudulent callers who try to dupe people into paying money or divulging personal information. The government is gradually replacing Medicare cards for the 60 million people covered by the federal health plan. Previously, the cards used the recipient’s Social Security number as his or her Medicare number, which posed a risk of identity theft. Congress mandated a change in 2015. “It took a very long time, but it’s in the works,” Sue Greeno of the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy said. The new cards use an 11-character Medicare identifier that contains both numbers and letters, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs Medicare. While the cards are safer, criminals are always alert to new ways of scamming people, said Amy Nofziger, a fraud expert with AARP. Recent calls to the group’s fraud help line indicate that some people have received calls asking for a fee in order to deliver a new Medicare card, or asking for personal information before a new card can be issued. Such calls are bogus. “The card is free,” Ms. Nofziger said, and will be mailed automatically. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “Medicare will never call you uninvited and ask you to give us personal or private information to get your new Medicare Number and card.” Suspicious calls can be reported by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), the agency said. Consumers can also call their local Senior Medicare Patrol, a federally funded service for people on Medicare and their families. The government began mailing the cards this spring. But because mailings are staggered in 10 “waves,” people shouldn’t be alarmed if a friend or a relative in a different state receives a new card first, Medicare administrators said. The agency is about halfway through its mailings and, in “Wave 5,” recently began sending cards to people in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Mailings to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the rest of New England began in July. You can check a special section of the Medicare.gov website to see where cards have been mailed, and you can enter your email to be notified when mailings begin in your state. Here are some questions and answers about the new Medicare cards: The Medicare website says new cards were mailed to my state, but I don’t have mine yet. What should I do? It takes time for the cards in each wave to be mailed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. The agency suggests checking your MyMedicare.gov account to see if one was mailed. (You’ll need to establish an account if you don’t have one.) If it was mailed, you can print a new official card. Or, call 1-800-MEDICARE to see if your information, like your mailing address, needs to be updated. It’s a good idea to check that the Social Security Administration has your current mailing address, since that’s the one Medicare uses, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. He recommends doing so by creating an online “my Social Security account” if you haven’t already. Or call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. Everyone on Medicare should have a new card by April. But to allow for a transition period, doctors can accept the old cards until Dec. 31, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. What should I do with my old Medicare card? Once you receive the new card, you can start taking it to your doctor visits and destroy your old card, the agency advises. Ms. Nofziger of AARP recommends using a “confetti” shredder to destroy the old card. What if I am signing up for Medicare for the first time? New enrollees will receive cards with the new, unique Medicare numbers.",The New York Times

2018,"New Plan for City Streetcar: Shorter, Pricier and Not Coming Soon","The good news for fans of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s Brooklyn-to-Queens streetcar project is that, speculation to the contrary, the city says it is still alive. The rest of the news is that it will cover less ground, cost more and take a lot longer to build than when it was proposed in 2016, city officials said on Wednesday. Astoria Manhattan QUEENSBRIDGE Queens Hunters point Greenpoint Williamsburg DUMBO Brooklyn Downtown Red Hook Carroll gardens Gowanus 1 mile By The New York Times And it will require a billion dollars from a federal government that has shown reluctance to pay for urban mass-transit projects. After two years of studying routes, talking to consultants and residents, and digging test holes in the street, the city is releasing its first fleshed-out vision for the project, which would stitch together waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that have become some of the fastest-growing parts of the city even though they are poorly served by the subway. Highlights of the revised plan include: ■ Twenty-six stops along an 11-mile route running from Gowanus in Brooklyn to Astoria, Queens. (An earlier plan to extend the streetcar southward to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has been scrapped.) ■ A shift of the route inland in parts, away from Dumbo in favor of Downtown Brooklyn. ■ A $2.73 billion price tag, up from the original $2.5 billion estimate. ■ Streetcars running by 2029, not 2024 as initially projected. ■ A projected 50,000 riders per day. The city now begins putting together an environmental-impact statement, a first step in the approval process for a major project. Under the new timetable, construction on the streetcar, formally known as the Brooklyn-Queens Connector or BQX, would not begin until 2024, long after Mr. de Blasio leaves office in 2021. There will be no golden shovel moment for this mayor. But Mr. de Blasio, who has been criticized as being slow to follow up on his own proposal, said Wednesday that it was “time for our transit system to catch up” with the explosive growth along the waterfront. “The BQX is one of the biggest, most ambitious projects in a generation,” the mayor said in a statement. “It will be a challenge, but New York City is taking it on.” The streetcar system, which would run on rails and be powered by overhead wires, was initially expected to pay for its own construction through extra tax revenue brought in by the increase in property values it would trigger along its route. But a $1.3 billion funding gap has opened up, mostly because of a 2016 city policy that earmarks much of the increase in tax revenue for other purposes, including affordable housing, making it unavailable for the streetcar, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen said. It is that gap that the city is looking to Washington to help close. Ms. Glen said that the public-private partnership that would build the streetcar would be expected to contribute up to 10 percent of the cost, leaving about $1 billion to come from the federal government. Though President Trump has slashed funding on many fronts, including withdrawing support for the $30 billion Gateway commuter rail project connecting New York and New Jersey, city officials noted that Congress has restored money for Gateway through the appropriations process. The streetcar — which would link Red Hook, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Long Island City and other places that have seen crumbling industrial waterfronts replaced by new housing and jobs — was met with both enthusiasm and skepticism when Mr. de Blasio proposed it. Critics asked why buses along the same route could not be used instead. That was followed by a long silence, and this spring, Ms. Glen said that if the streetcar did not pay for itself, “We have to decide whether or not this is the right use of capital money for a transportation project.” On Wednesday, though, she ruled out using the city’s capital budget to pay for it. Keeping the streetcar alive has meant moving and shrinking it. The infrastructure beneath Dumbo’s waterfront streets is ancient and would have to be upgraded at considerable cost before tracks were laid, and ridership in the neighborhood would be under 1,000 people a day, the city found. The inland route through Downtown Brooklyn had more connections to subways and buses and would see much higher ridership. The stretch from Gowanus south to Sunset Park would also have few riders, would require a new bridge across the Gowanus Canal and largely duplicates the route of the R train. The city’s study also determined that the project would cost about $250 million per mile, up from the original $150 million estimate, largely because of the complexity and condition of underground utilities. Many of the benefits of the proposal remain, the city said, including improved mass transit access for thousands of public-housing residents and a new bridge across Newtown Creek, the industrial waterway that separates Brooklyn from Queens, that would be used by streetcars, walkers and cyclists. Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research group, said that he remained excited about the streetcar but that now was not the right time to seek federal support. “This is a project that should be able to generate local revenues to cover it, if it’s being done in conjunction with the growth of the city and the region and corridor,” Mr. Wright said. But city officials, noting the 10-year timeline, said they felt the federal dollars would flow sooner or later. “In the long run, good projects get federal funds,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner.",The New York Times
2018,"New Reasons (Cookies, Pizza) to Go to Greenpoint","THE RESTAURANT PREVIEW This fall’s openings serve up more of the comfort foods that exemplify the area’s ‘small-town charm.’ It was only a matter of time before Greenpoint became a magnet for restaurants. With the L train shutting down next spring for 15 months of repairs, next-door Williamsburg is already losing its appeal as a dining hub. That may allow Greenpoint to emerge as a less expensive alternative for restaurateurs and diners, but one that offers similar amenities: proximity to Manhattan, waterfront views and plenty of new stores and apartments. Once largely industrial and still known for its Polish immigrant population, Greenpoint this year has had several openings, including Di An Di, a stylish pho spot; Oxomoco, an airy Mexican restaurant with wood-fired grills; Annicka, a cafe and bar specializing in New York-made beer, wine, cider and spirits; and Bernie’s, a faux-retro diner. Unlike Williamsburg, Greenpoint has always been difficult to reach by subway. The area is served by the G line. But “because it is so disconnected, it has this small-town charm,” said Nick Padilla, the chef and an owner of the Palace, a bar that he and his co-owners and managing partners, Mary Schultz and Rita Puskas, are opening next month in a space that housed an Irish pub for more than 80 years. The Palace will serve classic cocktails and “unpretentious, blue-collar” food like homemade corned beef and collard green melts, said Mr. Padilla, who also owns the Greenpoint restaurant Alameda. Also coming this fall is Alula, a cafe where “Moorish meets healthy American food,” said its owner, Tony Ismail. Mr. Ismail, who was born in Beirut, Lebanon, will serve sandwiches, salads and grain bowls accented by Middle Eastern specialties like the red pepper-based muhammara and kishk, made with dried yogurt and bulgur. Two of Greenpoint’s veteran establishments, Paulie Gee’s and Ovenly, are expanding within the neighborhood. Paulie Gee’s founder, Paulie Giannone, whose flagship restaurant commands long waits for its plush, wood-fired pizzas, plans to open Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop this week, featuring an extensive vegan pizza selection in addition to the more classic slices, and takeout options. (The original has an infamous no-takeout policy.) Ovenly, known for its nostalgia-inducing baked goods, will open an event hub near its flagship bakery called Ovenly Studio One54. Every morning the space will sell drip coffee and pastries — think “cookie pies” and mini Bundt cakes — that are being auditioned for other Ovenly locations, said Erin Patinkin, who founded Ovenly in 2010 with her fellow baker Agatha Kulaga. Pastries will be overseen by the James Beard Award-winning chef Karen DeMasco. Greenpoint is unusual, Ms. Patinkin said, in that “people know each other. It actually feels like a neighborhood.” “I think that matters,” she added. “Chefs want that.” Alula 252 Franklin Street (Eagle Street), alulabrooklyn.com, September.

2018,New Restaurants to Fill In New York’s Gaps,"THE RESTAURANT PREVIEW This fall’s openings offer fresh choices in busy neighborhoods that need them, and in cuisines that can always use a bigger spotlight. Around New York City you’ll find thickets of restaurants — so-called restaurant rows, or neighborhoods so saturated with food choices that they seem zoned for dining. Elsewhere, even in highly trafficked places, the options can be sparse, neither satisfying to the locals nor attractive to visitors. For me, a big piece of news in the openings this fall is the arrival of some remedies — several compelling new restaurants in areas that cry out for them. Exhibit A: the Upper West Side, not just around Lincoln Center but also to the south and north. The roster of newcomers is led by Leonti, where the chef Adam Leonti has taken over the 77th Street space that housed the acclaimed Dovetail. In the Time Warner Center, David Chang will install a version of Momofuku Noodle Bar, as well as Bang Bar for grab-and-go fare. (The rest are detailed here.) Another cultural destination, the blocks around Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Opera House and Harvey Theater, begs for more pre- and post-performance choices. There, Harris Salat and Rick Horiike — the celebrated team behind Ganso Ramen, which closed this year, will resurrect the Bond Street space as Taqueria, serving marinated and grilled pork, beef, chicken, mushrooms and peppers wrapped in housemade tortillas, and larger plates like braised brisket and tongue. They expect this menu will be less seasonal than steaming bowls of ramen. Times Square has countless restaurants and pubs, but few serious chefs’ names. The marquee-worthy John Fraser, of the Loyal and formerly of Dovetail, will bring his stylish sensibility to several as-yet-unnamed restaurants in the new the Times Square Edition hotel. (More about that here.) Like neighborhoods, there are also cuisines that could use a brighter spotlight. The city’s prospects for Vietnamese dining, for example, have improved over the past few years, especially in the East Village. There, Yen Vo and her husband, the chef Jimmy Ly, who created the standout Madame Vo, are taking the cuisine in a new direction with the nearby Madame Vo BBQ. “We wanted to show another take on Vietnamese food,” Ms. Vo said, “It’s festive food, more interactive and fun.” Unlike the original, the new place will be fitted with Japanese tabletop grills for searing skewered Wagyu beef wrapped in betel leaf, black sea bass, sugarcane shrimp and lemongrass grilled oysters. Chelsea Market may have lost Chelsea Thai, the venerable shop and food counter, in January, but lovers of Thai food can welcome Ayada in its place. (And they will now find Chelsea Thai in the East Village, where it opened this month.) Ayada is an offshoot of the restaurant of the same name in Flushing, Queens, where the spiciness of the food brought our critic Ligaya Mishan to tears. “It was thrilling: so much of the Thai food in New York is docile, its spice neutered in a bid for Western palates,” she wrote. “There were no such concessions here.” The chef Sung Park plans to meld French and Korean food and pour makgeolli cocktails at Windrose, in what had been Mas (farmhouse) in the West Village. Not far away, in the former Tertulia space, the chef Erik Ramirez of Llama Inn will open Llama-San, serving Nikkei cuisine, the Peruvian-Japanese hybrid known for its raw fish with chiles. If you have tasted examples of it at the Nobu restaurants or Sen Sakana, you’re surely ready for more; at Llama-San, chefs will use a robataya wood-fired grill. Mediterranean food will get a new home at Benno, an intimate dining room in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad. The chef Jonathan Benno, who ran Lincoln Ristorante in Lincoln Center, has already opened a restaurant and a bakery in the hotel; his new flagship will focus on the cooking of Northern Italy and Southern France, while touching on neighboring regions like Morocco and Spain. A similar itinerary will be on the menu in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, at Saint Julivert Fisherie, a seafood restaurant from Alexandra Raij and Eder Montero, whose popular Spanish place La Vara is nearby. When the chef Einat Admony closed her standard-bearer Balaboosta in April she promised it would reopen. And it will, taking over the West Village space occupied by her Bar Bolonat, which will close at the end of this month. Ms. Admony’s particular blend of Israeli, North African and Middle Eastern cuisines will show up in dishes like her Yemenite dumplings. With real estate costs in the stratosphere, New York restaurants now capitalize on every inch of space — hence, all the speakeasy-style nooks tucked over, under and around existing restaurants. It will continue with Undercote, a sultry little basement den promising Korean tidbits and drinks, from the Norwegian bartender Sondre Kasin. The location is beneath Cote, a sleek, thriving Korean steakhouse in the Flatiron district. La Cave, an elegant hideaway lounge for a glass of wine with hors d’oeuvres and desserts will open downstairs at Bistro Pierre Lapin in the West Village. And above Osamil, a Korean gastro pub in NoMad, will be Osamil Upstairs, for innovative drinks, a raw-bar spread and steaks. (One high-profile chef, Tom Colicchio, will move beyond the city, opening Small Batch, a barnlike farm-to-table affair in Roosevelt Field, the Nassau County megamall.) And then there are the stragglers, the openings that failed to happen last fall. I’m still intrigued by Zauo, a Japanese restaurant where diners catch their own fish from open tanks. And I’m looking forward to the Italian-accented Greenmarket fare that Rita Sodi and Jody Williams plan to serve at Pisellino, a bar with food from morning to night, across the street from their Via Carota in the West Village.

2018,"New Russian Hacking Targeted Republican Groups, Microsoft Says","BOSTON — The Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election appears to have a new target: conservative American think tanks that have broken with President Trump and are seeking continued sanctions against Moscow, exposing oligarchs or pressing for human rights. In a report scheduled for release on Tuesday, Microsoft Corporation said that it detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific Senate offices or political campaigns. The shift to attacking conservative think tanks underscores the Russian intelligence agency’s goals: to disrupt any institutions challenging Moscow and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The Hudson Institute has promoted programs examining the rise of kleptocracy in governments around the world, with Russia as a prime target. The International Republican Institute, which receives some funding from the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, has worked for decades in promoting democracy around the world. “We are now seeing another uptick in attacks. What is particular in this instance is the broadening of the type of websites they are going after,” Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, said Monday in an interview. “These are organizations that are informally tied to Republicans,” he said, “so we see them broadening beyond the sites they have targeted in the past.” The International Republican Institute’s board of directors includes several Republican leaders who have been highly critical of Mr. Trump’s interactions with Mr. Putin, including a summit meeting last month between the two leaders in Helsinki, Finland. Among them are Senator John McCain of Arizona; Mitt Romney, a former presidential candidate; and — though he was silent on Mr. Trump’s appearance in Helsinki — Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who was replaced in the spring as the White House national security adviser. General McMaster, who is now retired, had been the author of the national security strategy that called for treating Russia as a “revisionist power” and confronting it around the world. “This is another demonstration of the fact that the Russians aren’t really pursuing partisan attacks, they are pursuing attacks that they perceive in their own national self-interest,” said Eric Rosenbach, the director of the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University, on Monday. “It’s about disrupting and diminishing any group that challenges how Putin’s Russia is operating at home and around the world.” The State Department has traditionally helped fund both Republican and Democratic groups that engage in promoting democracy. Daniel Twining, the president of the International Republican Institute, called the apparent “spear phishing” attempt “consistent with the campaign of meddling that the Kremlin has waged against organizations that support democracy and human rights.” “It is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize Mr. Putin’s authoritarian regime,” Mr. Twining said in a statement. The goal of the Russian hacking attempt was unclear, and Microsoft was able to catch the spoofed websites as they were set up. But Mr. Smith said that “these attempts are the newest security threats to groups connected with both American political parties” ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “These attacks are seeking to disrupt and divide,” he said. “There is an asymmetric risk here for democratic societies. The kind of attacks we see from authoritarian regimes are seeking to fracture and splinter groups in our society.” On Sunday, the current national security adviser, John R. Bolton, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the fall elections. He also named China, Iran and North Korea — the other most active cyberoperators among state adversaries — as threats. But so far Microsoft and other firms have not found extensive election-related actions by those nations. Senior United States intelligence officials have also warned that the midterm elections will be targeted by foreign governments looking to influence American voters. Speaking last month at the Aspen Security Forum, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that his agency was seeing information operations “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in the country.” Only days later, in a report first released to members of Congress, Facebook revealed that it had discovered and eliminated an influence operation aimed at fueling divisions among Americans by targeting progressive groups. Facebook stopped short of naming Russia as the culprit of that campaign, although the social media company pointed to similarities between the influence operation and previous work by the Russian state-linked Internet Research Agency. The attempt revealed by Microsoft mirrored efforts by Russian state-backed hackers before the 2016 presidential election. After the 2016 vote, a number of cybersecurity companies discovered websites that had been created by Russian hackers to spoof, or mimic, those of well-known institutions. Among the think tanks targeted were the Council on Foreign Relations and the Eurasia Group, both based in New York; the Center for a New American Security in Washington; Transparency International in Berlin; and the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. A single letter, or even a punctuation mark, was often the only difference between the real and fake websites. The fake websites were used as the conduit for a number of attacks, including persuading victims to download harmful malware or to reveal passwords and other personal information. But for the past year, Microsoft has grown increasingly aggressive in countering them. In 2016, a federal judge in Virginia agreed that the group Microsoft calls “Strontium” and others call “APT 28,” for “advanced persistent threat,” would continue its attacks. The judge appointed a “special master” with the power to authorize Microsoft to seize fake websites as soon as they are registered. As a result, the hackers have lost control of many of the sites only days after creating them. But it is a constant cat-and-mouse game, as the Russian hackers seek new vectors of attack while Microsoft and others seek to cut them off. “These attacks keep happening because they work. They are successful again and again,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, who doubts whether anyone can stay ahead of the hackers. “Microsoft is playing whack-a-mole here,” Mr. Rid said. “These sites are easy to register and bring back up, and so they will keep doing so.” Last month, Microsoft announced that it had detected and helped block similar attacks against two senators who are up for re-election. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces one of the toughest political challenges this year, acknowledged that her campaign was among them after months of keeping the news quiet — apparently to avoid alienating voters who doubt the Russian role in election interference. Microsoft says it is expanding its effort to help political candidates counter foreign influence. It is starting an initiative it calls “AccountGuard” to bolster protections to candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations. With the midterms less than three months away, Microsoft said greater cooperation was needed between tech companies and the federal government over efforts to interfere in the American elections. “Over the last year, the larger tech companies, in particular, have put into place stronger information-sharing practices where we have seen these threats emerge,” Mr. Smith said. “Those agreements, however, are informal.”",The New York Times
2018,New Sentences: From Instagram’s ‘#Puffins’ Tag,"New Sentences — From the Instagram account seanlophotography, on Aug. 14, 2018. I subscribe, on Instagram, to the hashtag “#puffins.” It is a visual fire hose of bird-clowns, and it brings me joy all day long. We do not have nearly the space here for me to explain the particular magic of these birds — the comedy of their bowling-pin proportions, the expressiveness of their head tilts, the way they cluster on rocky islands but then scatter off, flapping madly, bullet-shaped in the air, only to dive and plunge into the sea, emerging with beaks full of sagging silver fish. Vast colonies of puffins nest in my heart, and language cannot possibly hope to contain them. Let us move on. The sentence above is from an Instagram post by the wildlife photographer Sean Lo. It is part of a caption for a glorious image: a close-up photo of a puffin opening its bright beak against a stone-blue sky. In the gap of the bird’s mouth, we can see just a hint of breath, a tiny drift of puffin-fog, suspended in the cold air. (This photo was categorized under not only #puffins but #birdstagram, #cutenessoverload, #wildlife_perfection and #nuts_about_birds.) What brings the caption to the next level is this factoid about average body temperature: A bird’s metabolism is so high, we learn, that it is nearly seven degrees hotter than an average human’s. (That is a large gap — the difference between Pittsburgh and Miami in July.) It is the sort of sentence — a little gift box spring-loaded with information — that reminds me of the things I most loved to read as a child: almanacs, nature magazines, stout collections of outlandish facts. As our modern reading metabolisms change, as social media becomes an increasingly large part of our daily diet, this sort of sentence becomes more and more common — a tiny shot of knowledge or style, appearing and disappearing as quickly as a breath of air.",The New York Times
2018,New Sentences: From Mitski’s ‘Two Slow Dancers’,"New Sentences — From Mitski’s “Two Slow Dancers,” the final song on the new album “Be the Cowboy” (Dead Oceans, Aug. 17, 2018). There are great sentences on paper and great sentences in songs, but the two categories don’t usually overlap. One is for the eyes and the other for the ears. Put a great on-the-page sentence in a song, and it may well feel as though the singer, strutting heroically across the stage, has paused to consult an index card. Put a great song lyric on the page, and it may provoke the same cringing reaction as teenage-diary entries and bad writing in dialect. The sound of a human voice changes a lot. This is as true of the singer-songwriter Mitski as it is of anyone, apart from the wrinkle that she already has a singing voice like a piece of prose: It’s precise and mannered, moving methodically from note to note with total composure. It’s as though she has applied all the old admonitions of Strunk and White — omit needless words, write with nouns and verbs — to performance instead of writing. Those two would probably feel vindicated by the results: Mitski’s composure means that even the smallest ripple of expressiveness in her voice can hit like an earthquake. “Two Slow Dancers” is about two old people sharing a dance, both acutely aware of the “old” part. (“The ground has been slowly pulling us back down,” it says; “you see it on both our skin.”) What’s remarkable about its first line, crooned softly into near-empty space, is the way the gravity of Mitski’s voice steals the school dance from the realm of cliché and reminds us what it actually is: a ritual. The school gym is where American children are first formally invited and encouraged, with adults watching and everything, to put our bodies near those of our peers and move them together, at precisely the stage in our development when this possibility is most terrifying and intriguing. To inquire, flatly, decades later, about the unforgettable scent of that? It’s interesting to the eye, sure, but tectonically heavy to the ear.",The New York Times
2018,New Sentences: From ‘Paul Simon: The Life’,"New Sentences — From Robert Hilburn’s “Paul Simon: The Life” (Simon & Schuster, 2018, Page 79). Hilburn spent decades as a music critic and editor at The Los Angeles Times and has also written a biography of Johnny Cash. This sentence refers to the notoriously stinky English town of Widnes, at whose train station Paul Simon is reported to have written the hit song “Homeward Bound.” The residents, tired of bad publicity and refreshed by the touch of folk-rock greatness, installed a historical marker. But such commemorations — plaques, portraits, statues — are always complicated. When history is compressed into tiny spaces, reality gets forced out like water from a squeezed sponge. (A statue of Winston Churchill might capture the hang of his jowls, but it can never reproduce the honey-tongued bellicosity that defined much of World War II.) The “Homeward Bound” plaque in Widnes is layered with ironies as lush and tight as any Simon and Garfunkel harmony. First of all, the song is not exactly a celebration of the town. It is a statement of complete distaste, of desperately wanting to leave. (“And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories.”) Also, Simon probably didn’t actually write the song in Widnes. According to this biography, he was in a hurry and nearly missed his train, which would have left no time for scribbling lyrics about the bittersweet nature of life on the road. He may have thought about the song in Widnes, but he didn’t write it there. Still, the “Homeward Bound” plaque contains enough pop-cultural juice that it has been stolen multiple times. It is a memorial not to presence but to absence: a plaque at a railroad station, commemorating a song about a man wanting to leave that railroad station, that refuses to stay at the railroad station.",The New York Times
2018,New Trailer: Orson Welles’s ‘The Other Side of the Wind’,"Orson Welles shot “The Other Side of the Wind” between 1970 and 1977, but it has only recently been finished by some of the director’s disciples. Now, on the eve of the Hollywood satire’s premiere at the Venice Film Festival, a head-spinning trailer has been released. Another cinematic giant, John Huston, stars as a legendary director who’s trying to make a comeback, and that’s not the story’s only autobiographical element. Lines delivered about Mr. Huston’s character (“He’s just making it up as he goes along,” “What he creates he has to wreck — it’s a compulsion”) could just as easily have been said about the notoriously chaotic Mr. Welles himself. As the trailer cuts back-and-forth between black-and-white and color footage, other filmmakers of the era like Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper can be seen playing characters similar to themselves. Oja Kodar, who was Mr. Welles’ romantic companion at the time and is credited as the movie’s co-writer, also appears. Netflix, which financed the film’s restoration, will also release a documentary about Mr. Welles, “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead,” by the Oscar-winning director Morgan Neville (“20 Feet From Stardom”). “The Other Side of the Wind” will be available on the streaming service as well as in theaters on Nov. 2.",The New York Times
2018,New Trailer: Ryan Gosling in ‘First Man’,"In a signature scene from the Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle’s 2016 musical “La La Land,” the song-and-dance man Ryan Gosling suddenly lifts off into the sky. The duo will shoot for the stars once again with “First Man,” a biopic of the astronaut Neil Armstrong that opens the Venice Film Festival. A newly released trailer reflects the drama’s attempt to balance the intimate with the epic. The clip cuts between scenes of the commander trying to assuage his family’s concerns for his safety (Mr. Gosling sings the lullaby “I See the Moon” to his character’s baby girl) with recreations of Apollo 11’s sometimes-troubled mission to the moon in 1969. Claire Foy (“The Crown”) co-stars as Mr. Armstrong’s wife, Janet, and Corey Stoll (“House of Cards”) plays his fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Kyle Chandler and Jason Clarke can be seen as members of NASA’s mission control, who get dressed down by Ms. Foy’s character: “You’re a bunch of boys — you don’t have anything under control!” “First Man” will land in theaters on Oct. 12.",The New York Times
2018,"New Trailer: ‘The Front Runner,’ With Hugh Jackman","A politician is accused of infidelity, and the activities of the tabloid media become an integral part of the story. The new trailer for the forthcoming drama “The Front Runner” depicts events from 30 years ago, but its themes could be ripped from today’s headlines. The Australian-born Hugh Jackman affects an American accent as Gary Hart, the U.S. Senator from Colorado who led the field of Democratic candidates for president in 1988 until his affair with Donna Rice, a former beauty-pageant winner, was exposed. A photo of Ms. Rice sitting on Mr. Hart’s lap on board a yacht called Monkey Business (which was also written on the candidate’s T-shirt) was published by the National Enquirer and helped lead to his withdrawal from the race. The Democratic nomination was ultimately won by Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. The film reunites the director Jason Reitman with Vera Farmiga, who co-starred in his 2009 corporate satire “Up in the Air” and plays Mr. Hart’s beleaguered wife, Lee, here. J.K. Simmons, a semiregular in Mr. Reitman’s films (“Thank You for Smoking,” “Juno”), is cast as Bill Dixon, Mr. Hart’s longtime friend and campaign manager. The trailer, wittily scored to Nina Simone’s “Sinnerman,” indicates Mr. Reitman may be channeling the sardonic spirit of earlier political films like 1972’s “The Candidate.” The release date for “The Front Runner” could hardly be timelier: Election Day, Nov. 7.",The New York Times
2018,New U.S. Sanctions Target Russia for Defying Rules on North Korea,"The Trump administration announced a series of sanctions on Tuesday targeting Russia, including ships that are delivering Russian oil to North Korea despite ongoing sanctions and marine companies that are supplying Russia’s military. The ships, based in Vladivostok and operating for Primorye Maritime Logistics Co. and Gudzon Shipping Co., have defied international sanctions against North Korea by engaging in ship-to-ship transfers of oil to North Korean ships, which then bring the contraband into North Korean ports. The Trump administration has been warning against this practice for months. But while negotiations with North Korea were going well, the administration largely turned a blind eye to the problem. The marine companies were sanctioned for doing business with a Russian company, Divetechnoservices, that the Trump administration had sanctioned on June 11 over its links to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main security and intelligence agency in the country. In the months since President Trump’s June summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, North Korea has shown few signs that it intends to surrender its nuclear or ballistic weapons or even to slow down the manufacture of new ones. As a result, the administration is once again ratcheting up economic pressure on Pyongyang and its enablers. Similarly, although Mr. Trump had a warm summit meeting in July in Helsinki with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, his government has been increasing pressure on Moscow. On Tuesday, that pressure grew in a small way with sanctions announced against a variety of marine companies for supplying underwater equipment and diving systems to Russian government agencies, including the F.S.B. The companies include Vela-Marine Ltd. and two people associated with sanctioned companies, Marine Igorevna Tsareva and Anton Aleksandrovich Nagibin. “The Treasury Department is disrupting Russian efforts to circumvent our sanctions,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a news release. “Today’s action against these deceptive actors is critical to ensure that the public is aware of the tactics undertaken by designated parties and that these actors remain blocked from the U.S. financial system.” The new sanctions against Russia come just as Microsoft released a report showing that the Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election is now targeting conservative think tanks that have pushed for a tougher line against Moscow.",The New York Times
2018,New U.S. Sexual Misconduct Rules Bolster Rights of Accused and Protect Colleges,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is preparing new policies on campus sexual misconduct that would bolster the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape, reduce liability for institutions of higher education and encourage schools to provide more support for victims. The proposed rules, obtained by The New York Times, narrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses. They would also establish a higher legal standard to determine whether schools improperly addressed complaints. The new rules would come at a particularly sensitive time, as major institutions such as Ohio State University, the University of Southern California and Michigan State University deal with explosive charges that members of their faculty and staff have perpetrated serious sexual misconduct. But for several years, higher education administrators have maintained that sexual misconduct rules pressed by the Obama administration unnecessarily burdened them with bureaucratic mandates that had little to do with assault or harassment, and men’s rights groups have said the accused have had little recourse. Unlike the Obama administration’s guidance documents, the Trump administration’s new rules will have the force of law and can go into force without an act of Congress, after a public comment period. Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the department was “in the midst of a deliberative process.” She added that any information obtained by The Times “is premature and speculative, and therefore, we have no comment.” Last fall, Ms. DeVos rescinded a 2011 letter prepared by the Obama administration that outlined the responsibilities of schools and colleges that receive federal funding to address episodes of sexual misconduct. Victims rights groups praised the Obama-era guidelines for aggressively holding schools accountable for complaints of sexual harassment, assault and rape that they said had often been played down or ignored. But critics contended that too often they trampled due-process rights for accused students. In announcing the rescission of the letter, Ms. DeVos assailed the guidelines as federal overreach that coerced schools into setting up quasi-judicial systems fraught with inconsistencies. “The truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students,” Ms. DeVos said in September 2017. “Survivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved.” Ms. DeVos has also criticized the Obama administration for imposing rules without following the legal processes, which would allow for a public comment period. The department’s proposal would preserve much of the law that protects against sex discrimination, called Title IX, which for the past two decades has extended beyond gender-specific discrimination to include sexual misconduct as a form of denying students access to an education. But for what appears to be the first time, the federal government would go beyond guidance and recommendations to codify how it defines sexual harassment in the nation’s schools and the steps institutions are legally required to take to address it. They could also be revised before they are formally published. There is still dissension among employees in the Education and Justice Departments about whether more of the standards from guidance issued in 2001 should be codified in the new regulations, and whether some of the provisions should apply only to higher education, according to people familiar with the administration’s deliberations. While the issue has centered on allegations against students on college campuses, it also applies to elementary and secondary schools and allegations against teachers, professors and other employees. “The department recognizes that despite well-intentioned efforts by school districts, colleges and universities, advocacy organizations and the department itself, sexual harassment and assault continue to present serious problems across the nation’s campuses,” the department wrote in the draft rule. “The lack of clear regulatory standards has contributed to processes that have not been fair to all parties involved, that have lacked appropriate procedural protections and that have undermined confidence in the reliability of the outcomes of investigations of sexual harassment allegations.” Advocates of victims rights condemned the proposals. They are “a tacit endorsement of making campuses a safer place to commit sexual assault, rather than a safer place to learn free from violence,” said Jess Davidson, the executive director of End Rape on Campus. But groups that have long challenged the sexual assault policies under the Obama administration praised the proposed rules. “Going solely by what has so far been reported, it sounds as though the proposed rules will go a long way towards restoring meaningful due process protections to the campus justice system, which will benefit both accusers and the accused,” said Robert L. Shibley, the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. After the department rescinded the Obama letter and a subsequent question-and-answer document, it reinstated temporary guidelines, which drew from guidance issued in 2001 and a subsequent letter issued in 2006. The Obama administration built upon that guidance but had notable differences. The new regulations cement some of the most debated policy positions in the interim guidance, such as allowing schools to choose the evidentiary standard — “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing” evidence — to apply in determining whether accused students are responsible for alleged misconduct. They also leave it to schools to decide whether to have an appeals process. The most protested part of the Obama administration guidance was the mandate that schools use the preponderance-of-evidence standard, the lower standard of the two, in determining whether those accused should be disciplined or expelled. The Trump administration rules propose that a school’s choice of evidentiary standard must apply to any investigation of civil rights violations. The rules also maintain Ms. DeVos’s year-old policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions, and would add the ability for victims and their accused perpetrators to request evidence from each other and to cross-examine each other. The rules also allow the complainant and the accused to have access to any evidence obtained during the investigation, even if there are no plans to use it to prove the conduct occurred. The Obama administration held that mediation was not appropriate, even if voluntary. It also strongly discouraged parties from personally questioning each other during hearings, believing it would be “traumatic or intimidating, thereby possibly escalating or perpetuating a hostile environment.” The previous administration also recommended that schools provide an appeals process. The new rules would adopt a new Supreme Court definition of “sexual harassment” that appears to be reserved for repeated complaints or the most egregious allegations. The new rules would define sexual harassment to mean “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school’s education program or activity.” In its guidance, the Obama administration defined the act more broadly as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” that includes “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.” The proposed regulations do not define what constitutes a “hostile environment” for victims as previous guidance did, but does allow a school to remove an accused person from campus after conducting a safety and risk assessment. The new rules would require that institutions only be held legally responsible for investigating formal complaints and responding to reports that school officials have “actual knowledge” of happening. A formal complaint is one made to “an official who has the authority to institute corrective measures,” not, for instance, a residential adviser in a dormitory. The regulation contrasts with the standard, dating to 2001, that a “school knows, or reasonably should know, about possible harassment.” College leaders have long complained that was too broad and held them accountable for allegations of which they were not aware. Under the new rules, schools would be held to a new standard for determining whether they took the proper steps to address the allegations. That standard, called “deliberately indifferent,” means that an institution is found in violation of the law “only if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.” The new rules would also hold schools responsible only for investigating episodes reported to have taken place within their own programs, or on their campuses, not, for instance, in off-campus parties. The Obama administration required that schools investigate a complaint regardless of where the conduct initially took place. The rules also say that the government will not penalize schools if they provide “supportive measures” to victims who choose to forgo filing a written complaint. The regulations encourage measures that are “nondisciplinary individualized services” and “nonpunitive, time-limited and narrowly tailored” to keep students in school. The rules provide an extensive list of options, such as counseling, deadline extensions, changes in class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in housing, leaves of absences or increased security and monitoring. The regulations go to great lengths to require impartiality in investigations. They call on schools to conduct objective investigations and provide “prompt and equitable” resolutions. And, for the first time, the administration explicitly says that just as an institution’s treatment of a complainant could constitute sex discrimination, so would the treatment of the accused. The regulations require that schools approach all investigations under the presumption that the accused is innocent until proved guilty.",The New York Times
2018,New York City Is Briefly Labeled ‘Jewtropolis’ on Snapchat and Other Apps,"Users of a variety of popular apps and services, including Snapchat, awoke Thursday morning to find that New York City had been relabeled “Jewtropolis” on maps displayed in the apps. People on Twitter quickly posted screen shots of the maps, calling them racist and anti-Semitic. Maps on Snapchat, Citi Bike, StreetEasy and even The New York Times all appeared to be affected. All use embeddable maps from a third-party company called Mapbox. The company’s chief executive, Eric Gundersen, said in an interview that the mishap was the “ugliest kind” of error. Mapbox creates its maps using more than 130 different sets of data, including data from a map of the world called OpenStreetMap that is free to use and built by volunteers. One of the volunteers made more than 80 anti-Semitic or hate-oriented edits to locations around the world, including New York, Mr. Gundersen said. Edits made to map data — approximately 70,000 every day — are flagged by a computer and reviewed by people before they are published, Mr. Gundersen said. A human reviewer stopped all of the other anti-Semitic edits made on Thursday, but pushed the “Jewtropolis” edit live. The error was caught within one hour and fixed, Mapbox said. The company is investigating why the human reviewer published the label and plans to add additional layers of vetting, Mr. Gundersen said. “Hate speech online is horrible,” he said. “The internet should be safe, maps should be safe.” Many broadcast their concerns about the label on social media early Thursday morning. Some of the companies affected said they reached out to Mapbox once they were alerted to the error and asked the company to fix it. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, apologized to its users Thursday and called the error “deeply offensive.” A spokeswoman for StreetEasy said the company was “deeply sorry” the error had appeared on its site. A spokeswoman for Motivate, the company that operates Citi Bike, said that Mapbox should make sure “that disgusting slurs like these don’t appear again.” Mapbox essentially supplies the base layer of the map.

2018,"New York City, Geocachers’ Paradise","Jeremy Jacobowitz and John Mitchell were on the hunt for treasure in Central Park. Mr. Jacobowitz consulted the coordinates on his phone as a misty rain fell. He and Mr. Mitchell were geocaching, and if past experience was any guide, they would most surely find something. In nine years as a geocacher, Mr. Jacobowitz has discovered more than 8,200 caches, as the treasures are known, ranking him very near the top of the heap among New York City players. Mr. Mitchell counts his haul at around 3,600. If golf is a good walk spoiled, geocaching is a good walk enhanced by digital devices and GPS coordinates, where hidden treasures are in parks and other public spaces. “Treasures” may be a bit overstated. The prizes may be a sew-on patch, a Matchbox car, a piece of costume jewelry. Each cache includes a small notebook or scroll for the finder to log in their name and the date they found it. Then the cache is returned to its hiding spot. Geocachers have been searching for treasures since 2000, but the avocation is picking up in popularity. These days, most everyone has the functionality for it on their smartphone, and social media has brought geocachers in particular regions together, encouraging them to share notes from their hunts. Caches are listed at Geocaching.com, while NYCGeocaching.com offers a treasure guide for the New York area. Caches are often situated near offbeat landmarks, like Tom’s Restaurant in Morningside Heights, which stood in for the diner on “Seinfeld,” or the Midtown subway grate where Marilyn Monroe’s white dress famously fluttered, or the TriBeCa firehouse where the Ghostbusters gang convened. “Geocaching brings me places I’ve never seen before,” Mr. Jacobowitz said. “I learn a lot of history while doing it.” It also involves a lot of nosing around — looking behind a light post, a mailbox, a tree — and replacing the cache once it has been located. Neither Mr. Jacobowitz, 54, nor Mr. Mitchell, 46, said they had been questioned by police while geocaching. But to any non-geocachers — those in the culture refer to them as Muggles — the two men slinking around the southwest corner of Central Park might have looked vaguely suspicious. Some experienced geocachers prefer a GPS device to their phone. Mr. Mitchell’s unit, which he said he got on sale for around $200, pointed to a thicket of chest-high brush just off Center Drive, near the Victorian Gardens amusement park. They ventured in along a path, scanning for clues as well as poison ivy. The find wasn’t in the dirt, but was situated a few feet higher: a plastic bird affixed to a bush with a clip; beneath it was a small pill bottle. As the men unscrewed the container to take out the login sheet, a couple of police officers ambled down the path to see what they were up to. Neither officer had heard of geocaching, but they quickly deduced that the geocachers were not trouble. One feigned disappointment; he said he was primed for a big bust. NYC Parks appears mostly indifferent to geocaching. “We encourage exploration in our parks, however, we do have policies against leaving personal property behind for the safety of all of our park visitors,” a spokeswoman, Anessa Hodgson, said in a statement. Gateway National Recreation Area, a 27,000-acre national park with green space in Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn and New Jersey, offers virtual geocaching at its Floyd Bennett Field site in Brooklyn. There are 14 “virtual caches,” where geocachers search out hidden clues, each one leading to a question to be answered. Those who answer six can claim a Gateway pin at the ranger station. “Traditional physical caches,” meaning tangible, three-dimensional treasures, are not permitted in the park, according to the Gateway website. The caches have gotten harder to find over the years, notes Layne Cameron, author of “The Geocaching Handbook.” “Tools of the trade now include hand-held mirrors, tweezers, magnifying glasses and flashlights, to find, see, decipher all the clues necessary to find geocaches,” he said. “In the beginning, you’d occasionally need these. Today, you’re using them on a regular basis.” There are caches to be found in the city, the suburbs, and beyond. The treasures outside city limits are larger — typically stashed in Tupperware or ammunition containers, holding toy soldiers or other tiny playthings, and hidden in woodsy locales. A stroll around Rockefeller State Park Preserve’s Swan Lake, in Westchester County, can yield a half-dozen geocaches in the woods just off the water. Barry Abisch, 74, of Somers, N.Y., recently invited colleagues to witness his 3,000th find, an event he held at Brooklyn Bridge Park and called “Brooklyn 3K.” He’s been geocaching since 2004. “I wanted to do something different for my 3,000th,” Mr. Abisch said. “I was born in Brooklyn and decided, why not go back to Brooklyn for this?” Manhattan is home to smaller “micro-caches” featuring a container with a login but little or no swag. City environs are challenging for geocachers. Muggles are everywhere, and the parks department is active in pruning trees and cleaning the parks, say local geocachers, making it more difficult to hide caches. But for those who know where to look, the city is littered with them. Mr. Jacobowitz estimated that there were as many as 60 in Central Park alone. “There’s so much stuff in such a small area,” he said. “It’s unique to have so many things to find so close to each other, compared to outside the city.” Mr. Jacobowitz and Mr. Mitchell met years ago, when Mitchell’s wife asked him to run to the supermarket, and he went hunting for caches instead. While he was searching a triangle off a Long Island Expressway service road in Fresh Meadows, he came upon Mr. Jacobowitz, who had stashed the cache there. They have been geocaching colleagues ever since. Back in Central Park, the duo trekked for about 10 minutes, ending up on a massive boulder near Hallett Nature Sanctuary, just north of the pond. They were on the hunt for a cache known as Monkey’s Lament. Mr. Mitchell’s GPS said they were close. “Look for something just a little bit off,” he advised. “Sometimes it’s nothing.” Indeed, a hunk of bark rested on the boulder, looking, as Mr. Mitchell suggested, a little bit off. Behind it, a fist-size container was stashed in a hole. The geocachers opened the container, signed the login, and were off to find the next treasure.",The New York Times
2018,New York Congressman Chris Collins Is Charged With Insider Trading,"Representative Chris Collins was at the Congressional Picnic on the South Lawn of the White House last summer when he received an unexpected email from the head of a drug company in which he was heavily invested. The company’s only product — an experimental treatment for multiple sclerosis — had just failed a do-or-die scientific trial. What Mr. Collins did next, apparently in a state of panic, forms the core of a federal indictment unsealed on Wednesday in New York that accuses him of insider trading and lying to federal agents. Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Collins with brazenly using his private information about the company to help his son and others avoid financial disaster. The charges against Mr. Collins, a New York Republican who was one of President Trump’s earliest and most ardent supporters, stem from his involvement with Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, a small drug maker based in Australia, which had no approved drugs but several well-placed allies in the capital. Within minutes of learning about the company’s unsuccessful test, Mr. Collins frantically called his son, Cameron Collins, who, in the days that followed, sold off his stock, avoiding losses of more than $570,000, prosecutors said. Brought to court by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, the indictment cast what could be a long shadow in the House. At least five Republican lawmakers were shareholders in Innate Immunotherapeutics at the time of the Collins family’s sell-off, according to financial disclosures. Mr. Collins’s case has also raised ethical questions about the propriety of a member of Congress, sitting on the House committee with jurisdiction over health care companies, being not only the largest shareholder of an Australian drug maker, but also a member of its board, good-government advocates said. Shortly after the charges were announced, the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, stripped Mr. Collins of his seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and called for the House Ethics Committee to look into the allegations. “Insider trading is a clear violation of the public trust,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. Mr. Collins’s lawyers, Jonathan Barr and Jonathan New, said in a statement that the congressman had not traded a single share of his own stock after learning of the failed trial. “We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name,” they said. Mr. Collins said in an email to supporters that he would remain on the ballot for re-election in the 27th Congressional District in western New York. The insider trading charges against the New York congressman stem from his involvement with Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, a drug maker based in Sydney, Australia. Later Wednesday, at a news conference in Buffalo, Mr. Collins said his investments in Innate came before he was elected to Congress and that he suffered substantial losses when the company’s stock plunged. He denied that he had broken any laws, calling the charges against him “meritless.” “I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated,” he said, declining to answer any questions. [With Mr. Collins under indictment, can Democrats flip his seat?] In a dramatic scene described in court papers, Mr. Collins, 68, was attending the clubby annual picnic at the White House on June 22, 2017, when he received an email from the company’s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, saying there was “extremely bad news to report”: Innate Immunotherapeutics’s all-important clinical test for its new drug, MIS416, had failed. Fifteen minutes later, still at the picnic, Mr. Collins answered Mr. Wilkinson, prosecutors said. “Wow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???” he wrote. Over the next five minutes, phone records included in the indictment show, Mr. Collins called his son, missing him six times before they had a brief conversation. Prosecutors claim that in that conversation he told his son about the unsuccessful drug trial. The following morning, the indictment said, Cameron Collins placed an online order with his brokerage firm, selling more than 16,500 shares of Innate Immunotherapeutics stock. Over the next few days, Mr. Collins, 25, placed 53 more sell orders and passed the tip to others, including his fiancée, Lauren Zarsky, and Ms. Zarsky’s father, Stephen Zarsky, 66. Cameron Collins and Mr. Zarsky were also charged with insider trading and lying to investigators. Acting on the tip from Cameron Collins, Mr. Zarsky avoided about $144,000 in losses. Mr. Zarsky’s wife, daughter and brother also dumped their stock before it dropped in price, though they were not charged, the indictment said. Mr. Collins pleaded not guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday and was released on a promise he would produce a $500,000 bond within two weeks. He said nothing as he left the courthouse and climbed into a black S.U.V. His son and Mr. Zarsky also pleaded not guilty and were given similar bail packages. On June 27, 2017, the day after Cameron Collins made his last trades, news of the failed drug test became public and the company’s stock plummeted by more than 90 percent. The congressman did not sell any of his own stock, prosecutors said, because he was already under investigation by the Congressional Ethics Office. [Read our January 2017 report on Innate Immunotherapies and its allies in Washington.] At a news conference on Wednesday announcing the indictment, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Collins later lied to federal agents investigating the case. “Congressman Collins, who by virtue of his office helps write the laws of our nation, acted as if the law did not apply to him,” Mr. Berman said. Prosecutors also said that Mr. Collins took other steps to hide his involvement in the stock sale. For example, they said, on June 28, 2017, one of his staff members issued a statement to the news media that denied he had personally sold any shares and asserted that his son had sold shares only after a halt on its trading had been lifted, a move that had caused him “substantial financial loss.” Prosecutors claimed the statement was “written in a manner designed to mislead the public.” Mr. Collins was the first member of Congress to endorse Donald J. Trump, in February 2016, and that decision transformed him from a backbench member to one of the few lawmakers to have a strong relationship with the president after Mr. Trump won the White House that November. Early in the Trump administration, he served as an informal liaison for the White House to Capitol Hill and would brag about how the president would call him on his cellphone unannounced. The endorsement also helped make Mr. Collins a fixture on cable television, with numerous appearances on the CNN program of Chris Cuomo. There was a winking irony to those appearances, as Mr. Collins had long feuded with the host’s brother, Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York. Mr. Collins said last year of Andrew Cuomo, “You can’t believe anything this governor says.” Mr. Cuomo pushed for his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, to run against Mr. Collins this year instead of seeking re-election, but Ms. Hochul has said she prefers her current role. Mr. Collins defeated Ms. Hochul when he first won the Buffalo-area seat in 2012. The 27th District is one of New York’s most conservative; it is where Mr. Trump won his highest percentage of vote in the state, with nearly 60 percent. Aside from owning nearly 17 percent of Innate Immunotherapeutics’s stock, Mr. Collins was also a major booster for the company among his colleagues in Washington. Tom Price, a former congressman and health and human services secretary, faced scrutiny for his investments in Innate stock, which he purchased after Mr. Collins introduced him to the company. While he was serving as a congressman, Mr. Price was one of 20 American investors who received a privileged offer to buy the stock at a discount, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Mr. Price more than tripled his investment when he sold his shares for $325,000 in February 2017, a divestment he was obligated to make once he was named health secretary. Five other Republican congressmen also purchased stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics in January 2017, around the time Mr. Price’s investments were drawing criticism: John Culberson of Texas; Mike Conaway of Texas; Doug Lamborn of Colorado; Billy Long of Missouri, and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. Two of those representatives, Mr. Long and Mr. Mullin, serve with Mr. Collins on the health subcommittee of the House’s Energy and Commerce Committee. Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Mr. Collins’s role in the company had always been a troubling conflict of interest. “From a common sense perspective, what are you doing holding this kind of stock?” Ms. Canter said. “Members of Congress have no business serving the public interest at the same time they are serving on the board of directors of publicly traded companies. It’s a direct conflict of interest.”",The New York Times
2018,New York Investigators Subpoena Michael Cohen for Documents Linked to Trump Foundation,"Investigators in New York issued a subpoena to Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, for documents related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation on Wednesday, an escalation of the Cuomo administration’s investigation into whether the president’s charity violated tax laws. After receiving the subpoena, Mr. Cohen called the investigators in the state Tax Department to ask when they could talk, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. The subpoena was issued less than a day after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan to charges including campaign finance violations, in the form of payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, for the “purpose of influencing the election” for president in 2016. It also came amid a continuing war of words between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a sharp-elbowed Democrat who is said to have presidential aspirations, and Mr. Trump, as both have lobbed personal attacks at each other over Twitter and in speeches. Mr. Cuomo — whose primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, has accused him of only lukewarm liberalism — has presented himself as a progressive foil to Mr. Trump. The subpoena to Mr. Cohen on Wednesday, issued by the state’s Department of Taxation and Finance, seemed calculated to strike yet another blow — both legal and political — against the president and his inner circle. It seeks documents related to both personal and business federal tax filings, as well as state tax filings, connected to the foundation, according to two senior Cuomo administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about an open investigation. Those documents could include general ledgers, bank statements, invoices and contracts. The officials said the subpoena stemmed from remarks that Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, made on Tuesday evening on NBC News and CNN. “I do believe that he has information about Mr. Trump that would be of interest both in Washington as well as New York State,” Mr. Davis said of Mr. Cohen on CNN, referring to a two-year investigation the state attorney general’s office conducted into the Trump Foundation. When contacted on Wednesday, Mr. Davis declined to provide further information about Mr. Cohen’s knowledge of the foundation. James Gazzale, a spokesman for the Tax Department, confirmed the subpoena had been issued “for relevant information in light of the public disclosures made yesterday” but declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. Representatives of the Trump Organization, an umbrella company for Mr. Trump’s holdings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the subpoena on Wednesday. On its own, the Tax Department’s inquiry may provide political ammunition for Mr. Cuomo more than it presents a legal peril to Mr. Trump. Even if the department found evidence of criminal behavior, it would need to refer the matter to a law enforcement agency, such as the attorney general’s office or a district attorney, for prosecution. In June, the state attorney general sued the Trump Foundation in civil court, accusing the charity of violating campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegally coordinating with Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. The suit said the foundation was co-opted by the campaign during the 2016 race. Campaign staff not only directed foundation fund-raisers but also controlled who received grants, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation, recover $2.8 million in restitution and temporarily bar President Trump and three of his children from serving in leadership positions in New York nonprofits. Administration officials would not say when the Tax Department’s investigation began, but it became public a month after the attorney general’s lawsuit. Beyond the civil charges, the attorney general’s office has not announced a criminal investigation into the foundation, saying only that it would seek a criminal referral from a state agency at the appropriate time. But because the office’s review of the Trump Foundation is still active, the office is coordinating with the Tax Department’s inquiry, according to an official familiar with the investigation, who also requested anonymity because the investigation is active. The Manhattan district attorney’s office is also looking into possible impropriety by the Trump Foundation, according to someone familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump established the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1987, when he was a New York City real estate developer, with the stated mission of collecting and maintaining money “exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes,” either directly or by donating to other organizations. It had about $1 million in assets in 2016, according to its last I.R.S. filing. Mr. Trump was the foundation’s president until he stepped down after taking office in January 2017. In October 2016, the New York attorney general’s office ordered the foundation to cease soliciting donations in the state, after Mr. Trump admitted he had used the foundation’s money to contribute to political causes. After the election, Mr. Trump announced he would dissolve the foundation to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest, but the attorney general did not approve the proposal, saying the office needed to finish its investigation.",The New York Times
2018,New York Is Just a Bowl of Chinese Noodles ,"The Restaurant Preview Some fall arrivals will bolster the city’s rich array of slurp-worthy restaurants. The Bowery already has a restaurant called Great NY Noodletown. But these days, that name could describe the entire city, which suddenly seems awash in noodle menus. It’s not all lo mein and chow fun. Young, savvy Chinese-Americans are leaning into the regional dishes of their heritage, building restaurant groups that leverage China’s diverse noodle canon. This fall, Dunhuang, a northwestern-Chinese restaurant whose signature offering is an aromatic beef noodle soup from Lanzhou, will open its sixth outpost, near Grand Central Terminal. A spot near Columbia University is planned for the Tang, a contemporary noodle bar from the 25-year-old restaurateur Yu Li, serving varieties like dan dan mian, a Sichuanese dish made with skinny noodles and dry-fried pork. (He already runs two other Tang restaurants in Manhattan.) And Junzi Kitchen, a Chipotle-like fast-casual place, will soon open its third New York restaurant, near Bryant Park, offering bings (savory crepes) and bowls with a choice of two northern Chinese noodle styles (knife-cut and spring), along with sauces like tomato egg and furu sesame. They join popular restaurants like Little Tong Noodle Shop, Hunan Slurp and Little Alley, all of which have found success in eschewing homogeneous takeout staples and embracing more distinctly flavored regional noodle specialties. Little Tong recently opened a second location in Midtown, and the owners of Hunan Slurp and Little Alley are planning expansions for next year. Noodles make a lot of sense for restaurant owners, said Jenny Ji, a partner at Dunhuang: They are familiar to customers, simple to train employees how to make, and quick to cook. “It’s hard for us to standardize other entrees,” she said, “but it’s easy to standardize noodles.” The sheer variance in China’s regional noodle styles also fits well into diners’ current preference for customizing, bold flavors and bowls, said Junzi Kitchen’s chief executive, Yong Zhao. Instead of Americanized Chinese food, “We call it Chinese-fied American food,” he said. “Using the treasury of food-obsessed culture in China to make lunch better.” For so long, Mr. Zhao said, “when you brought Chinese food to the American market you had to dumb it down to make Americans understand.” But his generation isn’t interested in softening flavors for anyone. “We’re changing that perspective.” Dunhuang 320 Lexington Avenue (38th Street), dunhuangfood.com, September.

2018,New York May Cap Uber. Is That the Right Strategy?,"The City Council is weighing whether to approve new regulations for Uber and other ride-hail companies. Whether you’re in New York or anywhere else we want to hear what you think about these proposals. The New York City Council is expected to vote on Wednesday on whether to add new limits on Uber vehicles and other ride-hail services. The City Council is considering a package of bills to regulate ride-hail companies after growing complaints over street congestion and low driver wages. Six professional drivers in New York have killed themselves in recent months, in part because of financial turmoil in the industry. One bill would halt the issuance of new for-hire vehicle licenses for a year while the city studies the industry. The apps would be able to add new vehicles only if they are wheelchair-accessible. Another bill would allow the city to set minimum pay rates for drivers. Uber and Lyft, the two most popular ride-hail apps in New York, oppose the cap proposal. Uber arrived in New York in 2011 and has transformed how people get around, drawing riders away from yellow taxis and the subway. Across the world, cities are grappling with how to regulate the company. Supporters of the cap say it is needed to stop the influx of vehicles slowing traffic speeds in Manhattan. They also argue that a flood of new drivers is making it difficult for current drivers to make a good living. Uber says it provides a critical service in New York, where the subway is faltering. Uber sent an email to its customers saying that if the legislation passes, it could raise prices and lengthen wait times for passengers.

2018,New York Sergeant Who Shot Unarmed Man Is Fired Amid Investigation,"A police sergeant who was under investigation in connection with the off-duty shooting of an unarmed man in the face in Brooklyn was fired on Friday, a police official said. Moments after the shooting on Aug. 2 in the East New York neighborhood, video surveillance footage captured the sergeant, Ritchard Blake, patting down the man, Thavone Santana, as if looking for a weapon. The sergeant then pulled a sheath knife out of his back pocket and dropped it out of its covering beside Mr. Santana. After briefly pacing, Sergeant Blake picked it back up, the video shows. Mr. Santana, 21, survived the shooting. The surveillance video, which was described by two law enforcement officials and later posted by NBC New York, raised questions about what had happened, and the Brooklyn district attorney’s office said it would conduct “an independent and thorough” review. A spokesman for the office said on Saturday that the episode remained under investigation but declined to comment further. The police official who disclosed the firing did so on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. Neither the Police Department nor the Sergeants Benevolent Association responded to questions on Saturday, and efforts to reach Sergeant Blake were unsuccessful. He had previously told officers that he was worried about the safety of his girlfriend, whose relationship with the two men had been a source of simmering friction between them. Around 5 a.m. on the day of the shooting, Sergeant Blake was walking away from the woman’s home and headed to work at the 109th Precinct in Queens, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Santana followed and got Sergeant Blake’s attention. The video shows Sergeant Blake holding his arms out at his sides and talking. Mr. Santana moves closer with one hand in the pocket of his shorts. The police gave conflicting accounts of what led to the shooting. The Police Department said on Thursday that the sergeant fired because a man pretending to have a gun tried to rob him. A police official later said Mr. Santana had told Sergeant Blake that he had a gun, but not that Mr. Santana had been trying to rob him. Sergeant Blake fired his gun twice, hitting Mr. Santana once in the face. He then called 911 to report an off-duty shooting. He was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on modified duty. He was already on a form of administrative probation after being charged with assaulting a woman in 2016. He was suspended for 36 days and placed on dismissal probation, according to a New York Daily News article on police discipline published in March. That designation allows officers who have been disciplined to continue to work but gives the police commissioner the power to fire them without a trial during a yearlong probation. The spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney’s office declined to discuss that case and said it was sealed.",The New York Times
2018,"New York Times Co. Reports $24 Million Profit, Thanks to Digital Subscribers","The New York Times continued its digital growth in the second quarter of 2018, adding 109,000 digital-only subscribers. With that rise came an increase in revenue that counteracted a decline in print advertising. The company said on Wednesday that revenue from digital subscriptions rose to $99 million in the second quarter, a jump of nearly 20 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Over all for the second quarter, total revenue increased 2 percent, to $415 million, and the company reported a profit of almost $24 million. The Times now has 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, out of 3.8 million total. “Subscription revenues accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company’s revenues, a trend we expect to continue,” Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, said in a news release. “We continue to believe that there is significant runway to expand that base substantially.” Shares of The New York Times Company fell on Wednesday, closing 6.6 percent lower. Other company revenue grew 40 percent in the second quarter, largely as a result of the company’s agreement with Newsday to print and transport its publications. Other sources of revenue included the renting of an additional four floors in the New York headquarters and the success of Wirecutter, a review and recommendation website bought by The Times in 2016. Even with the rise in digital subscriptions, the company had a 10 percent decline in advertising revenue, with digital advertising revenue falling 7.5 percent, to $51 million. Print advertising revenue decreased in the second quarter of the year by 11.5 percent, to $68 million. The second quarter of 2017, during which digital advertising experienced a 23 percent increase, was an outlier, thanks in part to the so-called Trump Bump. “This is a subdued quarter for digital advertising, as we predicted, but we remain confident that we will return to strong year-over-year growth in the third quarter,” Mr. Thompson said. Operating profit for the second quarter increased to $40 million, from $26.5 million in the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit, the company’s preferred method of assessing performance, decreased to $59 million in the second quarter, compared with $65 million last year. Operating costs decreased to $373 million, nearly $6 million less than in the second quarter of 2017, mostly because of lower severance costs, which were partially offset by higher marketing costs and growth in commercial printing. Looking ahead, Mr. Thompson said he expected total subscription revenue to continue to grow. “We’re also pleased with our progress in driving international subscriptions, especially in markets like Australia and the U.K., where we’re making coordinated efforts with journalism, opinion and new marketing tactics,” Mr. Thompson said Wednesday on an earnings call. The company also expects a 10 percent increase in digital advertising in the next quarter and an overall advertising revenue decrease in the low single digits. The podcast The Daily has also proved to be a successful tool in attracting a younger audience to The Times. “The Daily is a very successful ad business,” Meredith Kopit Levien, executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in the earnings call. “We have a ton of evidence that suggests that the format of The Daily, which is essentially one big story and sometimes two, actually makes people more likely to engage in our platform.” Mr. Thompson said he was optimistic that a coming TV show with FX and Hulu called “The Weekly” will have a similar impact. “We hope that ‘The Weekly’ will bring Times journalism to new audiences, generate substantial revenue itself, and support engagement and subscription to our core digital news and opinion offering,” Mr. Thompson said.",The New York Times
2018,New York Today: A Beach in Manhattan,"New York Today Good morning on this dazzling Thursday. Let’s, for a minute, imagine a beach in Manhattan. Manhattan is the only borough without one. Other big cities, like Copenhagen and Paris, have built centrally located swimming areas, so why can’t we? Mayor Bill de Blasio thinks it’s “an interesting idea,” or at least he said so when asked about it on NY1 this month. “As a New Yorker, I’m kind of intrigued,” he said. The mayor was responding to a New York Times editorial that suggested the idea. We recently asked New York Today readers to share their thoughts — the pros and cons — and tell us where they would put it. The responses were mostly in favor, with a few detractors. A selection of those responses: The yes camp: Near Christopher Street: “As someone who has lived in Copenhagen before, I spent most of my second summer here in New York City showing my friends social media posts from family and friends jumping into the Copenhagen harbor and questioning the water here. What if you could swim laps off Christopher Street? (With guarantees you wouldn’t grow a mutated third arm.) Sounds pretty perfect to me.” — Jake Petersen, 27, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Battery Park: “A beach would cap the decades long effort to open up the city’s waterfront, and go beyond the traditional esplanades and walkways that have been employed in recent years to ring Manhattan. Battery Park would be a good place to create a pilot beach, but tidal studies would have to first be conducted to ensure safe swimming is possible before moving forward.” — Richard Murdocco, 31, Syosset, N.Y. Anywhere clean: “Yes of course a beach is always a lovely and attractive idea. Who doesn’t want to sit on the sand? I do think the practical issues of water currents and the cleanliness of the water is key. Also would there be public bathing, changing and toilets provided? These often a mess but could be maintained. Or would the beach serve as a place to sit and enjoy drinks with friends? This might be the best option. Enjoying the beach experience, without the swimming issues.” — Michelle Jaffé, 62, TriBeCa, Manhattan Along the Hudson River: “I think a Manhattan Beach is a great idea! If you’ve ever been to Chicago, there is nothing like walking up Michigan Avenue and running into a big, beautiful beach integrated right into the heart of the city. Ideally, the beach should be located where it would be most accessible — by walkers, joggers, residents, and tourists, and it should be close to a jogging or running trail.” — Charles Biener, 60, Larchmont, N.Y. The no-thanks camp: “Why doesn’t the city first build more swimming pools for Manhattanites? That’s surely cheaper than creating a beach in Manhattan. Or how about building more efficient express trains to take people out to Brighton Beach, Rockaways, etc.?” — Robin Greenstein, Upper West Side “Manhattan has long since lost whatever natural beaches, if any, it once had. It seems unlikely that ‘beaches’ in the ordinary vernacular sense could be restored, given today’s tides and currents, so as to afford reasonable safety.” — John Lee Kapner, 77, Morningside Heights What do you think would be the pros and cons of a beach in Manhattan? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Here’s what else is happening: We can practically hear the sea gulls cawing: Today we’ll have perfect beach weather.

Cooling off with a dip in the Hudson River may sound nice, but is it legal? We investigated. Generally speaking, it is legal to swim in the Hudson or the East River, the Police Department told us. It is illegal, however, to enter restricted areas in the water or interfere with boat traffic. You also need permission from the landowner where you enter the water. (We should note: The Police Department warned that swimming in the rivers can be dangerous because of the strong currents in the rivers. Their advice: Swim at public beaches.) Even with the inherent dangers of a city swim, New Yorkers have been circumnavigating the island for at least 100 years, when Robert Dowling, at the age of 19, was the first person believed to have completed the feat. If you’d like to give it a try, the 20 Bridges Swim offers the chance to swim around the island of Manhattan (and under 20 bridges). The entry fee is steep, $2,700, which comes with a boat, an official observer and a kayaker to paddle alongside in case of an emergency. Registration has closed for this summer, but you can watch a group take the challenge on Sept. 14.

2018,New York Today: A Leonard Bernstein Centennial,"New York Today Good morning on this brilliant Friday. Leonard Bernstein, the musician and conductor, would have turned 100 years old tomorrow. Bernstein, who died in 1990 at the age of 72, wrote symphonies and operas as well as scores to ballets and Broadway plays, like “West Side Story,” “On the Town,” “Wonderful Town” and “Candide.” He was also the director of the New York Philharmonic from 1959 to 1969. “He was eclectic down to his fingernails,” said Humphrey Burton, a friend of Bernstein’s who also wrote the biography “Leonard Bernstein.” “He’s not your average classical composer. He’s not your average showbiz composer, either. He struck a chord with a far broader range of listeners than the norm.” He was the rare kind of classical music conductor whose fans would lunge at his car and tear at his clothing. But fame came to Bernstein through a stroke of luck. A Jewish boy from the Boston suburbs, Bernstein moved to New York City in his early 20s and spent time playing piano at the Village Vanguard in the West Village and working at a music-publishing house. At 25, he was hired as an assistant conductor at the Philharmonic. “Normally all the assistants did was to get the scores ready, read the mail, do the chores, take notes, that sort of thing,” Mr. Burton said. But one snowy Sunday afternoon in 1943, the guest conductor from Germany was sick, and Mr. Bernstein took over the program, to great success. “Lenny rode his luck and he was front-page news from then on,” Mr. Burton said. Later, as the Philharmonic’s musical director, he turned it into the best orchestra in America, Mr. Burton added. “He used it as a political instrument,” Mr. Burton said. “He went to Berlin when the wall was up. He went to Russia, and made friends with the Russians — tried to as part of the Nixon peace offensive, and so on.” “And he changed the face of music, temporarily, at least, by making a generation, maybe two, very much more aware of classical music than they ever had before,” Mr. Burton said. He brought classical music into the homes of Americans by insisting that the Philharmonic’s concerts for young people were televised. But he will be remembered most, Mr. Burton said, for the work he left behind. “It still strikes people’s imaginations,” Mr. Burton said. “A work like ‘West Side Story’ is universal. It touched a nerve at the time, and because the play was about bigotry, and the need for tolerance, it’s still as relevant as it ever was.” The New York Philharmonic is celebrating Bernstein during August with Bernstein-themed programming on its radio program “The New York Philharmonic This Week,” hosted by Alec Baldwin, on WQXR 105.9. You can find your local station and show times here. Here’s what else is happening: It feels pretty. Oh, so pretty. And bright. The sun will be out in full force today, but, thankfully, the thermometer shouldn’t budge past 84. Put a smile on.

2018,New York Today: A Maple Syrup Boom,"New York Today Good morning on this fair Friday. Some delicious news to end the week: We’re in the midst of a maple syrup boom. The past five years have seen a nearly 50 percent increase in maple syrup production in New York State. We’ve produced more than 800,000 gallons of maple syrup this year, making New York the second largest maple syrup-producing state in the country (behind Vermont). Sweet. There are two reasons for this, according to Helen Thomas, executive director of the New York State Maple Producers Association. “One is that more landowners have joined the ranks of making maple syrup,” she said, with an estimated 2,000 producers across the state. “But the bigger reason is that techniques for producing syrup have gotten better, so that all of us who make syrup now make more syrup per tree than we did 10 or 15 years ago. We’ve also added taps.” Maple season is in the early spring — “that’s when the tree is taking the ‘food’ stored in its roots as starch and converting it into sugars,” Ms. Thomas explained — but this week included the inaugural Maple Day at the Great New York State Fair. Visitors in Syracuse watched cooking demonstrations and sampled syrup-soaked pancakes, maple sausage, maple milk, maple doughnuts and maple cotton candy. Maple Day was certainly cause for celebration, but the activity continues year-round. Producers like Ms. Thomas — whose farm near Buffalo, Maxon Estate Farms, has been in the family for 200 years — spend the fall in the woods preparing equipment. In the late winter and early spring, they are drilling holes into trees, inserting tap spiles and monitoring sap flow. Ideal weather for getting the job done is 40 degrees by day and 25 by night, Ms. Thomas said, so when the time is right, farmers must collect the sap quickly, several times a day, and then boil and process it immediately to prevent it from spoiling. At the rate they’re going, Ms. Thomas said, New York’s maple producers hope to catch up with Vermont. (Behind us: Maine.) “Our industry is still very different from the Vermonts and the Maines because we’re still very much small family farms doing it,” she told us. “I like to compare us to the craft breweries; Vermont and Maine are more of a commercial product. New York adds the ingredient of love to their maple syrup.” Here’s what else is happening: Well, we’ve seen better holiday weekend weather. The mercury dips today — cooling to a high in the mid-70s — but showers are not out of the question on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. (Otherwise: continuously cloudy.) Labor Day itself is looking lovely, though, to the tune of 80s and sunny. • Plans for Mayor Bill de Blasio’s streetcar project connecting Brooklyn and Queens are still alive, but the city says it would require $1 billion in federal funding. [New York Times] • Here are six takeaways from Wednesday night’s debate between Cynthia Nixon and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. [New York Times] • Governor Cuomo vowed to finish a full third term if re-elected in November, saying that the only caveat was if “God strikes me dead.” [New York Times] • The morning after the Democratic debate for governor, one candidate careened among television interviews, while one remained relatively quiet. [New York Times] • Could the influence of big-money donors be waning? A new report revealed that 73 percent of donors to last year’s mayoral race gave $175 or less to candidates in the city’s matching-funds program. [New York Times] • The rate of young children in public housing testing positive for lead has remained relatively steady, even as it declines citywide.

Bad Hair Day Dear Diary: On my list of biggest fears, haircuts are No. 1 and birds are close behind. My mother cuts my hair, so I think I’m entitled to be a little scared. I still remember when I was in elementary school, always getting super nervous before getting a haircut and throwing tantrums after. I’m in college now. Not much has changed. The last time my mother cut my hair, it was the shortest it had been since middle school. After she finished, I looked in the mirror and felt like I was 8 again. It was so short I wanted to cry. I woke up dreading going to work. I didn’t want my co-workers to see my hair. I took the R train to Jackson Heights, and got off to transfer to the 7 to Manhattan. I listened to “Here Comes the Sun” through my headphones while I waited. Suddenly I saw the shadow of an object flying toward me. It was a pigeon, and it was headed directly at my head. I ducked to avoid it, but its feet skidded off my hair. I just stood there, shaken by what had happened. A man approached me and asked if I was O.K. “That was terrifying,” I said before blurting out what I had been thinking since the night before: “My hair is cursed!” “Don’t worry,” a woman said. “You can always wash it.” — Alison Fiona Cheung It has been a rocky summer for Catholics. In July, Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, the former archbishop of Newark and Washington, resigned after allegations that he sexually abused minors and adult seminarians over a span of decades. Then in August, a scathing grand jury report in Pennsylvania accused the Roman Catholic Church of covering up the sexual abuse of children by more than 300 priests over a 70-year period. The revelations have shaken the church, and some faith leaders have even called on Pope Francis to resign. Catholics have been forced to confront these scandals head-on, and we want to know how Catholics in the New York region have dealt with the revelations. Have they challenged your faith and trust in the church? Whether you’re a devout churchgoer or you’ve left the church altogether, we’d like to hear from you.

2018,New York Today: A Picnic Packing List,"New York Today Good morning on this spotty Friday. Fourteen percent of New York City — some 30,000 acres — is part of the Department of Parks and Recreation. And the perfect picnic destinations in those green spaces and others are endless. (In Queens, under the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and Hell Gate Bridge in Astoria Park; in the Bronx, along Van Cortlandt Lake; in Brooklyn, by the Ridgewood Reservoir; on Staten Island, beneath the crab apple trees in Silver Lake Park; and in Manhattan, at Paley Park, Tudor City Greens, Central Park and beyond.) But where to sit is only half the equation. The other half: What to pack? We asked professional picnickers — that is, New York Today readers enthused about eating al fresco — to share their picnic essentials. A few that made us smile: “A roll-up backgammon set and a Bose mini (quietly playing Chopin). Throw in some bread and spread plus a jug of sangria, and your day is well spent.” — Flora Burdock, 35, of Harlem. (Choice spot: the Atrium at the Ford Foundation, and the Heather Garden in Fort Tryon Park, “to spy on weddings.”) “Watermelon, Bluetooth speaker, a Frisbee and friends.” — Dylan Lee, 23, of Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn. (Choice spot: Long Meadow in Prospect Park.) “A decent bottle of rosé (referred to as a ‘park crusher’ by my favorite wine shop) and the bodega staple, a 50-cent cup of ice to drink it in.” — Caleb Oberst, 37, of East Harlem. (Choice spot: Great Hill in Central Park.) “Brie, apricot jam, rosemary and sea-salt-baked crackers (obsessively delicious).” — Jason Hansman, 35, of Astoria, Queens. (Choice spot: Sheep Meadow in Central Park.) “Dressed eggs and prosecco.” — Beth Anderson-Harold, 68, of Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. (Choice spot: Brooklyn Botanic Garden.) “A bottle of wine from West Side Wines and assorted snacks (olives, cheeses, sweets) from Zabar’s.” — Alexis Kulash, 23, of the Upper West Side. (Choice spot: north of the reservoir in Central Park, on the grassy bank surrounding the loop.) “A folding picnic knife (a small serrated blade for bread cutting with a built-in corkscrew), a mini collapsible rubber colander for on-the-spot rinsing of a last-minute cherry purchase, and my padded legless ‘chair’ that rolls up to the size of a loaf of bread.” — Catherine Feeny, 35, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. (Choice spot: Nethermead in Prospect Park.) Two friendly footnotes from your folks at New York Today: New York City police officers can issue a civil summons for public drinking. And we particularly loved your request to organize a picnic for the wonderful readers, contributors and commenters of New York Today. That’s food for thought — pun entirely intended — and we’ll keep you posted. (Who’s in?) Here’s what else is happening: A cloudy cap to the week with showers and thunderstorms possible most of today. (More rain and humidity is on the way tonight and Saturday, so prepare to feel soggy and sticky.) Sunday will be our saving grace — when the sun finally says hello — but a high around 90 could make us drippy all over again.

2018,New York Today: A Playlist for Commutes,"New York Today Good morning on this feverish Thursday. Spotify users have created more than 20 playlists for the sole purpose of getting through the New York City commute. From Drake, Kanye and Cardi B to easy listening melodies, like Bon Iver, Enya and Norah Jones — the songs you listen to on the way to and from work can affect your mood and overall well-being. “Research in music psychology and cognition confirms what many people already know: Loud, fast music increases heart rate, breathing and blood pressure, while slower, quieter music has the opposite effect,” said Joy Calico, a professor of musicology at Vanderbilt University. Tailoring your commute playlist to how your day is going could be a benefit. “If the workday has been exhausting and you are now trying to get up the energy to go to the gym, that’s one playlist,” Ms. Calico explained. “If you leave work furious with a co-worker and that anger is threatening to follow you home, that’s another.” Nina Eidsheim, a professor of musicology at U.C.L.A., agreed. “If a commuter’s goal is to de-stress or to have a productive workday using music, I’d encourage them to think about what music puts them in which mood and to create their own highly personalized commuting playlist with that purpose in mind,” she told us. Manjinder Bhatti, 23, who takes the Q69/Q19 bus from Jackson Heights to Astoria in Queens, matches his commuting playlist to the time of day. “In the morning I play hard rock to wake myself up, and in the evening I play R&B and rock,” he said. So can listening to a podcast or audiobook have the same calming, or energizing, effect? “Music lends itself to endless repeat in a different way” than podcasts or books on tape, Ms. Eidsheim said. “Sometimes listening to the same piece of music on repeat is exactly what is needed.” Danny Suarez, 32, prefers listening to audiobooks during his 30-minute car commute from Whitestone to Astoria. “I listen to audiobooks just because I feel like that’s a better use of my time.” Whatever you listen to on your commute, Ms. Eidsheim advises that you “observe the effect and adjust along the way.” In other words, find the right beat and you might find a better commute. Here’s what else is happening: Today’s beat: Disco Inferno. It’s gonna burn, baby, as the mercury jumps into the low 90s.

2018,New York Today: A Rainy Run,"New York Today Updated, 7:48 a.m. Good morning on this washed-out Wednesday. What better way to kick off August than with enough rain to ruin your hair, your shoes and your weekend plans? Plan for rain today, with thunderstorms possible in the afternoon and evening. (More showers are in the forecast on Thursday. And Friday. And Saturday.) What’s with that? It’s not your imagination. August is, on average, the third-rainiest month of the year in New York City — after July (first) and April (a close second), according to Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. On average, he said, we get 4.4 inches of precipitation in Central Park during August (compared with 4.6 during July and 4.5 in April). The variations may seem slight, but summertime — the season that leaves us daydreaming perpetually about beaches, barbecues and brightness — is often, on average, the wettest period of the year. And this summer has been particularly so. We had almost 7.5 inches of rain in July, about 3 inches above normal, according to Mr. Ciemnecki. So how does this fare for our remaining beach days? John Homenuk, the founder of New York Metro Weather, told us the ocean typically climbs to its warmest around August, but ample rainfall could get in its way. Ocean temperatures lag behind air temperatures, he said, so “some of the warmest water temperatures around this area come in August and September, whereas some of the warmest air temperatures come in June and July.” “Abnormal rainfall amounts can lead to cooler water at the surface,” he said. “Over time, mixing will bring the water back to equilibrium, but it can temporarily alter the temperature, as can wind and strong storms.” Here’s hoping for more sunny days, sweeping the clouds away.

Congratulations to the residents of Lefferts Avenue between Bedford and Rogers, the champions of this year’s Greenest Block in Brooklyn contest. They beat nearly 160 other blocks from 30 neighborhoods across the borough. Nina Browne, Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s community program manager, who has overseen the competition for years and trains the judges, told us that this year’s winner “ticked all the boxes!” “What stands out is that it is a really long block, so they have a lot of ground to cover and a lot of neighbors to involve,” she said. “Participation rate is one of the metrics used in judging the Greenest Block in Brooklyn, and you can see a very high rate of participation on this block from corner to corner.” This was the block’s fourth time entering the annual contest, and participants incorporated feedback from earlier attempts to win this year. “They created a children’s garden and got children on the block involved,” Ms. Browne said. “There’s a sense of whimsy on their block in the use of upcycled materials, like old baby carriages and amps as planters that make you smile as you walk down the street. And their use of educational signage means that every passer-by will learn something, too!” Job well done.

2018,New York Today: Aretha Franklin’s New York,"New York Today Good morning on this still-sultry Friday. The outpouring of love for Aretha Franklin continues a day after the “Queen of Soul” died. She was 76. Ms. Franklin was, to put it succinctly, “one of America’s greatest singers in any style,” wrote The Times’s music critic Jon Pareles. Like many great artists, she made her way to New York City and stardom soon followed. Ms. Franklin grew up in Detroit, but she moved to New York by herself in her late teens. She signed with Columbia Records at 18, and later with Atlantic, producing some of her greatest hits here, like “Respect,” “I Say a Little Prayer,” “Baby I Love You,” “Chain of Fools” and “Think.” In the mid-1960s, she performed at the bottom of a bill at the Apollo Theater. When she returned for a 1971 concert, well, the theater’s marquee said it best: “She’s Home. Aretha Franklin.” Ms. Franklin spent years performing and recording in New York before moving to California in the mid-1970s. Her final public performance was last year at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on the Upper West Side, at the age of 75. A tribute to the singer went up in the Franklin subway stop in TriBeCa and her name was back on the marquee at the Apollo. We’ll leave you, today, with a playlist of 20 essential Aretha Franklin songs. Here’s what else is happening: When will the sweltering weather end, you ask? Hopefully this evening, after work, when showers may wash over the city. Until then, expect a cloudy day with highs that feel like the high 90s. Saturday, with its high of 88, is promising. Sunday is looking truly spectacular, cloudy with a high near 75. • Three years after an investigation was opened to find out whether certain ultra-Orthodox schools were sufficiently teaching subjects like math, science and English, the inquiry has little to show.

Aretha Franklin’s death touched many residents in the New York area, many of whom recalled seeing her in person or what she meant to them personally. Here are a few of the comments we received: “My most recent memory is this past February. My mom was in at-home hospice and we were listening to Aretha Franklin’s ‘Amazing Grace’ album as we wrote down the menu and playlist for her celebration of life when she passed.” — Aliya Frazier, 46, Inwood “Aretha Franklin was the definition of blackness. From her singing at the funeral of M.L.K. to ‘the hat’ at the first Obama inauguration to singing for Carole King at the Kennedy Center Honors (but not before going back offstage to get her pocketbook, which she safely placed on the grand piano where she could watch it). She defined me, a black gay man, and she defined my entire family.” — Wesley Rowell, 57, Jersey City “Aretha Franklin was more than just music, she was pure life with a fight worth going for. She impacted every audience from African-Americans to women to aspiring musicians to everyday people. ” — Francis Asprec, 33, Park Slope, Brooklyn “As an African-American growing up in the ’60s and ’70s, Aretha was a powerhouse as a role model for teens like me who aspired to a career in music. I will always remember her singing ‘Natural Woman’ at the Kennedy Center Honors for Carole King. Thank you, Aretha, for giving all of us, especially African-American women, your music and, equally important, your example of acting with grace and demanding ‘Respect!’” — Boreta Singleton, 59, the Bronx “Aretha will be schooling the cherubs and seraphim. May she rest.” — André M.

2018,New York Today: Avoiding a Workplace Breakdown,"New York Today Good morning on this stormy Wednesday. Elon Musk is overworked. In a recent emotional interview with The New York Times, Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, choked up multiple times and said, “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career.” “It’s not been great, actually,” he added. “I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.” Mr. Musk said that he had been working up to 120 hours a week. (That’s more than 17 hours a day.) He may not be a New Yorker, but his workaholic nature is prevalent in a city where the average person works or commutes more than 49 hours a week, according to a 2015 report by the city comptroller. That’s longer than workers in the next 29 largest cities in the United States. And that doesn’t count those of us who take work home. With that in mind, we spoke to Anat Lechner, a business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, about mental health in the workplace and how to avoid hitting a breaking point. What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point? The signs are usually emotional. “You can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don’t work as hard,” Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it’s important to understand what messy work means, she added. “People who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.” What are the best ways to personally prevent a breaking point? Avoidance and engagement. “Avoid being on the grid 24-7,” Ms. Lechner said. “Carve out for yourself the three or four hours that you need every day to get off the grid and relax and teach the rest of the world, as well as yourself, that not all hours are email hours.” And engage more effectively. “Learn to collaborate better. When you learn the skill of collaboration, or working together, the work naturally gets distributed more effectively,” she said. How can I help a struggling colleague? Talk, listen and lend a hand. Get the person to talk. “Corporate life is very taxing and doesn’t usually come with a safe space,” Ms. Lechner said. “People are afraid to talk because they cannot afford to show their weakness because there are some people who are going to take advantage of that. Getting the person to talk is the first step to isolating the problem.” Listen. “When you are talking to someone who is overburdened, become a sounding board for what needs to be renegotiated,” she added. “It gives the other person the space to think about the boundaries of the work that was assigned and what can be renegotiated.” Maybe they need more time? Or more resources? Listen and help them find out. Lend a hand for a short while. “This is actually the least useful,” Ms. Lechner said. “It’s like putting a Band-Aid on; it’s O.K. for a while.” Here’s what else is happening: Keep your umbrella at the ready. Showers are very likely this morning, with bouts of heavy rain, and we may see thunderstorms. The day will gradually get drier and we may see a fair bit of sun before it hits the horizon. It’s still warm: The high is 83. • Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and longtime fixer, pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud charges and campaign finance violations.

It’s the first effort by an American city to create a hub for freelancers who work in the gig economy, according to the Office of Media and Entertainment. The new center, operated by the Freelancers Union, is geared toward freelancers in media and entertainment. It’s slated to open in early October.

2018,New York Today: Balancing Bikes,"New York Today Good morning on this heated Thursday. It’s the dawn of the dockless bike in New York City. This summer, 900 free-standing bikes have been installed in the Bronx, Staten Island and the Rockaways — with more wheels on the way in the coming weeks. But dockless bicycle fleets present a unique set of challenges: How do you make sure bikes are where they need to be? What do you do with broken bikes? And what’s the best way to get a bike out of a tree? Here in New York, those questions fall to Gil Kazimirov, 26, a general manager for Lime, one of our city’s four dockless bikes operators. We recently spent an afternoon in the Rockaways with Mr. Kazimirov as he made repairs, checked in on bikes and responded to complaints. But first, we helped him rebalance the fleet. “In a dockless system, people can park the bike anywhere, which means that bikes can end up in less popular areas,” Mr. Kazimirov said. “It’s my job to make sure that people can get a bike when and where they need it.” To accomplish that, Lime uses bike trip data to pinpoint “hot spots,” or locations where bikes are in high demand, and has employees move bikes to the hot spots from less popular areas. “Sometimes it means taking a bike from someone’s house to the subway station before the evening rush hour, or moving a bike from Jacob Riis beach to the ferry on the weekend,” Mr. Kazimirov said. Mr. Kazimirov checked an app on his phone. He saw a bike that had been idle for three days, meaning it needed to be moved. We found it on the sidewalk in an industrial part of the neighborhood. “This is what we’d call a desert,” Mr. Kazimirov said as we picked up the bike. “You can see there’s not much traffic here.” Then a distress call came in about a bike in Far Rockaway. “It looks like someone complaining that the bike is in front of their house,” Mr. Kazimirov said. After a bit of searching, we found the bright green bike in a driveway on Beach 64th Street. Mr. Kazimirov quickly diagnosed the problem: a broken lock, probably jammed with sand. The bike was loaded into a white van and taken to the company’s warehouse in Bay Ridge for repairs. So far, Mr. Kazimirov said, he hasn’t had to rescue bikes from trees or bodies of water — as dockless bike operators have had to do in other cities. And over the last few weeks, the types of complaints have changed, he said. “When we first put them out, people would call in and say there was an abandoned bike, thinking that someone would steal them,” he said. “We’d arrive and there’d be nothing wrong. “It takes awhile for people to realize that, oh, the bike can just be there and it doesn’t have to be in a dock,” he added. “Eventually, they will just become part of the scenery.” Here’s what else is happening: Remember when everyone was complaining about snow showers in April and begging for warm weather? Well, now Mother Nature is letting us have it. Another sizzling, stormy day lies ahead, with a high around 90.

Although the neighborhood is predominantly Hispanic today, the area used to be one of the city’s largest Italian neighborhoods. And for more than 100 years, the Italian community has been gathering on Pleasant Avenue to build and hoist a several-ton shrine to a patron saint — Saint Anthony. (Here’s what last year’s looked like.) The tradition of building a giglio — or lily in Italian — began in A.D. 409 outside Naples. The festival begins tonight with musical performances at 6 p.m. and continues with food vendors, games and dancing throughout the weekend. The lifting of the giglio starts at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday. The festival’s activities generally take place on Pleasant Avenue between 114th and 116th Streets. You can see the full schedule here.

2018,New York Today: Capping Uber,"New York Today Good morning on this bright Wednesday. New York City officially pumped the brakes on Uber and other ride-hailing services. Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a bill into law yesterday that limits the number of ride-share vehicles in the city. “It’s time for the big corporations to take a back seat and for working people to take the wheel,” Mr. de Blasio said at the bill signing at City Hall. The pioneering law is meant to address congestion, driver wages and the weakening of the taxi industry. Here’s what the law means for New Yorkers. Will there be fewer ride-share vehicles? No. The number of vehicles in the city will be capped at its current level — around 100,000. The new law limits new ride-share vehicles for a year as the city studies the environmental and economic impact of ride-sharing services. Yesterday was the last day that a driver could register a vehicle with a ride-hailing service, although the law allows companies to add wheelchair-accessible vehicles. What will change for riders? The mayor’s office said that riders should not see a change in service and should not notice any significant increase in wait times. The mayor’s office also doesn’t expect to see a significant increase in fares. Uber, however, argues that the cap will mean fewer cars for passengers who want them, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan. “We’re worried the impact will be felt the most in areas not well served by mass transit and where taxis refuse to travel,” said Jason Post, director of public affairs for Uber. Mr. Post said prices for Uber riders would not rise immediately, but could go up in the future. What does it mean for drivers? Aside from capping the number of vehicles, the package of bills signed yesterday also raised the minimum wage of drivers to $17.22, after expenses. The new minimum wage would bump driver’s incomes by about 23 percent, on average. Many yellow-cab and Uber drivers support the cap and say they hope that the new law will translate into less competition, more customers and higher incomes. What’s next? After a year, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission will be allowed to regulate the number of for-hire vehicles on the road. Presently, up to 40 percent of ride-sharing vehicles are unoccupied at any given time, according to a study commissioned by the T.L.C. Those empty cars add to the street congestion and increase competition among drivers. The city is considering establishing an occupancy rate that is healthier for the city, said a spokesman for the mayor’s office. If successful, the law could become a model for other cities or states that want to regulate the industry. Here’s what else is happening: Finally, a day of beautiful (but balmy) weather. Sunny skies today for your midweek pick-me-up, with a sizzling high just above 90.

2018,New York Today: Congestion for New Jersey Commuters,"New York Today Good morning on this somewhat sunny Monday. To the New Jerseyans who commute to the city, our condolences. Beginning last Friday night, two lanes of Route 495 leading into and out of the Lincoln Tunnel were closed for repairs. (The work is expected to take two and a half years.) The thoroughfare, the only direct route into Midtown Manhattan from New Jersey, is one of the most heavily trafficked routes on the East Coast, shuttling 150,000 people a day across the Hudson River, according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. [Read more about the repairs.] As people who take the tunnel adjust their commutes, other commuters can expect more cars in their lanes and fewer seats on public transit. Here’s what you need to know if this madness affects you: How much time will this add to a commute? “It’s hard to say — that road is already a congestion hot spot,” said Robert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman at AAA Northeast. But think of it this way, he said: “You’re reducing capacity by 33 percent, so add 33 percent” to your regular time through the corridor. What are my options for avoiding the tunnel? Train. For those who live in Hudson County, take the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail to Hoboken or Jersey City and then switch to the PATH trains or a ferry. Ferry. If you are commuting from Monmouth County, try taking one of the ferries from the Atlantic Highlands, Belford or Highlands. Bus. The express bus lane from the North Bergen Park and Ride to Port Authority will be open throughout the construction. Staten Island. Take the car pool lane from the Goethals Bridge through Staten Island, and then onto the Gowanus Expressway into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. Other bridges. The only other options for drivers are the Holland Tunnel or the George Washington Bridge. Both are already heavily trafficked and miles away from Midtown Manhattan. What if I want to drive? The New Jersey Department of Transportation has suggested joining a car pool or van pool or adjusting your schedule to avoid the peak commute times of 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. If you have more questions, the Transportation Department has set up a hotline for commuters at 201-408-8495, or you can write to DOTOutreachRT495@dot.nj.gov. Did you take the Lincoln Tunnel today? We want to hear how your commute went.

2018,New York Today: Cuomo vs. Nixon One-Liners,"New York Today Good morning on this clammy Thursday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon — our Democratic candidates for governor — faced off last night in their first and only debate before the Sept. 13 primary election. Things got theatrical as they moved from topic to topic — from the M.T.A. and infrastructure to homelessness, health care, security and marijuana. A recap of memorable lines: 1. “He used the M.T.A. like an A.T.M.” That was Ms. Nixon saying that Mr. Cuomo used money intended for M.T.A. improvements for his own pet projects. (An example of that, according to an investigation by The New York Times, was when Mr. Cuomo’s administration forced the M.T.A. to use $5 million to bail out several struggling, state-run ski resorts.) 2. Nothingburgers. A term thrown around by both candidates as they bickered about the release (or nonrelease) of their tax returns. “Nothingburger” can be slang for something hyped that is downplayed. You can also think of it as something that appears to be delicious, or something with meat on it, but that, after you take a bite, is not all that substantial or filling. Case in point: “Only Donald Trump has done less transparency on his taxes than my opponent,” said the governor, accusing Ms. Nixon of releasing her tax returns for just three hours “on a Friday,” perhaps to avoid unwanted attention. Ms. Nixon replied that releasing her taxes was “a big nothingburger.” To which he responded, “If it was a nothingburger, you wouldn’t hide it.” (We fact-checked that here: Ms. Nixon did release five years of her taxes last week, on a Friday, but had released last year’s returns in early May.) 3. “Yes and yes. Double yes!” That was Mr. Cuomo when asked about his White House ambitions. Would he promise that, if re-elected governor, he would serve the full four years and not run for president in 2020? “Yes and yes. Double yes!” 4. “We have either incompetence or corruption. Which is it?” That was Ms. Nixon hammering home a point she made several times, about the governor’s ties to Albany insiders found guilty of corruption — namely, to Joseph Percoco, one of the governor’s former top aides, who was found guilty of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and solicitation of bribes in March. (Here are a few others linked to the governor who have been ensconced in corruption scandals.) 5. “Can you stop interrupting?” “Can you stop lying?” That one we heard a couple of times, with Mr. Cuomo asking Ms. Nixon to let him speak and Ms. Nixon firing back that he needed to tell the truth. What were your favorite one-liners from the debate? Tell us in the comments. Here’s what else is happening: Still uncomfortably muggy. A heat advisory remains in effect until tonight, with sunshine and a high near 90. Thunderstorms may roll in this afternoon — and Labor Day weekend’s looking iffy — but here’s hoping that Mother Nature comes through for us. • At debate watch party in Bushwick, the pro-Nixon crowd had little patience for Gov.

Seeking Mr. Softee Dear Diary: An ice cream truck has stalked my Harlem neighborhood for months. From about 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. every weekend night, the incessant sound of the Mr. Softee jingle invades my eardrums. Mr. Softee is loved and wanted here. The park across the street is like our town square — local children and their parents spend entire Saturdays there — and Mr. Softee is the mayor. Yesterday, I decided I would finally have an ice cream. My partner and I went outside, listening for the familiar song and heard … nothing. We walked 10 blocks to a different corner that Mr. Softee is known to frequent. No luck. We decided to have a Dominican fruit ice instead. Walking home, our faces and fingers were sticky with mango flavor. As we approached our building, we thought we heard the faint tinkle of the Mr. Softee theme. I power-walked on ahead, and there he was. Well, not Mr. Softee, but an off-brand version. My partner got a chocolate-vanilla twist. I got a chocolate-dipped vanilla cone. We stood at the park’s edge, giggling and trying to eat as much ice cream as we could before it melted. — Ashley Lusk New York City has Restaurant Week. Fashion Week. Fleet Week. And Broadway Week.

2018,"New York Today: Ditmas Park, a ‘Suburb in the City’","New York Today Updated, 7:42 a.m. Good morning on this gloomy Tuesday. The second stop in our Suburbs in the City series: Ditmas Park in Brooklyn. A step off the B or Q train is a step into what feels like a real estate version of the game Tetris: Homes of all colors and shapes — Victorian, Tudor, Colonial Revival, bungalow — that somehow fit effortlessly together. But Ditmas Park, named for the early settler Jan Jansen Van Ditmarsen Jr., was once farmland. It was developed from rural to residential in the early 20th century and, by the 1920s, had become part of the city’s subway system. Today, though Ditmas Park proper spans only eight blocks, its charm spills over those borders. Cortelyou Road, akin to the main street of a cozy town, is abuzz with boutique-like businesses. The neighboring streets — Westminster, Argyle, Rugby and Marlborough Roads, East 16th and East 17th Streets and beyond — are quiet and still. (“Please don’t honk,” a sign reads.) The porches have personalities, too, with birdhouses on many, stone lions on some and chairs that seem to tell the story of who’s inside — office chairs, Adirondack chairs, rocking chairs and sofas that look as though they’ve been passed through generations of families. The roofs are crowned with weather vanes, the doors adorned with wreaths. Green garden hoses snake around front porches, vines climb two or three stories high. Not much more than that, though; there’s not a skyscraper in sight. Old treasures like Kings Theater on Flatbush and the Japanese cottage on Buckingham are cherished by those in the area. (And a hearty thank you to the New York Today readers who shared a few of the more recent spots they most admire there: La Loba Cantina for Oaxacan food and mezcal; Cafe Tibet for simple Tibetan fare; Werkstatt, a Viennese bistro with scrumptious pretzels; and Sycamore, which doubles as both a cocktail bar and flower shop.) Ditmas proper was designated a historic district in 1981, so as much as this suburb in the city has changed, it has also stayed the same. Here’s what else is happening: Rain, rain, go away. (But actually.) The wet streak continues with scattered showers and thunderstorms and a sticky high near 85. Hold on for one more day!

Paleontologists estimate the titanosaur weighed about 70 tons, equivalent to 10 large elephants, and predated this column by roughly 100 million years. Visitors can watch the inaugural titanosaur cleaning (complete with vacuums and long-handled brushes) from the fourth floor of the museum, beginning at 10 a.m. New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

2018,New York Today: Eating in a Heat Wave,"New York Today Good Wednesday morning. It will be mercilessly hot again today. The mercury may reach a mere 90, but with the humidity, it could feel as stifling as 98. (Thunderstorms may roll in, mainly after 2 p.m., but they won’t cool us off.) A heat advisory is in effect until this evening, which means you should turn on your air conditioner or get to a place that has one. During our current heat wave, we noticed that we’ve been drinking tons of iced coffee and haven’t felt as hungry. Curious about the relationship between our guts and the weather, we spoke to a few nutrition experts. Can hot weather affect your appetite? Yes. Extreme weather of any kind can change appetite, said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “While it’s difficult to generalize, many people, myself included, don’t feel as hungry in hot weather,” she said. The reason? Overeating generates a lot of heat. “If you eat a large amount of concentrated calories, you’re going to generate heat from metabolizing them,” Ms. Nestle said. “And when it’s hot outside, you don’t want to be generating extra heat in the body.” Does hot weather change the types of foods we eat? Probably not. While there are consumer surveys and anecdotal evidence that suggest we may pass up beef stew in favor of a salad on a hot day, there is little hard scientific evidence. “Cycles in our diet may have mattered more at other times in history,” said Sharon R. Akabas, professor of pediatrics and nutrition at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “But the availability and convenience of food today probably overrides that.” What are the best foods to eat in hot weather? Fruits and vegetables. “Hydration is key during hot weather,” said Ms. Akabas. “Fruits and vegetables provide lots of water and are loaded with potassium.” Is spicy food helpful? It depends on where you eat it. It’s true that spicy foods make some people sweat, which can help cool you down, Ms. Nestle said. But outside in really hot and humid weather, like today’s, she said, “It just makes things worse because you’re sweating, but the sweat is not evaporating.” So, if you’re in an air-conditioned restaurant then go for the extra-hot guac, but if you’re having lunch outside or in the sun, that extra-spicy pad thai may make you more uncomfortable. Tomorrow, temperatures drop — into the high 80s — and it will stay warm until the weekend. As you pack your lunch this week, here are 55 recipes for 90-degree days from The New York Times Cooking.

Our city is getting a new park. Later today, Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce that the city has secured financing for an extension of the Hudson Park and Boulevard at Hudson Yards in Midtown West. The three-acre park will run over the Amtrak rail cut from 36th Street to 39th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. While the current park serves as a popular lunch spot for the area’s commercial workers, the extension will create a space that’s greener and more lush, according to a spokesman for City Hall. But don’t make any picnic plans just yet. Groundbreaking is set to begin in late 2020, and the park isn’t scheduled to be open until the winter of 2023. Until then, you can visit one of these new parks that have opened in the city this summer.

2018,New York Today: Getting a Subway Ad,"New York Today Updated, 7:58 a.m. Good morning on this so-so Thursday. If you’re reading this on the subway, perhaps you’re sitting (or squished like a sardine) near an ad. Maybe for a mattress. Or tampons. Or a divorce lawyer. Or college. For a transit system with about 5.6 million daily riders — an audience of 11 million eyeballs — you can be sure ad space on the subway is coveted real estate. “Anyone who wants to make a name in New York knows they have to be on the subway,” said Jeremy Male, chief executive of Outfront Media, the company that works with the M.T.A. to review and place the advertisements you see on your underground commute. “Think about it, you can reach virtually all New Yorkers, from young, hip urban audiences to Wall Street executives.” So what are the criteria for getting an ad on the subway? “Just like other advertising mediums, ads on the subway need to be legal, honest and creative in order to resonate with our audiences,” Mr. Male said. “The biggest difference is since we are working with a public service, we don’t accept political ads.” Are some ads pricier than others? What is the most-sought placement? “Just like other mediums, ad costs are highly dependent on a number of factors, including location, size, time and duration,” Mr. Male said. “Prime” placements include wrapped cars or several ads in a station for a single company, he explained, as well as the shuttle from Grand Central Terminal to Times Square, which can be completely covered by an advertiser — both the interior and exterior of the three-car train — to immerse riders in the brand. “These are opportunities brands can use to break through to consumers,” Mr. Male said, “and they don’t even approach the price of a single Super Bowl ad.” How do you measure the success of those ads? “Advertisers come back year after year,” Mr. Male said. “It obviously works for them. After all, Dr. Zizmor became New York’s dermatologist long ago through subway advertising. Even young people know who he is.” What’s next for subway ads? “Over the next decade and beyond, we have big plans for New York City’s subways,” Mr. Male said. “Imagine, for example, you’re heading home in the middle of a Mets or Yankees game and there’s a huge play in the outfield,” he said. “Made possible by the screens we’re currently rolling out and in conjunction with coming 5G technology, soon we’ll be able to dynamically stream that content to every screen in a subway car, providing a completely new and immersive experience that will add energy to anyone’s commute.” At the dismal rate subways are going, we’ll take all the energy we can get. Here’s what else is happening: C+. (That stands for “clouds, and then some.”) A mix of clouds and sun this morning, with thunderstorms threatening to shake the sky this afternoon. Friday is also shaping up to be a C+. We’ll share a weekend report card tomorrow. • Ridership of the city’s subway system dropped for the second year in a row as passengers flee to Uber and other ride-hailing services. [New York Times] • State officials in New Jersey are targeting several former industrial sites in lawsuits for pollution that has severely affected surrounding communities.

2018,New York Today: Is Your Wi-Fi Network Safe?,"New York Today Updated, 7:47 a.m. Good morning on this mediocre Monday. Picture this. You’ve just nestled into a seat at your local coffee shop to catch up on emails and read New York Today. You click your Wi-Fi network options, select “CAFE GUEST Net,” and — woo hoo — you’re online. The name looked innocuous enough. Convenient, too, without a password. But is that network actually safe? “Illegitimate networks are difficult to spot because they look exactly like real ones,” said David Mitchell, the chief technology officer of Intersection, a New York-based company that manages Wi-Fi networks around the world. Signing in to an unsecured wireless network puts much of your private information — including browser history, documents and photos — at risk of being discovered by a hacker. Even your bank login and account numbers could be compromised if you visit your bank’s website on an unsecured network. (That’s reason enough to think twice before choosing a network that looks and feels legitimate.) At a time when data privacy concerns have taken on added urgency, what can New Yorkers do to take extra precaution? In the coming weeks, NYC Cyber Command, a group responsible for the city’s cyber defense efforts, plans to launch NYC Secure, an initiative to help New Yorkers protect their personal information online and strengthen the public Wi-Fi security system. The first part of the project: a free smartphone app. Once you’ve downloaded the app, you can turn on notifications, which will alert you when you’ve connected to an unsecured network that could make you vulnerable to a malicious user. You’ll receive a real-time pop-up with a description of the threat and recommendations for how to get around it, like connecting to a secure network the app is able to locate. And unlike many other apps, NYC Secure does not ask for personal information during the setup process. (A release date has not been officially set, but Maya Worman, a spokeswoman for NYC Cyber Command, said the app should be available this summer.) Until then, Mr. Mitchell gave us a tip for determining whether a network is safe: “Your device will indicate that a network is encrypted by showing a padlock icon or other visible indication next to the network name.” So before you give in to temptation to connect to any listed network, trust the padlock. Here’s what else is happening: The weekend rain is spilling over into Monday. Showers and thunderstorms today, with otherwise cloudy skies and a high just above 80. Remember: August is, on average, the third-rainiest month in New York City. • An Australian tourist on a bicycle died after she was hit by a garbage truck on Central Park West near West 67th Street.

Another staple on our skyline has been declared an individual city landmark, joining the ranks of more than 1,400 others in our backyard. It was first the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building (longhand for AT&T), then Sony Plaza and now, simply, 550 Madison Avenue. When construction on the office tower, which was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, began 40 years ago, it was considered a leap forward in 20th century American architecture. “This is the building that established postmodernism as a legitimate architectural movement,” said Frederick Bland, vice chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The structure, between East 55th and 56th Streets, has classical touches that set it apart from many neighboring skyscrapers in Midtown. The quirky catch: The outside of the building is now a landmark, but its inside is not. There has been debate on whether the interior, exterior, or both deserve the designation.

2018,New York Today: Making Surfboards in the Rockaways,"New York Today Good morning on this hot and humid Monday. In a shipping container at a sleepy marina in the Rockaways, Queens, Paul J. Schmidt is really living the dream. In 2013, Mr. Schmidt did something some of us have considered: He quit his job (prepping handblown glass chandeliers in SoHo) and moved to the beach. These days, sandwiched between surfing sessions, Mr. Schmidt “shapes” surfboards by hand. He’s one of a half-dozen or so full-time surfboard makers in New York City who design custom boards for a growing local clientele. We stopped by his workshop at Marina 59 on a recent morning to learn about his craft. To make his boards, Mr. Schmidt shapes “blanks” — or long pieces of unshaped foam with a planer — or an electric shaver. “There are no straight lines on the board, so shaping is done all by light and by feel,” he said. He then layers on sheets of fiberglass and a coating of epoxy resin in a room heated to between 95 and 100 degrees, which helps keep the syrupy resin malleable. Finally, he sands out any imperfections. The process is similar to woodworking, said Mr. Schmidt, who spent time as a young man working for a carpenter in “landlocked” Richmond, Va., where he’s from. Shaping a board also reminds him of surfing. “The work is done quietly, by yourself,” he said. “You’re connected to an object and the rhythm in your body, and you have time to think and recalibrate.” It takes him about two or three days to make a custom board, which he sells for between $600 and $1,500 through his company Paul Surf. “The best is when people I make boards for tell me, ‘Dude, I just had the best session of my life,’ or ‘I caught the longest wave of my life,’” he said. “I get to create something with my own hands that connects people to the ocean and water. It feels great to be able to connect people with nature, through the surfing craft.” Here’s what else is happening: It’s a great day to shred some salt. The waves around the Rockaways may be small — around two feet — but the sun will be shining and the high near 93 degrees. It will stay warm through the night, with lows in the mid-70s. • The Bronx bodega where gang members stabbed a teenager to death has become the center of a heated debate over how to memorialize the young man.

Today would have been Andy Warhol’s 90th birthday.

2018,New York Today: Neil Simon’s New York,"New York Today Good morning on this boiling Tuesday. Broadway theaters will dim their lights on Thursday to honor Neil Simon, one of the most successful playwrights of our time. Mr. Simon died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 91. [Read his obituary here.] At the height of his work, between 1965 and 1980, Mr. Simon’s shows were performed on New York stages more than 9,000 times; he produced nearly 30 plays throughout his career. But it was more than Mr. Simon’s achievements on Broadway that made him a true New Yorker. He was born in the Bronx in 1927, before moving to Washington Heights as a toddler. (Family struggles during Mr. Simon’s childhood — his parents constantly fighting, and his father in and out of the picture — would later inspire his autobiographical comedy “Lost in Yonkers,” which won a Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize.) Mr. Simon graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and attended New York University. After his service in the Air Forces Air Reserve, Mr. Simon started his career as a clerk at Warner Bros., where he and his older brother, Danny, began writing scripts and comedy sketches together. From early on, New York City was a protagonist in several of Mr. Simon’s biggest plays. Mr. Simon and his first wife, Joan Baim, whom he met through a writing gig in the Poconos, were recognizable regulars in Greenwich Village, where they lived in a fifth-floor walk-up. Their life in the neighborhood inspired “Barefoot in the Park,” Mr. Simon’s 1963 comedy that catapulted him not only to Broadway fame, but also to Hollywood celebrity when it was turned into a movie a few years later. And “The Odd Couple,” another of his most sensational hits and also a Tony winner, was set on Riverside Drive. When the play was reimagined as a television sitcom, the location of the couple’s fictional apartment was more ambiguous — sometimes seemingly on the Upper West Side (on Central Park West), and other times on the Upper East Side (on Park Avenue). Whatever the setting, and despite the fact that much of the series was actually shot in Los Angeles, “The Odd Couple” was in many ways a reflection of New York. “His plays are a map of upward mobility in the city,” said Jesse Green, the co-chief theater critic for The New York Times. “Even their titles tell the story, from Brighton Beach to Broadway to the Plaza Hotel.” Here’s what else is happening: With Labor Day on the horizon, it’s (unofficially) our final week of summer. But the summer heat isn’t going anywhere. It may feel as scalding as 100 degrees today, and a heat advisory will remain in effect from late morning until tomorrow night. Happy sweating. • Here’s everything that we now know — and don’t — about President Trump’s deal with Stephanie Clifford, the actress also known as Stormy Daniels.

The New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Department of Parks and Recreation this month announced plans to build an adventure park with water slides, log flumes and other outdoor entertainment on Coney Island. The project — part of larger revitalization efforts in South Brooklyn — would transform 150,000 square feet of city-owned land by the boardwalk (next to the Thunderbolt roller coaster) into an aquatic adventure zone, expanding the skyline of roller coasters and thrill rides at Luna Park. The concept, subject to approval by the Public Design Commission, would also feature a ropes course overlooking the ocean. Not a bad way to cool off if you think about it, which is really all you can do for now.

2018,New York Today: Protecting Your Eyes,"New York Today Good morning on this comfy Tuesday. We talk at length about protecting our skin during the summer months. But eye safety? Not so much. Yes, your eyes can get sunburned, too. “Being in the city, even if you’re just walking around — even if there’s a cloud cover — you still need protection for the eyes,” said Dr. Ashley Brissette, an ophthalmologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. Ultraviolet exposure from the sun “can affect the eyeballs themselves,” she said. The most common issue caused by the sun is cataracts, a cloudiness of the lens inside the eye, which can result in vision loss as we get older. It’s normal for the eye to age or change over time, but “increased UV exposure can cause that to come on sooner,” Dr. Brissette said. “It can also cause growths to occur on the surface of the eyeball, and inside the eyeball itself.” Stay out in the sun too long, and you’ll burn — an instant indicator of damage — but walk around without sunglasses on, and you might not notice any immediate consequences. While the risk is mostly over the long term, Dr. Brissette said, “even just a few hours of very intense UV exposure can cause damage to the eyes.” Photokeratitis, for example, is the eye’s equivalent of a sunburn. Here are some eye protection tips: Know when you’re most at risk. “Sunlight is strongest midday and early afternoon, so be conscientious of that,” Dr. Brissette said. “And it’s not just summertime; it’s any time of the year because UV and sunlight can also be reflected off snow.” Choose 100 percent protection. “Most sunglasses will have a sticker or tag indicating that they block 100 UV rays,” she said. “Sometimes it says UV 400, another indication that there’s UV protection in the sunglasses.” (Polarized lenses can cut down on glare and dark or colorful lenses may help with contrast, but neither necessarily protect your eyes from the sun, Dr. Brissette said; you’ll still need the UV protection designation.) Go bigger — it’s better. “Small sunglasses seem to be quite trendy, but they can put you at an increased risk of UV exposure. Bigger, oversized sunglasses protect the light coming in on top and sides,” Dr. Brissette said. “You’re protecting not only the eyeballs, but also the eyelids, because you can get a number of skin cancers on the eyelids and it’s difficult to apply sunscreen there.” As long as you’ve checked the above boxes, she added, cost shouldn’t matter. Here’s what else is happening: A thick layer of clouds will offer a little eye protection today. The day will get progressively more gray until this afternoon, when we could see some showers. The high is a comfortable 77 degrees. • The Cuomo administration spent over $200,000 in legal fees to keep the emails of a high-profile lobbyist secret.

2018,New York Today: Remembering McCain,"New York Today Good morning on this sunny Monday. Americans paused over the weekend to absorb the death of Senator John McCain, a Republican who represented Arizona in Congress for 35 years. He was 81. The outpouring of love and respect for the senator began trickling in on Friday, a day before his death, when his family announced he would no longer be treated for brain cancer, which he had been battling for more than a year. New Yorkers joined the chorus of voices to express their sorrow and share what he meant to them. “He was truly a gift. I first met him when I was in high school. I have not always agreed with him, but I’ve always looked up to his courage, the Maverick. He’s been a role model.” — Brendan M. Fredette, 36, Williamsburg, Brooklyn “As a Vietnam veteran and also a lifelong liberal thinker, I have always held Senator McCain in the greatest respect. My goodness, what a man, what an American.” — John Taylor, 74, Pleasant Valley, N.Y. “Rarely did I find myself on the same side of an issue with John McCain, but I was taught young to recognize a man of respect.” — Pat Sitler, 71, the Bronx “Our country needs your morality, integrity and your leadership. Regardless of our divergent political views, you earned our respect and admiration.” — Lindsay Stewart, 70, Upper East Side “I disagreed with John McCain on most but not all things political and yet I respected him for his integrity, valor, for being a patriot and having the courage of his convictions, even when they went against his party.” — Stephen Quandt, 57, Manhattan “There’s lots of soul in heaven now. God bless John and Aretha.” — Judy Creecy, 65, Germantown, N.Y. Here’s what else is happening: With heat back in the forecast, the sticky weather returns today. It’s hot, with highs near 90 and lots of sun to greet you on your bright morning commute.

Somebody to Lean On Dear Diary: I was at the intersection of 88th Street and Madison Avenue one evening in May. I had the light and was starting to cross when a cab came around the corner and hit me. I was lying in the street, in significant pain and unable to get up. Everyone in the small crowd gathered around me appeared to be calling 911. The ambulance took longer than expected to arrive. A woman crouched down near me. “I’d like to sit cross-legged behind you and have you put your head on my lap,” she said quietly. And then she did just that. I rested on her lap until the ambulance finally got there. I asked her name. “Laura,” she said. Laura, I’ve thought of you many times since that night. Know that my displaced, fractured hip was more tolerable because of your kindness, and I’ll never forget it. — Lila Bader City of Immigrants has arrived at a street corner near you. The project — a combination of photographs from The Associated Press, historical tidbits and cultural content — is being showcased on thousands of LinkNYC kiosks across the boroughs to remind passers-by, commuters and tourists of the boundless diversity that makes up our city.

2018,New York Today: Should We Cap Uber?,"New York Today Good morning on this blistering Tuesday. You’re running late. Your subway station is closed for repairs. Your grocery bags are too heavy to carry home. You pull out your phone, and within minutes, an Uber driver comes to the rescue. Uber and other ride-hail apps have become a vital tool for many New Yorkers, alongside their MetroCards. Now, as New York City considers capping most for-hire vehicles for a year, Uber has a message for its customers: Your trip could get more expensive, and you might have to wait longer for a ride. We asked readers what they thought of the proposed cap and another bill to set a minimum wage for ride-hail drivers. The City Council is expected to vote on both measures on Wednesday. Many New Yorkers came to Uber’s defense. Connor Duffy, who lives in Brooklyn, said: “Uber and Lyft are really convenient in the boroughs! Enforcing minimum wages or other driver-protection measures would be better than capping service.” Another reader, Chad Horner, said slow traffic in Manhattan was a major problem, but he favors another solution known as congestion pricing — a proposal to toll drivers in the busiest parts of Manhattan that would require approval from state lawmakers. “I feel that it would be better to deploy this political capital elsewhere,” Mr. Horner said of the cap, “while continuing to pressure the State Legislature to enact congestion pricing next session.” City Council members say the regulations are needed to halt an influx of vehicles clogging streets and to raise driver wages. They also plan to consider other legislation to help struggling taxi owners, including creating a health benefits fund. Yoni Weiss, who lives in West Harlem, opposes the cap and worries it could hurt the quality of service. Like many New Yorkers, he uses Uber when the subway is unreliable. “I consider it a small luxury to treat myself to an Uber home that’ll take 20 minutes rather than an hourlong subway ride,” he said. Cities across the globe are grappling with how to regulate Uber. Timothy Booth, an Uber driver who lives in San Diego, said a cap would hurt competition. “It is protectionism pure and simple, and it will harm consumers and workers alike,” Mr. Booth said. Now we’d like to hear from you. Do you support a cap on Uber and other ride-sharing vehicles? Let us know by filling out this form here. Here’s what else is happening: We may see some thunderstorms this afternoon, but until then, get ready to sweat. The high is near 91, but a heat advisory is in effect and we could see heat index values as high as 100 degrees. The hot weather is also triggering an air quality alert, so your evening run should be held indoors today, if possible. More rain and hot weather are on the way tomorrow. • Governor Andrew M.

2018,"New York Today: Snacking in, and on, City Parks","New York Today Good morning on this stuffy Friday. A New Yorker may see a leafy park and think, What a great place to picnic. Steve Brill would see that same patch of green and think, Mmm delicious. Mr. Brill is a naturalist who for years has been leading foraging tours in the city and cooking up vegan dishes made with plants he plucked from the five boroughs. We recently joined him along with 15 novice foragers as they hunted for edible plants in Upper Manhattan. Our first stop was near a playground in Fort Tryon Park. Mr. Brill paused in front of a purple-flowered Burdock plant, took out a shovel and dug it up. “This makes excellent jerky,” he said, dusting off the root. Monika Johnston, 55, a history teacher from Washington Heights, was skeptical. What about pesticides, or rat poison? she asked. It’s not an issue, Mr. Brill said. Rat poison is typically attached to chunks of buried meat and would have to be dug up and ingested directly for it to be fatal. And pesticides aren’t used in the more rustic areas of parks. Before long, the group was picking handfuls of common plantain leaves and blue Asiatic dayflowers in front of an apartment complex on Payson Avenue, but the next big discovery came near a decomposing log in Inwood Hill Park. “We have our first red-cracked bolete,” Mr. Brill said, hoisting a small yellow-colored mushroom above his head. “Sautée that up with a little garlic and olive oil. It’s very tasty.” We should note that not everyone is happy that some New Yorkers use the parks as personal spice racks. Foraging is against the Department of Parks and Recreation rules, Anessa Hodgson, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote in an email: “It not only threatens vegetation, but can also create health issues for people eating plants from city soil.” The department issues tickets, she wrote, but has no record of any recent violations. Mr. Brill was arrested in 1986 “for eating a dandelion” on a tour, he said, but the charges were dropped and he was later hired by the Parks Department as a naturalist for a few years. He later left and continued with his private tours. “No one wants to destroy the source of their food, and here we are getting very delicious food with no environmental impact,” Mr. Brill said. And the city’s green spaces have a lot to offer, he added. “The only bad thing about New York’s parks is that there are just too many delicious species.” Here’s what else is happening: City flowers will be busy gourmandizing today. Expect lots of sunshine and a chance of showers after 6 p.m. And it’s still pretty hot, with a high of 90. Tomorrow, things will cool off: Temperatures drop to the mid 70s and stay there for the rest of the weekend, but showers remain likely. • Melania Trump’s parents were sworn in as U.S. citizens on Thursday, after their daughter had sponsored them.

2018,New York Today: When Acting Meets Politics,"New York Today Good morning on this still-scalding Wednesday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon, go head-to-head tonight in a debate at Hofstra University. (It will be shown on tape delay on WCBS-TV at 7 p.m.) It will be their first and only debate. [Read our story about what to watch.] But it’s not the first time an actor or TV star has been a key contender for office. Jerry Springer became a mayor. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a governor. Al Franken, a senator. Ronald Reagan, a president. (And then there’s President Trump.) So how can having a background in acting, as Ms. Nixon does, help, or hurt, a candidate, especially in a debate? We asked the longtime debate coach Aubrey Semple, program director for the New York City Urban Debate League, to weigh in. What are the pros of having an acting background in the political arena? “You’ve got to remember that debate is performance,” he said. “As viewers, we serve as spectators — we watch the debates because we want to be informed, but let’s not kid ourselves: We also want to be entertained.” Acting experience can help candidates communicate in a way that people can understand, Mr. Semple said, citing Reagan as a classic and contemporary example. “Same thing with Schwarzenegger: He used his machismo attitude of ‘The Terminator’ on issues that you wouldn’t expect Arnold to speak about, like climate change.” “Nowadays,” he added, “with social media, if you’re able to have a persona that is recognizable and relatable and you’re able to actually come up with creative ideas for pressing issues, that can make you really powerful. Trump kind of proves it.” What are the cons? “The ability to spin the argument,” Mr. Semple said. “Politicians are trained, classically, in the art of spin. If you’re able to spin an argument, you can make whatever you want a form of truth. But if you’re not coming at it with that classical understanding of how arguments work and how you portray that in a competitive debate setting, that can be a challenge.” A nontraditional background could also serve as fodder for critics. At tonight’s debate, “you’ll notice a lot of time spent on Nixon’s history, and her ability to transition into a governmental worker, a public servant,” Mr. Semple said. “In a debate setting, if you have a competitor bringing up a bunch of arguments but that person doesn’t have the background to speak on it, that’s the first thing that as a coach I’d teach my debaters to go for.” “The best defense,” he added, “is detecting weakness and trying to spin that narrative as early as possible.” Here’s what else is happening: No relief just yet.

Bernie and the Bouncer Dear Diary: In 2006, I bought an engagement ring for my wife. She got me a ticket to a sold-out Paul Weller concert at Irving Plaza. I considered them comparable gifts. Mr. Weller performed on three consecutive nights in January 2007. Each show was devoted to a different part of his career. The first night, songs by the Jam; the second, the Style Council; the third, his solo career. I went to the first two shows alone (I bought a ticket for the second one). The same bouncer was there both nights, wearing a Yankees cap. I wasn’t the only one who noticed that he had a few extra tickets to give away. On the third night, my wife accompanied me. We watched as several people badgered the bouncer for tickets. He appeared irritated. She went to wait at the pub next door. The bouncer told the people who were annoying him to go away. “What are the Yanks going to do with Bernie?” I asked him. At the time, Bernie Williams appeared to be at end of his career with the Yankees. It seemed likely he would retire or be traded. The bouncer lit up. “The Yankees better treat him right,” he said, and then he paused. “Get your date and go to the box office for tickets.” Thank you Yankees fan bouncer, and thank you Bernie Williams. — Thomas Fox NYC Ferry’s new Lower East Side route opens today.

2018,"New York’s Economic Spending Shortchanges Nonwhite Communities, Report Says","As New York has poured billions of dollars into economic development and trumpeted the rebirth of once-blighted regions of the state, the money awarded through one of the governor’s signature programs has flowed disproportionately to predominantly white communities, according to a new report. The Regional Economic Development Councils initiative, introduced by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a bottom-up model of shaping economic growth, calls for councils representing 10 regions around the state to compete for funding. Since 2011, the initiative has awarded more than $5 billion to over 6,300 projects. But the report found that regions with a greater proportion of white residents have received as much as 23 times more funding per person than communities with a high density of nonwhite residents. “The regional council competition is one of the largest sources of economic development money in the state,” the authors wrote. “Historically, this system has shortchanged communities of color.” The report was released Wednesday by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, and Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights group whose advocacy arm has endorsed Cynthia Nixon in her Democratic primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo. The governor has consistently emphasized the importance of stanching the economic free-fall of upstate New York, which is predominantly white, as the disappearance of manufacturing jobs has led to abandoned factories and a dwindling population, especially in the Southern Tier. Even as New York City’s economy has recovered, its counterparts elsewhere in the state have lagged far behind. Still, the report is the latest of a chorus of criticism of the state’s development practices, as they have been battered by charges of corruption, waste and opacity. Last month, Alain Kaloyeros, the onetime leader of Mr. Cuomo’s so-called Buffalo Billion initiative, was convicted in a sprawling bid-rigging trial. While the regional councils have not figured prominently in recent scandals, the report suggested that they were part of a broader culture in need of reform. “This is just one example, honestly,” said Deborah Axt, the co-executive director of Make the Road. “We have long been disappointed in the model of economic development. But we were certainly shocked at the extent to which communities of color are just not represented either in the decision-making model or where the dollars land.” The report analyzed the amount of money allocated to each of the state’s 10 economic development regions through the councils over the past seven years. Though the total amount awarded to each region was roughly similar — between $460 million and $615 million — the amount per resident varied drastically. New York City, with its population of 8.5 million people, nearly 68 percent of whom are nonwhite, received $5.5 million in awards per 100,000 residents. By contrast, the North Country, where less than 12 percent of the 400,000 residents are nonwhite, received $127.1 million per 100,000 residents. If the regions had received funding promises proportionate to their population — what the report called each region’s “fair share” — New York City would have received more than 10 times more money, and Long Island nearly three times more. The North Country’s funding would have fallen by half. The funding awarded through the regional councils accounts for just a fraction of the state’s economic development spending. It does not include money spent on infrastructure, such as a $1.8 billion project to redesign an expressway in the South Bronx. The state also has other programs dedicated explicitly to promoting growth in communities of color, including expositions for minority- and women-owned businesses. Howard Zemsky, the president of Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, said that much of the investment upstate does go to minority communities, even if they do not make up the majority of the population there. He cited work force development and anti-poverty initiatives in Buffalo and Rochester. Alphonso David, the governor’s counsel, called the report’s focus on the regional councils “disingenuous.” “To look at economic development policy in a vacuum without appreciating all of the work we’re doing writ large is irresponsible,” he said. Mr. Zemsky emphasized the plight of the upstate economy, adding that “unless you’re prepared to allow these regions to decline indefinitely, then those are the regions that need a disproportionate share of support.” The report also noted the lack of diversity among the council’s leaders, who are appointed by the governor’s office. Ninety percent of those leaders are white, and 72 percent are male. Mr. Zemsky said the councils collaborate with local groups who reflect the diversity of their regions. Given those unseen players, he said, “I do think it negates that argument” about the lack of diversity on the councils themselves. But the report’s authors maintained that the regional councils program, while not inclusive of all economic development money, should still be scrutinized as a barometer of Mr. Cuomo’s dedication to nonwhite communities. “The regional councils are the governor’s signature economic development initiative,” Ms. Axt said. “To call their damning record irrelevant is absurd.”",The New York Times
2018,New York’s Push to End Inequality Extends to Garbage,"For years, residents in less prosperous parts of North Brooklyn, Southeast Queens and the South Bronx have held their noses and complained about the huge amount of trash trucked in and out of garbage transfer stations that sprang up by their homes. Together these areas see nearly three-quarters of the city’s trash move along their streets. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a law that is meant as a first step toward fixing that imbalance, by capping the amount of garbage that can be handled at transfer stations in those neighborhoods. City officials said that as a result of the law, some transfer sites will see sharp reductions in the amount of trash they handle, likely including some notorious facilities near residential communities. The law, which was passed by the City Council last month, breaks a longstanding deadlock over what advocates call waste equity and seeks to relieve the undue burden on poor and minority neighborhoods that handle most of the city’s trash. “It’s a huge change,” said Antonio Reynoso, a Brooklyn councilman who was the lead sponsor of the bill, adding that capping the total garbage handling capacity of overburdened neighborhoods would prevent ever greater amounts of trash from entering in the future. “Any trucks off the streets are a good thing.” Mr. de Blasio, saying that just 6 percent of the city’s population lives in the three areas that handle three-quarters of the city’s trash, called the law “profoundly progressive.” “We’re saying that we no longer accept the notion that, if you happen to be poor or you happen to have darker skin, that all the garbage goes to your neighborhood,” Mr. de Blasio said. The changes over all in the overburdened districts may not be overly visible at first. Gregory Anderson, the chief of staff to the sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, said that by late 2020, when the law is fully in effect, the city estimates that these neighborhoods will still process between 66 percent and 69 percent of the city’s trash. Last year they received 73 percent of the city’s trash. Some transfer stations are expected to see significant increases in the trash they process, as garbage shifts from one facility to another, but advocates said that those are mostly in more heavily industrial areas. Garbage is hauled to transfer stations and then sent to landfills or incinerators outside the city. The city will offer incentives to those that ship trash by rail or barge, which will lead to a reduction in truck traffic. Mr. Reynoso, Mr. de Blasio and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, who all attended the bill signing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, also cited other reforms to the way the city handles garbage, which could bring additional relief to overburdened neighborhoods. Those include efforts to reduce the amount of trash produced in the city, and a proposal to alter the way commercial garbage is collected, by assigning carting companies to zones to increase efficiency. The law signed on Thursday focuses on four community board districts, encompassing Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn, Southeast Queens and the South Bronx. Those areas contain the majority of the city’s transfer stations. The law would reduce the total capacity of trash that can be handled in a designated area in North Brooklyn by 50 percent and in the districts in the Bronx and Queens by 33 percent. One of the transfer stations that is likely to see a drop in the amount of trash it handles is on Thames Street in Williamsburg, in an area that includes light industrial and residential buildings. The transfer site, currently known as GPB Waste NY, has long been the focus of community protest and residents said that they cannot open their windows because of the stench. Truck traffic causes noise and air pollution, which experts have said contributes to asthma in children and older residents. “It smells terrible,” said Jen Chantrtanapichate, 29, who lives up the block on Thames Street and is the founder of Cleanup North Brooklyn. “When you leave your building it’s the first smell that hits you in the face, especially on a hot day, like 90-degree weather. Hot trash.” The law also seeks to keep other neighborhoods from becoming overburdened by trash, barring any community board district from receiving an increase in waste that raises its total share to more than 10 percent of the city’s garbage output. The changes to transfer-station capacity will begin in October 2019 and will take effect over the next year, as stations renew their licenses. The four community board districts targeted by the law will eventually see a total reduction of 120 to 180 garbage truck trips per day, according to Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for the mayor. There will be also an overall reduction of 60 tractor-trailer trips per day as well, she said. The total amount of trash moving through the four districts would be reduced by between 1,200 tons and 1,800 tons a day, according to city estimates. A law to address the problem had been discussed for years but got little traction in the face of stiff opposition from the carting industry. Mr. Reynoso and Stephen Levin, a Brooklyn City Council member and another primary sponsor of the bill, praised Mr. Johnson, the Council speaker, for moving the bill forward. Mr. Reynoso, chairman of the sanitation committee, presented Mr. Johnson with a pair of boxing gloves. The transfer-station problem dates to the 1990s, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, both Republicans, announced a plan to shut down the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, a Republican stronghold. The landfill — which was hated by Staten Islanders but was a convenient and cost-effective way for the city to dispose of its trash — shut down completely in 2001. The result was the emergence of privately operated transfer stations around the city, where trash was taken by garbage truck and then loaded onto tractor-trailers — or in some cases rail cars or barges — to be shipped out of town. But the majority of the trash went to a small number of transfer stations in poor neighborhoods, creating a new problem. Kendall Christiansen, the executive director of New Yorkers for Responsible Waste Management, an industry group, criticized the law and what he called, in a statement, “the City Council’s rush to adopt it after it languished for years without adequate support.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | New York’s Yeshiva Students Deserve Better,"Elected officials should require Orthodox Jewish schools to meet legal standards. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In 2015, concerned parents, teachers and former students filed a complaint to New York City’s Department of Education charging that 39 ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools in the city failed to give children a basic education, violating state law that requires instruction to be “substantially equivalent” to that in public schools. Three years later, virtually nothing has been done to hold the schools to legal standards, as politicians have ducked their responsibility rather than challenge leaders of one of the city’s most powerful voting blocs. In a city with low turnout in primary elections, candidates often covet the support of Orthodox communities, which tend to vote based on the guidance of religious leaders. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration says it has visited only 15 of those schools, called yeshivas, and been denied access to 15 others. It said nine others that were subjects of the complaint were either closed or didn’t offer K-12 education. A lawyer for a group representing the schools denies that investigators were barred and said the accusations were unfounded. In the schools that investigators did manage to visit, they essentially confirmed the critics’ complaints. Many of these schools receive public funding. The only discernible action the administration has taken based on its desultory investigation has been to pass the buck. It wrote to the state Education Department this month, asking for guidance — something it could have done years ago. Students at these Yeshivas receive little secular instruction in primary school, and some former students have said boys in particular receive even less after age 13. Administrators at the schools that investigators visited said the yeshivas had adopted a broader curriculum, but they provided the city with only an outline of the material. In an op-ed in The Times earlier this year, Shulem Deen, who was raised in a Hasidic family but left the community, wrote that his yeshiva education left him bereft of even basic knowledge. He recalled students learning to sign their names in English for the first time at the age of 18, to prepare for their marriage licenses. Mr. de Blasio told reporters recently, “Clearly there was room for improvement but I have to be straightforward and say there’s room for improvement in a lot of our traditional public schools, too.” Failing to make enough headway in one area is a peculiar excuse for failing to make headway in another. Mr. de Blasio, who like many New York mayors has benefited from the backing of powerful Orthodox Jewish groups over the years, says he is balancing religious rights with the need for government oversight. “It has nothing to do with political support,” he said in an interview. In retrospect, he said, the city should have moved faster to inspect the yeshivas to which it was denied access: “We’re willing to be as aggressive as the state Education Department would allow us to be.” That’s an oddly passive response from a mayor who has fought aggressively to win control of the city’s schools from the state. And this is not the first time that city officials have acquiesced to demands from these groups, such as easing guidelines around a circumcision practice that health officials felt was dangerous. The state has hardly done better. Earlier this year, State Senator Simcha Felder, who represents a largely Orthodox district in Brooklyn, held up the state’s nearly $170 billion budget until lawmakers agreed to loosen oversight of the yeshivas. Young Advocates for Fair Education, the group that filed the 2015 complaint, has sued to block the measure. The failure of politicians to challenge Orthodox leaders denies some of the most vulnerable members of Orthodox communities government’s full protection. Officials have an obligation to ensure that every child in New York receives a sound education.

2018,"New Zealand Leader Vows Daughter Will Learn Maori, a Waning Language","WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand has pledged that her newborn daughter would grow up to learn both English and the country’s indigenous Maori language, which is battling for survival after years of decline. Ms. Ardern’s first child, Neve Gayford, was born on June 21, and the prime minister returned to work last week after six weeks of parental leave. As one of only two modern world leaders to give birth while in office, each decision she makes about raising her daughter is being watched and discussed by a global audience. In an interview on Monday with Maori Television, Ms. Ardern said that she “certainly” wants her daughter to speak Maori. Maori, or “te reo Maori” as it is widely rendered in New Zealand, is one of the country’s three official languages — along with English and New Zealand Sign Language — but it is thought only about 125,000 of the country’s 4.7 million people, or about 2.5 percent, speak it. Fears the language would die have prompted attempts by activists and politicians to revive it in recent years. Ms. Ardern said learning the language was important for children “not only for what it does for their education, for what it does for their cognitive development, but actually because this is Aotearoa, New Zealand,” she said, using the country’s Maori name, which means “land of the long white cloud.” Ms. Ardern said she had not yet decided whether her daughter would attend a kohanga reo, or full-immersion Maori preschool. Neither she nor her partner, Clarke Gayford, speak the language. Ms. Ardern’s center-left Labour Party took power last October, and the prime minister has since called for Maori leaders to hold her government to account for its work on indigenous issues. Maori have higher child poverty rates and worse education and health outcomes than white New Zealanders. Another Labour Party lawmaker, Willie Jackson, who is the associate minister of Maori development and an advocate for the language, lauded Ms. Ardern for using her status to promote bilingual education. “When you have a language that’s on the verge of dying — and sadly with our language those types of predictions have been made — we need every type of positive strategy we can to resurrect it,” Mr. Jackson said. It “made my heart jump” to hear Ms. Ardern say her daughter would learn Maori, he added. Ms. Ardern and Mr. Gayford, a former television host who has become a stay-at-home parent, gave their daughter a Maori middle name, Te Aroha, which is the name of Ms. Ardern’s hometown and means “love.” She said the indigenous choice was the “easiest part” of naming her daughter. Referring to the many Maori names that iwi, or tribes, around New Zealand gifted to her child ahead of her daughter’s birth, Ms. Ardern said it was a “given” that she and Mr. Gayford “would somehow reflect in Neve’s name the generosity and kindness that was shown to her.” Mr. Jackson, 57, the Labour Party lawmaker, said many Maori children of his generation were given English names by parents who no longer spoke Maori. Some young Maori were disciplined at school for speaking their indigenous tongue, he said. “Having Maori names was very unsexy,” Mr. Jackson said. “That’s what we’ve gone through; hearing our language mispronounced, schools wouldn’t teach it.” He added that anecdotally there seemed to be a new “hunger and thirst” for the language in recent years, with education providers reporting wait-lists for beginner Maori lessons. Last year, a Maori-language version of the Disney film Moana was released in New Zealand. Ms. Ardern’s government intends to make Maori universally available in New Zealand schools by the year 2025. Some activists for the language say she should go further and make it compulsory, a proposition that has been the subject of heated national debate. But Ms. Ardern said access to the language must be made widely available in schools before anything more was considered. “At the moment we can’t offer that because we don’t have enough teachers,” she said of mandatory Maori classes. She denied the goal of universal Maori language education was far-fetched. “If we don’t have that ambition, then where will we be heading?” she said.",The New York Times
2018,New Zealand Town May Ban Cats to Protect Other Species,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Omaui, an idyllic coastal town on the South Island of New Zealand that overflows with rare bird species, is home to just 35 people and seven or eight much-loved cats. But a new proposal to phase out felines to preserve native wildlife susceptible to predators has raised the hackles of some cat-loving residents. Among other things, they worry rodents will breed out of control. “We’re not supporting feral cats, but there are people who have doubts here about the plan,” said Terry Dean, 75, a longtime resident. The proposed ban would impose a sunset clause for cats in Omaui, meaning that once a cat died, its owners would not be allowed to replace it. If the policy is approved, cat owners will have six months to register existing cats with the regional council and have them microchipped and neutered. After the six-month grace period, no new felines would be permitted — and families moving to the area would have to get rid of their cats first. Those ignoring the policy would be encouraged to send their cats away from Omaui, with seizure of cats by the council a last resort. The proposal is part of a pest control plan that lays out protection measures against 72 predators. Ali Meade, the regional council’s biosecurity and biodiversity manager, said cats posed real risks to New Zealand’s unique fauna, which had “evolved in isolation from mammals.” New Zealand’s status as an island nation that became home to mammals only once settlers arrived made its birds and reptiles “much more vulnerable” to predation than species in other countries, Ms. Meade said. “They grew up with strange ways of living, like birds that nest on the ground and can’t fly; really naïve behaviors,” she said. Cats’ often secretive nighttime hunting behavior means the regional council is not certain how much carnage they are responsible for. Still, Ms. Meade said, “extensive research” elsewhere in New Zealand showed the damage cats caused. The council said that decade-old rules about microchipping and neutering cats on nearby Stewart Island had helped protect New Zealand’s most famous native bird, the kiwi. The normally shy flightless birds were now regular visitors to the island’s settlement. Even if Omaui’s cats are not particularly savage, the council said, they are a concern because of the notable richness of the area’s wildlife. “I’ll have 30 birds on my bird feeder at one time; some of them are almost my friends,” said John Collins, the chairman of Omaui Landcare Trust, the community group petitioning the council to institute the cat ban. The trust has spent the last few years trying to rid the town of pests — including weasels, possums and ferrets — and encourage rare native birds to flock back to Omaui. The council predicted insects and lizards would shortly return too. “Cats habitually kill things; they’re hunters, it’s not their fault,” said Mr. Collins, who added that he was “not a cat hater.” “We just live in a high-value conservation area,” he said. But Mr. Dean, the local resident, said that the community had not been properly consulted about the proposal, and that divisions over it had made things in the town “a bit awkward.” During his 35 years living in Omaui, Mr. Dean has always kept a cat, and he did not relish the thought of Mr. Whiskers — his current pet — becoming his last. “Once you lose the cats, you’ve lost the ability to control the nasties in the bush,” he said. “They do a marvelous job keeping the rodent population under control.” The town’s 35 residents have eight weeks to give feedback to the regional council on the proposal. The country has long wrestled with how to protect its native fauna from felines, and it aims by 2050 to exterminate all rats and other introduced predators in the wild. A millionaire economist, Gareth Morgan, who made a failed bid for Parliament during New Zealand’s last election, kicked off a campaign in 2013 calling for the entire country to become cat-free. The largest city, Auckland, is considering a plan to euthanize cats without microchips that are found in protected wildlife sites. New Zealand has identified 150 critically endangered species as a priority for protecting, according to the news site Stuff. They include an entire leech population living under a single rock, and a type of lizard found only on a patch of land behind a small-town pub. OpinionJoe Roman and Ya-Wei Li",The New York Times
2018,"New in Paperback: ‘An Odyssey,’ ‘Dunbar’","Six new paperbacks to check out this week. AN ODYSSEY: A Father, a Son, and an Epic, by Daniel Mendelsohn. (Vintage, $16.) Mendelsohn — a classicist, translator and critic — teaches a course on the “Odyssey” at Bard College, and one semester his 81-year-old father decided to enroll. The experience, along with a 10-day cruise inspired by the poem, is a route to mutual understanding, and Mendelsohn weaves in reflections on his childhood and love of classics. DUNBAR, by Edward St. Aubyn. (Hogarth Shakespeare, $16.) A modern reimagining of “King Lear” casts Lear as Dunbar, an aging media mogul whose two eldest daughters conspire to keep him in a sanitarium — and out of the family business. The novel has the underpinnings of a thriller as Dunbar plots his escape; the hero, from his language to his chosen profession, is convincingly updated to suit contemporary times. MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy, by Jonathan Taplin. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $17.99.) In his biography of these Silicon Valley titans, Taplin takes a grimmer view than many tech journalists. “The original mission of the internet,” he writes, “was hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals to whom the ideas of democracy and decentralization were anathema.” REFUGE, by Dina Nayeri. (Riverhead, $16.) Niloo, the protagonist of Nayeri’s second novel, was 8 when she left Iran with her mother and brother for Oklahoma, and the story charts her reinvention in exile over the next two decades. Infrequent meetings with her father — a hedonistic dentist who chose to stay behind in his village — build the story’s emotional core. “The strains and indignities that come with remaking a life are what give ‘Refuge’ poignancy and relevance,” Jennifer Senior wrote in The Times. AMERICAN WOLF: A True Story of Survival and Obsession in the West, by Nate Blakeslee. (Broadway, $16.) Blakeslee traces the fates and fortunes of the Rocky Mountain gray wolf, which is recovering from near extinction in the 20th century. One Yellowstone wolf, a social-media sensation named O-Six, takes center stage, along with two National Park Service employees driven by their passion for the species. CLASS MOM, by Laurie Gelman. (St. Martin’s Griffin, $16.99.) Jen Dixon, a former wild child, has settled into motherhood, and is pitted against the other parents when she becomes the unlikely “class mom.” Our reviewer, Katherine Heiny, praised this debut novel, writing, “It’s impossible not to root for Jen as a fellow foot soldier in the guerrilla war against so-called perfect mothers.”",The New York Times
2018,"New in Paperback: ‘Democracy in Chains,’ ‘Black Mad Wheel’","Six new paperbacks to check out this week. DEMOCRACY IN CHAINS: The Deep History of the Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America, by Nancy MacLean. (Penguin, $18.) MacLean sketches out the six-decade push to protect the wealthy elite from the will of the majority. The architect of this plan was James McGill Buchanan, a political economist who, starting in the mid-1900s, devoted his career to paving the way for a right-wing social movement. BLACK MAD WHEEL, by Josh Malerman. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $15.99.) A rock ’n’ roll band, the Danes, is approached by a top military official to help identify a mysterious, but potent, noise: The sound seems able to neutralize any kind of weapon, and even make people disappear. As the story goes to the African desert and beyond, the novel “takes flight in some head-splitting metaphysical directions,” Terrence Rafferty wrote here. THE WORLD BROKE IN TWO: Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, E. M. Forster, and the Year That Changed Literature, by Bill Goldstein. (Picador, $18.) The year 1922 was pivotal for these modernists. Goldstein makes good use of their correspondence and published material to outline each writer’s development and creative blocks, and how their work fit into a broader postwar movement. MOVING KINGS, by Joshua Cohen. (Random House, $17.) David King is a heavyweight in the moving industry in New York, the patriotic, Republican and wealthy owner of a well-known storage company. In a moment of nostalgia, he invites his distant cousin Yoav, fresh from service in Israel’s military, to work for him, carrying out the business’s ugly side — evicting delinquent tenants and seizing their possessions. The novel and its tensions promise some thematic heft, touching on race, occupation, gentrification and who deserves the right to a home. THE LONG HAUL: A Trucker’s Tales of Life on the Road, by Finn Murphy. (Norton, $16.95.) Murphy has logged hundreds of thousands of miles and decades on the road, but may be an unlikely representative: He falls asleep reading Jane Austen in motels and nurtures a crush on Terry Gross, “probably because I’ve spent more time with her than anyone else in my life.” SUNBURN, by Laura Lippman. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $16.99.) In a sleepy Delaware town, two newcomers — a waitress running from her past and a short-order cook — fall in love, though the two are not what they claim to be.

As our reviewer, Harriet Lane, wrote: “You see the huge red sun sinking into the cornfields; you feel the dew underfoot.”",The New York Times

2018,"News of Laos Dam Failure Didn’t Reach Them, but the Water Did","SIEM PANG, Cambodia — Kang Ngan isn’t sure what a dam is. She doesn’t know how old she is, although she thinks “over 30” is a good guess. But she has lived long enough to know that something is terribly wrong along the Sekong River. The rhythms of life here in Siem Pang, Cambodia, are tightly bound to this sleepy, brown tributary of the Mekong, which swells annually during the monsoon season, then gently spills its banks in October. But last week, the waters rushed up three months early. Thousands of people in this remote northeastern district were displaced, including Ms. Kang Ngan and her community, who are members of the Kavet minority. The deluge was caused by the failure of a dam in neighboring Laos, about 50 miles north. The accident devastated a large swath of that country’s Attapeu Province, drawing international media attention, but few noticed when the floodwaters rushed downstream and into Cambodia. The flooding has upended life for the people here, with little help forthcoming from the Cambodian government or the multinational corporations that funded the Laos project. Nobody has explained to Ms. Kang Ngan and her neighbors exactly what happened, although some have heard rumors that the water came from Attapeu. She interprets the flood as a terrifying natural disaster, just the latest stroke of bad luck in an already unlucky life, lived on the margins of an already poor country. “It was difficult then and now it’s double — triple — difficult,” she said. Her family’s vegetable garden and small rice field are now ruined, leaving them with only the rice they had stored and no new harvests for the foreseeable future. “It’s all flooded, it’s finished,” she said quietly. “I barely have anything to eat. I have nothing.” Events like this may become more common as Southeast Asia embraces lucrative hydroelectric projects that harness the same natural resources its people depend on for survival. Siem Pang sits in what is known as the 3S Basin, where the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok rivers flow in a tangle of silt and lush greenery into the Mekong. The 3S basin is one of the biggest and most important Mekong watersheds, described by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as “a bread basket for over three million people.” But it is increasingly dotted with dams. More than 60 have been built on the basin’s rivers in the past 25 years, altering water and sediment flows and depleting fish stocks. About 50 more are planned or under construction. Forty miles south of Siem Pang, a Chinese-funded dam called Lower Sesan 2, which started producing electricity late last year, has already displaced 5,000 Cambodians and could devastate fish stocks that feed tens of thousands more. laos Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Dams vietnam Attapeu cambodia laos Phnom Penh South China Sea cambodia 200 miles Siem Pang Sekong River Sesan River Mekong River Srepok River 20 miles By The New York Times Ian Baird, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has done research in the area, said the 3S basin was highly multiethnic, with most villagers subsisting on food from rivers and forests. “These are places with relatively poor people who rely heavily on what have historically been very abundant natural resources, which are now being damaged,” he said. In Siem Pang, a borderland closer to Laos and Vietnam than the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, people often speak both Khmer and Lao, as well as a third minority language. Food and agricultural products are imported from Vietnam. And ethnic groups have traditionally sprawled across the highlands and jungles of all three countries. Rivers also have little respect for national boundaries. The Mekong tumbles through six countries before emptying into the South China Sea. The 3S rivers wind more daintily through Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. But cross-border cooperation here is severely lacking. The Mekong River Commission, established in 1995, was meant to ensure that dams did not harm the river’s fragile ecosystem or affect villagers downstream, but its provisions are nonbinding and its consultation process has been criticized as toothless. It has essentially no say over dams built on key tributaries like the Sekong. “There is currently no single standard or set of requirements in the Mekong basin for assessing and compensating transboundary impacts,” said Maureen Harris, Southeast Asia program director for the conservation group International Rivers. Dr. Baird, the geography professor, said there were also no formal cross-border emergency communications systems in place, even though it was obvious that water released in Laos would quickly reach Cambodia. “It is a really big problem and weakness,” he said. The Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company, the joint venture behind the failed dam, has an agreement with the Lao government that was not made public but seems to include no provisions for cross-border compensation. According to International Rivers, no official assessment of the dam’s cross-border environmental impact was made. One of the two South Korean firms involved in the joint venture, SK Engineering and Construction, declined to comment on whether it would take responsibility for the flooding in Cambodia. This will not surprise many people in Siem Pang. While they have received some food aid, nobody interviewed said they even dreamed of compensation. They assume they have been forgotten, even by their own government. “It’s hard when they don’t help us,” said Chhum Pang, who thinks she is over 60. “All the plants died. The vegetables that I grow are gone,” she said. “I don’t know what to do. I’m out of hope now and have only regret.” When the flood hit last week, Cambodia was in the midst of preparations for its national election, in which victory was assured for Prime Minister Hun Sen, the country’s increasingly authoritarian leader. Despite the chaos, the authorities in Siem Pang ensured that as many people as possible still turned out to vote on Sunday. Siem Pang’s governor, Phann Yuth, a member of Mr. Hun Sen’s party, said Sunday that the government had distributed noodles and drinking water, as well as deployed soldiers to evacuate and transport villagers by boat, but lacked the funds to do more. He said he was not free for a longer interview because he was busy counting votes. Then he was headed straight to a party to celebrate Mr. Hun Sen’s victory. That same afternoon, a group of displaced pregnant women was sheltering in the district hall, seemingly unsupervised. “They said they were busy with the election, and if we need any help we can call them,” said Meuy Lah, 60, who was there with her pregnant daughter and said she was low on food. “But they don’t pick up.” Ms. Kang Ngan and her husband, Phlen Dinh, were hunkered down by the banks of the Sekong earlier on Sunday with their 3-year-old daughter, Losh, prepared to wait up to 12 hours for a boat that would allow them to cross. The family had not eaten since the previous day, and did not expect to until sundown. They were trying to reach home after a visit to the district health clinic, which ended abruptly after they ran out of money. Once they got started, the nine-mile journey took seven hours by boat and foot through muddy floodwaters, with Ms. Kang Ngan balancing nearly 20 pounds of rice, blankets and clothing on her head. When they arrived home, the only food there was a packet of Vietnamese instant noodles. A group of neighbors crowded around and began reminiscing about what meals had been like just a week earlier, when they included potatoes, eggplant and pumpkin. Asked if they ever ate meat, they laughed. “Not for us,” said Chhim Bunhong, 31. “For us, maybe we’d go to the river and catch a fish. But now there are not so many fish.” They said they were eating mostly rice seasoned with salt and chiles, supplemented by government-distributed dry noodles. “Without more rice, we are going to die soon,” Mr. Phlen Dinh said. Like many people here, they could not imagine a world in which they did anything but subsist on the land and water, and in which their fortunes did not rise and fall with the Sekong. “What can we do? We’re ethnic,” Ms. Kang Ngan said. “We don’t know how to earn money like the Khmer and the Lao. We only know how to farm rice, and now there is nothing.”",The New York Times
2018,Newseum Says It Made a Mistake and Pulls ‘Fake News’ Shirts,"The Newseum in Washington, which caused a stir Friday after reports that it was selling a T-shirt reading “You Are Very Fake News,” announced Saturday that it was pulling the shirts from its gift shop and online store. “We made a mistake and we apologize,” the museum, which is dedicated to press freedom, said in a statement on its website. “A free press is an essential part of our democracy and journalists are not the enemy of the people.” “Fake news,” of course, has become a rallying cry for President Trump and his supporters, who contend that the news media presents a distorted view of the president and his administration and fabricates facts. He has repeatedly called the press the “enemy of the people.” “Real news wins!” was the response on Saturday from Jim Acosta, the chief White House correspondent for CNN. When Mr. Acosta, who has been a frequent target of the president and his allies, heard on Friday about the shirts at the Newseum, he said, “If they’re that strapped for cash, I’m happy to make a donation.” The Newseum has struggled financially since it opened its new home on Pennsylvania Avenue in 2008, besieged by crippling debt and an expensive building in a city full of free museums. Merchandising has provided a crucial income flow. So in addition to the “Fake News” T-shirt, there’s a coloring book that depicts Mr. Trump as a superhero and a red “Make America Great Again” hat. Those hats, and F.B.I. hats, are the biggest sellers, Sonya Gavankar, the director of public relations for the museum, told the Poynter Institute, the journalism think tank that reported the sale of the shirts on Friday. In its statement on Saturday, the Newseum noted that although questions had been raised about gift items beyond the shirt, “we’ve historically made all types of political merchandise available.” “That has included former and current presidential slogans and imagery and merchandise from all political parties,” the statement concluded. “We continue to do so in celebration of freedom of speech.” On Friday, Ms. Gavankar had described the shirts the same way, as a celebration of free speech. She was not available for comment on Saturday. “As a nonpartisan organization, people with differing viewpoints feel comfortable visiting the Newseum, and one of our greatest strengths is that we’re champions not only of a free press but also of free speech,” she said at the time. The Newseum’s mission statement proclaims that it is devoted to a free press, and the point is hammered home on the building’s exterior, where the First Amendment is inscribed on a 74-foot-tall stretch of marble. So some visitors and supporters — not to mention practitioners of journalism who spoke up on Twitter — were surprised to find the shirt for sale there. “I think it’s obviously intended as a joke,” Robert MacNeil, an author and a Newseum trustee emeritus, said Friday. “I don’t think it’s a great joke.” Scott Williams, the president and chief executive of the museum, said the sales of the Trump-related items did not directly benefit the president or his campaign. “Like all our hats, T-shirts, buttons, etc., those are purchased from a third-party manufacturer,” Mr. Williams said. “The phrase is not trademarked, and no, Trump nor his campaign see any revenue from the sales of that or any other merchandise. Of course, those hats are sold as souvenirs all over D.C., and I’m sure they come from a variety of companies.” But the optics, nevertheless, raised eyebrows. “I’m not sure that I think it’s the greatest, especially with the Newseum logo on there,” Esther Wojcicki, a Newseum board member and a journalism teacher, said. “You’re kind of like a walking billboard when you’re wearing a T-shirt. You want to promote a message in one glance.” Mr. Williams said Friday that the message behind the “Fake News” shirt was not quite as direct as some critics suggested. “Fake news is a word that is in our popular culture now,” he said, “and this is intended to be a ‘satirical rebuke’ and appears in our store with T-shirts that include a variety of other “tongue-in-cheek” sayings.” Late Saturday afternoon, the shirt was still visible on the Newseum website, but it was not possible to purchase it. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the Newseum’s director of public relations. She is Sonya Gavankar, not Govankar. The article also misidentified the title of Scott Williams. He is president and chief operating officer of the Newseum, not president and chief executive officer.

2018,Next Act for Roseland Ballroom Site,"the high end Four years after the popular concert and dance hall closed, a 62-story rental tower rises in its place. Roseland Ballroom, the popular concert and dance hall on West 52nd Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, saw plenty of fishnet on its dance floor through the years. Fishnet tank tops at the disco parties of the 1980s. Fishnet stockings when Lady Gaga performed at the auditorium’s final shows in 2014, shortly before the building was torn down. Now the luxury rental tower that has risen in its place is wearing fishnet, of a sort. A webbed sheath of composite-metal panels has been slipped over a curving glass tower designed by Manhattan architecture firm CetraRuddy, for Algin Management. The building, named ARO, stands 62 stories (60 of them occupiable), thanks in part to the purchase of air and development rights from nearby low-rise theaters, and it gradually widens halfway up. Balconies arc out, giving the asymmetrical exterior a dynamic rippling effect. The building introduces contemporary architectural drama to a portion of west Midtown that is not generally known for it (with the exception of Norman Foster’s faceted glass tower for the Hearst headquarters, with its own metal exoskeleton, at 57th Street and Eighth Avenue). And it is pushing residential use east. There are plenty of apartment houses on Eighth Avenue, as well as older tenement buildings on the side streets farther west. But ARO, on its mid-block site — which reaches back to 53rd Street, where the new tower’s entrance will be — is “moving the residential zone toward Broadway,” said John Cetra, a founding principal of CetraRuddy. His client is a residential real estate company founded in 1957 by the late Albert Ginsberg, whose three children now run the firm. Algin purchased Roseland in 1981 with the idea of developing the site, but operated the entertainment business — which became a profitable one — as a sideline until it felt the time was right. “We do one project at a time,” said Larry Ginsberg, who, with his sisters, Liane Ginsberg and Hilary Feshbach, recently led a tour of their latest, which they’ve conceived as their company’s flagship. The leasing office is slated to open the first week of September, with occupancy expected to begin in November. CetraRuddy, too, is a family business — Mr. Cetra is married to co-founder and managing principal Nancy J. Ruddy, who heads the interiors side of the practice. At ARO, this has engendered a coherence between the exterior and interior architecture, with details like the lobby’s curved cove ceiling and swooping reception desk taking their cues from the tower’s undulating outer form. The rectilinear base of the building includes retail space — no tenants have signed on yet, but Algin is hoping for a restaurant — and the lengthy list of amenity spaces that has become requisite in luxury buildings. On the tower floors above, the 426 apartment units range from studios starting at $2,800 to a duplex penthouse whose price has yet to be determined. Seventy percent of the units are studios and one-bedrooms (the latter will rent for $3,695 and up), and all have ceilings of nearly 10 feet and marble bathrooms. Apartments on the upper floors offer views of the Hudson River, Central Park and the Midtown skyline. Asked about the New Yorkers who still mourn the loss of Roseland, which hosted everything from “taxi dancers” in the 1940s to Madonna in 2008, the Ginsbergs acknowledged their own sadness about shutting the place down. “We had a good time running it,” said Ms. Feshbach, who had been Roseland’s president of advertising and director of sales. “But I think we were all ready for it to be a building, and our dad had purchased it with the mind-set that it would be a building.” (The name ARO is a tribute to her father, who died in 2001, as well as to the bygone venue, coined by combining the first letter in his name with “RO,” for Roseland.) Algin also saved artifacts from the decades it ran the ballroom. Concert posters will be on display in a lounge. Photographs taken during performances — including of the Rolling Stones, Metallica and Dave Grohl — will be hung. The 10-foot stainless-steel letters that spelled out ROSELAND on the back of the building were also salvaged. Artist James Greco, who said he cut his concert teeth going to see punk bands at Roseland as a teenager and was later a bartender there, has been commissioned to use the A, R and O in a sculpture to be placed in the lobby.

2018,"Nia Wilson, Killed at BART Station, Is Remembered: ‘No Peace Without Justice’","Nia Wilson wanted to join the military. She wanted to be a paramedic. And in three years, when she turned 21, she just wanted to do her makeup with her cousin and go out. But on July 22, Ms. Wilson was fatally stabbed at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station in Oakland, Calif. At a memorial service on Friday, family, friends and community members described a future senselessly stolen. Ms. Wilson’s death robbed her family of a confidante, someone cousins and nieces looked up to and elders respected, they said. “Now I’m only left with memories that I will never forget of you,” Ms. Wilson’s niece said before the crowd, fighting back tears. “Can you promise to come visit me in my dreams?” Ms. Wilson’s body lay in a white coffin. On one side, white flowers were arranged to spell “Nia” in all caps. On the other, a cross made of white flowers. The service included songs and dances, as well as remembrances from family, clergy and politicians. But the crowd also clapped and cheered as some speakers demanded justice for a death that the community sees as another unjust killing of a black person at the hands of a white person. John Lee Cowell, the 27-year-old man who the police say attacked her, is white. Ms. Wilson was with two sisters, one of whom was also stabbed. That sister was taken to a hospital and later released. The police and prosecutors have not formally said they believe that race played a role in Ms. Wilson’s killing, though they are looking into the possibility. They said that if the evidence were to support it, they would classify the attack as a hate crime. For many living in Oakland, it’s impossible not to view the crime through a racial lens. “I don’t think you can take any violent crime committed against a black body by a white body outside the context of race in America, particularly when you’re talking about black girls in the City of Oakland,” said Cat Brooks, a community activist who is running for mayor and the executive director of the Justice Teams Network, a group that organizes responses to police shootings. Facing rapid gentrification, the city has seen a recent decrease in its black population despite its long history as a center of black culture and activism. BART itself has been at the center of controversy: In 2009, a BART police officer shot and killed Oscar Grant, an unarmed black man, at another train station. It’s that historical background, Ms. Brooks said, that makes Ms. Wilson’s death resonate in a broader context. Mr. Cowell has been charged with murder and attempted murder, and is being held in an Alameda County jail, said Michael O’Connor, an assistant district attorney in the county. Mr. Cowell has not yet entered a plea, and he is expected to do so during a hearing on Aug. 22, Mr. O’Connor said. Christina Moore, who is representing Mr. Cowell, said that he was recently released from a state hospital that treats felons who suffer from mental illness. The authorities said that Mr. Cowell had two previous felony convictions — for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon — in a neighboring county. Ms. Wilson’s family will sue the transit agency next week, arguing that weak public safety protections allowed her killing to take place, said Robert Arns, a lawyer for Ms. Wilson’s family. The lawsuit will be filed in Alameda County Superior Court. Mr. Arns said the lawsuit will assert that Mr. Cowell jumped a turnstile without paying his fare, that he should have been prevented from getting on a train, and that BART has been negligent in providing security for its riders. The lawsuit picks up on escalating concerns about safety in the transit system, which is one of the largest in the country and an integral means of commute for people living in the different corners of the San Francisco Bay Area. Violent crimes on BART have risen nearly 70 percent from 2007 to 2017, according to The San Francisco Chronicle, with 2018 on track to closely resemble 2017 numbers. In late July, in addition to Ms. Wilson’s death, there were two other homicides in the transit system in less than a week, BART authorities said. Chief Carlos Rojas of the BART Police said the agency is “constantly battling a perception” that crime is rising, especially when several high-profile crimes happen in a short period of time. He said the increase over several years could in part be driven by the expansion of the system. Mr. Rojas said BART does have a “big problem” with people jumping turnstiles or evading fares in other ways. He said he did not know if Mr. Cowell had jumped one. Speaking Friday at the funeral service, Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat who represents the east Bay Area, said she would seek justice for Ms. Wilson. “There is no peace without justice,” Ms. Lee said. “We will always keep Nia near to us, and say enough is enough in her memory and in her honor.”",The New York Times
2018,Nick Kyrgios Was Struggling. The Chair Umpire Stepped Down and Stepped In.,"Nick Kyrgios did not seem to be trying very hard Thursday afternoon in his second-round match at the United States Open. He was barely lunging for serves from his opponent, Pierre-Hugues Herbert. He moped around the court between games with a towel clenched between his teeth. He looked as if he would have preferred being anywhere other than Court 17. Then, during a changeover early in the second set, something curious happened. The chair umpire, Mohamed Lahyani, hopped down from his perch and offered Kyrgios what appeared to be a pep talk, imploring him to give more of an honest effort. Coaching is prohibited during matches at the Open — except, apparently, when chair umpires are doing it. “I want to help you,” Lahyani told Kyrgios at one point, adding, “I’ve seen your matches; you’re great for the sport.” Coincidence or not — and Kyrgios definitely thought it was a coincidence — he was a completely different player after that conversation, coming from behind to defeat Herbert, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-0 and set up a third-round meeting with second-seeded Roger Federer of Switzerland. At his news conference, Kyrgios, the No. 30 seed, quickly tired of questions about Lahyani and the suggestion that Lahyani had “coached” him through his struggles. “It’s ridiculous,” said Kyrgios, a 23-year-old Australian. “He wasn’t coaching me at all. I don’t have a coach. I haven’t had a coach for, like, years. Of course he wasn’t coaching me. What are you talking about?” Herbert, though, said he believed Lahyani had crossed a line. Chair umpires are expected to be impartial. It is one thing, Herbert said, if an umpire wants to warn a player about his lack of effort. It is another thing entirely to offer emotional support. “He doesn’t need to say the words he said on the video,” said Herbert, a 27-year-old Frenchmen. “I think this was not his job. I don’t think he’s a coach; he’s an umpire and he should stay on his chair for that.” The Open later released a statement that said that Lahyani had left his chair because he had wanted to be able to effectively communicate with Kyrgios in a noisy stadium. According to the statement, Lahyani was concerned that Kyrgios might need medical attention and went on to inform him that he would need to take action if Kyrgios’s “seeming lack of interest” in the match continued. A spokesman for the United States Tennis Association said the episode was being reviewed by the tournament director, tournament referee and chief umpire. “I think Mohamed Lahyani did a mistake,” Herbert said, adding, “I don’t think this is appropriate for an umpire to go down and say, ‘I want to help you.’ ” Lahyani, a longtime referee from Sweden — and known among fans for his showmanship — politely declined an interview request when he was approached after the match. Tour guidelines generally bar chair umpires from speaking with members of the news media. Lahyani referred questions about the episode to Kyrgios. “I’m not allowed to talk,” Lahyani said. “Is it about what happened? Ask him. Ask him. I’m just here to do my job.” For his part, Kyrgios said similar conversations with chair umpires happened all the time. And if Herbert had been on the receiving end of such a talk from Lahyani, Kyrgios said he would not have had a problem with it. “He said he liked me,” Kyrgios said. “I’m not sure if that was encouragement. He just said that it’s not a good look.” Kyrgios was referring to the way he was playing (poorly) and conducting himself (lethargically), neither of which was entirely out of character. “Look, I wasn’t feeling good,” Kyrgios said. “I know what I was doing out there wasn’t good. I wasn’t really listening to him, but I knew it wasn’t a good look.” Kyrgios is many things: talented and temperamental, capable of dominating high-level opponents one match and then getting destroyed by inferior players the next. His commitment to the game has been questioned. He is one of the most polarizing figures on tour. On Tuesday, in his first-round victory over Radu Albot, Kyrgios was booed by fans — and said he loved it. On Thursday, Kyrgios assembled a lackluster opening set — he put just 39 percent of his first serves in play — and then dropped the first three games of the second set. He was playing with minimal effort. Fans were heading toward the exits. Lahyani, apparently, had seen enough. Herbert said he could not hear what they were saying. Besides, he said, in a match against a player as wildly unpredictable as Kyrgios, he needed to focus on himself. “I just saw that he went down off the chair,” Herbert said, referring to Lahyani, “and I was a little bit surprised.” Portions of the conversation were picked up by an on-court microphone and later broadcast on ESPN. “I know this is not you,” Lahyani could be heard telling Kyrgios. Kyrgios proceeded to win 19 of the next 25 games to close out the match. “From that point, he was a different player,” Herbert said. Such a talk is not entirely unprecedented. In fact, Lahyani has had similar conversations with other players, including one with Bernard Tomic in 2016 (“Do your best,” Lahyani told him) and another with Gaël Monfils at a tournament in Spain several years ago when Monfils was upset with a call. “I’ve never seen you like this,” Lahyani told Monfils during a changeover. “You always keep your head.” On those occasions, Lahyani remained in his chair. Herbert, who was gracious after Thursday’s match, said that Lahyani was an “amazing” umpire who had overstepped his responsibilities. “He cares for Nick,” Herbert said. “He cares for the show.” A couple of hours after his news conference, though, Herbert reacted angrily to the statement that had been put out by the tournament — a statement he said was “taking us for fools.” “Err is human,” Herbert wrote in a post on his Twitter account, “but I still wait for explanations.” Federer, who defeated Benoît Paire of France, 7-5, 6-4, 6-4, on Thursday, said that he did not expect such a situation to happen again, but that was not an umpire’s role to speak as Lahyani did. “He was there for too long,” Federer said. “It’s a conversation. Conversations can change your mind-set. It can be a physio, a doctor, an umpire, for that matter.”",The New York Times
2018,"Nicki Minaj Cries Foul, but Travis Scott Is No. 1","In some ways, this week’s Billboard album chart was just a classic contest between two stars: Nicki Minaj, with her first LP in four years, was challenging Travis Scott, the incumbent, for the top spot. But these days, victory on the charts is rarely so simple. Mr. Scott’s “Astroworld” ended up holding No. 1 for a second week in a row, with the equivalent of 205,000 albums in the United States, according to Nielsen. That included 78,000 copies sold as a full album and 167 million streams. Ms. Minaj’s “Queen” came in second by a fair margin — 185,000 equivalents, which, like “Astroworld,” included about 78,000 sales of complete albums, but just 129 million streams. Yet Ms. Minaj cried foul. In a series of Twitter posts on Sunday that revealed to fans the kind of bitter finger-pointing that often goes on behind the scenes in an industry now dominated by two online powers, Ms. Minaj accused Spotify of suppressing promotion of the album as retaliation for her playing it on Beats 1, the online radio station of Apple Music. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Spotify put drake’s face on every playlist but told me they’d have to teach me a lesson for playing my music 10 mins early on #QueenRadio,” she wrote in one message, referring to her show on Beats 1. She also complained that Mr. Scott had unfairly gamed Billboard’s chart system by bundling the album with sales of merchandise and concert tickets — a common marketing gimmick, although Mr. Scott was trying to entice fans to a tour that had not been announced yet. But Ms. Minaj also knows how to play the game. On Tuesday, four days after “Queen” was first released as a 19-track album, she added a 20th track: “Fefe,” a hit collaboration with the rapper 6ix9ine that came out last month — a move that could help lift the overall numbers for “Queen.” And she also included copies of the album with lots of merch sales — like $25 necklaces and $60 hoodies — and with concert tickets. Spotify declined to comment on Monday, but by then Ms. Minaj had apparently withdrawn her complaints as mere “sarcasm/dry humor.” Also this week, Aretha Franklin, who died on Thursday at 76, reached her highest chart position in 46 years. After just one day of sales — the standard accounting week for album sales runs Friday to Thursday — “30 Greatest Hits” reached No. 7. The last time Ms. Franklin had reached that high on the chart, it was for her live album “Amazing Grace” in 1972. Drake’s “Scorpion,” meanwhile, is No. 3, while the rapper Trippie Redd opened at No. 4 with “Life’s a Trip,” and Post Malone is in fifth place with “Beerbongs & Bentleys.”",The New York Times
2018,Nicki Minaj and Travis Scott Fumble Toward Yesterday’s Prize: A No. 1 Album,"Critic’s Notebook On Sunday afternoon, Nicki Minaj went on Twitter to go over some matters of accounting. Moments earlier, Billboard reported that Travis Scott’s “Astroworld” was the No. 1 album in the United States for the second week running, relegating Ms. Minaj’s “Queen,” her fourth studio album, to No. 2 in its debut week. “I spoke to him,” she tweeted, referring to Mr. Scott. “He knows he doesn’t have the #1 album this week. I love my fans for the #1 album in AMERICA!” What incensed Ms. Minaj was a boost in sales Mr. Scott had received by bundling his album with merchandise and tour packages, and also an Instagram post by Mr. Scott’s paramour, Kylie Jenner, “telling ppl to come see her & Stormi,” Ms. Minaj tweeted. (Stormi is Mr. Scott and Ms. Jenner’s baby daughter.) But that wasn’t it. For about an hour, Ms. Minaj — whose album sales were supported by similar packages — listed her gripes: Billboard chart chicanery, Spotify blackballing, record-label spinelessness. Her complaints about how those alleged actions affected the rollout (and subsequent chart position) of “Queen” — which she later brushed off as “sarcasm/dry humor” — were implicitly tied to Ms. Minaj’s broader belief that, as a female rapper, she has not fully gotten her due. [Nicki Minaj has canceled her fall North American tour. Read more here.] No one is entitled to a No. 1 album, and in general, record labels and artists try to strategize release dates to maximize their chances. For the past two months, most people have stayed out of the way of Drake’s “Scorpion,” which had a five-week run at No. 1. Mr. Scott bumped him from the top a week ago. Presumably, Ms. Minaj expected to dethrone Mr. Scott (and next week, be dethroned herself by labelmate and collaborator Ariana Grande). But it wasn’t to be. Still, the resulting pyrotechnics obscure a far bleaker truth, which is that this fleeting battle for album-chart supremacy — itself a metric that’s becoming increasingly irrelevant — is between two artists preoccupied with the album format who are not especially well-suited to it. For Ms. Minaj, a classically skilled rapper fired in the kiln of New York mixtape rap and one of the last true crossover hip-hop superstars, an album is an opportunity to show off, to wear different guises, to make a grand statement. It’s a declaration of pomp and range. That’s what it is for Mr. Scott as well, but his approach is almost opposite. He is often less present on his own album than all of the guests he gathers. The sum total is impressive, almost overwhelming, but it says little about Mr. Scott on his own. “Queen” is Ms. Minaj’s first album in four years, a stretch of time in which the music business has been upended by streaming, and hip-hop has been upended by the internet. The 19-track record often feels like it’s fulfilling a checklist, trying to appeal to multiple constituencies in a way that was de rigueur, say, a decade ago. There is “Bed,” a blithe soft-R&B collaboration with Ms. Grande; “Come See About Me,” a ballad that sounds like it were written for Faith Hill; and “Thought I Knew You,” a listless pairing with the Weeknd. There is “Majesty,” an overbearing collaboration with Eminem — to be fair, one of the only rappers who can match Ms. Minaj’s theatricality — that extends for an uncomfortably long period of time. And there’s “Nip Tuck” and “Hard White,” songs where Ms. Minaj’s vocals are buried under digital effects — an effort to keep up with the sounds of the moment that ends up distracting from her familiar commandeering presence. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] As “Queen” makes clear, Ms. Minaj is a far better rapper than a singer, and a far better writer of rhymes than melodies. Her most muscular moments are her best here: the lightheartedly savage “LLC”; a pointed collaboration with Foxy Brown, “Coco Chanel”; and “Chun-Li,” full of casually ferocious bars, on which Ms. Minaj doesn’t break a sweat. And of course, there’s “Barbie Dreams,” a buoyant remake of the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Just Playing (Dreams),” a lewd rundown of his sexual fantasies about female R&B singers that verges on offense but was so skillfully executed it didn’t cross the line. The song is a crucial moment in 1990s New York rap, and Ms. Minaj does not take her inversion of the classic — which targets male rappers — lightly, delivering it with verve and also a fair bit of comedy. That Ms. Minaj is so much more effective in this mode is only underscored by the songs in which she abandons it. “Queen” aspires to solve multiple problems at once, but winds up emphasizing a whole new one: the continuing fuzziness of her artistic identity. Here again, she has something in common with Mr. Scott. He is hard to pin down on “Astroworld,” which may be the best of his studio albums but, like the ones before it, serves largely as testimony to his sense of scale and arrangement, and less as an affirmation of his technical skill. The list of guests is long and borderline preposterous: a bracing Frank Ocean on “Carousel,” Drake on “Sicko Mode,” an effective tag team of Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes on “No Bystanders,” an ethereally blissful pairing of Gunna and Nav on “Yosemite.” “Stop Trying to be God” features vocals from James Blake, Kid Cudi and Earth, Wind & Fire’s Philip Bailey, and harmonica from Stevie Wonder. Mr. Scott is on there, too, but there is a cardboard blankness to his vocal texture. Even all the layers of processing it’s run through don’t enliven it. That is a constant throughout this album, which is both excitingly ambitious and curiously hollow at the core. Mr. Scott has had some indelible singles over the years — “Pick Up the Phone,” “Butterfly Effect,” “Goosebumps” — but over the length of an album, he recedes. The 17-track “Astroworld” is as long as it is merely to show off all the guests he can attract. He also makes albums for an old-fashioned reason: to win prizes. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Mr. Scott’s A&R representative, Sickamore, described the glut of nontraditional guests on “Astroworld” as an arrow targeted right at the Grammys. What Mr. Scott does have is a sense of hip-hop as a fully immersive performance. His live concerts are creative and enthusiastically rowdy. His aesthetic sense is highly refined. Unlike Ms. Minaj, for whom hip-hop is first and foremost about rapping, Mr. Scott understands hip-hop primarily as a lifestyle. (Some of that has to do with age — Ms. Minaj is 35, Mr. Scott is 26 — and generational shifts.) His album is an opportunity for music, yes, but also for merchandise that is whimsical and maximal, just like his shows. For Mr. Scott, the album is a pretense, a necessary step in between him and the exuberant presentation that is his true gift. But albums aren’t for everyone. This tussle over Billboard chart dominance — never mind that Ms. Minaj is judging her first week against Mr. Scott’s second — feels especially futile given that it’s between artists who could probably continue to thrive without them. Ms. Minaj’s celebrity is secure. Mr. Scott has figured out how to embody modern hip-hop while bypassing the usual steppingstones. For both, the album is an albatross, not an answer.",The New York Times
2018,"Nicki Minaj and Travis Scott, Rivals With Common Problems","Nicki Minaj is one of hip-hop’s old-fashioned superstars — an impressive technician, a character actor, a cross-genre fixture. Travis Scott is a star of the new generation, focused on aesthetics and reception more than his own technique. For the last two weeks, Mr. Scott’s “Astroworld” has been the No. 1 album in the country, keeping Ms. Minaj’s “Queen” at bay. (On Twitter, she groaned over what she perceived to be the unfair circumstances helping boost the performance of Mr. Scott’s album.) But while these two rappers seem opposed, they have commonalities: They both struggle with the album format, for one, and they are actively negotiating what their artistic identity should be.

2018,"Opinion | Nixon, Clinton and Trump","The more Trump is cornered, the more he mirrors Richard Nixon. Opinion Columnist Twenty years ago last Friday, President Bill Clinton testified before the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and a grand jury about his sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky. That night, Clinton addressed the nation, in which he confessed: I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible. But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action. I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that. It was a clear admission, even if offered under duress and after the option to lie had vanished, and even if still splitting some hairs. Months earlier, Clinton had bluntly said, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the American people.” Days after Clinton made his admission, Donald Trump gave an interview to Chris Matthews in which he said of Clinton: I think his little speech after it was a disaster. It wasn’t the right tone, and I’m not sure he should have done it. And, I’m not even sure that he shouldn’t have just gone in and taken the Fifth Amendment, and said: “Look, I don’t get along with this man, Starr. He’s after me. He’s a Republican.” He’s this, he’s that, and you know, just taken the Fifth Amendment. It’s a terrible thing for a president to take the Fifth Amendment, but he probably should have done it. Donald Trump made clear then his approach to dealing with these sorts of problems: Admit nothing, confess nothing, deny everything, attack the person pursuing you. For me, it is clear that there was at least an attempt by members of the Trump team to conspire with Russians to influence the elections. The evidence of that is now public record. And, it is just as clear that Trump has attempted to obstruct justice by hampering the investigation and continues to do so. Whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, will deem those actions to meet the legal threshold of criminality is another story. But, it seems to me that Trump is growing increasingly agitated over the very real possibility that more members of his campaign and possibly his family are open to liability and that he himself may be vulnerable to eventual impeachment. As such, he is mirroring the actions of President Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached. Almost 25 years to the day before Clinton addressed the nation with his confession, Nixon addressed the nation with a denial. Nixon said: I said on May 22 that I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate operation. In all the testimony, there is not the slightest evidence to the contrary. Not a single witness has testified that I had any knowledge of the planning for the Watergate break‐in. It is also true, as I said on May 22, that I took no part in, and was not aware of, any subsequent efforts to cover up the illegal acts associated with the Watergate break‐in. We now know, of course, that that was a lie. But a full reading of Nixon’s statements sound mild compared to the viciousness with which Trump is attacking the investigation looking into illegality, the press reporting on it and those providing information for it. Even in Nixon’s false statement, one reads at least a rhetorical respect for American institutions and history, even if that respect did not exist in fact or in full. Trump has none of that. I believe he has absolutely no plans to personally cooperate with the investigation by sitting for an interview. He may have once believed that he could bluff his way through such an experience, but now his hostility and fear about the inquiry’s conclusion has clipped his courage. And, I don’t believe Trump is going to confess as Clinton did, or resign as Nixon did, regardless of what Mueller finds, whom he prosecutes or what he says in a report. Trump lies about almost everything, but one thing that he says is true: He is a fighter. But he’s not a fighter because he is fearsome or brave. Valor has no relationship to the man. Trump fights for vanity. One of Trump’s greatest fears and greatest insecurities is being embarrassed and being exposed. Trump is petrified that someone will remove the mask he has been crafting for seven decades, or of having it be revealed that that mask is made of paper rather than steel.

2018,No Artists Outshine Others in This Egalitarian Collection,"Show Us Your Wall CHICAGO — Collector commitment levels vary widely: There’s the casual art purchaser; the informed and systematic acquirer; and then, at the top of the pyramid, the fully committed zealot. Patric McCoy easily qualifies in the last category. Mr. McCoy has some 1,300 works stuffed into his apartment here on the South Side, not too far from his alma mater, the University of Chicago. Across the street is the house where the musician Muddy Waters lived for two decades. The paintings, sculptures and drawings aren’t all necessarily by well-known artists, and Mr. McCoy likes it that way. In fact, he refused to let The New York Times photograph some ceramics by the biggest name on hand, the Chicago-based Theaster Gates. “I don’t like putting one artist over the others,” Mr. McCoy said. “I have a problem with celebrity emphasis.” He spoke glowingly of several paintings by George Crump, a sculpture by Preston Jackson and a print by Larry Walker (the father of the artist Kara Walker), but, given enough time, he would find similar praise for everything in the place. Intense, bright colors tie it all together. Mr. McCoy, 71, is a retired chemist who co-founded Diasporal Rhythms, a group that collects the work of artists of African descent. In October, a show of some of their collections will be on view at the DuSable Museum of African American History, and some of the participants will open their homes for tours, too. On a recent morning after working out, Mr. McCoy talked about his very precise and thought-out collecting philosophy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did this get started? In 1968 at the University of Chicago, my roommate was an art major, and he came back with a lithograph that he had done in class. I asked him what a lithograph was because I didn’t know. So he explained the process, and then I asked him if he was going to sell it. And we negotiated for $10. I bought it, and still have it to this day. And then it was off to the races? It was slow at first. After doing it for a while, I started to understand that I actually was an art collector. There are so many different prejudices in the American scene that keep people from thinking of themselves as art collectors. We have been told through the media that you have to be super wealthy. What are the other negative messages? That you have to be private, that you acquire things and you squirrel them away. And what you hear everywhere is that you have to know something about art, and that is such a bunch of malarkey. All you have to do is look at something and say, “I like that, and I want to buy it,” and then you’re an art collector. Tell me about this painting by your father, “Nuclear Family” (1954). My father, Thomas McCoy, was an accomplished artist in high school and received a full scholarship from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. A month after sending him the acceptance letter, they sent him a letter saying he couldn’t come there because he was black. He never received any formal training after high school but he did painting, photography, commercial art and furniture design when he wasn’t working at the Glidden paint factory. The painting of our family was done at the height of the atomic war scare of the 1950s. He took a frightening symbol and made it a symbol of the family. As far as Chicago, what are your local inspirations? At one point I was doing research on Jean Baptiste Point du Sable [the Haitian man who is considered the founder of Chicago]. When he left in 1800 and had to sell his estate, the deed listed he had 23 paintings. And I realize this is in the wilderness, there are no roads — the city wasn’t even established until 1837, and he has all these paintings. So I’m thinking, “Oh, this city was founded by an art collector.” And so we’re just part of that tradition.",The New York Times

2018,"No Credit, No Problem for Todd Howe, Who Is Freed on Bail","The story of Todd R. Howe, the disgraced government witness who helped federal prosecutors investigate major New York State corruption cases, always seems to come down to credit cards and second chances — both of which seem to pose problems for Mr. Howe. On Thursday, Mr. Howe was taken into a Manhattan courtroom from the detention center where he has been held since February, under rather unusual circumstances. Mr. Howe was thrown into jail after he admitted during a trial that he tried to defraud a credit card company after becoming a cooperating witness for the government. Mr. Howe, who had pleaded guilty to eight felonies and still faces sentencing, made the admission under cross-examination during the trial of Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Hours after making that admission, Mr. Howe was arrested for violating a key provision of his cooperation deal: that he “commit no further crimes whatsoever.” Mr. Percoco was later convicted, and awaits sentencing. Mr. Howe, meanwhile, awaited his own fate, which he hoped would soon include his release. Two weeks ago, Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court signaled at a court conference that it was time for Mr. Howe, to be released on bail, and his lawyers and the government later submitted a joint proposal that would require him to sign a $100,000 personal recognizance bond and abide by a list of conditions. But the judge questioned whether some of the provisions, like one that strongly restricted his use of cellphones and electronic communication devices, were appropriate or necessary. A prosecutor, Janis Echenberg, explained that as Mr. Howe gained his freedom over the next several months, “having specific rules for him to follow, at least initially, we think makes sense.” Judge Caproni replied that the “primary rule” for Mr. Howe was that he “cannot commit another crime.” “If he can’t keep that in mind,” she said, “none of the rest of these conditions are going to make a dime’s worth of difference.” But the judge suggested that one provision — about credit cards — was not strict enough. She ultimately allowed Mr. Howe to keep one credit card and an A.T.M. card, and directed that within one week, he have a credit check done through the three major credit reporting bureaus, and send the reports to the government and to the court. Judge Caproni said he would be required to run another credit check one week before sentencing, which is scheduled for Nov. 2. “I want to see where you are right now and I want to see where you are right before sentence.” He was not to apply for any new cards, she added. As the hearing ended, Judge Caproni addressed Mr. Howe again. “You’re getting a second chance. Don’t mess it up. I might say this is more like your third or fourth chance but, seriously, everybody’s patience has gone. So this is your chance. Don’t mess it up. You now know what jail is like.” By day’s end, Mr. Howe had been released on the new bond conditions, said one of his lawyers, Savannah Stevenson. “Mr. Howe is looking forward to seeing his family,” she said, “and preparing for the court’s decision come sentencing.” She added that Mr. Howe was to be on a flight back to Idaho, where his most recent job was as a groundskeeper for a golf course.",The New York Times

2018,"No Saudi Aramco I.P.O.? No Problem, Potentially, for Saudi Arabia’s Investment Dreams","Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ The world’s largest initial public offering is on hiatus. The spending it was to enable may not be. Saudi Arabia planned to take its giant oil company, Saudi Aramco, to the public markets. It was to be the linchpin of a grand economic vision, generating billions of dollars to pay for future-proofing the kingdom’s economy, including huge investments in technology. It is now postponed, leaving a large funding shortfall. But Saudi Arabia is pursuing alternative transactions that could ensure its dreams aren’t dashed: • Saudi Aramco is in discussions to buy a large stake in Sabic, a publicly traded chemical company. Sabic’s controlling shareholder is Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. While the size of that potential acquisition is unclear, media reports say it could be as big as $70 billion. • The Public Investment Fund is in talks to raise $11 billion in bank loans from international lenders, according to The Financial Times. It would be the first time the sovereign wealth fund borrowed money. • Saudi Aramco could still sell a stake in itself. Big companies in China and Russia reportedly expressed interest in an investment in the past. It isn’t clear how much a sale would raise, but it would almost certainly run to billions of dollars. The Saudi government planned to sell about 5 percent of Saudi Aramco on public stock markets. If the oil giant could have fetched a $2 trillion valuation — and there has been skepticism over that figure — the kingdom would have received roughly $100 billion. The three new moves, if they were to happen, could yield almost as much as Saudi Aramco’s I.P.O. would have. The Saudi government would then have the financial firepower to pursue its grand economic goals, collectively known as Vision 2030. That means money to invest in Silicon Valley start-ups. Or to create a giant new city that runs on clean energy and robots. Or to even help Elon Musk take Tesla private. Saudi Arabia already has a nearly 5 percent stake in the carmaker, and Mr. Musk has said it is interested in helping fund a buyout. But the Public Investment Fund has yet to send such a signal, and is reportedly in talks to invest in a Tesla rival.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | No, It’s Not My Boyfriend’s Bike","Ms. Miyake is the author of “The Gendered Motorcycle.” One of the beautiful aspects of riding a motorcycle is that, for those few precious moments when you watch your speedometer leap into life and feel the wind rush past your face, when you feel the pull of gravity drawing you closer toward the blur of a corner, things like your gender cease to matter. It’s just the machine and you. That is the joy of the road. That is freedom. Freedom that lasts just up until you stop, step off the bike, take off your helmet — and are promptly greeted with offers to help park the machine you just rode in on. The pleasures of taking to the open road on a motorcycle are gender-neutral: There’s the rumble that growls from deep within your machine when you twist the throttle; the sheer distortion of sound and vision at 70 miles per hour; the sudden lurch as you and your bike suddenly pull away, leaving traffic behind you. And yet all my years of riding — and I have been riding for about half of my life now, on different machines, in all manner of places — have taught me that while the pleasures themselves may be gender-neutral, people consistently assume that the people experiencing them are male. In some ways, they’re not wrong to do so. I have always been a bit of a thrill-seeker, and since I was little, I have been fascinated by machines. Motorcycles found their way into my life before I even knew what “feminism” or “gender bias” meant. But statistically speaking, I’m a minority. In Britain, where I live, men are three times as likely to own a motorcycle, moped or scooter than women. It’s a rare occasion that I encounter fellow women on two wheels on the road, especially riding solo. The message from popular culture is certainly that bikes are for men (see Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando and, more recently, Ewan McGregor). When women do appear on them, it is while a) wearing a skintight cat suit, b) clinging onto a man from behind as a passenger or c) looking reassuringly butch and thus, vehicularly appropriate. Why are there so few of us women experiencing one of the great joys of summer: riding into the sunset on two wheels? Part of it has to do with the relationship between men and machines. Historically, machines have belonged to domains typically considered masculine — labor and industry, war and militarism. Women’s relationship with machinery, by contrast, has been restricted to the domestic sphere (see “Christmas morning she’ll be happier with a Hoover!”). Today, thankfully, we’ve progressed to the point where women are allowed out in cars. But in the popular imagination, for women, cars remain extensions of the home, tools to shop for groceries or collect the kids — tasks for which motorcycles are not particularly well suited. Another part has to do with the association in the public imagination between motorcycles and crime, deviance and aggression. Real-life infamous incidents centered around motorcycles, like the Hollister riots in California in 1947 and the Mods and Rockers clashes across British seaside resorts in 1964, along with notorious motorcycle clubs like the Hells Angels, have over the years fed widespread perceptions of bikes as vehicles for gangs — composed primarily of men — engaged in nefarious activities. And part of it has to do with the limited number of ways that pop culture has allowed women and bikes to come together. Men who want to ride have a spectrum of different motorcycle-based masculinities to choose from: There are the metrosexual Belstaff-jacket-wearing David Beckhams; the “Mad Max”-style crazy adrenaline junkies; leather-clad Angels types; even existentialist motorcycle maintenance gurus. By contrast, when women associate with bikes, in pop culture at least, it’s to indicate that they are strong biker chicks: Carrie-Anne Moss’s Trinity in “The Matrix,” Megan Fox’s Mikaela Banes in “Transformers” or Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman in “The Dark Knight Rises.” There are those who would argue that the biker chick is a sign of progress — women who have ditched their Hoovers to pop pert wheelies — and those who view this archetype as another form of objectification, this time clad in leather. A debate worth having, sure — but in the meantime, where does that leave those women who just want to wear Gore-Tex? Unfortunately, until we see more images of women wearing boring outfits, until we have more motorcycle advertisements and products aimed at women not as passengers but as riders, until we get more models of female motorcyclists, like British travel writer Lois Pryce, until we have more women’s motorcycle clubs, the rest of us will have to keep correcting assumptions: explaining that no, that’s not my boyfriend’s bike, and yes, I did ride in on it by myself. The good news is, it’s not bikes that engender you; it’s people who do all that. So whether you’re a catsuit-clad road goddess who doesn’t touch dirt but loves the smell of burning tires, a grease monkey who tinkers with her own gaskets or simply a commuter looking for a more exciting way to get to work, don’t let people get in the way of you feeling the elements charging at you, refreshing your soul with the thrill of liberation, the sensation of flying. I just ignore them and keep on riding. And so should you.",The New York Times
2018,"No, Tariffs Aren’t Going to Pay Down the National Debt","The budget deficit is growing much faster than any increase in tariff revenue. President Trump has a new plan for how to pay down the national debt: Taxing American consumers and businesses when they buy certain goods from countries subject to his tariffs. Math is not on his side. Mr. Trump contended over the weekend that the tariffs his administration has imposed on steel, aluminum and a variety of imported Chinese goods will soon begin to generate sufficient revenue to reduce the federal debt. It’s a bold claim. Mr. Trump famously promised during the 2016 campaign to pay off the entire national debt as president. Reducing the national debt is not quite as ambitious as paying it all off but it’s still a tall order. To reduce the debt, you must first balance the federal budget — and then go right on past that and start running a surplus, where the government takes in more revenue than it spends every year. For this fiscal year, the Congressional Budget Office projects the federal budget deficit will be $800 billion. Mr. Trump’s own Office of Management and Budget projects the deficit will top $1 trillion in 2019. That means that to pay down any of the debt — let alone “large amounts” — tariffs will need to bring in at least $800 billion this year. As it happens, the Treasury Department tracks how much revenue the United States collects from tariffs. By its calculations, that amount is going to clock in at about $40 billion as of 2018. That amount includes $35 billion that the Treasury has already taken in from tariffs over the past two years. So the additional amount coming in this year, as a result of Mr. Trump’s tariffs, is about $5 billion, or 1/160th of what Mr. Trump needs to begin retiring debt. But wait, you say. Mr. Trump has announced more tariffs could be on the way. Won’t they raise more money? Yes, probably. Let’s assume every tariff Mr. Trump has proposed thus far this year goes into effect, at the maximum possible rate, and that American consumers keep buying all those imported products even if they are much more expensive. Those are dubious assumptions — particularly because consumers would likely switch their buying habits to favor goods not affected by tariffs — but let’s go with them for now. A proposed 25 percent tariff on $200 billion in additional imports from China would raise $50 billion a year. A proposed 25 percent tax on imported automobiles and auto parts would raise $85.25 billion. That’s a lot of money. It’s a real boost to federal revenue, along with, in basically every economist’s model of how tariffs work, a tax increase on American consumers. And it remains at least $664 billion short of what you would need to start paying off debt. The gap would be less daunting if not for some deficit-juicing laws that Mr. Trump signed in the past year. A compromise Congressional spending bill will increase military spending by $40 billion this fiscal year and nonmilitary spending by $54 billion. In 2019, that combined spending increase jumps to $139 billion, which would entirely offset the revenue gained from the Chinese tariffs and the auto tariffs, the C.B.O. predicts. Mr. Trump’s signature tax cuts are an even larger factor. They will reduce federal revenue by $163 billion this year and $285 billion next year, the C.B.O. estimates. There was a time when the United States raised most of its federal revenue through tariffs. It ended 100 years ago, after World War I. In post-World War II America, tariffs have almost entirely disappeared as a significant revenue source. Mr. Trump could return tariff revenue to its high point of the last 50 years — under President Gerald Ford in 1975 — and still be a good $700 billion short of what he needs to pay down debt. To get that kind of money from trade policy alone, Mr. Trump would need to impose a more-than 33 percent tariff on $2.34 trillion in imports — which is to say, every single good the United States imported last year.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | No, the Church Does Not Love Ireland","Opinion But the Irish people have learned to love one another. Protesters against clerical sexual child abuse in Ireland, at a rally in Dublin on Sunday.CreditCreditPaulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times Ms. McKay is a writer in Ireland. DUBLIN — On Sunday, while the faithful gathered for mass with Pope Francis in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, a large group gathered in the city’s Garden of Remembrance at an event called Stand for Truth. The railings had been hung with dozens of tiny pairs of baby shoes. Colm O’Gorman, who runs the Irish office of Amnesty International, organized the event. He told the crowd that he had been 13 years old, and deeply religious, when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979 — the last time a pope visited Ireland. “I was in a liturgical group,” he said. “The church was in every part of my life. That moment in Galway when the pope said, ‘Young people of Ireland, I love you,’ I believed him. My heart nearly burst. A year and a half later I was raped by a Catholic priest.” He was raped repeatedly, and that priest raped many other children. Like hundreds of other abusive clerics, the priest was facilitated and protected by the Catholic hierarchy. As in so many cases, when parents or other concerned adults complained, the local bishop or abbot would simply move the offender to another parish where he was not known, then perhaps to another. Some were posted to hospitals, some to schools. No warnings were issued. And offenders continued to rape children. Mr. O’Gorman had come to realize that no, the pope had not loved the young people of Ireland. “But we have learned to love each other,” he said. “And we are Ireland, the new Ireland.” The new Ireland allows gay people to marry, women to have abortions and unhappily married people to divorce. None of these things is allowed by Pope Francis’ church. And on this visit, the disconnect between the new Ireland and his church was plain. Pope Francis arrived in Ireland on Saturday morning and was taken to visit the popular president, Michael Higgins, who said in a statement that he had spoken “to his Holiness of how the achievement of an equality of rights defined a republic, and of how acts of exclusion, including those based on gender and sexual orientation, had caused, and were still causing, great suffering.” The Taoiseach (as Ireland’s prime minister is known), Leo Varadkar, gave a speech in the presence of the pope about the “brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic church and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims.” Now, Mr. Varadkar said, words must be followed by actions. Well, there were plenty of words. During his public and private engagements Pope Francis repeatedly expressed shame. He begged for God’s forgiveness and said crimes committed by clerics and others in the church had left “an open wound.” But he did not offer any ideas as to why all this depravity had been visited on innocent people; he did not outline any plans to reform his church; and he did not instruct criminals within the church, or those who facilitated them, to hand themselves over to the police. The Irish people were not satisfied. In 1979, more than a million people attended the papal mass. Feminists were a radically dissenting voice, but they were lost in the general euphoria — about 90 percent of the population actively practiced Catholicism. Many people were suffering, but not in the public domain. This time 500,000 tickets were issued but an estimated 130,000 turned up. Almost 10,000 registered for the Stand for Truth event. There have been too many hollow promises. We know too much. Protests about the denial of human rights are well organized and well supported. Our side wins referendums, including, this summer, one that will allow women to get abortions in Ireland. And hollow promises are no longer believed. At the Stand for Truth event musicians sang a hauntingly beautiful version of “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” and “We Shall Overcome.” Sarah Clancy, a poet, read “Cherish,” one of her fierce poems, indicting “the ring kissers/who made it all possible.” The novelist Marian Keyes quoted Raymond Carver’s “Late Fragment” in which he says that yes, he got what he wanted from life: “to call myself beloved, to feel myself/beloved on the earth.” Survivors of abuse had been ignored and silenced, Ms. Keyes said, but now Irish people were going to take care of them. “They deserve to know right to their bones that they are beloved on the earth,” she said. I spoke to Siobhán Casey, who’d come to the event with her husband and two small children. “I’ve been working with young people in the care system and the criminal justice system for years,” she told me. “I have seen so much damage. It runs through generations. … They don’t always have the emotional language to describe what happened in their family but they are suffering.” And I met Claire McKeegan, a human rights lawyer from the North who represents many survivors of institutional abuse, who wore a necklace made of baby shoes. She said her clients would gain strength from the protests. The rally ended with a silent walk along a street named after Sean McDermott, one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising against the British. The pope had been conveyed down this same street in his Popemobile the previous day. He had stopped at the local chapel, where he venerated the bones of Matt Talbot, an alcoholic religious zealot who mortified his flesh by wrapping it in chains and died in the 1920s. The walkers passed the church, stopping just beyond it at another building that the pope was not brought to see. Now empty, it was the last of the Magdalene laundries — institutions where girls and women were sent to atone for the “sin” of becoming pregnant while unmarried — which closed only in 1996. An artist at the site invited people to write their thoughts on white sheets like those scrubbed by the women confined in them. One man wrote: “My father was told by the Monsignor it was his own fault for leading the priests on. My heart breaks.” I walked to the train station feeling profoundly sad, but also proud to be part of the new Ireland, a republic that hears the voices of the most vulnerable.

2018,No. 1 Simona Halep Exits the U.S. Open in the First Round,"It only seemed as if Simona Halep made history Monday in a New York minute. Actually, it took all of 76 minutes for her to become the first No. 1 women’s seed in the history of the United States Open to lose in the first round, falling by 6-2, 6-4 to Kaia Kanepi. As Halep’s trademark on-court soap operas go, the stunning upset was still swift, almost routine. Kanepi, a 33-year-old Estonian who is ranked No. 44, dominated a sluggish Halep in the first set before halting her rally to 4-4 from 0-3 in the second in the first main-draw match at the new Louis Armstrong Stadium. How to explain Halep’s tournament being finished before lunch, even if the Romanian has a history of first-round flameouts — 12 in 34 career Grand Slam events — and Kanepi has six major quarterfinals on her résumé, including one a year ago in New York? [Get live results and analysis from the first day of the 2018 U.S. Open.] Halep did not cite fatigue, despite runs in consecutive weeks this month to the finals in the Rogers Cup and Western & Southern Open, winning the former and losing the latter before withdrawing from last week’s event in Connecticut. She did not blame the noisy conditions in the otherwise well-received Armstrong Stadium, where open-air walkways and concessions create a continuous din. She did admit that, for whatever reason, “I never play my best tennis” in New York. True to character, honest as usual in her post-match confessional, Halep suggested it was more the voices in her head that most contributed to the dismal end to a Grand Slam season that began with a heart-wrenching defeat to Caroline Wozniacki in the final of the Australian Open and a long-awaited breakthrough title at the French Open over Sloane Stephens “Yeah, nerves,” she before adding with a guilty-as-charged smile, “because I’m born like this, I think.” It can be painful to watch players struggle against their emotional demons in their lonely line of work, but that makes it even more exhilarating to witness an eventful exorcism. To that end result, Halep was moved to joyous tears in Paris after the Stephens match, during which she seemed headed to a fourth major final defeat before wearing down her opponent and accelerating to the finish. So was her coach, Darren Cahill, who resigned the position for a spell, exasperated by Halep’s futile bouts with self-loathing. The demons apparently never stray far enough away to be permanently neutered. This summer, even as she tightened her grip on the top ranking that she will maintain despite Monday’s defeat, Halep was seen on television summoning Cahill to the court during one changeover in Montreal — he waved her off — and despairing to him for having missed a second-set match point against Kiki Bertens in the Western & Southern Open final before wilting in the third. Her matches have become compelling docudramas, as psychologically draining as they’ve been physically grueling. Generously listed at 5 feet 6 inches, in an era long since labeled Big Babe Tennis by the broadcaster Mary Carillo, Halep has brilliantly fought her way to the top of the tour by winning wars of tactical attrition against comparative giants. Cahill convinced her over the last two years to go bigger on her groundstrokes, with obvious success. But nothing much worked in the first set and the next three games of the second against the 5-foot-11 Kanepi, who mercilessly attacked Halep’s 80-plus miles-per-hour second serve, belting clean winners and breaking her four times. Between sets, Halep discarded her cap, but that didn’t stop the bleeding. She was broken immediately and then, after a wide backhand to start the second game, she violently introduced her racket to the hard court — twice. “It’s no problem venting and getting all this stuff out, that’s no problem, as long as you are willing to make a difference,” Cahill had lectured her in one of his memorable on-court pep talks during a 2017 match with Johanna Konta in Miami. “And if she beats you playing great tennis, no worries. Shake her hand and tell her well done.” By the time Halep reached the media conference room on Monday, that was the conclusion she appeared to have reached. The stat sheet was in full agreement. Kanepi hit 26 winners to Halep’s 9. Halep won 30 percent of her second-service points (6 of 20) compared with Kanepi’s 60 percent (9 of 15). “She played really strong, pushed me back,” Halep said. Cahill, she said, had given her a hug and “said that it’s all right.” She knew coming into the match that the draw had not been kind. Kanepi was certainly no pushover — if not quite the first-round challenge that Maria Sharapova was in ousting Halep, then the No. 2 seed, at the Open last year. Initially impassive to Kanepi’s first-set level, the Armstrong crowd, swelling with the scent of an upset, tried to lift Halep by chanting her first name. Kanepi wondered what was up with that after breaking Halep’s second-set momentum by turning around a 40-15 deficit to break back to 5-4 before serving out the match. “Why they cheer so much for her? Because normally they cheer for the underdog,” Kanepi said. She was smiling, no doubt aware of how Serena Williams’s absence from the tour after the birth of her daughter last September had cast an episodic spotlight on others, especially in the United States. In the grand scheme of things, Halep at her size could be considered an underdog against many of her top opponents, including those vexing demons within. The battle against them continues.",The New York Times
2018,Nobu’s Offspring Still Know How to Party,"Restaurant Review 8 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There was a time when there was only one Nobu, on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa’s startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalapeño wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup — and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted — you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same — more on this in a minute — but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa’s food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven. The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won’t be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building’s ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn’t tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group’s design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions’ locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, “Our menu is kaiseki style, so it’s like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.” I must have looked confused because he added, “Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.” Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review, by Frank Bruni in 2005. That’s what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with puréed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don’t know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn’t been seen much since the ’90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith’s desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don’t try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera, but they know what they’re doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

2018,"Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke","Feature He has won a cult following by playing the wise fool, but his comedic ambitions are much greater than that. If he could only hold down a job. Norm Macdonald at his home in Los Angeles, with his 18-year-old cat, Kitty.CreditCreditPeter Yang for The New York Times Midway through his third orange Fanta, in the course of explaining why he doesn’t talk to strangers anymore, Norm Macdonald told the story of one of his stalkers. We were at the Panini Kabob Grill, an aggressively normal eatery in a planned community of shops and condos not far from his home on the Westside of Los Angeles. It was April, sunny but mild. The night before, Macdonald taped an episode of his new Netflix talk show, and he still had makeup in the crevices around his nostrils when he arrived for brunch. We were sitting with Lori Jo Hoekstra — Macdonald’s producing partner for the last 20 years — and a representative from Netflix. The tables were heavily lacquered, the menus were laminated and there were a few discreetly placed TVs. It was the kind of place where Macdonald was both unlikely to be noticed and virtually guaranteed to be the most famous person there. Macdonald used to linger after his nightclub performances to talk to fans, he explained, but the stalker made him stop. She lived in Florida and was convinced that they’d been conducting a secret affair for decades. Her psychiatrist contacted Macdonald’s manager to warn that she might be planning to harm him. His manager did not write down the psychiatrist’s number, though, so Macdonald learned only that she was out there, somewhere in Florida. Later, when his manager offered him some Florida dates, Macdonald cited her as a reason not to go. His manager dismissed this concern. “That loony tunes?” Norm recalled him saying. “She’s crazy.” “That’s the point!” Macdonald protested. “I’m not going to play chess with her.” Hoeskstra was visibly amused by this anecdote, even though she had surely heard it before. Macdonald went on to say that he often wondered why nightclub comics weren’t more frequently murdered. “It would be easy to walk in with a gun and kill one of them,” he said. It seemed an insight best kept from reporters. The Netflix representative became deeply interested in a point somewhere in the middle distance, and Hoekstra said “Norm” in a tone of voice that must have been familiar to both of them. In the silence that followed, he turned to me and asked, “Do you find stand-up is no good anymore?” By all outward appearances, stand-up is thriving. The number of shows and specials, as well as the critical attention devoted to them, has reached heights not seen since the 1980s. This rising tide has also lifted Macdonald, who is still best known for anchoring the “Weekend Update” segment of “Saturday Night Live” from 1994 until January 1998, when he was fired during the Christmas hiatus — not by the show’s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, but by the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer. The reason has always been a subject of debate. The popular explanation was that Ohlmeyer, who died in 2017 and was a close friend of O.J. Simpson’s, resented a string of jokes about Simpson’s murder trial that continued long after the former football star was acquitted. In retrospect, the Simpson trial was eerily suited to Macdonald’s sense of humor, in that it centered on an assumption widely held but politely denied. While the news media was obliged to withhold judgment, Macdonald gave voice to the popular belief that Simpson was guilty, delivering joke after joke about how he was obviously a murderer. Macdonald made the number and intensity of these jokes a kind of gag in itself, even after he left “Saturday Night Live.” Hosting ESPN’s Espy Awards one month after he was fired, he congratulated Charles Woodson on winning the Heisman Trophy: “That is something that no one can ever take away from you,” he said, “unless you kill your wife and a waiter.” His refusal to stop saying things like that on TV fits his image, among his fans, as a comedian who prioritizes the joke above all else — even his career. Since “S.N.L,” that career has been aesthetically pleasing but commercially uneven. The dedicated fan will identify two patterns in his television work: It is invariably funny, and it is invariably canceled. His longest-running show, the sitcom “Norm,” aired on ABC between 1999 and 2001. ”A Minute With Stan Hooper” was canceled after six episodes. “Sports Show With Norm Macdonald” lasted nine. He also played the KFC mascot Colonel Sanders in a handful of commercials. Mostly, he does nightclub comedy. He estimates he was on the road 44 weeks last year — a grueling schedule for a 58-year-old man who doesn’t drink and describes himself as never having been “promiscuous.” Between his stand-up, his short-lived but distinctive TV projects and a series of memorable appearances on late-night talk shows, he has captured an audience that is dedicated and, in many cases, influential. Jon Stewart described him to me as “a master of stand-up”; David Letterman, who is credited as “special counsel” on Macdonald’s new show and helped sell it to Netflix, likened him to a “pitcher with five out pitches.” “In my mind, I’m just a stand-up,” Macdonald said at brunch, interrupting his thought to thank the waitress for bringing his eggs. He is scrupulously polite. In conversation, he seems to make a point of following other people’s remarks with notes of encouragement, saying “that’s interesting” or “exactly right.” Even on the set of his own show, he speaks quietly, almost to the point of diffidence. He looms at over six feet, though, and he has that voice — flat but resonant, drawn, the comedy version of Buffalo Bill in “Silence of the Lambs.” He continued: “But other people don’t think that. They go, oh, the guy from ‘S.N.L.’ is doing stand-up now.” Two decades later, he has yet to recapture the fame he enjoyed when he left that show. To his thinking, though, he has moved steadily closer to his own ideal of what comedy can or should be. Macdonald speaks often about a kind of Platonic form of a joke whose punch line is identical to its setup. He feels he came close in 1995 on “Weekend Update”: “Julia Roberts told reporters this week that her marriage to Lyle Lovett has been over for some time,” he said, as a picture of the country singer’s asymmetrical face appeared behind him. “The key moment, she said, came when she realized that she was Julia Roberts, and that she was married to Lyle Lovett.” At that time, Macdonald was better known for shocking punch lines than for elegant writing, although the elements of his mature approach were already in place. Over the last two decades, he has grown more devoted to the pure joke, even as comedy has turned away from it. Contemporary stand-up increasingly positions the comedian either as a relatable personality whom audiences can follow from role to role or as a righteous truth-teller. Macdonald is neither. He is resolutely nonpolitical in an industry bent on producing new versions of “The Daily Show,” an ironist working on the same platform as “Nanette.” At a moment when comedians work for applause as much as laughter, by being vulnerable, honest, outspoken, socially relevant, Macdonald is still pursuing the laugh — and nothing more. This anachronistic approach might be limiting his audience, but it could also explain his enduring appeal, because it lends him a kind of moral authority. He is something like a comedy ascetic, demanding a purity that temporal jokes cannot achieve. He seems vital and transgressive again, but pushing 60, he also seems tragic. One thing that makes him a captivating figure onstage is the tension between his refusal to do material about himself and the sympathy you feel for a craftsman who has not been rewarded in proportion to his talent. At brunch, he cited the ’70s stand-up Robert Klein as saying that when he started, there were 50 stand-ups, and five were funny; suddenly, there were 500 comedians, and five were funny. Macdonald thinks the dynamic Klein described has continued apace, and now the ratio is something like 500,000 to five. He rejected the idea that he was just getting older. “I don’t understand abstract art, but I’m not stupid enough to think it’s worthless,” he said. “I don’t think comedy, though, is that complicated.” Comedy is a fundamentally social form. You can write a novel at home alone, but it’s virtually impossible to develop a stand-up set without an audience. The structure of stand-up is also rigidly proscribed; while narrative comedy can be about anything, stand-up is almost always about one person addressing the audience directly, without costumes or props. When was the last time you saw a lapel mic instead of a hand-held one, much less a duo or a musical act? The combination of strong audience presence and clearly defined expectations in stand-up encourages comics to try to subvert those expectations. This is anti-comedy: a way to succeed not by making people laugh so much as making them think about the form. Macdonald is not an anti-comic. He despises anti-comedy, but that has not stopped people from mistaking his work for it, sometimes to his benefit. In 1992, after touring the clubs of his native Canada for the better part of a decade — including a four-month stint opening for Sam Kinison in 1984 — he moved to Los Angeles. There, he heard from another comic that Dennis Miller liked one of his jokes. Macdonald reached out to Miller, who asked him to submit a packet for his new talk show. Macdonald bought a copy of USA Today and went through it article by article, struggling to come up with topical material. He wound up submitting exactly one joke: “Jeffrey Dahmer went on trial today for murdering and cannibalizing 15 men. But I don’t like his chances after hearing what his defense strategy is going to be: They started it.” Miller hired him, thinking his single-joke packet was, as Macdonald puts it, “some Andy Kaufman move.” He wrote for several episodes, then joined the writers’ room of “Roseanne” after the titular Barr saw him doing stand-up. The next year, he got a call from Lorne Michaels. None of these details appears in Macdonald’s 2016 book, “Based on a True Story: A Memoir” — which, despite its title, is actually a novel. It recasts the events of his life as the exploits of a drug-addled sociopath desperately recycling the same joke about answering machines. (The joke, mentioned repeatedly, is never revealed.) This kind of strategic withholding is a central element of Macdonald’s act. Although he is unmistakably intelligent in real life — Letterman told me he was “maybe the smartest guy in comedy” — he likes to establish a position of ignorance and then lecture his audience from it. Jerry Seinfeld described this approach to me as “sophisticated dumbness” — a technique that makes any glimpse of the real Macdonald feel thrilling. In those rare moments when he chuckles at his own joke or otherwise breaks character, we feel a rush of empathy, as though we have caught the playwright watching from the wings. This awareness of an amused Macdonald lurking behind the deadpan Norm is what animates his forays into meta-comedy — not the smug refusals of anti-comedy, but genuinely funny subversions that exploit what audiences have come to expect from the form. Consider the moth joke. During a now-infamous appearance on “The Tonight Show With Conan O’Brien” in 2009, Macdonald told a long joke about a moth who goes to a podiatrist’s office. He described in dramatic terms the moth’s complaints — from the boss who delighted in exercising power over him, to the aged stranger he once recognized as his wife, to the son that, he feared, he no longer loved. After nearly three minutes of Tolstoyan elaboration, the podiatrist finally says that he sympathizes, but what the moth really needs is a psychiatrist. “Why on earth did you come here?” he asks. The moth answers, “Because the light was on.” After delivering this punch line, Macdonald stared at O’Brien, only just perceptibly smirking, while the audience cheered. The moth joke is not a shaggy-dog story, one of those ambling anecdotes with no point. As anti-comedy, the shaggy-dog story congratulates the audience for being in on the absence of a joke. The moth joke resembles a shaggy-dog story structurally, but its wrenching punch line reveals Macdonald’s mastery of craft. “Because the light was on” is classical. It resolves the tension Macdonald has built up by situating the moth within the dynamics of human psychology and misery, slamming us back into joke territory with a reminder that, actually, it’s just a moth. That’s what makes us laugh, but what makes us cheer is the audacity of telling this joke on network television for three minutes, when you might be expected to use that time to promote your own career. The moth joke rewards a type of person whose lifestyle was not viable 20 years ago: the comedy nerd. Macdonald’s talk-show appearances, previously misremembered as anecdotes or entombed as home VHS recordings, are now collected on YouTube. His 2016 appearance on “Conan,” in which he plugged his book for 30 seconds and spent the next three and a half minutes doing Catskills-style jokes about how his wife was “a real battle-ax,” has over 1.5 million views. Shareable digital archives have allowed casual Norm fans to become cult Norm fans. YouTube also allowed Macdonald to fulfill what seemed like his destiny in narrowcasting with “Norm Macdonald Live,” a video podcast with the co-host Adam Eget that featured guests like Tom Green and Caitlyn Jenner, which he uploaded directly to the site between 2013 and 2017. That podcast became the proof of concept for his new Netflix show. On a set whose sparseness and simple lighting evoke Charlie Rose, Macdonald interviews a single guest each episode. There is no studio audience, although the crew can periodically be heard laughing in the background. The conversational format reveals the friendly autodidact Macdonald has made a career of hiding. “Norm just kind of twinkles, even when he’s not playing the dumb guy,” Letterman told me. “He’s deadly funny, he’s incredibly smart, he’s wildly personable and he’s peculiar.” The program is descriptively titled “Norm Macdonald Has a Show.” It offers to fulfill the promise his book subverted: Here Macdonald will be himself, talking with other celebrities about things that actually happened. There is another way to read that title, though: as fatalistic disillusionment with show business. “My idea was ‘The Latest Show,’ ” Macdonald told me. “That’s a clever little title.” Norm Macdonald has a show, and we all know what happens next. Macdonald and I made plans to eat dinner in Los Angeles on a Saturday night in mid-July. Those plans did not come to fruition. He thought I was coming the following weekend, and he had a bad cold. Any time your subject has a cold, it wrecks the profile. We rescheduled for the next day, planning to drive up to a seafood restaurant in Malibu. This plan, too, went the way of the buffalo. After considering and rejecting a couple more restaurants, he suggested the Daily Grill, a chain restaurant attached to the LAX Hilton. The staff there greeted him with warm familiarity. Macdonald is a creature of habit, and many of those habits are not conducive to the advancement of his career. He doesn’t go to parties. He doesn’t schmooze. He doesn’t drive, which in Los Angeles is like being confined to an iron lung. He used to live in West Hollywood, which made it easy to drop by the Comedy Store for surprise sets. But now he lives in a planned community with his adult son, Dylan, next to the home he bought for his mother. He’s deep in the wad of office parks and car dealerships near LAX and has to take a hundred-dollar Uber to get to the Comedy Store, so he rarely does. By his own admission, he spends a lot of time at home, going down what he calls “rabbit holes” on YouTube or watching sports on television. The night before our dinner, he stayed up until dawn live-tweeting the World Series of Poker. Macdonald’s life seems characterized by routines that shade over into compulsion. He quit drinking as a teenager, after an initial foray into weeklong binges and blackouts. He was a chain smoker before he stopped 10 years ago — stand-up footage from his youth shows the telltale gesture of index and middle fingers toward mouth — and he said that, if he found he had a few cigarettes left in the pack around bedtime, he would stay up to finish it. He seems to love carbohydrates; in his dressing room after the taping, I watched him consume the better part of an economy bag of SweeTart Ropes. At the Daily Grill, he ate a heroic amount of bread before telling me he would have done “Weekend Update” forever. “I told Lorne I would hire on like Walter Cronkite, and just take the money as it exists, and never ask for a raise, and just do it until I was 65,” he said. He paused a moment before adding, “He didn’t like that idea.” As our pasta arrived, Macdonald said he rejects the O.J. hypothesis and has come to believe that he was fired for his material. “We were doing experimental stuff, non sequiturs,” he said. “Ohlmeyer would watch Leno kill every night for 15 minutes. Every joke, huge laughs, and then I’d do 10 minutes a week and sometimes not get laughs.” At that time, “S.N.L.” was at a critical and popular nadir — Macdonald told me of watching in astonishment as the live audience booed the final installment of the “It’s Pat” sketch — and the “Update” writers were trying to break out of it. He hired Frank Sebastiano, a delivery man who had submitted hundreds of handwritten jokes along with his packages, whom Hoekstra credits with the blunt tone “Update” developed during Macdonald’s tenure. (After Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley filed for divorce: “According to friends, the two were never a good match. She’s more of a stay-at-home type, and he’s more of a homosexual pedophile.”) Such acerbic jokes felt increasingly at odds with the rest of the show, which was moving toward silly sketches like Cheri Oteri’s cheerleaders and Chris Kattan’s Mango. Macdonald often skipped the curtain call, he said, because it made him feel foolish. “When I got ‘Update,’ I’d just leave right after ‘Update,’ ” he told me. How did the rest of the cast feel about that? “Eh,” he said, “not great.” He rarely attended the show’s famous cast parties, either. Instead, he would take the studio-provided limo to Atlantic City and play craps. A six-figure win on one of these trips changed his relationship to gambling forever. Instead of cashing out, he took the chips home in a paper bag and stashed them in his refrigerator. He couldn’t go back to playing $25 craps after that. Macdonald has had long runs of compulsive betting on poker, craps, blackjack and sports book. Although he spoke candidly about his tendency to gamble in problematic ways, he hasn’t quit. At one point he went to Gamblers Anonymous, but he said listening to all those stories about gambling only made him want to gamble more. As the check arrived, he talked about other people’s tales of hitting bottom, losing their houses or their children’s college funds. “I never got close to that,” he said. “So you never went broke?” I asked. “No, I did go broke,” he said immediately. “But I always had a job, so it was different.” It is tempting to conclude from this kind of statement that Macdonald is sad. When he says he doesn’t care about money, it must be a mechanism to defend himself from regret over his gambling losses — because who wouldn’t regret that? Likewise, when he laments the state of contemporary comedy, it is easy to assume he is lamenting the state of his own career. But to make these judgments is to succumb to the fallacy that he values what most people value. Maybe Macdonald really is just in it for the jokes and the admiration of his peers, and what looks by other standards like a series of disappointments is, to him, success enough. After dinner, Macdonald and I joined Hoekstra and five friends at the Hollywood Park Casino, where he had reserved a dealer for a single-table tournament in Texas Hold ’Em. Macdonald played well, and in the end he and Gabe Veltri — a former sound engineer who recorded Adam Sandler’s comedy albums before he quit to play poker full time — agreed to split the prizes for first and second place. Macdonald still insisted on counting out their chips, though, to see who was ahead; his stack exceeded Veltri’s by less than 10 percent. It was after 1 in the morning, but Macdonald was amped up. As we drove back to his place, he talked about the Henny Youngman one-liner “Take my wife, please.” Youngman delivered this joke without a pause before the last word, which, Macdonald pointed out, does not make sense. The terminal “please” is funny because it shifts the meaning of “take my wife [for example]” to “take my wife [away from me.]” He wondered whether Youngman intentionally removed the pause to further increase the efficiency of an already stunningly economical joke, or if it became so popular he delivered it as a catchphrase. The latter possibility seemed tragic to him, a joke’s equivalent of death. We stopped in front of his condo, where Macdonald opened the door, put one foot on the curb and talked to me for the next 90 minutes. He talked about how bewildered he felt when he heard that Mo’Nique got $10 million for a Netflix special — a rumor that the actor and comedian debunked only recently — when he was paid a fraction of that. He discussed the galling experience of being asked to “audition” for his own comedy special — “Hitler’s Dog, Gossip and Trickery,” released last year — by having content executives attend one of his performances. (Netflix initially passed on the special, only to reverse its decision later.) He talked about his desire to overcome these kinds of attachments, and the satisfaction he found in working on his next book, a 600-page straight novel that he plans to publish under a pen name. The process was maddeningly difficult, but he liked the way it organized his days. “If I can not watch sports and not gamble, so much time opens up,” he said. At 58, he said, he was having the disturbing experience of recognizing some of his own opinions as the thinking of an old man. There were new ideas about gender identity that he knew were right but couldn’t quite get his head around. He recounted what Dylan said to him when he broached this subject: “Why do you always need to feel you understand things?” The question had set him thinking, and he related it to me with a father’s uninhibited pride. Many of these remarks he prefaced with the caveat that he knew he shouldn’t say them in front of a reporter. He couldn’t help it, though; he seemed compelled to speak honestly, the way he once felt compelled to finish a pack of cigarettes at bedtime. He even talked about politics. Mostly, though, he talked about his desire to transcend such things — current events, popular wisdom, even the quotidian details of his own life — to operate in the realm of the pure joke, one that’s still funny 100 years from now. “Making people laugh is a gift,” he said. “Preaching to them is not a gift. There are people who can do that better.” His eyes seemed to glimmer in the light from the dashboard before he completed the thought: “Preachers.”",The New York Times
2018,Norman Seabrook Guilty of Bribery in Trial That Cast Shadow Over De Blasio,"Norman Seabrook, the once-powerful former leader of the New York City correction officers’ union, was found guilty of bribery and conspiracy on Wednesday in a case that cast a shadow over Mayor Bill de Blasio’s fund-raising efforts and touched on corruption in the New York Police Department. The jurors returned a partial verdict in the afternoon. They found Mr. Seabrook guilty of accepting a bribe but said they were deadlocked on a conspiracy charge. “Your job is not done yet,” said Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who presided over the case. “You have another count to consider.” An hour later, the jurors returned to say they had found Mr. Seabrook guilty of conspiracy to take a bribe as well. Prosecutors presented evidence that Mr. Seabrook, 58, had steered $20 million of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association money into a risky hedge fund in exchange for a kickback potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It was the second time a jury heard evidence: His first trial ended in a mistrial last fall. When the first guilty verdict was announced, some of Mr. Seabrook’s supporters began to cry. One woman shook her head and began to pray; a man held his face in his hands. “Don’t cry, baby,” Mr. Seabrook said to a supporter in the front row. The verdict represented a remarkable fall from grace for Mr. Seabrook, who wielded significant power during the two decades he spent as the head of one of the most important public-employee unions in the city, with more than 20,000 members. He established himself as a blunt advocate for the city jail system’s rank and file and an unflinching defender of Rikers Island. He was a master at using both charm and hostility to get his way in negotiations, and under his leadership, the city’s correction officers saw large gains in their salaries and pension benefits. At the same time, he accrued power and wealth, often outflanking mayors and correction commissioners in his influence. As he left the courthouse on Wednesday, a cigar in his mouth, he faced up to 20 years in prison for convictions on one count of honest services wire fraud — or bribery — and one count of conspiracy. “I will be vindicated because God is still on the throne,” he said. Much of the government’s case rested on the word of Jona Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate developer who both sides agreed was a prodigious liar with an unsavory history. “We are not asking you to like Jona Rechnitz,” a prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, told the jury at the beginning of the trial. Still, the government relied on Mr. Rechnitz’s testimony to build a narrative that ultimately led to Mr. Seabrook’s conviction. Mr. Rechnitz, who pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy and is cooperating with the government, said he brokered a deal between Mr. Seabrook and Murray Huberfeld, a family friend and the founder of the hedge fund Platinum Partners. Mr. Seabrook agreed to invest the union’s retirement money in Mr. Huberfeld’s fund, and in exchange, Mr. Huberfeld would pay him a cut of the profit, the government said. Mr. Seabrook ended up investing $20 million in the fund, $19 million of which the union eventually lost. It was a risky proposition for the prosecution to once again depend on Mr. Rechnitz, whose inconsistent testimony in the last trial seemed to lead to the hung jury. A juror in the fall referred to him as a “straight-up liar.” The government said that the bribe was delivered in a nearly cinematic scene: One December evening, Mr. Rechnitz took $60,000 in cash from a safe in his office and crammed the bills into a handbag he had purchased from the Salvatore Ferragamo store, Mr. Seabrook’s favorite designer. He then delivered the bag to Mr. Seabrook before they attended a Torah dedication ceremony together. Mr. Huberfeld, who was Mr. Seabrook’s co-defendant in the first trial, pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy in May. In this trial, Mr. Rechnitz was caught in fewer inconsistencies on the stand, and he seemed more prepared to answer the defense’s questions. He also spent less time talking about his relationship with Mr. de Blasio, testimony that dominated much of the first trial. At that time, he said he had donated tens of thousands of dollars to Mr. de Blasio’s re-election campaign in exchange for a direct line to City Hall, including the mayor’s personal phone number and email address. During the second trial, prosecutors kept Mr. Rechnitz’s testimony more narrowly focused on his shady business dealings and on the payment to Mr. Seabrook. The defense argued that Mr. Rechnitz would say whatever he thought would help him get a more lenient sentence for his own crime. It was true, they said, that Mr. Rechnitz had showered Mr. Seabrook with expensive trips, fine cigars, fancy meals and flattery. But Mr. Seabrook did not betray his union in response. “You can fault Norman Seabrook for falling for Jona Rechnitz’s act,” said Paul Shechtman, Mr. Seabrook’s lawyer. “But boy, was it a good act.” A few jurors wiped away tears as they left the federal courthouse. One said the verdict had been “emotionally raw.” Richard Wade, a juror, said the panel had found Mr. Rechnitz credible. “The look in his eyes said that he was broken,” Mr. Wade said. After the trial concluded, Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, spoke in front of the courthouse, flanked by the prosecutors on the case. “As long as there are public servants who place self-interest ahead of the people they are sworn to serve, public corruption will remain a top priority for our office,” he said. Mr. Seabrook, who had appeared to be in good spirits throughout the trial, sometimes invoking his trust in God with reporters, left the courtroom and, ever a politician, shook hands with Mr. Berman, congratulating him on his recent promotion. “Look, I’m innocent,” he said a few minutes later. He noted Mr. de Blasio himself had called Mr. Rechnitz a liar. “I feel disappointed, especially knowing that I did nothing wrong,” he said. “There will definitely be an appeal,” Mr. Shechtman said. “Mr. Seabrook has fought these charges for two years, and I don’t expect him to stop fighting now.”",The New York Times
2018,North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Gerrymandered Congressional Map. Again.,"A panel of three federal judges again declared North Carolina’s congressional district map to be unconstitutional, ruling on Monday that it was gerrymandered to unfairly favor Republican candidates. The decision, which may have significant implications for control of Congress after the midterm elections, is likely to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which for the moment is evenly split on ideological lines without a ninth justice to tip the balance. Though North Carolina’s voters tend to divide about evenly between the two parties, Republicans currently hold 10 of the state’s 13 House seats. A redrawn district map may put more of the seats within Democrats’ reach. The three judges had ruled unanimously in January that the state’s House map violated the First and 14th Amendments by unfairly giving one group of voters — Republicans — a bigger voice than others in choosing representatives. But the Supreme Court declined in June to hear an appeal in the case, sending it back for reconsideration under guidelines it had set out in a different case about who had legal standing to challenge the map. In a lengthy ruling on Monday, the panel reached largely the same conclusion that it had in January. And the judges agreed that the plaintiffs in the case — voting-rights advocacy groups and residents of each of North Carolina’s 13 districts — had standing to bring the suit. The judges left open the possibility that they could order new maps to be drawn before the 2018 election, either by the North Carolina General Assembly or by a special master appointed by the court. The ruling sets up a delicate tactical question for the Supreme Court, which has never ruled a partisan gerrymander to be unconstitutional, passing up three separate opportunities to do so in its last term. With the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy at the end of July, the court is now divided between four conservatives who have expressed skepticism about the court’s ability to tinker with political maps, and four more liberal justices who have argued that it has that ability. A 4-to-4 vote would leave the lower court’s ruling intact. The swing vote on the issue would probably be Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whom many voting-rights advocates see as the only prospect on the court — and a slim one, at that — for a fifth vote to outlaw partisan gerrymanders. Of the welter of cases on the issue that have moved through the federal courts in recent years, the North Carolina case is perhaps the starkest. The state’s Republican-dominated legislature redrew the House map in 2016 under orders from a different federal court, which had ruled that some districts drawn in 2011 were racially gerrymandered, a practice the Supreme Court has already ruled unconstitutional. The 2011 map had turned a 7-to-6 Democratic edge in the state’s House delegation to a 9-to-4 Republican one. The redrawn map in 2016 — the one at issue now — produced a 10-to-3 ratio, but the legislature explicitly said that it had been drawn not to disadvantage minority groups, but to hurt Democrats. “I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats,” David R. Lewis, a North Carolina state representative who helped lead the remapping, said in 2016. The three-judge panel ruled in January, though, that the change in motive did not make the map acceptable. It found that the legislature’s intent was “to ‘subordinate’ the interests of non-Republican voters and ‘entrench’ Republican domination of the state’s congressional delegation,” a view they reaffirmed on Monday. The chief author of the panel’s latest opinion, Judge James J. Wynn of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, said the legislature’s “invidious partisanship runs contrary to the Constitution’s vesting of the power to elect representatives in ‘the people.’” The three judges left open, for the moment, what would happen next. They gave the parties in the case until the end of this month to file briefs on whether the court should allow the existing map to be used one more time, in the midterm election, or should order that it be redrawn by mid-September. With the election less than three months distant, Judge Wynn noted, a court normally would allow one more use of the old map, so as not to disrupt election preparations, especially since North Carolina has already held primaries for the races. But the state’s election plans are already frozen by another bitter court battle, this one over Republican lawmakers’ efforts to place six state constitutional amendments on the November ballot. Among other things, those measures would strip the state’s Democratic governor of some powers to appoint judges and would allow the legislature to devise a new voter ID law to replace one struck down in the courts, which ruled it an effort to depress minority voting. It was conceivable, Judge Wynn wrote, that the state could hold a fresh primary election for House seats in November using a new map, and then conduct a special election to choose the delegation before the next Congress convenes in January 2019. He also raised the possibility of forgoing primaries, as the state does with some other offices. The ruling promised to further roil the political scene in a state with one of the deepest partisan divides in the nation, and where both liberals and conservatives receive support from well-financed national groups. Redistricting has been contentious in North Carolina for decades. In the years before 2010 when Democrats controlled the General Assembly, the Democratic-drawn boundaries were regularly challenged by Republicans, by critics of gerrymandering and by the Justice Department, which deemed some of their plans to be in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Since the Republicans took control in 2010, their legislative boundary maps have prompted numerous court challenges from Democrats and advocacy groups. Registered Democrats actually outnumber Republicans in the state by a significant margin, though many of those Democrats are conservatives who have tended to vote Republican in recent years. President Trump carried the state by about 3.7 percentage points in 2016. With this week’s ruling, North Carolina now faces the possibility that its House delegation will be more evenly split, but it also faces the possibility of electoral chaos, according to Gerry Cohen, who worked for more than three decades as the director of bill drafting for the General Assembly. If changes are made this year, Mr. Cohen said, significant bureaucratic miracles will have to be performed to meet a deadline of Sept. 22 for mailing absentee ballots to voters in the military and overseas. Imagine it, Mr. Cohen said: New districts will have to be drawn. The courts — and perhaps the Supreme Court — will need time to rule on them. A filing period for candidates will have to open and close. The state will have to update its rolls to assign millions of voters to their new districts. And ballots will have to be printed. All before Sept. 22. “I’m very sympathetic to the plaintiffs here, but it would be insane,” Mr. Cohen said, to try to meet that timetable. He said that while the ruling could eventually help Democrats, it also introduces new political questions. If the next delegation is chosen in a special election in early 2019, as the court suggested may be an option, Democrats may struggle to turn out voters, as they historically have in special elections. Alternatively, if the seats are filled in open races without a primary, numerous candidates could be on the ballot from the same party, splitting the vote. Though the state’s existing map was drawn aggressively to protect Republican incumbents, rising liberal opposition to President Trump and the emergence of several strong Democratic candidates already have some House Republicans on the defensive. Representatives Ted Budd and George Holding, for example, were facing closely contested races, and Democrats were even better positioned to capture a Charlotte-to-Fayetteville seat after the Republican incumbent, Robert Pittenger, lost his primary earlier this year to a lightly funded opponent. Under a new, less Republican-friendly map, more seats could become competitive, especially in Charlotte and the Research Triangle, the state’s main population centers, where the current boundaries tend to minimize the voting impact of African-Americans and white liberals. An earlier version of this article misstated the usual number of Supreme Court justices whose assent is required for the court to hear a case. It is four, not five.",The New York Times
2018,North Korea Presses Demand for End of War Amid Talk of Pompeo Visit,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea pressed its demand on Friday that the United States agree to declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, as South Korea’s leader indicated that the American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was preparing for his fourth visit to the North. Mr. Pompeo, the point man in President Trump’s efforts to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, has been struggling to follow up on the agreement reached between Mr. Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, when they met in Singapore in June in the first summit meeting between their nations. In Singapore, Mr. Kim committed to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But the summit agreement lacked details on how to achieve that goal, and Mr. Pompeo and his team of negotiators has strained since then to win concrete action on this front from their North Korean counterparts. When he met with representatives of political parties in Seoul on Thursday, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said that negotiations between the United States and North Korea have recently gained “speed,” with Mr. Pompeo planning to visit North Korea again, according to Yun So-ha, an opposition leader, who briefed reporters on the meeting. On Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said his team was “continuing to make progress” with the North Koreans, and said he hoped that “we can make a big step here before too long.” “We’re continuing to engage in conversation with them about a path forward to a brighter future for the North Koreans,” Mr. Pompeo said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. He also commended the North for not conducting any nuclear or missile tests since late last year. Mr. Pompeo first met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Easter weekend and again in May to help prepare for Mr. Trump’s summit with Mr. Kim. He again visited Pyongyang last month to urge North Korea to carry out the Singapore summit deal by moving quickly toward denuclearization, but notably failed to meet with Mr. Kim. At the end of this visit, North Korea called his demands for denuclearization “gangster-like.” The State Department has yet to announce whether and when Mr. Pompeo planned to visit North Korea again. But South Korean officials have said that Mr. Moon has scheduled his own visit to Pyongyang in September to discuss improving inter-Korean relations with Mr. Kim after Mr. Pompeo’s fourth trip to the North. On Wednesday, Mr. Moon proposed a bold expansion of economic cooperation with North Korea, including reconnecting the rail systems of the two Koreas, should the North denuclearize. The latest hitch in negotiations has been over North Korea’s demand that the United States join the two Koreas in declaring an end to the Korean War. The conflict was halted with an armistice that was signed in 1953, but for decades the North has demanded that the United States negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the war. Recently, it has renewed its push for a political statement in which the two Koreas and the United States — and perhaps, China too — jointly declare an end to the war, as a prelude to complex negotiations for replacing the armistice with a peace treaty. Mr. Moon supports the proposal, arguing that such a statement will help ease tensions and encourage North Korea to denuclearize. When he met with Mr. Kim in April for their first summit, the two Korean leaders agreed to push for such a declaration this year. But United States officials fear that North Korea may be seeking such a declaration to undermine the rationale for the United States military presence in South Korea without getting any commitment by Pyongyang to relinquish its nuclear weapons. They insist that North Korea take meaningful steps toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program before Washington makes any such concessions. But the North has pushed back. “There is no reason to ignore a declaration to end the war,” said a commentary in the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea’s main state-run newspaper, on Friday. “It is a preliminary and essential process to pave the ground for easing tensions and building permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.” The North’s government, state-run news media and propaganda websites have issued a steady stream of similar statements in recent weeks, indicating that the declaration of an end to the war was the North’s latest negotiating goal. When Mr. Pompeo visited Pyongyang in early July to seek more concrete steps toward denuclearization, North Korea indicated that it was willing to take steps in exchange for the end-to-the-war declaration. One of the first things North Korea should do is to declare all its nuclear weapons-related facilities, United States officials say. North Korea insists that it will move toward the complete denuclearization of the peninsula only in phases and will do so only if Washington matches them with corresponding measures to improve ties and provide security guarantees for the North. “The United States must implement phased and simultaneous measures, like the end-of-war declaration, to build mutual trust,” the Rodong commentary said.",The New York Times
2018,North Korea to Expel Japanese Tourist Accused of Crime,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has decided to expel a Japanese man accused of committing a crime while visiting the isolated country on a tourist visa, the country’s state media reported. The man, Tomoyuki Sugimoto, has been held in North Korea for an investigation of “his crime against the law,” the Korean Central News Agency said in a brief dispatch late Sunday. It did not provide details of the alleged crime. But it said the North Korean authorities had decided to “leniently condone him and expel him” from North Korea “on the principle of humanitarianism.” Japan’s Kyodo News agency reported earlier that a Japanese videographer on a group tour appeared to have been detained in North Korea after shooting footage of a military facility while visiting Nampo, a port city south of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Japan and North Korea have been in talks on and off over Tokyo’s demand that the North return Japanese citizens said to have been kidnapped by the North during the 1970s and 1980s. The so-called abductees issue remains the thorniest matter dividing the neighboring countries. North Korea has a history of holding foreigners accused of committing vague “crimes against the state,” and releasing them only after high-ranking officials or dignitaries visit Pyongyang to seek their freedom. North Korea released three Korean-Americans, including one sentenced to 10 years of hard labor for an espionage conviction, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang in May. Early this month, it released a South Korean citizen who had been detained in the North since last month. The releases came amid a political thaw on the Korean Peninsula that began early this year when the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, began negotiations with South Korea and the United States on improving ties and denuclearizing the peninsula.",The New York Times
2018,"North Korea, Indonesia, Venezuela: Your Monday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A harrumph from North Korea, an earthquake in Indonesia, and exploding drones in Venezuela. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea is accusing the U.S. of failing to live up to its end of their nuclear bargain. At the Asean security forum in Singapore over the weekend, Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the North’s concessions, like dismantling a missile engine test site, had brought nothing from Washington. That was after Mr. Ri had a cordial, if brief, encounter with the U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, above. Mr. Pompeo is now heading back to the U.S., after finishing his Asia tour in Indonesia. And our reporter dug into a supposed mass defection of North Korean waitresses to South Korea and found a tale of lies, blackmail and betrayal. _____ • Eighty-two dead. That’s the toll, as of this writing, from a powerful earthquake that struck off the coast of the Indonesian resort island of Lombok near Bali on Sunday evening. Above, the aftermath at a Bali hospital. The quake, magnitude 7.0, sent panicked residents and tourists fleeing to safety on both Lombok and Bali. It was followed by a 5.6 aftershock and a tsunami warning, which was later lifted. Just days before, on July 29, an earthquake struck around the same area, killing 17 people. _____ • “Cracks appeared in the official story line.” That was our reporter’s observation on a government-led trip for journalists in northern Rakhine State, in Myanmar. They met with a group of Rohingya Muslims, who the government said had been repatriated. But the supposed returnees told our reporter that they had never left Myanmar. The government spun other stories: that the Rohingya were terrorists or else their pawns, and that, rather than being the victims of what much of the world has called ethnic cleansing, they had burned down their own homes. _____ • President Trump found a new target on Twitter, insulting the intelligence of the basketball star LeBron James, above, among others. Was there a quiet rebuke from his wife? Her spokeswoman issued a statement saying that Melania Trump was open to visiting Mr. James’s new school for disadvantaged children in Ohio. In another tweet, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his campaign aides had held a Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer to “get information on an opponent” — contradicting a statement he dictated last year. Mr. Trump’s proclamations on matters like Russia, North Korea and Iran have created two foreign policies: his administration’s, and his own. And we unspooled the many connections between prominent Republicans and Maria Butina, a Russian woman charged with waging an illegal influence campaign within the National Rifle Association and beyond. _____ • The Australian government is taking a harsher new line against major banks’ and insurers’ stranglehold on consumers. A government report issued found that the country’s four largest banks controlled more than 75 percent of the country’s lending, deposit and credit card businesses, and that the insurance industry was even more concentrated. Treasurer Scott Morrison urged transparency and outside competition, but some experts see little hope without the threat of large penalties. “I suspect we’re going to end up with no major change,” said an economist who wrote a book about Australian banking. (The title? “Game of Mates.”) _____ • China countered U.S. threats of sharply increasing import tariffs by threatening to levy its own taxes on an additional $60 billion a year worth of U.S. imports. • Iran will try to bolster its currency with new measures on Monday, as U.S. sanctions are reimposed. • More Australians are having to reach into savings to make ends meet, a new survey has found. • “Mission Impossible — Fallout,” the sixth film in Tom Cruise’s action series, has taken in $330 million worldwide as of its second weekend.

Lady Gaga, in whose “Born This Way” music video he made a star turn, said the cause was suicide. Hercule Poirot was fictional, but an obituary for Agatha Christie’s famous Belgian detective nevertheless appeared on the front page of The Times on this day in 1975. Poirot, fastidious and impeccably dressed, made his debut in 1920 in Christie’s “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” and appeared in more than 30 novels by the British mystery writer. But “at the end of his life, he was arthritic and had a bad heart,” according to the obituary, which ran the month before Poirot’s final appearance, in “Curtain.” Above, the British actor David Suchet took on the role for TV. Although “Curtain” was published in 1975, Christie wrote the book during World War II as a gift for her daughter in the event that Christie did not survive the bombings in London. The book — as well as one featuring her other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple — were locked away for more than 30 years. Christie died in 1976, and received her own front-page obit in The Times. With a prolific output and global appeal, she remains at the top of Unesco’s list of the world’s most translated authors. It’s hard to pinpoint why Poirot’s death got such prominent treatment in 1975. “There’s a deep psychological level to Christie’s work,” Mark Aldridge, the author of the book “Agatha Christie on Screen,” said in an interview last year. “You can watch a film of her work purely for the plot, but you can also watch it for insights into the characters and the human conditions.” Claire Moses wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"North Korea, Russia, Samsung: Your Friday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A close look at the global heat wave, a deadly airstrike in Yemen and a gender milestone for the U.S. Marines. Here’s what you need to know: • The world is getting hotter, faster. Globally, this is shaping up to be fourth-hottest year on record — the only years hotter were the three previous ones. The devastating effects have been felt from California to Greece to Japan. Above, air-conditioners in New Delhi. And it’s too early to call it the new normal: Temperatures are still rising, and, so far, efforts to tame the heat have failed. On the horizon is a future of cascading system failures threatening basic necessities like food supply and electricity. “It’s not a wake-up call anymore,” a climate expert said. “It’s now absolutely happening to millions of people around the world.” _____ • Pre-emptive diplomacy. The Times has learned that senior U.S. national security officials, seeking to prevent President Trump from upending a formal policy agreement at last month’s NATO meeting in Brussels, pushed the military alliance’s ambassadors to complete it before the forum even began. The rushed machinations to get the policy done, as demanded by John Bolton, the national security adviser, came just weeks after Mr. Trump refused to sign off on a communiqué from the June meeting of the Group of 7 in Canada. _____ • In recent years, millions of ordinary investors across China have plowed their savings into online financial products that promised big profits with little risk. But the sudden collapse of hundreds of these peer-to-peer lenders in recent months has prompted a panic, leaving many investors with little information and little way to get their money back. For Chinese officials, the situation is quickly becoming political. Thousands of investors plotted a big protest in Beijing this week, but the Chinese authorities all but quashed it, above. _____ • Senior officials from North and South Korea will meet on Monday in Panmunjom, above, on their border, to discuss the possibility of a third summit meeting this year between their leaders, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in.

The move comes as South Koreans are coping with a changing U.S. military presence — one no longer seen as immutable.

2018,North Korean State Media Denounce U.S. as Diplomacy Stalls,"WASHINGTON — North Korean state media criticized the United States over the weekend for “extremely provocative and dangerous military moves” in Pacific waters and warned that the diplomacy forged between the two countries’ leaders during their Singapore summit meeting in June could be in jeopardy. The belligerent articles were the first official comments from North Korea since a frustrated President Trump announced on Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was canceling his most recent plan to travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr. Trump’s announcement, made in a series of tweets, was the first acknowledgment by the American president that the diplomatic process with North Korea had stalled. He said the United States had not been making “sufficient progress” on getting North Korea to halt or dismantle its nuclear weapons program, and blamed China for the slow progress. Some American officials and analysts in Beijing, however, have said China generally has adhered to an American-led economic sanctions plan against North Korea. On Sunday, the Korean Central News Agency, the official state news agency of the government in Pyongyang, reported that American “special units” had flown 1,200 kilometers, or about 745 miles, to the Philippines over Pacific waters. It described the exercise as preparing for an “infiltration into Pyongyang,” which could be done with a “change of direction.” The report also said the U.S.S. Michigan, a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, had transported units of Green Berets, Delta Force and other elite soldiers in late July or early August from Okinawa, Japan, to a naval base in South Korea. The news agency cited South Korean radio as its source, not any independent evidence. The Pentagon generally does not comment on operations of its special units. In a statement on Monday, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo spoke last week with the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, and the two diplomats “agreed that pressure must continue” until Pyongyang dismantles its nuclear weapons program. Mr. Pompeo also appointed a special envoy, Stephen E. Biegun, last week to oversee diplomacy with North Korea. At his June meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Trump promised to cancel military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which surprised both the Pentagon and the South Korean government. Since then, large exercises between the two allied nations have been put on hold. The United States maintains about 28,500 troops in South Korea. The Pyongyang news report did not provide details on the American military moves that North Korea was asserting had taken place. It appeared to lay the foundation for blaming stalled diplomacy on American officials by accusing them of reneging on promises made at the summit meeting. The news agency cited a Sunday commentary in Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the central committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, that said the “extremely provocative and dangerous military moves” would “mar the hard-won atmosphere of the peace on the Korean Peninsula” and the dialogue and agreements that had come out of the summit meeting. The commentary said that “such acts prove that the U.S. is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war” against North Korea and “commit a crime which deserves merciless divine punishment.” It also said the United States had “double-dealing attitudes” and was trying to engage in diplomacy with “a smile on its face” while conducting military drills with special units. Right after the summit meeting, Mr. Trump said that North Korea was on the path to “denuclearization” and that the nuclear threat had abated. In fact, North Korea never agreed to a process to get rid of its nuclear weapons, and experts estimate that it has as many as 60 warheads. It also has been developing a ballistic missile that can deliver a warhead to the mainland United States. North Korean officials want the United States to first support a peace declaration that will bring a formal end to the Korean War, which began in 1950. The South Korean government has also said this should be a priority. “Perhaps we’re starting to see the frustration in the White House over being played on these grandiose promises of denuclearization that the North Koreans do not intend to fulfill until they get everything they need, and want, from the United States in return,” said Jean H. Lee, director of the Wilson Center’s center on Korean history and public policy. Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the South Korean foreign minister. Kang Kyung-wha is a woman, not a man.",The New York Times
2018,North and South Korea Agree to Summit on Dismantling Weapons,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will visit Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, next month to hold his third summit meeting with that country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, South Korean officials said Monday. A joint statement, released on Monday after a meeting of senior officials from North and South Korea, did not specify a date for the visit. It was unclear whether the North Koreans asked Mr. Moon to visit Pyongyang in time for the country’s annual national day celebration on Sept. 9. This year, North Korea is commemorating the 70th anniversary of its founding as a communist state, and it has been trying to invite foreign dignitaries to the country for the occasion. Last week, the North’s Foreign Ministry accused Washington of telling other countries not to send high-level delegations to the celebrations in Pyongyang, which could include a large-scale military parade. No sitting South Korean leader has attended the North Korean anniversary. Mr. Moon will be the third South Korean president to visit Pyongyang. Two former presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, met with Mr. Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, respectively. Mr. Moon has inherited those leaders’ policies of promoting political reconciliation between the two countries. Mr. Moon has already met twice with Mr. Kim this year, in April and in May. Both those meetings took place in Panmunjom, a village straddling the highly fortified border. During their April 27 meeting, which was the first time Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon met, they agreed that Mr. Moon would visit Pyongyang in the fall. South Korean officials have recently suggested the possibility of a third meeting this year, in the hopes of breaking an impasse between North Korea and the United States over the dismantling of the North’s nuclear arms program. In April, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon reached a broad agreement on easing military tensions and improving their countries’ ties. That meeting, and their second meeting at Panmunjom, which was held on May 26, helped to lay the groundwork for Mr. Kim’s landmark talks with President Trump on June 12 in Singapore, the first time sitting leaders of the United States and North Korea have met. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim signed a joint statement at that meeting in which Mr. Kim committed to work toward “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Mr. Trump promised to provide the North with security guarantees and to help build “new” bilateral relations. But the statement included no specifics on how denuclearization would be achieved, and both sides have since expressed frustration with the other. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang to urge the country to take concrete steps toward denuclearization, including disclosing an inventory of its nuclear weapons and facilities, and dismantling some of them. But North Korea later called the Trump administration’s behavior “gangster-like,” accusing Washington of demanding a “unilateral” denuclearization while offering little in return. North Korea has recently demanded that South Korea and the United States declare an end to the Korean War, as a prelude to negotiating a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that halted the fighting 65 years ago. During their April meeting, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon agreed to push for such a declaration by the end of this year. Pyongyang insists that Washington make the North Koreans feel safe before expecting them to give up their nuclear weapons. It says that by declaring an end to the Korean War, Washington can demonstrate that it is moving away from its hostility toward the North. But American officials have been reluctant to grant such a highly symbolic concession before the North takes more meaningful steps toward denuclearization. South Korean officials are trying to help the two sides find common ground.",The New York Times
2018,North and South Korea to Discuss Plans for a 3rd Summit,"SEOUL, South Korea — Senior officials from North and South Korea will meet next week to discuss the possibility of a third summit meeting between their countries’ leaders, the South said on Thursday. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of the South have already met twice this year, in April and in May. South Korean officials have recently expressed interest in holding a third meeting soon, in hopes of breaking an impasse between North Korea and the United States over the dismantling of the North’s nuclear arms program. Mr. Moon has accepted an invitation from Mr. Kim to visit Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in the fall. But no date has been set, and it is unclear whether the proposed third summit would be held there. A meeting at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village on the inter-Korean border where the previous talks were held, would take much less time to arrange. The South’s Unification Ministry said on Thursday that North Korea had proposed holding ministerial-level talks at Panmunjom on Monday to discuss preparations for another summit meeting, and that South Korea had quickly accepted the offer. At their April 27 meeting, which was the first time Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon met, the two reached a broad agreement on easing military tensions and improving their countries’ ties. They also said that “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula was a shared goal. That meeting, and the one that followed at Panmunjom on May 26, helped to lay the groundwork for Mr. Kim’s historic talks with President Trump on June 12 in Singapore, the first time sitting leaders of the United States and North Korea ever met. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim signed a joint statement in which Mr. Kim again committed to work toward “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Mr. Trump promised to provide the North with security guarantees and to help build “new” bilateral relations.

North Korea called the Trump administration’s behavior “gangster-like” last month after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang, where he urged the country to take concrete steps toward denuclearization, like handing over an inventory of its nuclear weapons and facilities, and dismantling some of them. The United States and South Korea canceled their joint annual military exercises this year, in hopes of encouraging North Korea to denuclearize. But last week, speaking at a regional forum, the North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho said the United States was not doing enough, while his country had halted nuclear and missile tests, demolished an underground nuclear test site and started dismantling a missile engine test site. He reiterated that the two countries should take “simultaneous actions and phased steps,” meaning that the United States should match such moves by the North with concessions of its own. North Korea has recently demanded that the two countries jointly declare an end to the Korean War, as a prelude to negotiating a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that halted the fighting 65 years ago. During their April meeting, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon agreed to push for such a declaration by the end of this year. But American officials have been reluctant to grant such a highly symbolic concession to the North before the country takes more meaningful steps toward denuclearization. For its part, North Korea considers such a declaration essential to showing that the United States is no longer hostile toward the North, analysts said.",The New York Times
2018,"Northern Rivers Is a Breezy, Ex-Hippie Wonderland for Australian Chefs","Australia fare: Critic’s notebook The appealing landscape and beaches have attracted young, talented restaurateurs and the ‘boho-chic’ set. Astrid McCormack tells a story about one of the first meals she served at her restaurant Fleet in Brunswick Heads, New South Wales: It was 2015, and Ms. McCormack and her partner, the chef Josh Lewis, had just opened on a quiet stretch of the town’s small business district. At the end of service, a local customer said to Ms. McCormack, “Thank you, everything about this was so wonderful. There goes Brunswick Heads.” That early prediction turned out to be correct. In the three years since Fleet opened, the town has changed tremendously. I’ve been visiting for over a decade thanks to my father, who lives in the area, and the transformation is drastic. The retail strip that used to be home to a few small businesses is now buzzing with boutiques and cafes; the streets that used to feel sleepy are now often thick with wandering tourists. Fleet also foreshadowed an influx of ambitious young restaurateurs to the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, just south of the Queensland border. It’s a stunningly beautiful part of the world, a not-quite-tropical lush hinterland that catches the rain and cradles a cobalt coastline. The best-known town is Byron Bay, and its cape is Australia’s easternmost point. The area has long been a magnet for surfers and hippies, but in the past decade — as the term “boho-chic” has emerged as a moneyed alternative to its scruffier precursors — Byron has transformed. It is now a place where movie stars own homes and $300 caftans are the new norm, alongside crystals and patchouli. For a talented chef, the allure of Byron is obvious. The influx of money, brought by people looking for a certain beachy lifestyle guided by good taste, is sure to provide a decent customer base, as is the beach tourism and the many music and cultural festivals held in the area. But Byron itself is at a crossroads, one in which the property values have skyrocketed while the infrastructure falters under the town’s growing popularity. It’s as if Byron skipped over the part in its evolution where it was exciting enough to draw inventive operators but affordable enough to create opportunity for those people. And so, a few enterprising people took a bet on the small towns surrounding Byron. This pioneering spirit has resulted in rapid gentrification. It has also created a thriving dining scene that’s one of the Australia’s most interesting and fertile, rivaled only by Tasmania’s. Ms. McCormack and Mr. Lewis, who moved to the area together, realized that their dream of a small, self-funded restaurant would be far more achievable in a Byron-adjacent location than in the town itself. When an opportunity arose in Brunswick Heads, they jumped at it. Three years later, Fleet is one of the toughest reservations in Australia; the only booking I could secure was as a single diner, at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. Despite the odd hour (Fleet’s website refers to this midafternoon meal as “late lunch”), the experience was an intensely lovely way to spend a few hours. Ms. McCormack acts as host and server, and Mr. Lewis cooks and plates every dish in the restaurant, solo in the small kitchen but for a dishwasher. The food is almost simple, but not quite. Tiny curls of local squid come over rounds of yellow squash, with preserved lemon and a deeply savory crustacean oil. Spanner crab is jumbled with ribbons of zucchini and slivers of chestnut, but it’s the sweet, deep seafood-broth-based sauce that makes the fresher ingredients sing. Fleet was not the first ambitious restaurant to set up shop in a small town in northern New South Wales. A decade ago, I had a world-class pizza at a restaurant called Milk and Honey in the small inland town of Mullumbimby (its biggest claim to fame at the time being that it’s the hometown of Iggy Azalea). Milk and Honey is still turning out great pizzas, and Mullumbimby’s Friday farmers’ market is now an incubator of sorts, where chefs rent stall space to test out concepts that sometimes become full-fledged restaurants. Town, a cafe in Bangalow, opened in 2011 and serves tasting-menu dinners on weekend nights in a candlelit upstairs dining room. In Newrybar, an ambitious restaurant called Harvest opened in 2007, and eventually added a bakery and deli. But there’s something different about the most recent crop of restaurants in the area, an aesthetic that forcefully proclaims a regional style. The breezy atmosphere that makes this such a beautiful place to live and visit finds its way onto the plate, as does the area’s history as a hippie enclave. Many of the best meals I’ve had in the Northern Rivers could almost be mistaken for spa food, if not for the focus on bold flavor and intense pleasure. Just south of Byron Bay is Lennox Head, where Andrew Love opened Shelter in early 2017. Mr. Love came to the area to work as a manager at Three Blue Ducks, which began in Sydney and now has outposts in Brisbane and Byron Bay. He originally envisioned opening his own project in Byron, but couldn’t resist the location his business partner, Troy Noonan, found in Lennox, directly across from the beach. Most days, weather permitting, Shelter’s walls made of windows are wide open to the salty breeze, with nothing but a few cars across the road obstructing the ocean view. Shelter serves as a casual cafe in the morning, offering mixed grain bowls and avocado toast alongside the requisite high-quality espresso drinks. Lunch displays the chef Dennis Baker’s ambition and verve, with dishes like raw kingfish with cultured cream, thinly sliced cucumber and a scattering of succulent leaves. The cooling green flavor of the succulent and cucumber brought a new kind of freshness to the fish, while the lightly tangy cream added luxurious texture. Dinner, served three nights a week, expands on the promise of lunch. Local octopus is sweetened with XO sauce and given a punch of dynamism by green chile. Brussels sprouts are roasted and served with tangy mustard and more of that lush cultured cream. I thought I was sick of roasted sprouts; Shelter proved me wrong. Farther north in Cabarita Beach, the chef Ben Devlin serves a flexible tasting menu at Paper Daisy, on the bottom floor of Halcyon House, a small oceanside resort in a former cheap surf motel. (It isn’t cheap anymore: A room for the night will cost you between $600 and $1,100 Australian dollars.) Mr. Devlin has Noma on his résumé, and you can see René Redzepi’s influence in the careful construction of some of the food here. But the overwhelming takeaway is one of lightness and elegance: the saline sweetness of smoked oysters under a blanket of crumbed grilled cauliflower, brightened by yuzu and the peppery sting of intensely fresh watercress; or ash-roasted chicken over a swoosh of pine nut purée, with fennel and grapes. There’s a real sense of place to much of this food, in the use of local ingredients and in the culture of healthy eating that has long been a part of Byron’s dining ethos. There’s nut milk with the salted fish at Paper Daisy, macadamia nut butter under the roasted pumpkin at Fleet and an almond paste accompanying the line-caught mulloway at Shelter. The chickpea purée that harmonizes a dish of shaved yellow squash, sea urchin and calamondin lime at Paper Daisy isn’t called hummus, but it has all of that beloved dip’s rich appeal. At Fleet, one of the signature dishes could be a parody of upscale-eating-meets-hippie asceticism: A fresh raw radish comes encrusted in sesame seeds with a touch of honey. It’s reminiscent of those chewy sesame candies from health food stores, but the slightly bitter vegetal snap of radish somehow makes it doubly gratifying. Ms. McCormack and Mr. Lewis have recently opened a second business in Brunswick Heads, a cafe and food store called Ethel, and they’re taking over a local Mexican restaurant. Ms. McCormack says she can’t envision this level of success and rapid growth in any of Australia’s big cities. She feels lucky to have gotten in early; real estate prices have risen sharply in the last couple of years. But don’t expect that to deter more young, talented people from setting up shop along this coastline. I asked everyone I spoke to why they chose the Northern Rivers, and got the exact same answer: Look around you. Look at this ocean; breathe this air. Why wouldn’t you want to be here?

2018,Notes From the Book Review Archives,"Our Back Pages For this week’s cover, Fareed Zakaria reviews “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crisis Changed the World,” by Adam Tooze. In 1998, Walter A. McDougall took note of Zakaria’s first book, “From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America’s World Role.” Read an excerpt below. This thin doctoral thesis would ordinarily pass unnoticed outside academic circles, but it should attract wider attention for three reasons. First, its author is no obscure assistant professor, but the managing editor of Foreign Affairs, the premier American foreign policy journal. Second, its tightly argued thesis addresses a question sure to be revisited during this anniversary of the Spanish-American War: to wit, why the United States in 1898 suddenly cast off its traditions and, in an imperialist jag, claimed the role of a global power. Third, its conclusions are both provocative and full of implications for the world today. Fareed Zakaria begins in the mode of political science by defining a theoretical problem and reviewing two dominant schools of thought. Why, he asks, do nations expand? Clearly they cannot do so unless and until they acquire the requisite material power vis-a-vis their victims or rivals. But mere measures of strength cannot account for the motives or timing of a nation’s expansion. This thesis has a number of merits. It allows Zakaria to escape the myth that America was ever isolationist, to demonstrate a certain continuity in American expansionism whether triumphant or thwarted and to identify the second Cleveland Administration not as a last hurrah for an old diplomacy but as the first hurrah for a new. His argument for continuity would have been even stronger had he looked ahead to Woodrow Wilson, whose expansion of Federal power at home paralleled his globalization of American interests abroad. Even if the author cannot touch all bases in less than 200 pages, his thesis conveys important lessons for our post-cold-war world.",The New York Times
2018,Notes From the Book Review Archives,"Our Back Pages In this week’s issue Robert P. Baird reviews William Logan’s “Dickinson’s Nerves, Frost’s Woods,” an analysis of some of English literature’s greatest poems. Here is an unsigned 1894 review of a posthumously published collection of Emily Dickinson’s letters and poems. Below is an excerpt. A most remarkable and interesting woman is revealed in this collection of letters, a woman who lived in recluse in the college town of Amherst, and who wrote poetry which was not published till she has been dead a number of years. She was a bright woman, but, being untrained, her thoughts ran to whimsicalities, and her poetry was unlike anything anybody else had written. Her peculiar life, too, had its effect upon her writings. She stayed at home almost constantly, rarely venturing outside the fences which inclosed her father’s place. Her pleasure was in her associations with members of her own family, in her correspondance with a few — a very few — persons, with whom she established terms of delightful intimacy, and finally in her communion with nature. She was not soured the least by her life of retirement, but that life developed in her a great many peculiarities which found expression in the letters she wrote, as well as in the little poems which she dashed off on the margins of newspapers and on the backs of envelopes and stowed away in what she called her “scrap” heap. A curious thing about Miss Dickinson is that, although in her later years — that is to say, after she had passed her twenty-fifth year — she shunned society and clung closely to her home, she in her youthful days was full of fun and the life of the centre of schoolgirls in which she moved. The first thought is one of regret that Miss Dickinson did not fulfill the promise of her girlhood and make a literary name for herself, but, perhaps it is just as well that she developed in a different way. It may be said, too, that poems and letters such as Miss Dickinson wrote have a literary value in their very strangeness and irregularity.",The New York Times
2018,Notes From the Book Review Archives,"Our Back Pages This week Erica Check Hayden reviews “The Tangled Tree,” a new book by David Quammen that upends Charles Darwin’s tree of life theory. In 1860, The Times considered Darwin’s explosive text, “The Origin of Species.” Read an excerpt below. Meanwhile, Mr. Darwin, as the fruit of a quarter of a century of patient observation and experiment, throws out, in a book whose title at least has by this time become familiar to the reading public, a series of arguments and inferences so revolutionary as, if established, to necessitate a radical reconstruction of the fundamental doctrines of natural history. Not by dubious speculations on the action of a “chemico-electric” operation on “germinal vesicles,” but by the synthesis of a wide series of appreciable and daylight facts in the structure of animals and plants, does Mr. Darwin sustain his startling theory. Rising from this synthesis, he ascends with the swoop and force of analogy to the august and audacious statement that “all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was at first breathed!” It is clear that here is one of the most important contributions ever made to philosophic science; and it is at least behooving on scientists, in the light of the accumulation of evidence which the author has summoned in support of his theory, to reconsider the grounds in which their present doctrine of the origin of species is based. In that future, to which he looks forward, he will not, we apprehend, be regarded as having drawn the cosmic circle of life, but rather as having indicated one of its arcs. At all events, it seems to be a historic law that the greater portion of truths in the theory of nature first appear as purple mirages —ruddy and auroral streaks gilding the matin of man’s mind ; but the appointed time- duly brings up the perfect thought, fraught with the wealth of invisible climee, and Hooding the age with the sunlight of science.",The New York Times
2018,Notes From the Book Review Archives,"Our Back Pages Kate Tuttle reviews Anne Tyler’s most recent novel, “Clock Dance,” in this week’s issue. In 1985, Larry McMurtry expounded on Tyler’s skill and talent while writing about “The Accidental Tourist” for the Book Review. Read an excerpt below: One of the persistent concerns of this work is the ambiguity of family happiness and unhappiness. In “The Accidental Tourist” these themes cohere with high definition in the muted personality of Macon Leary, a Baltimore man in his early 40’s who writes travel guides for businessmen who, like himself, hate to travel. Not long after we meet him, Macon is left to himself. Sarah, his wife of 20 years, leaves him. Macon and Sarah have had a tragedy: their 12-year-old son, Ethan, was murdered in a fast-food joint, his death an accidental byproduct of a holdup. With the ballast of his marriage removed, Macon immediately tips into serious eccentricity. Miss Tyler shows the mingling of misery and contentment in the daily lives of her families, reminds us how alike — and yet distinct — happy and unhappy families can be. The concept of an accidental tourist captures in a phrase something she has been saying all along, if not about life, at least about men: they are frequently accidental tourists in their own lives. Her men slump arond like tired tourists — friendly, likable, but not all that engaged. If they see anything worth seeing, it is usually because a determined woman thrusts it under their noses and demands that they pay some attention. The fates of these families hinge on long struggles between semiattentive males and semiobsessed females. In her patient investigation of such struggles, Miss Tyler has produced a very satisfying body of fiction.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Notes on a Butter Republic,"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Still on vacation, and I’m currently in Denmark – in fact, just cycled from Copenhagen to Helsingor, aka Elsinore. Sad to say, I’m such a fearsome nerd that instead of thinking about Shakespeare, my thoughts have turned to … economics. For Denmark’s story is, I’d argue, of considerable interest to the rest of us. To be clear, I am in no sense an expert on the Danish economy, now or in the past. I only know what I read and can pull out of readily available databases. So this is really about using Denmark as a mirror to hold up to the rest of the world. But it’s an interesting mirror (and much nicer to think about than the outrages at home.) There are, in particular, two lessons I think Denmark can teach us: a hopeful story about globalization, and another hopeful one about the possibilities of creating a decent society. Blessed are the cheesemakers OK, as a helpful bystander points out in Life of Brian, it’s a metaphor, not to be taken literally: the blessing extends to all manufacturers of dairy products. The blessing certainly worked in the case of Denmark. During the creation of the first global economy, the one made possible by railroads, steamships, and telegraphs, the world seemed to bifurcate into industrial nations and the agricultural raw/material producers who catered to them. And the agricultural nations, even if they grew rich at first – e.g., Argentina – seemingly ended up getting much the worse of the deal, turning into banana republics crippled economically and politically by their role. But Denmark became, not a banana republic, but a butter republic. Steamships and steam-powered cream separators allowed Denmark to become a huge exporter of butter (and pork) to the UK, leading in turn to impressive prosperity on the eve of World War I. One interesting point about this export surge is that in a way it was value-added production, like the exports of modern developing economies that rely on imported inputs – except that in Denmark’s case it was imports of animal feed from North America that helped provide a crucial edge. The good news was that this agricultural orientation didn’t turn out to be a dead end. Instead, it laid the foundation for excellent performance over the long run. And in Denmark’s case globalization seems to have been equalizing, both politically and economically: instead of fostering dominance by foreign corporations or domestic landowners, it led to dominance by rural cooperatives. Why was the Danish story so happy? The Danes may have been lucky in the product in which they turned out to have a comparative advantage. Also, like the Asian countries that led the first wave of modern developing-country growth, they came into globalization with a well-educated population by world standards. They may also have been lucky in the enlightened behavior of their elites. Anyway, I’m not pushing a universal lesson that globalization is great for everyone; just the opposite. The point is that the results depend on the details: a country can produce agricultural products, be “dependent” by most definitions, yet use that as the basis for permanent elevation into the first world. And in today’s world, Denmark manages to be very open to world trade, while having very low levels of inequality both before and after redistribution. Globalization need not be in conflict with social justice. Speaking of which … The non-horrors of “socialism” A number of people on the U.S. right, and some self-proclaimed centrists, seem totally taken aback by the rise of politicians who call themselves socialist. But this rise was predictable and predicted. Here’s what happened: for decades the right has tried to shout down any attempt to sand down some of the rough edges of capitalism, whether through health guarantees, income supports, or anything else, by yelling “socialism.” Sooner or later people were bound to say that if any attempt to make our system less harsh is socialism, well, they’re socialists. The truth is that there are hardly any people in the U.S. who want the government to seize the means of production, or even the economy’s commanding heights. What they want is social democracy – the kinds of basic guarantees of health care, protection against poverty, etc., that almost every other advanced country provides. Denmark, where tax receipts are 46 percent of GDP compared with 26 percent in the U.S., is arguably the most social-democratic country in the world. According to conservative doctrine, the combination of high taxes and aid to “takers” must really destroy incentives both to create jobs and to take them in any case. So Denmark must suffer from mass unemployment, right? Ahem: Yep, Danish adults are more likely to be employed than their U.S. counterparts. They work somewhat shorter hours, although that may well be a welfare-improving choice. But what Denmark shows is that you can run a welfare state far more generous than we do – beyond the wildest dreams of U.S. progressives – and still have a highly successful economy. Indeed, while GDP per capita in Denmark is lower than in the U.S. – basically because of shorter work hours – life satisfaction is notably higher. Macro muddles Despite all this good stuff, there is something rotten – OK, maybe just slightly off – in the state of Denmark. While the long-term performance has been great, Denmark hasn’t done too well since the 2008 financial crisis, with real GDP per capita falling substantially, then taking a long time to recover. In particular, Denmark has lagged far behind Sweden: There’s no mystery about this recent underperformance. Denmark isn’t on the euro, but unlike Sweden, it has pegged its currency to the euro. So it has shared in the euro area’s problems. Leaving aside the general issue of exchange rate regimes, this is a reminder that microeconomics – things like the incentive effects of a strong welfare state – is different from macroeconomics. You can do great things on the micro front and still screw up your monetary policy. So those are my notes on Denmark – plus one more observation: nothing in Danish is pronounced remotely the way the spelling suggests to an English speaker. (The famous astronomer Tyco Brahe was, if I got it right, something like Tuco Brawwww.) The same isn’t true for German. Why did they do this?",The New York Times
2018,"Novak Djokovic Breaks New Ground, Completing Set of 9 Masters Titles","MASON, Ohio — In an era largely dominated by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, it hasn’t been easy to carve out new entries in the record books of men’s tennis. But Novak Djokovic found a way to set himself apart on Sunday, completing an elusive set by winning the Western & Southern Open for the first time and becoming the first man to triumph in singles at all nine Masters events on the ATP Tour. “Definitely one of the most special moments in my career,” Djokovic said after beating Federer, 6-4, 6-4, in the final. “Making history of the sport that I truly love is a great privilege and honor, and something that I’ll be very proud of for the rest of my life.” Djokovic shares the distinction of having won all four Grand Slams with Federer and Nadal, but sweeping the nine Masters event is a point of differentiation. Federer has won seven of the nine, lacking Monte Carlo and Rome; Nadal is missing Miami, Shanghai, and Paris. Djokovic’s tally of Masters titles has stood at eight since 2013, when he won in Monte Carlo for the first time. He had made the final five times in Cincinnati, but lost twice to Andy Murray and three times to Federer. Djokovic said he was “pleased and proud and satisfied” to have come through in his sixth final here. “I kept on coming here, and I felt, to be honest, more pressure every time that I kept coming,” Djokovic said. Djokovic stayed on the court well beyond the trophy ceremony, signing autographs and taking selfies with fans around the entire perimeter of the court. He then took the trophy to a balcony on the side of the stadium and posed once more for fans gathered below. “The little baby is here for the first time,” he said of the large ceramic trophy, cradling it in his arms. While still a step below the Grand Slam events in terms of prestige, the nine Masters events have been a fixture on tour in their current form since 1990. Three players — Bob Bryan, Mike Bryan and Daniel Nestor — have won doubles titles at each Masters event. The WTA tour, which uses a more convoluted nomenclature including distinctions between “Premier Mandatory,” “Premier 5,” and “Premier” levels, has not been able to enumerate an equivalent achievement. In the women’s final earlier Sunday, 17th-ranked Kiki Bertens won the biggest title of her career, beating top-ranked Simona Halep, 2-6, 7-6 (6), 6-2. Halep had a match point in the second set tiebreaker, but Bertens fended it off and won the set. From there, Halep faded considerably, with cumulative fatigue from her title last week in Montreal and her four matches this week catching up to her. Before this summer, Bertens had been almost exclusively a clay court specialist who struggled on grass and hard courts, winning all five of her career titles on clay. This summer, however, she has gone 8-0 against top-10 opponents on grass and hard courts, surfaces on which she had previously gone 0-11. The win over Halep was Bertens’ fourth win over a top-10 player this week, following victories against No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki, No. 5 Elina Svitolina, and No. 8 Petra Kvitova. “Winning on a surface that you didn’t really know coming into this year that it was possible — yeah, that’s a great feeling,” Bertens said. Djokovic and Federer have battled it out across every surface over the years — Sunday was their 46th professional meeting — but they had not faced each other since the 2016 Australian Open. Federer called Djokovic’s set of Masters titles “an amazing accomplishment” and one that could only be correctly appreciated with time. “At the end you’re going to judge it all together, bundle it up and say, ‘O.K., what was the coolest thing you ever did?’” Federer said. “And this might be it for Novak — besides winning all the Slams, and all the other things he’s done already.” Federer has been more successful at this Masters event than at any other, winning seven times in Cincinnati. But on Sunday, his consistency was lacking and he couldn’t mount a steady challenge on Djokovic’s serve, only generating one break point in the match. While acknowledging that he had struggled, Federer did not want to keep the focus on his own subpar play Sunday, instead directing the focus toward Djokovic’s breakthrough. “Not about me missing second-serve returns,” Federer said. “It’s about him making history. That’s my opinion. We can go into whatever points you want, but I think that’s what the headline should be about. This is an amazing accomplishment, and I hope he’s extremely proud and extremely happy about this moment.”",The New York Times
2018,"Now Comfortable on a Big Stage, Kevin Anderson Seeks a Major Win","TORONTO — Kevin Anderson was about to unleash one of his sizzling serves on a practice court at the Rogers Cup this month when a funk-jazz band about 60 feet away suddenly started blaring at a remarkably high volume for a tennis tournament. Still wearing the hardened expression of a focused athlete, Anderson lifted his head and stared at the band. It appeared to be a look of disgust over a noisy interruption, but when asked about it later, Anderson said, no, it was actually an expression of admiration, not anger. “They were really good,” he said. Even though Anderson is a budding musician with a love of good tunes, it was hard to fully accept his explanation. The initial glare he aimed at the band seemed to speak for itself. Still, the whole episode was a good illustration of where Anderson, now 32, finds himself as a player and person on the men’s tennis circuit. Long considered part of the second tier, Anderson has raised his level of play and narrowed his focus on the ultimate prize — a Grand Slam title — while retaining the thoughtfulness and graciousness that have helped define him in the world of tennis. That distinct mix was on display last month in his historic victory against John Isner in their Wimbledon semifinal, one of the the biggest wins of Anderson’s career. After capturing a match that took 6 hours 36 minutes to complete and reaching his second major final, Anderson looked almost sad. He removed his hat after vanquishing Isner and frowned. He was thrilled with the result, of course, but he knew the anguish that the loss would cause Isner, and instead of simply reveling in his own joy, he chose to show empathy for his opponent. It was an act of true sportsmanship, but there was another element at play, too. Anderson is no longer satisfied in merely reaching a Grand Slam final. Now, it’s about winning one — when he can really celebrate. As he enters the United States Open with a career-high ranking of No. 5, his lifetime goal feels closer than ever. “Projecting forward to the U.S. Open and next year, I just feel a little more comfortable saying, ‘I’m here to compete for the win,’” Anderson said. “I would have said it before, but now I can say it with more self-assurance.” That belief comes at the end of a long, steady climb for Anderson, who has reached two of the last four Grand Slam finals, including last year’s U.S. Open. Despite all the recent success, many aspects of Anderson’s life remain unchanged. He still travels with his wife, Kelsey O’Neal, and their little dog, Lady Kady, to most tournaments. As a longstanding member of the ATP players council, Anderson is actively involved in the issues affecting men’s tennis players. As a citizen of South Africa, he understands his role in the development of tennis there, too. And as an aspiring musician, Anderson often travels the globe with a small electric guitar stuffed into his racket case, and an ear open for any good jams. In just a few years of playing the guitar, he has developed some strong moves, and during his stay in Toronto, he and Kelsey attended a Taylor Swift concert at the Rogers Centre. He did not jump on the stage to jam with her band — he may not be at that level yet — but he does know that after his string of groundbreaking results, including a convincing win over Roger Federer in the Wimbledon quarterfinal that preceded the Isner match, he now belongs on any tennis court in the world against any opponent. “In this position, I feel quite comfortable,” he said. “I’ve always set my goals and aspirations really high and worked really hard systematically to get there.” At 32, Anderson still has years left in his career, considering that the game now seems to favor veteran players. And after getting to the highest level, he feels he has shed the feeling of awe that he initially had in those moments. “Last year, if you had said I’d make two Grand Slam finals, it would be amazing and crazy,” he said. “Once you do it, you realize it’s obviously a great achievement and a lot of great memories, but life and tennis moves on. I built it up a little bit too much in some aspects in my mind of what it would be like.’’ Still, he added, “it was interesting to go through those emotions.” They were certainly new feelings for a player who has spent much of his career considered a secondary player — the kind that opponents did not want to face because of his booming serve and savvy court awareness but one who rarely advanced past the third and fourth rounds in tournaments. In his first 33 Grand Slam events, Anderson reached the quarterfinals only once, at the 2015 U.S. Open. But on his 34th and 37th attempts, he was suddenly in unfamiliar terrain. Defying expectations, Anderson reached last year’s U.S. Open final, and less than a year later he was back at the same level at Wimbledon. He lost both finals to two of the sport’s greats — Rafael Nadal in last year’s U.S. Open and Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, and both times he fell in straight sets. Anderson said he always knew he had the game to compete with the best players in the world, but he had to prove it to himself first. He has long been a dedicated worker, but he noticed that his constant efforts to improve every aspect of his game also sent a subliminal message to himself that he didn’t yet have the skill to win a major title. Now that is changing. “I feel like in the last year or so, I was able to recognize just how good of a tennis player I am, without needing to constantly work to improve,” he said. “My mind-set shifted where I realized, I’ve got the game and I’m just adding pieces, as opposed to needing to work so hard that you wonder, ‘Is my game good enough to win these tournaments?’” As he spoke, Anderson wore the clear, self-confident expression of a premier athlete.",The New York Times
2018,Now You Can Just Pay Celebrities to Say Stuff,"Critic’s Notebook Cameo is the “Being John Malkovich” of apps. Remember Nikki Blonsky? She was the unknown Long Island teen plucked from a Cold Stone Creamery and cast as the star of the 2007 movie musical “Hairspray.” Now, a decade after that big splash, her acting career has slowed to a drip. Recently she lent her voice to “Pup Star,” a direct-to-digital entry in the “Air Bud” extended universe. Soon she’ll appear in a horror movie opposite Gary Busey’s son. But lately Ms. Blonsky has found a new performance platform: Cameo, a service that allows fans to pay low- to midrange celebrities to send them short, personalized video messages. Ms. Blonsky is the bard of Cameo. She excels at the projection of intimacy. She takes a few spare details about her subject — an upcoming birthday, a career milestone — and spins them into a sugar-voiced pep talk filmed as a dim, shaky selfie. The heady mix of heartfelt emoting and janky video quality creates the illusion of a bridged gap between celebrity and fan. The experience costs $20. I bought one for myself: Cameo is an intriguing new development in celebrity-fan relations. Commoners have always had a tenuous relationship with the stars. Their images and life stories exert a strong gravitational pull over our own, and the internet has provided the opportunity for the masses to yank back. Attempting to assert control in the confines of celebrity culture can take the form of fanatical image monitoring (as is the case with celebrity Photoshop-obsessed communities like Pretty Ugly Little Liar); creepy body fixations (indexing and cataloging celebrity parts on sites like WikiFeet and CelebHeights.com); erotic fan fiction (where you can write your favorite star into any scenario you choose); and criminal invasions (hacking and trading nude images). Cameo offers something new. It’s a kind of celebrity ventriloquism — the opportunity to project your voice through a famous host. It’s the “Being John Malkovich” of apps. Here’s how it works: Browse an array of available Cameo “talent” — the list includes “The O.C.” star Mischa Barton (current rate: $75), the N.F.L. Hall-of-Famer Terrell Owens ($350), the former boybander Lance Bass ($125) and a raft of “Real Housewives” socialites — and choose your favorite player. Then type in some credit card information and a set of instructions. The dummy copy reads: “My buddy Shia (pronounced SHY-UH) is graduating from college on Saturday (my name is Jason). Played football with him for three years, loves all your content. Our favorite saying is ‘okay pal?’. Please wish him a happy graduation.” If the celebrity accepts the request, a video will materialize in your inbox within a week. If he or she doesn’t, you’ll receive a sad GIF and won’t be charged. Cameo “talent” is free to reject any request found “confusing, difficult, or not in line with an athlete’s or influencer’s image,” so the potential thrill of being recognized by a B-list celebrity always comes with the risk of being rebuffed by one. Steven Galanis, a former LinkedIn account executive who is C.E.O. of Cameo, realized a couple years ago that “the celebrity selfie is the new autograph” and set out to democratize the experience with the help of co-founders Devon Townsend, a former Microsoft engineer, and Martin Blencowe, a producer and N.F.L. agent. Now, you no longer need to hope for a random celebrity run-in to secure such an image; you can pay Cameo to engineer it for you. But Mr. Galanis’s even-more-valuable intuition was this: Famous people are willing to do a lot more for money than was previously assumed. Mr. Galanis recalled asking the New York Knicks player Lance Thomas, a friend of his from college, how much it would cost for him to make an appearance at a Long Island bar mitzvah, and he replied, “Bro, I’ll go anywhere for $2,000.” Mr. Galanis did the math: Maybe three hours at the event, plus one hour of travel each way, amounted to about six dollars a minute. But boil an “appearance” down to just the few minutes is takes to shoot a video, and such experiences could be made available on a wide scale — “the greatest gift ever, and cheaper than a ticket to a Knicks game,” Mr. Galanis said. Mr. Thomas is now a Cameo investor and on its talent roster. Along the way, Cameo has unwittingly created a new style of performance. Some practitioners are more skilled than others. Occasionally, requested messages enter the celebrity’s brain and come out garbled. Others just seem insincere. Even a “bad” Cameo offers something of value, which is a totally new way of analyzing a celebrity persona. Dina Lohan, best known for giving birth to Lindsay, has struggled to adapt to the form. In her Cameos, she regularly appears perched in a striped armchair next to an enormous silk curtain contraption, filmed from across the room by an unseen handler. Her messages come off as scripted and rote, which, of course, they are. She has received such feedback from users as “She said 31st birthday instead of 35th” and “She doesn’t seem to be having fun.” But there’s also something wonderful about receiving a text message containing an artifact like this. It’s like a direct injection of her arid momager essence. A few celebrities appear to be using Cameo as a one-on-one image rehabilitation service. When I requested a Cameo from Jon Gosselin of “Jon & Kate Plus Eight,” he made sure to casually drop this: “I’m so busy I had to do it from my car.” $40. Rebecca Black, who rose to infamy as an awkward teenager in 2011, when a low-budget music video for her puzzling and atonal single, “Friday” went viral, has re-emerged on Cameo, where she seems to have found her calling. Now 21, she is suddenly gorgeous and self-assured. In her videos, she appears winkingly gracious to her “fans” for listening to “Friday,” then performs a twee ukulele version. Her voice sounds amazing. $30. One of the most intriguing aspects of Cameo is not the videos but the site itself, where famous people from every corner of modern celebrity — music, sports, YouTube, reality TV, viral infamy — assign a dollar amount to their self-worth. Celebrities set their own rates; Cameo takes a 25 percent cut. The real-life “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort has offered himself up for $1,000. Mr. Owens once charged $500 but has since dropped his rate to $350. The model Adriana Lima (who has the same name as a Victoria's Secret model) costs $40. Lee Garrett, a former “Bachelorette” contestant perhaps best known for his racist comments, goes for $5. In addition to soliciting Cameos from Ms. Blonsky and Mr. Gosselin, I bought videos from the celebrity gossip Perez Hilton, the youth culture queen Bella Thorne and Ms. Lohan. Because I am a sadist, I asked them to say “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” They mostly did, and now I feel strangely tender toward them all. Except for Ms. Lohan. Instead of repeating the tongue twister, she sat in her chair, told “me,” I guess, that she had just returned from opening Lohan Beach Clubs in Greece, and wished my family “love, laughter, and great health.” She didn’t say my name. $75. An earlier version of this article misidentified a model who is listed on Cameo. She is not Adriana Lima the Victoria's Secret model, but another model who has the same name.",The New York Times
2018,"Obama Endorses Dozens of Democrats, Rewarding Diversity and Loyalty","Former President Barack Obama took a public step back into the electoral arena on Wednesday, issuing a slate of 81 endorsements for Democrats running in the 2018 elections and giving his stamp of approval to more than a dozen veterans of his administration and election campaigns who are seeking office in their own right. Among the most prominent candidates to earn his backing were Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who is running for governor of Ohio; J.B. Pritzker, the private equity executive and Hyatt Hotels heir who is the party’s nominee for governor in Illinois; and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who is vying to become the first African-American woman elected governor of a state. But Mr. Obama also extended his political blessing to Democrats running far down the ballot, backing legislative candidates in states such as North Carolina and Texas, as well as Democrats running for relatively low-profile offices, including secretary of agriculture in Iowa, state auditor in Ohio and lieutenant governor in California and Illinois. [Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] The former president unveiled his endorsements with little fanfare and no advance notice, posting the list on Twitter with a concise explanatory note that called the candidates “as diverse, patriotic and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent.” Without rebuking President Trump or the Republican Party directly, Mr. Obama took up the rhetoric of change that Democrats have trumpeted in their campaigns this year. His endorsees, Mr. Obama said, would “strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.” The verbal endorsements, for now, are simply that — Mr. Obama has not yet settled his campaign itinerary for the fall and aides said that the list of favorites posted on Wednesday would not necessarily guide his travel. But candidates can begin using his name and statement of support, in fund-raising solicitations and other campaign materials. The list, aides said, was crafted with input from the Democratic Party’s official campaign committees, as well as the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an anti-gerrymandering group led by Mr. Obama’s former attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. Mr. Obama also instructed aides to prioritize diversity in his endorsements; a majority of the candidates he backed were women and about a quarter were racial minorities. He is expected to release at least one more tranche of endorsements this fall. The former president has kept a careful distance from the campaign trail since leaving office: He has not taken an active role in shaping Democratic strategy in the midterms and has commented only sparingly on Mr. Trump’s policies, many of which have been aimed at rolling back Mr. Obama’s accomplishments. But Mr. Obama has ventured out on a few important occasions, including last year’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. Other groups aligned with Mr. Obama, like Mr. Holder’s redistricting group and Organizing for Action, have previously released their own endorsement packages. Most telling may be Mr. Obama’s support for former officials in his own administration — a vivid expression of personal loyalty that could help shape the next generation of Democratic political leaders. In addition to Mr. Cordray, other important administration alumni earning support include Steve Dettelbach and Phil Weiser, two Justice Department veterans running for attorney general in Ohio and Colorado, respectively; Andy Kim and Tom Malinowski, a pair of former foreign policy officials running for Congress in New Jersey; and Eleni Kounalakis, a former ambassador to Hungary who is one of two Democrats running for lieutenant governor in California.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Oh, the Humanities!","New data on college majors confirms an old trend. Technocracy is crushing the life out of humanism. Opinion Columnist In the spring of 1946, W.H. Auden came to Harvard to read a poem to the university’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter. Titled “Under Which Lyre: A Reactionary Tract for the Times,” the poem envisioned a postwar world in which, the war-god Ares having quit the field, public life would be dominated by a renewed contest between “the sons of Hermes” and “Apollo’s children” — the motley humanists against the efficient technocrats, the aesthetes and poets and philosophers and theologians against the managers and scientists and financiers and bureaucrats. These two factions, Auden suggested, could ideally coexist: The Apollonian genius is for government and rule, and “the earth would soon, did Hermes run it,/Be like the Balkans.” But the Apollonian spirit, ever ambitious, cannot bear to leave the humanists to their poems and ideas and arguments, and so it seeks to expand its empire outward: But jealous of our god of dreams, His common-sense in secret schemes To rule the heart; Unable to invent the lyre, Creates with simulated fire Official art. And when he occupies a college, Truth is replaced by Useful Knowledge; He pays particular Attention to Commercial Thought, Public Relations, Hygiene, Sport, In his curricula. During his visit, Auden met James Conant, then the president of Harvard and a man associated with the Apollonian transformation of the modern university, its remaking as a scientific-technical powerhouse with its old religious and humanistic purposes hollowed out. “ ‘This is the real enemy,’ I thought to myself,” Auden wrote of the encounter. “And I’m sure he had the same impression about me.” This anecdote appears near the end of “The Year of Our Lord 1943: Christian Humanism in An Age of Crisis,” a new book by the Baylor professor Alan Jacobs. Auden is one of his main subjects; the others are T.S. Eliot, Simone Weil, Jacques Maritain and C.S. Lewis, a group of religious thinkers whose wartime writings Jacobs depicts as a sustained attempt, in the shadow of totalitarian ambition and liberal crisis, to offer “a deeply thoughtful, culturally rich Christianity” as the means to a postwar humanistic renewal in the West. Jacobs also depicts their attempt as a failure, because in the end neither a Christian humanism nor any other has been able to withstand the spirit of Conant, the spirit of technocratic ambition, the spirit of truth-replaced-by-useful-knowledge, that rules today not just in Washington and Silicon Valley but in much of academia as well. By coincidence, Jacobs’s interesting, depressing book has come out just after an interesting, depressing analysis of the steepening decline in the share of college students majoring in English, philosophy, religion, history and similar pursuits. The analyst is a historian named Ben Schmidt, who just five years ago wrote an essay arguing that the decline of the humanities was overstated, that enrollment in humanistic majors had declined in the 1970s, mostly as women’s employment opportunities began switching to more pre-professional tracks, but that since then there has been a basic stability, at best a soft declension. But now he’s revised his argument, because the years since the Great Recession have been “brutal for almost every major in the humanities.” They’ve also been bad for “social science fields that most closely resemble humanistic ones — sociology, anthropology, international relations and political science.” Meanwhile the sciences and engineering have gained at the expense of humanism, and with them sports management and exercise studies — the “hygiene” and “sport,” if you will, from Auden’s list of Apollonian concerns. Notably this trend is sharper among elite liberal arts colleges, the top thirty in the US News and World Report rankings, where in the early 2000s the humanities still attracted about a third of all students, but lately only get about a fifth. So it’s not just a matter of the post-Great Recession middle class seeking more practical degrees to make sure their student loans get repaid quickly; the slice of the American elite that’s privileged enough and intellectually-minded enough to choose Swarthmore or Haverford or Amherst over a state school or a research university is abandoning Hermes for Apollo at the fastest clip. Even this acceleration is no doubt partially driven by economic concerns: Elite college grads are by no means immune to feelings of precarity. But as with another, more literally humanistic pursuit — childbearing — that had seemed to stabilize after a post-1960s collapse but now is in decline again, the absence of a post-Great Recession bounce-back for the humanities suggests that the economic calamity of 2008 was a precondition but not the only cause, and that other cultural shifts had left the humanities ripe for another era of collapse. In explaining those shifts many conservatives blame the humanists themselves, for being politicized and marching lock step to the left and for pursuing postmodernist obscurantism in their scholarship and prose. But I think it’s more useful to step back a bit and recognize both politicization and postmodern jargon as attempted solutions to a pre-existing problem, not the taproot of the crisis. That problem is the one that Auden identified seventy years ago: In an Apollonian culture, eager for “Useful Knowledge” and technical mastery and increasingly indifferent to memory and allergic to tradition, the poet and the novelist and the theologian struggle to find an official justification for their arts. And both the turn toward radical politics and the turn toward high theory are attempts by humanists in the academy to supply that justification — to rebrand the humanities as the seat of social justice and a font of political reform, or to assume a pseudoscientific mantle that lets academics claim to be interrogating literature with the rigor and precision of a lab tech doing dissection. At the moment both efforts look like failed attempts. But is there an alternative? Here I would dissent a little from the sternness of Jacobs’s pessimism, since I think the Christian humanists that he describes — and their secular and Jewish counterparts — had a little more short-run success than he suggests. There was real growth in humanities majors beginning in the 1950s (stronger among women than men, but present among both), and that indicator corresponded to a genuine mass interest, mediated by journalists and popularizers as well as academia, in pursuits that now seem esoteric and strictly elitist — poetry and public theology, classical music and abstract impressionism, the Great American novel and the high theory of French cinema and more. What sustained this temporary cultural moment, middlebrow and crass in all sorts of ways but still more successfully humanistic than our own? Three forces, in particular, that are no longer with us. First, there was a stronger religious element in midcentury culture, visible both in the general postwar religious revival and in the particular theological-intellectual flowering that Jacobs’s subjects embodied, which rooted midcentury humanism in a metaphysical understanding of human life — an understanding that both ennobled acts of artistic creation and justified a strong interest in the human person’s interiority, his actual person as opposed to just his brain chemistry or social role. Second, there was the example of a rival civilization, totalitarian Communism, in which the Apollonian model had been pushed to its materialist-utopian conclusion and discovered only a ruthless, inhuman dead end. And third, forged in response to the Communist threat, there was a sense of Western identity, Western historical tradition, that could be glib and propagandistic in a from-Plato-to-NATO style, but at its best let people escape the worst of late modern afflictions, the crippling chauvinism of the now. This precise combination is not recoverable: Communism is dead (I think), the religious landscape of the 1950s is even deader, and the humanistic history of midcentury was Eurocentric in a way that a more globalized and multiracial society could neither embrace nor sustain. But a hopeful road map to humanism’s recovery might include variations on those older themes. First, a return of serious academic interest in the possible (I would say likely) truth of religious claims. Second, a regained sense of history as a repository of wisdom and example rather than just a litany of crimes and wrongthink. Finally, a cultural recoil from the tyranny of the digital and the virtual and the Very Online, today’s version of the technocratic, technological, potentially totalitarian Machine that Jacobs’s Christian humanists opposed. Auden’s poem closes with comic (but not really) advice for humanists: Thou shalt not sit/ With statisticians nor commit/A social science … Thou shalt not be on friendly terms/With guys in advertising firms … If thou must choose/Between the chances, choose the odd;/ Read The New Yorker, trust in God … Imagine “social media” where “advertising” sits in the stanza and imagine an intellectual climate where the last piece of advice doesn’t seem like a contradiction in terms, and you’ve imagined the beginnings of humanism’s revival.

2018,"Ohio Special Election Too Close to Call, as Republican Holds Slim Lead","• Get full results from Ohio’s special election here. • Gretchen Whitmer won the Democratic nomination for governor of Michigan, joining women in Georgia, Texas, South Dakota and elsewhere who are competing in November to lead their states. • In Missouri, voters rejected a legislative move to curb union power. • Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, was in a tight race against Gov. Jeff Colyer for the Republican nomination in the governor’s race. President Trump endorsed Mr. Kobach despite some Republican misgivings. • Here are five key takeaways from the results. WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Republicans spent millions of dollars on scorching television ads, pried a reluctant endorsement from Ohio’s moderate governor, used the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as a foil and enlisted President Trump in a last-minute turnaround effort in a special election for Congress in Ohio. And after all that, in a conservative-leaning district outside Columbus, the Republican candidate clung to the narrowest of leads on Tuesday night. The Republican, Troy Balderson, a state senator who ran a plodding campaign, led his Democratic challenger, Danny O’Connor, by nearly 1 percentage point with all precincts reporting. But 3,435 provisional ballots have yet to be counted, with Mr. Balderson’s margin standing at 1,754. Ohio law provides for an automatic recount if the two candidates are ultimately separated by less than half a percentage point. National Republicans declared victory before midnight, but it could be days or weeks before there is a conclusive result in the race. And regardless of the outcome, Mr. Balderson and Mr. O’Connor will face each other again in three months, in the regularly scheduled November election. But already, Republicans’ brush with catastrophe in Ohio has deepened the party’s gloomy mood, highlighting the massive political mobilization among Democrats and the comparative demoralization of the Republican base. The district that Mr. Balderson may have barely won voted for Mr. Trump by 11 points less than two years ago, and routinely elected Republicans to Congress by landslide margins before that. And on the Democratic side, the Ohio vote is likely to reignite debate about the cost of keeping Ms. Pelosi as party leader, and whether her declared intention to try to become House speaker again could limit their gains in November — or even cost them a chance to win the majority. Mr. Trump claimed credit for Mr. Balderson’s apparent survival, pointing out that the former auto dealer had trailed badly in early voting and fared better on Election Day, just days after the president visited the district. “After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better,” he boasted on Twitter. Even as Mr. O’Connor appeared to fall short, however, he significantly improved upon Hillary Clinton’s performance in the district’s suburban precincts, and he overwhelmed Mr. Balderson in the sort of high-income enclaves Republicans must perform better in to hold their 23-seat majority in the House. As ominous for Republicans was the sizable gap in turnout between the most heavily populated suburban counties and the more rural reaches of the district. A higher percentage of voters from Franklin and Delaware Counties, the two largest jurisdictions, cast ballots than in the other, far smaller five counties. See full results and maps from the special election for Ohio's 12th District. “We are in a tied ballgame,” Mr. O’Connor said at his election night party, refusing to concede. He then repurposed his speech into an appeal for the general election in November; he and Mr. Balderson have both been nominated to face off again then. “We’re not stopping now,” he said. “We must keep fighting through November.” Mr. Balderson spoke for only about three minutes in a Doubletree Hotel ballroom filled largely with men, who briefly broke into a couple of chants of “Trump, Trump” that soon died out. Mr. Balderson alluded just briefly to Mr. Trump’s visit to support him. “Over the next three months I’m going to do everything I can to keep America great again,” he said. “Danny O’Connor ran a hard race and I look forward to campaigning against him again this fall.” In voting elsewhere Tuesday, Gretchen Whitmer, a former Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate, claimed her party’s nomination for governor, setting up a crucial test for Midwestern Democrats and organized labor in November. Ms. Whitmer will face Bill Schuette, the state attorney general. Republicans have dominated Michigan for most of the last decade and Mr. Trump carried the state narrowly in 2016. The governorship is a vital prize for Democrats seeking a comeback there. In the Senate race in Michigan, John James, an African-American Republican who also had Mr. Trump’s backing, won the nomination to challenge the Democratic incumbent, Debbie Stabenow. And in a race to replace longtime representative John Conyers Jr., who resigned in December after allegations of sexual misconduct, Rashida Tlaib took a major step toward becoming the first Muslim woman in Congress by winning the primary to compete in November in a safely Democratic seat. In Missouri, Josh Hawley, the Republican state attorney general, will face off against Senator Claire McCaskill, a vulnerable Democrat. And while Mr. Trump crowed about lifting Mr. Balderson in Ohio, his ability to propel a much-closer ally in the Republican primary for Kansas governor appeared uncertain Wednesday morning. One day after he received an endorsement from Mr. Trump that he had aggressively lobbied for, Secretary of State Kris Kobach was clinging to a very slim lead over Gov. Jeff Colyer with almost all precincts reporting. However, Mr. Colyer was enjoying an advantage in Kansas’s most populous jurisdiction, Johnson County, where nearly all the remaining votes were to be counted. If Mr. Kobach, who has made a national name for himself for devising crackdowns on immigration and voting rights, were to lose, it would snap Mr. Trump’s streak of success in Republican primaries. The president has crowned Republican nominees from Georgia to South Carolina to Alabama in recent nominating contests. In the case of Kansas, though, Mr. Trump defied White House aides and other high-level Republican officials who urged him to stay out of a race involving a sitting governor. Many Republican leaders, and most all Democrats, believe Mr. Kobach would be a weaker general election candidate for the G.O.P. and perhaps imperil their grip on the state’s governorship But it was the Ohio congressional race that transfixed Democrats and Republicans as one of the marquee midterm battles of the summer. The Republican Party’s tactics that helped Mr. Balderson are now likely to be reproduced across the country this fall, as Republicans defend their congressional majority in similar districts stocked with the right-of-center suburbanites who proved so elusive in the special election. Republicans prevailed in Ohio by wielding a set of divisive issues — including gun rights, immigration restriction and taxes — that mobilized just enough voters on their side, particularly in the exurban and more rural reaches of the district. And they invoked Ms. Pelosi at every opportunity. Mr. Trump attacked Mr. O’Connor in a weekend rally as an agent of Ms. Pelosi, even though Mr. O’Connor pledged he would not vote to make her speaker of the House. Yet Mr. Trump, in a characteristic moment of thinking aloud, also ruminated on the difficulty of the midterm environment. Pleading with Ohio Republicans to show up for Mr. Balderson, he identified the dynamic that made the race so taxing for his party: Republican lethargy and disillusionment. “Whoever has the White House, that party tends to lose the midterms,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t know why. Maybe it’s complacency. Maybe you all fight so hard for the presidency and you win and you’re a little complacent.” Mr. O’Connor, whom Mr. Trump dubbed “Danny Boy,” was somewhat handcuffed by the nature of the district. It includes high-income and well-educated voters close to Columbus who revile Mr. Trump, as well as a more pro-Trump rural element toward the seat’s outer boundaries. So the Democrat studiously avoided training fire at the president, taking care to note in an interview Monday that he had been “at Mass” during Mr. Trump’s visit. Asked about his reaction to Mr. Trump’s intervention, Mr. O’Connor insisted he was “indifferent” and shifted to safer topics that he said voters wanted to discuss when he knocked on their doors: Social Security and the cost of college. Mr. Balderson and his allies also fought apathy among hard-core conservatives and disaffection among Republicans closer to the political center, fearing up to the end that they would be swamped by overwhelming turnout among Democrats and independents. Ambivalence about Mr. Trump was on display across the district on Election Day, as enthusiasm for the state of the economy mingled with misgivings about the president’s record and personal conduct. John Begley, 43, an insurance executive who voted for Mr. Balderson, said he did so to send a message of support for Mr. Trump. “It’s important that we stand behind what we voted for in the general election,” said Mr. Begley. Asked what he was happy with about the president’s record, Mr. Begley answered: “My investment accounts.” For some voters, economic prosperity was not enough to allay a deeper sense of unease. Pam Moore, 57, said that even though “my stocks are doing well,” she voted for Mr. O’Connor. She said Mr. Trump scares her. “I’m afraid he’s going to make some crazy decision that could turn us around in the wrong direction,” said Ms. Moore, who works in the loan department of a bank. Josh Wickham, 38, a community college administrator, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but for Mr. O’Connor on Tuesday. He said he wanted a Democratic-majority House to be a check on the president, especially over some conservative social positions the White House has promoted. A sister of Mr. Wickham’s is married to another woman and is “terrified,” he said, of a conservative Supreme Court reversing same-sex marriage. The special election was set in motion earlier this year by the resignation of Pat Tiberi, a nine-term incumbent who quit midway through his term to take over a business association back in the state capital. Republicans initially believed they could hold the district with relative ease, so long as they nominated a mainstream candidate. And so the party worked aggressively to steer Mr. Balderson, 56, through a contested primary that he barely won. But Mr. O’Connor, the 31-year-old county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus and is the most Democratic-leaning part of the district, proved unexpectedly formidable as a challenger, collecting more money for his campaign than Mr. Balderson and assailing the Republican as a threat to popular health care and retirement-security programs. And Mr. O’Connor aligned himself in his rhetoric with Gov. John R. Kasich, Ohio’s Republican chief executive who is an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, and who withheld his endorsement from Mr. Balderson until the last week of the race. Mr. Balderson struggled to raise money and kept a modest campaign schedule, forcing Republican outside groups to bail him out with expensive independent advertising campaigns. And despite fears about unsettling swing voters, Republicans ultimately called on Mr. Trump to help stir up support for Mr. Balderson among conservatives who were mostly tuned out of the race. Mr. O’Connor may have handed Mr. Balderson a decisive gift in the final stages of the race when he seemed to soften his pledge to oppose Ms. Pelosi in a television interview. The brief fumble gave Republicans a valuable opening to attack Mr. O’Connor as a conventional Democratic partisan in a district that leans well to the right.",The New York Times
2018,"Ohio Special Election, Tesla, Alex Jones: Your Wednesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The good news, if you’re a Republican: Troy Balderson is narrowly ahead in a special election to fill a House seat in a district outside Columbus, Ohio. The bad news: It’s a district that President Trump won handily in 2016 and that routinely elected Republicans before that. With provisional ballots yet to be counted, it could be days or weeks before there’s a final result in the election, one of many on Tuesday. Here are five takeaways and full results from five states. • Among the highlights: A Republican primary for governor is deadlocked in Kansas; Republican candidates endorsed by Mr. Trump won in Michigan; and voters in Missouri rejected a proposal to curb union power. • The testimony on Tuesday during the fraud trial of Paul Manafort sullied both his reputation and that of Rick Gates, his former aide who is now the prosecution’s star witness. Mr. Gates, under cross-examination, was portrayed as a thief, adulterer and liar. Our reporters write: “The testimony filled in a picture of two men with few scruples and a powerful thirst for money, hiding payments from Ukrainian clients in foreign bank accounts and deceiving accountants, banks and tax authorities, both individually and together.” The trial is the first by the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s election interference and possible coordination by the Trump campaign. • Kristin Davis, who once had an escort service and ran for New York governor, is set to testify this week before a grand jury. We looked at her possible connection to the Russia investigation. • Nearly 600,000 acres burned. More than 13,000 firefighters at work. More than 2,300 members of the National Guard called in. The numbers, however, don’t fully tell the story of the complexity of the firefighting effort in California, where nearly three times as many acres have been scorched as in the same period last year. • “It’s unprecedented to have so many sustained demands for so many resources over such a short amount of time,” one official said. • The conflict in Afghanistan has endured without a clear exit strategy for almost 17 years, across three U.S. presidencies. There is also the war in Iraq, which started in 2003 and continues in a different form over the Syrian border. More than three million Americans have served in uniform in these wars, and nearly 7,000 of them have died. • The Times Magazine takes a long look this week at how the failure of American military campaigns has left a generation of soldiers with little to fight for but one another. • President Trump says that tariffs on steel, aluminum and imported Chinese goods will generate enough revenue to reduce the federal debt. The math isn’t on his side. • Ikea, the world’s largest furniture retailer, has opened its first outlet in India. The store in Hyderabad has the classic layout, but what’s on display is somewhat different. • Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, suggested that he might take the automaker private, sending its stock soaring. • Has social media hit a ceiling? Snap, the maker of Snapchat, lost three million daily active users in the latest quarter, and it’s not alone. • Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist, urged his followers to fight back (and buy merchandise) after his programming was removed from several social media platforms. Mr. Jones and his supporters have complained that he has been deprived of his First Amendment rights. Free-speech scholars disagree. • The Times announced today that it added 109,000 digital-only subscribers in the second quarter. It now has 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, out of 3.8 million total. • U.S. stocks were up on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Today we introduce Ask, a way for Times subscribers to relay questions to our journalists and family of experts. (Everybody, including nonsubscribers, can benefit from the answers.) For the next month, we’re focusing on fitness. Our first expert is Jessamyn Stanley, a yoga teacher, body positivity advocate and author of “Every Body Yoga.” Have a question about the right kind of class, a pose for a certain ache or gear? Ask here. • Recipe of the day: If you’re feeling ambitious on a weeknight, make buttermilk fried chicken. • A dream ends on a mountain road “I’ve grown tired of spending the best hours of my day in front of a glowing rectangle,” Jay Austin wrote last year. So he and his partner, Lauren Geoghegan, quit their jobs and set off to cycle the globe. The young American couple had a vision of the world. The men who mowed them down in Tajikistan had a starkly different one. Our correspondent tells their tragic but inspiring story. • Southern food, or soul food? Two Atlanta cooks, Todd Richards and Virginia Willis, have published cookbooks this year that reflect new ways of thinking about Southern food. One of our writers talked to them about culture, identity and cuisine. Here’s more from this week’s Food section. • A long wait for a cast like this The last time a major Hollywood film set in the present featured a predominantly Asian cast was 1993, with “The Joy Luck Club.” “Crazy Rich Asians,” which is based on a best-selling novel, opens next week after an arduous casting process. • Best of late-night TV Trevor Noah relished the testimony of Rick Gates at the trial of his former boss, Paul Manafort: “He’s confessing to stealing from the same guy that he was committing crimes with. Like, Manafort must have been so mad — but also at the same time, so proud.” • Quotation of the day “Pound for pound, Stan Mikita was one of the greatest players of all time.” — Bobby Hull, the Hall of Fame hockey star, describing his teammate, who was 5-foot-8 and 150 pounds when he joined the Chicago Blackhawks in 1958. Mr. Mikita died on Tuesday at 78. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we’re reading Kate Phillips, a senior editor for health and science, recommends this article from STAT: “A pair of medical detectives searching for people with ALS and specific genetic mutations built a 250-page digital family tree, with about 6,700 names, eight generations, two intertwined families. This fascinating story follows the researchers’ forays into a region with a peculiar hold on the disease: the Cumberland Gap.” New York’s Restaurant Week, a promotional event offering dining deals across the city, is underway, so today we’re exploring the history of restaurants. Dining venues have existed since antiquity. Greeks and Romans ate at thermopolia, where customers could grab drinks and food from divots in L-shaped counters. In 13th-century China, eateries featured regional specialties and à la carte menus, and some consider them to be the predecessors of today’s restaurants. Globally, taverns and inns served food, but they focused primarily on alcohol or lodging. The word “restaurant” comes from 18th-century Paris, derived from the French verb restaurer, meaning to restore. According to the encyclopedia Larousse Gastronomique, a man named Boulanger opened an establishment near the Louvre in 1765 that served “bouillons restaurants,” or restorative broths. After the French Revolution, many chefs for well-to-do families lost their jobs and began emulating Boulanger’s business. Although his story is widely cited, the origin of the modern restaurant is not so clear. Rebecca Spang, a historian who has written about restaurants, said in an interview in 2000 that “there are simply no direct sources to demonstrate that someone called Boulanger existed and that he opened a restaurant.” Instead, she suggests the distinction should go to Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau, who opened a bouillon establishment in 1766 and called himself “the first restaurateur.” Matthew Sedacca wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,Ohio State Board Will Receive Report on Urban Meyer Investigation Wednesday,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — The results of a two-week investigation into how Ohio State’s football coach, Urban Meyer, handled domestic violence allegations against a longtime assistant coach will be presented to the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday, the university announced. Meyer, 54, one of the most accomplished and best-paid college football coaches in the country, has been on paid administrative leave since Aug. 1 after news reports indicated that he had been aware of domestic violence allegations against a former assistant coach, Zach Smith, since late 2015, when the accusations were made, and possibly years earlier. Meyer fired Smith in July, two months after he was charged with criminal trespassing at his ex-wife’s house, and days after she sought an order of protection against Smith. Further reports documented that Smith had been investigated but not prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2009, when he was a member of Meyer’s coaching staff at the University of Florida. Meyer defended his actions in a statement released two days after he was placed on leave. In it, he acknowledged that he had known about the accusations against Smith from years earlier — contradicting his initial public denial — and said he had always “followed proper reporting protocols and procedures” in dealing with them. Smith has denied ever abusing his ex-wife, Courtney Smith. Both are known to have met with the university’s investigators. Zach Smith is a grandson of Earle Bruce, a former Ohio State head coach who had been a mentor to Meyer before he died this year. Smith has been on nearly all of Meyer’s staffs since 2005, when Meyer joined Florida. Ohio State’s 20-member board was to receive an oral briefing on the findings of the Meyer investigation Monday, the university said in a statement, “to ensure that board members are adequately prepared to discuss this matter at Wednesday’s meeting.” The university’s president, Michael V. Drake, will make a decision on any punishment for Meyer after Wednesday’s board meeting. The inquiry has been led by a six-member working group comprising three trustees and three independent members. The group hired an outside law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, and one of its partners, the former United States Attorney Mary Jo White, to conduct the investigation. Ohio State’s athletic department is also dealing with the university’s revelation last month that more than 100 former students had accused a former team doctor, Richard H. Strauss, who died in 2005, of sexually abusing them, as well as a lawsuit alleging that a former assistant diving coach had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 16-year-old diver several years ago.",The New York Times
2018,Ohio State Gives Urban Meyer a 3-Game Suspension (and the Benefit of the Doubt),"COLUMBUS, Ohio — After a news report that raised questions about what the famed Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer knew about past domestic violence allegations against one of his closest assistant coaches, he wanted to know one important thing. How to delete old text messages on his phone. Meyer and a top athletic administrator discussed how to adjust the settings, a university report released on Wednesday said, and when Ohio State’s investigators obtained the phone, they discovered no messages on it older than a year. [RELATED: Details of the Ohio State report on Urban Meyer] Still, they gave him the benefit of the doubt, a running theme in the report that found missteps on Meyer’s part related to his handling of the case but no unassailable evidence of a cover-up or that he “deliberately lied” about his knowledge of the case. “We cannot determine,” the report said, “whether coach Meyer’s phone was set to retain messages only for one year in response to the Aug. 1 media report or at some earlier time.” “It is nonetheless concerning that his first reaction to a negative media piece exposing his knowledge of the 2015-2016 law enforcement investigation was to worry about the media getting access to information and discussing how to delete messages older than a year,’’ the report said. The university report, which led trustees to suspend Meyer for three games for not following proper procedures in informing administrators about a troubled employee, details a long list of problematic conduct by the assistant football coach Zach Smith: a 2013 charge of drunken driving; running up a $600 or so bill at a strip club on a recruiting trip; failing to show up at scheduled recruiting visits at high schools; taking sexually explicit photos of himself at the White House during a team visit; an addiction to a stimulant prescription drug used to treat A.D.H.D. that resulted in his being admitted into a drug treatment facility; and having a sexual relationship with a secretary on the football staff. All along, Meyer found reasons not to act or said he was not aware of what was going on. There were no criminal charges filed in the domestic violence case. He had talked to Smith, who promised to do better. He was unaware of certain messages Smith’s wife had sent to his wife, Shelley. Ultimately, Meyer fired Smith on July 23 after Smith’s former wife obtained an order of civil protection against him. “Repeatedly, Zach Smith’s conduct was met with reprimands and warnings by Coach Meyer, but never a written report, never an investigation and no disciplinary action until July 23, 2018,” the report said. Confronted by investigators delving into what he knew and when, Meyer admitted, “I followed my heart, not my head,” when handling Smith, whose grandfather Earle Bruce, a revered former Ohio State football coach, was a mentor to Meyer. “As I reflect, my loyalty to his grandfather Earle Bruce, who was my mentor, likely impacted how I treated Zach over the years,” Meyer said. The decision to suspend Meyer came after a marathon private meeting of the university’s board of trustees that stretched close to nine hours on Wednesday. As the meeting wrapped up, a group of fans stormed the building in which it was held, chanting support for Meyer. Against the backdrop of a nationwide, intensifying focus on addressing abuse of women, the board decided that Meyer’s missteps in the case did not rise to a cover-up but warranted punishment. The board deliberated extensively over how many games Meyer should miss and painstakingly reviewed the report that had been prepared by investigators, and it brought Meyer and others in for questioning, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a confidential session. Meyer was also suspended, without pay, for the remainder of the preseason — crucial preparation time for college teams. He will miss the season opener against Oregon State on Sept. 1, as well as games against Rutgers and Texas Christian, a top 20 team. He will, however, be permitted to work with the team outside of games beginning Sept. 2. Ohio State’s athletic director, Gene Smith, was also suspended without pay, from Aug. 31 to Sept. 16. Here are the findings of an independent investigation looking into Coach Urban Meyer’s handling of domestic violence accusations against Zach Smith, one of his assistant coaches. “Their handling of this matter did not exhibit the kind of leadership and high standards that we expect of our athletic director, head coach, assistant coaches and all on the football staff,” a university statement said. Meyer, one of the most successful coaches in college football — he won national championships with Ohio State in 2014 and with Florida in 2006 and 2008 — appeared somber at a news conference on Wednesday night following the board meeting. Meyer had been on paid administrative leave since Aug. 1 after allegations surfaced that Meyer knew Zach Smith had been accused of domestic violence since 2015, when the accusations were made. Meyer said in July that he had just learned of the case, but after being put on leave he released a statement saying he had misspoken and had “followed proper reporting protocols and procedures” after learning of the incident in 2015. Smith was fired in July. The university’s report said Meyer “did not deliberately lie.” The report said that Meyer had learned of the domestic abuse case from Gene Smith, the athletic director, and that they had monitored the case for months without following university protocol to inform other officials. The report, written by the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairwoman Mary Jo White and her team from the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, found that Meyer had acted in “good faith” in not reporting the allegations, but his actions were ultimately “not sufficient,” White said at the news conference on Wednesday night. Smith’s lawyer, Brad Koffel, released a statement on Wednesday evening: “Zach Smith married a woman he should not have married. Vengeance against her ex-husband regrettably resulted in collateral damage to Urban Meyer, Gene Smith and the Ohio State University. Trying cases in the media is a dangerous precedent for every other coach in America.” Meyer arrived midmorning to the site of the board’s meeting, the Longaberger Alumni House, just across from the football complex. Shelley Meyer showed up hours later. And in the late afternoon, some eight hours after the meeting began, Gene Smith entered the building. As evening approached, the clamor of football practice nearby could be heard under the direction of the interim coach, Ryan Day. The saga began in earnest on July 23, when Zach Smith was fired after the independent journalist Brett McMurphy reported on Facebook that Courtney Smith had requested a protection order against him. He also reported that Zach Smith had been accused of domestic violence in 2009, when he was an assistant to Meyer at Florida, and in 2015, when they were both at Ohio State. Courtney Smith, who is now divorced from Zach Smith, had said that Shelley Meyer had extensive knowledge of the abuse allegations in 2015, McMurphy reported. Courtney Smith’s story was supported by text messages, according to the report. A week earlier, at a news conference for the Big Ten Conference, Urban Meyer said that he had known of the 2009 accusations and that he and his wife had talked with the Smiths after a police investigation. But when confronted with questions about the 2015 allegations during the news conference, Meyer said he had learned of the accusations only the night before. The next week, he retracted that denial, saying in his statement that he had failed to be “clear, compassionate and, most of all, completely accurate” in his previous comments. Meyer, who has also coached at Bowling Green State and Utah, is entering his seventh year at Ohio State and has a career coaching record of 177-31, with an 11-3 record in bowl games. At Florida, along with the national championships came a string of players who had trouble with the law. He left the university in 2010, citing health and family reasons, but was hired a year later by Ohio State when the team was reeling from a tattoos for cash scandal. He righted the team quickly, going undefeated in his first season, though the team was ineligible for the postseason that year, and then won the national title in his third. He has not lost more than two games in any of his six seasons in Columbus. Ohio State’s revival has been mirrored by the rise of the Big Ten, which now rivals the Southeastern Conference as the best in the country. Meyer is set to make $7.6 million this season, among the highest salaries for college football coaches, and his contract runs through 2022. Because of his suspension, he will forgo six weeks of compensation. Ohio State has also been embroiled in a scandal over sexual abuse: More than 100 former students have said that Richard H. Strauss, a former university employee and team doctor, had sexually abused them. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, was an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State while Strauss was there and has faced questions about what he knew. He has denied knowledge of the allegations. An assistant diving coach has also been accused of being involved in an abusive relationship with a teenage athlete.",The New York Times
2018,"Ohio State Trustee Resigns, Saying Urban Meyer Punishment Was Too Soft","An Ohio State trustee has resigned, saying the punishment of the football coach Urban Meyer, a three-game suspension, should have been “more profound” after a report concluded he had mishandled domestic violence accusations against an assistant coach and had tolerated the assistant’s misbehavior for years. The trustee, Jeffrey Wadsworth, said in an interview on Thursday that he had stepped down from the board shortly after the university announced Mr. Meyer’s punishment last week. “I didn’t feel that I’d seen high-integrity behavior,” Mr. Wadsworth said of Mr. Meyer. He said he was the “lone voice” of dissent in advocating a harsher punishment but declined to specify what he had proposed or to speak in great detail about the closed-door negotiations, saying he wanted to respect the confidential words of board members. “Most people were concerned about whether it was a several-game suspension or not,” he said. “To me,” he added, “there was something altogether wrong about reducing it to a couple of games.” The state of Ohio and its flagship university have been consumed in recent weeks over the suspension of Mr. Meyer after a two-week university investigation overseen by three trustees and three independent members. It concluded that Mr. Meyer had failed to fulfill obligations to report the domestic violence allegations against an assistant coach, Zach Smith, to other university officials. The inquiry also found that Mr. Meyer had sought to delete records from his cellphone. And it found that Mr. Smith’s behavior, including failure to pay cellphone bills, a stint in rehabilitation for substance abuse and “promiscuous and embarrassing sexual behavior,” raised several other red flags. Mr. Smith has denied abusing his ex-wife. Investigators found discrepancies between Mr. Meyer’s account of some events and others’ and in at least one instance suggested that Mr. Meyer had lied to them. “You read the report,” Mr. Wadsworth said, “and there’s seven or eight things about emails, memory loss, hearing things five times, and to me, that raised an issue of standards, values — not how many games someone should be suspended for.” Mr. Wadsworth, a retired engineer and executive, is the first of the 20 board members to speak publicly about the matter, which has caused many in the Ohio State community to question the high value the university puts on sports. He is a former board chairman who has been a trustee since 2010. The board deliberated in a nearly 12-hour meeting last week before the university president, Michael V. Drake, announced the decision at a news conference. In a statement on Thursday, the university confirmed Mr. Wadsworth’s resignation. “The president and the board of trustees had a frank and comprehensive discussion last week,” the statement said. “A wide variety of perspectives were expressed in reaching a consensus. Mr. Wadsworth has been an exceptionally valuable member of the board. His service to the university is deeply appreciated, and we wish him the very best.” Mr. Wadsworth said in the interview that he had left the meeting at the lunch break, a few hours after it began, so he did not know the official result until it was announced, though he said he had had a good sense of what it would be. “It became clear to me where we were, discussing penalties, and I wasn’t ready to do that,” he said, explaining his early departure. “I was in a different place.” He “had larger concerns,” he said. “I felt that getting into a limited number of games that was a suspension missed the point of a bigger cultural concern about what message were we sending?” The meeting began with remarks from Dr. Drake, which were followed by the trustees taking turns offering their opinions, Mr. Wadsworth said. Although there was talk of a “range of options, from doing nothing to firing” Mr. Meyer, Mr. Wadsworth said, “that is different than deliberating it,” and the board quickly settled on a discussion of a suspension. The tone of the meeting remained respectful, he said, but he said he felt he needed to resign because he could not defend the outcome and because there had been no public accounting of members’ views. The university released two emails Mr. Wadsworth had sent to Dr. Drake and Michael J. Gasser, the board chairman, about an hour after the Aug. 22 news conference began, in which he tendered his resignation. “I heard enough in the meeting,” he wrote, “to persuade me that I do not want to be a party, through endorsing today’s decision or remaining on the Board, to implicitly or explicitly support current or future actions on such issues.” Mr. Wadsworth said he believed the punishment had come across as lenient, citing several articles published afterward, including a USA Today column with the headline “It’s Urban Meyer State University Now.” “I read all these articles,” Mr. Wadsworth said, “and I’m embarrassed.” Mr. Wadsworth, whose term would have expired in May, is one of the few remaining board members who were appointed by Ted Strickland, the previous Ohio governor. In June, Mr. Wadsworth was the lone member to vote against the 2019 budget. Mr. Wadsworth retired last year as president and chief executive of Battelle Memorial Institute. Battelle, which is based in Columbus, is a nonprofit center that explores new technologies. While at Battelle, Mr. Wadsworth managed several United States Department of Energy laboratories. He was also the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. On Wednesday, Mr. Smith, who was fired on July 23 by Mr. Meyer and the athletic director, Gene Smith, after a misdemeanor trespassing charge and a protection order against him were reported, broke his silence with an extended, angry thread of tweets. He accused the news media and his ex-wife, Courtney Smith, who had requested and received the order of protection, of misrepresenting events. He wrote on Twitter: “Let’s talk FACTS since so many people (mainly opposing fanbase’s fans) want to talk. 1. My kids are suffering because of all of this (most important) 2. I never beat my wife 3. OSU botched the investigation and worse off the ‘punishment.’” The Buckeyes, under an interim head coach, Ryan Day, host Oregon State in the season-opening game on Saturday.",The New York Times
2018,Ohio Teacher Sets Record for Rowing Alone Across the Atlantic,"It was not an auspicious start for Bryce Carlson, who was setting out from Canada to row across the North Atlantic by himself. One day after he left St. John’s, Newfoundland, on June 27, the main desalinator he planned to rely on for drinking water stopped working. Things did not improve much from there. About three days later, his boat capsized for the first of what would be about a dozen times. Seawater got into an electronics panel and the salt slowly began to corrode the connections, leaving his navigation system unreliable about halfway through his 2,000-mile journey (3,218 kilometers). Nonetheless, Mr. Carlson, a high school biology teacher from Cincinnati and an ultramarathoner, said he was able to remain “in the moment” 95 percent of the time, focusing solely on the five minutes ahead. Those five-minute increments would eventually stretch into 38 days, 6 hours and 49 minutes, setting a new speed record for a west-to-east solo and unsupported crossing of the North Atlantic, according to the Ocean Rowing Society International. Mr. Carlson also became the first American to complete that feat. Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow, the coordinator of the society, said that the time in which Mr. Carlson completed the journey was impressive (the previous record was 53 days 8 hours 26 minutes) but that his speed was even more remarkable. He arrived at St. Mary’s Harbor, in the Isles of Scilly in England, on Saturday, having recorded an average speed of 2.5 knots, compared with the previous record set in 2016 of an average speed of 1.86 knots, she said. For Mr. Carlson, 37, completing the journey was as much a psychological and financial challenge as it was a physical one. He personally took on about $85,000 in loans and credit card debt to underwrite costs of the trip, including the custom construction of his 20-foot boat, Lucille, named after his father’s mother. An additional $45,000 came from sponsors and online fund-raising. The debt was a source of stress, he said, adding: “I’m a teacher. I don’t have $85,000 sitting in a bank account.” A cross-country and track athlete in high school, Mr. Carlson said he found his niche when he joined the rowing team in college. From there, he began taking on ultramarathon races, which were critical in training him for the punishing toll of the trans-Atlantic voyage. A two-time participant in the Spartathlon in Greece, in which runners have 36 hours to run 153 miles (246 kilometers), Mr. Carlson also ran across the United States in a staged race, covering the equivalent of about 30 miles a day. Those events taught him how to manage the nagging inner voice that can sow doubt and undermine confidence, he said. “Spending any mental energy looking back cannot help you move forward,” he said. That kind of disciplined thinking allowed him to troubleshoot during various crises on the water. The first time the boat capsized, he was in its watertight cabin, but an air intake valve was open, allowing water in. The electronics became less reliable and would spontaneously shut off. He had multiple backup navigation systems, but the intermittent failures of the electronics were unnerving. “Were critical components going to fail and not come back on?” he said. The boat was built to right itself, “which it did brilliantly” each time, and the first capsizing did the worst damage, he said. Sleep came in fractured installments. He said he would sleep six hours a night, but might be awakened every hour or two. He started his journey weighing about 170 pounds and estimated he lost about 15. Rather than boasting forearms worthy of Popeye, he said at the end of his trip he was more sinewy than muscular from the high-intensity endurance of rowing. Eating became an uncomfortable chore. To take in the 4,000 to 5,000 daily calories he needed, he would frequently have to eat when he was not hungry. In addition, he developed an exercise-induced bout of acid reflux, which made eating even more troublesome. Relying on dehydrated meals did not help either. “That became very unappetizing very quickly,” he said. Inspiration came from the film scores of “Batman Returns,” “Lord of the Rings” and “Gladiator.” His playlist was diverse, with some heroic symphonies, electronic dance music from the ’80s and upbeat tunes from the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s playing through the boat’s built-in waterproof speakers. The last few hours of the journey required careful attention as he navigated around rocks and through channels. Pulling in to the harbor was less than a celebratory moment because of the emotional and physical fatigue, he said. “In that moment, it was not the three to five people I was expecting,” he said of the hundreds who gathered to greet him. “‘Surreal’ does not even come close relative to what I was expecting.” He said the preparations leading to his trip had taken a significant emotional toll and strain on his relationships. He said he was looking forward to spending more time as a dedicated coach and teacher and partner to his girlfriend. And now he can adjust his out-of-office email message, which read, “I’m away from my computer having the adventure of a lifetime, attempting to become the first American to row solo across the North Atlantic Ocean!”",The New York Times
2018,Oil and New Leadership Raised Hope in Guyana. But Political Rifts Are Resurfacing.,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana — The old tensions are rumbling again. Three years ago, Guyana attempted to set aside decades of ethnic divisions when it voted in a multiracial governing coalition that gave voice to a new generation of politics. With a promising discovery of oil offshore around that time, the future suddenly looked brighter for a country where most college-educated people emigrate to the United States, Canada and Britain. But old habits have proven hard to break. The political party that held power for 23 years, before the new coalition was voted in, is already accusing the government of stacking the decks for the national election in 2020. Government preparations for the first oil production in the country’s history are going slowly. And promised investigations into past corruption by successive governments have floundered. “We thought they would change everything, but they didn’t change anything,” Clement Dhanpat, a farmer of Indian descent, said as he walked out of a rice field on a recent day after spreading fertilizer. Mr. Dhanpat said he had been lured away from his traditional party to vote for the multiethnic coalition in the last national election. But now he is so disgusted that he may abstain in 2020. The new oil production will make no difference, he said, because “the oil is only going to help the politicians.” Guyana, which calls itself the Land of Six Peoples, is the only English-speaking country in South America. Its population of 750,000 is mostly divided between descendants of African slaves brought over by the Dutch and those descended from Indians brought over by the British as indentured laborers. Afro-Guyanese typically live in the capital and several towns, where they hold most of the jobs in government offices and the security forces, while Indo-Guyanese generally live in rural areas as rice and sugar farmers. The largest ethnic group, Indo-Guyanese are also numerous in the business community. And there is a small indigenous minority that mostly lives in remote regions. Votes are not based on ideology, with both major parties leaning left. But their competition goes back more than half a century, even before the 1966 independence from Britain. The nation’s two founders — Cheddi Jagan, an Indo-Guyanese, and Forbes Burnham, an Afro-Guyanese — vied for control in a bitter battle that led to election tampering, violence and labor strikes partly organized by C.I.A. agents. A growing number of young people have expressed a desire to move on from that past, leading to the 2015 election of President David A. Granger. A retired military commander who is Afro-Guyanese, Mr. Granger led the coalition to victory by a margin of fewer than 5,000 votes. His fractious group — which includes his People’s National Congress-Reform party and a third, multiethnic party — promised to take the country on a new course. The Granger government has increased funding for the national public university and raised teachers’ salaries, waged a campaign to combat the high rate of H.I.V. infection and AIDS, and upgraded the pumping system in Georgetown, the capital, to ease flooding. But Mr. Granger has passed up opportunities to reach out to the People’s Progressive Party, the predominately Indo-Guyanese party that ruled the country for decades. And his passive governing style has given space to ministers who seem to prefer taunting political opponents to seeking reconciliation. And while Mr. Granger has followed through on promises to slash subsidies for the sugar industry, putting thousands of Indo-Guyanese out of work, he has not cut the bloated government bureaucracy, which mostly employs Afro-Guyanese. The government also revoked a 99-year lease for a building that housed a research center dedicated to Mr. Jagan, and repossessed the building in late 2016. It argued that the lease had not been legally executed and that the building should also honor other past presidents. Though a court has since stayed the decision, the action was widely viewed as an attempt by Mr. Granger’s party to exert dominance. His office declined a request for an interview. The 2020 election will be held almost simultaneously with the production of the first oil in Guyana’s history, giving the next president an enormous advantage in wielding power. Within a few years, the government is expected to take in as much as $6 billion in annual royalties and taxes, a tremendous windfall in a small country. The opposition accuses Mr. Granger of laying the ground for fraud in the elections, and there have been hints by opposition leaders of protests to come. Following a practice introduced by former President Jimmy Carter in the 1990s to reduce political turmoil and election fraud in Guyana, the opposition in recent months provided Mr. Granger with three successive lists of candidates for chairman of the elections commission, which oversees the vote. They were turned down each time. Mr. Granger instead broke precedent and selected his own chairman. The action was legal under the Constitution, but the opposition cried foul. “This goes back to the old Burnhamite philosophy that if you are in power, you should never lose an election,” former President Bharrat Jagdeo, an Indo-Guyanese who is now the opposition leader, said in an interview. “They say, ‘It’s our turn now,’ and they trample on all institutions and safeguards.” One of those institutions is the National Assembly, housed in the stucco Parliament building, a British colonial relic with a regal dome and window balconies. The chamber, paneled in mahogany, is a hotbed of division. On a recent afternoon, the Assembly was considering a routine proposal to set term lengths for local offices amid a hail of fist pumping and finger pointing. The opposition accused the government of trying to undermine grass-roots democracy by gerrymandering local voting districts in a separate action, while Attorney General Basil Williams accused the opposition of “inequity for 23 years” in power. “Sit down, sit down,” opposition lawmakers called out to Mr. Williams as they laughed and refused to lift their gaze from their smartphones. Outside the chamber, the minister of natural resources, Raphael Trotman — an ally of the president’s and leader of the reformist third party in the coalition — acknowledged that Mr. Granger should have picked from the opposition’s election commission list. “I will accept that reconciliation has not been as easy to obtain and forge as we had hoped,” Mr. Trotman said. Mr. Carter last month urged President Granger and Mr. Jagdeo to begin a political dialogue to lower tensions. Yet skepticism persists about the potential for political change, even with the coming oil wealth. “The promise has not been fulfilled,” said Jason Calder, who as country representative for the Carter Center in Atlanta was an observer during the 2015 elections. “People wanted change, and the coalition represented that,” Mr. Calder said. “But the two major parties still need to come to a reconciliation.”",The New York Times

BOOM TOWN The Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, Its Chaotic Founding, Its Apocalyptic Weather, Its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-Class Metropolis By Sam Anderson Illustrated. 427 pp. Crown. $28. Within the first few pages of “Boom Town,” Sam Anderson offers readers a pre-emptive, wryly compassionate renunciation of his subject that most writers would never have the nerve to make. He confesses that he has written a history of Oklahoma City. “This may strike you as unnecessary, or unfortunate,” he admits. “If so, I would understand.” Let’s just say that Anderson had me at “unnecessary” and “unfortunate.” A critic at large for The New York Times Magazine, he goes on to describe Oklahoma City, which he first visited in 2012 to report on its N.B.A. franchise, as “unlikely, unreasonable, arbitrary.” Despite the rhetoric, however, it soon becomes apparent that in regard to “the great minor city of America” — given the sardonic context thus far, I think this constitutes high praise — the writer has discovered a subject that energizes him the way a birch-bark canoe roused John McPhee, the way a French meal stoked M.F.K. Fisher and the way the burning Bronx fired up Jonathan Mahler. Anderson begins at the very beginning, with the future Oklahoma City sitting at the bottom of an ancient ocean for the better part of 500 million years. Eventually the Rocky Mountains soared, the earth’s crust tilted, the seawater rushed off to the south, and before long (geologically speaking), April 22, 1889, arrived. On that Monday, Oklahoma City was born, at the stroke of noon, announced by bugle and cannon fire, when thousands of land-hungry settlers charged across the plains on their way to the imminent metropolis, where they were allowed by the federal government to grab formerly Native American territory for free. The city “was never more coherent than when it was nothing,” Anderson writes. “But it couldn’t stay nothing forever.” Many scoundrels and schemers had already been hiding for weeks in what were known as the “Unassigned Lands,” intent on gaining early access to the available property — hence their designation as “Sooners” and “Boomers,” tags that have been whitewashed into folksy monikers and team nicknames over the decades. At one point, Anderson re-enacts his own solo version of the Land Run by driving out to Choctaw, which served as one of the run’s starting points, ditching his car and trudging over a dozen blistered miles to the heart of modern-day Oklahoma City. Whereas nearly 130 years ago, the settlers raced under perfect skies across a promising landscape of tall prairie grass, blooming dogwoods and “primordial trees uncut,” Anderson staggers down the shoulder of Highway 62, past extinct strip malls, abandoned churches, a yard sale of animal cages and a Rottweiler straining against its chain. After a driver in a pick-up screams incoherently at him, he retreats into a Walgreens to buy sunscreen. “The route of the Land Run was filled with failure — ancient, recent, present and imminent,” Anderson writes. And there are times when Oklahoma City and its original promise appear to strike him as a perpetual example of the soul-altering fantasies of a boom town, of the abiding and destructive American hunger for instant success amid the usual financial desperation. Boom remains the operative word (and motif) throughout the book, serendipitously arising in different forms over the course of the city’s history. To be fair, boom is almost always accompanied by its unfaithful spouse, “bust.” Successions of oil and gas booms and busts have alternately enriched and depleted the city, starting in 1928 and continuing right up to the present with the advent of fracking, the extraction of natural gas through the destruction of underground rock formations, a process that has resulted in a drastic increase in earthquakes throughout the state, with their cacophony of seismic booms and rumbles. There are the supersonic booms that echoed through Oklahoma City in 1964 during Operation Bongo II, when the chamber of commerce volunteered the metropolis for a six-month experiment in how well its stoic citizenry could tolerate daily blasts from overhead jets in the forlorn hope that the city might become a hub for supersonic air travel. (Answer: not well; when the head of the F.A.A. visited during the experiment, he received multiple death threats.) There is the depraved, cataclysmic boom that reverberated across the city and nation from the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building by Timothy McVeigh, in which the force of the explosion produced a fiery 7,000-mile-per-hour wind, leading to the deaths of 168 citizens. And in a metaphorical sense, there is the premature boom of Oklahoma City’s relatively new N.B.A. team, the Thunder, which traded the rising star James Harden away in 2012, and seemingly abdicated a rare chance for precocious supremacy. (The basketball material, perhaps the book’s original impetus, is actually the weakest of the narratives, already yellowing like old newsprint, as chronicles of past sports seasons usually do.) Anderson may have a gimlet eye, but the nature of his civic scrutiny tends toward the affectionate. As a nominal East Coast elitist who works for a paper accused by red-state right-wingers of spawning “fake news,” he parachutes into flyover country (or maybe he’s tossed out of a tornado), hits the ground hard and appears to wake up and fall in love with the “not quite” middleness of Middle America. He comes to believe in Oklahoma City as a “radical experiment,” “an expression of American democracy or American foolishness.” “I felt a stake in its well-being,” he confides, a refreshing stance compared with the voyeuristic distance adopted by many journalists. And unlike navel-gazing yappers like Hunter S. Thompson, Anderson doesn’t splatter himself all over the story. He never drowns out anyone with his sly, entertaining voice. His sensibility, sophisticated though it may be, is generous enough to stand up and offer its seat to others. In fact, Anderson’s gonzo journalism, if it can even be called that, is beguilingly timid. At the ragged close of a festive night, he reluctantly participates in a scheme where Wayne Coyne, an Oklahoma City native and lead singer of the Flaming Lips, ushers a band of pranksters through the city’s Plaza District, each dripping paint from a different color of the rainbow onto the unassuming and ordinary streets. “I am not, by nature, a lawbreaker, have never even received a traffic ticket,” Anderson writes, “and I was terrified the entire time, and that terror was obvious in my line. It looked like purple was trying to secede from the color spectrum. I kept swerving away … pretending, absurdly … that I had no affiliation with these reckless hippie monsters who were sullying the civic landscape of an otherwise fine city.” Coyne is merely one of an array of vividly depicted Oklahoma City luminaries. Anderson produces a rich portrait of Stanley Draper, the city’s Robert Moses, who decided that “the earth had clearly made a mistake,” that the capital needed a mountain, and that he was going to build one, three or four hundred feet tall, and line it with azaleas. There’s Clara Luper, a charismatic African-American activist who was arrested 26 times for leading sit-ins and protests. Perhaps the most entertaining portrayal is of Gary England, the weatherman for Channel 9, who became a legend for his forecasts of tornadoes, and goes home after every weather disaster for a plate of nachos and a glass of wine. The city, too, becomes a singular character in its own right. As for the ultimate fate of this character, that appears to be contingent on the outcome of an ongoing contest between a red-state ideology of extreme individualism, preached and practiced by the city’s rich white conservatives, and the civic necessities of a more diverse metropolis. In 1912, Franz Kafka started working on a novel that would be called “Amerika,” one he would never finish, though it was eventually published after his death. The book ends with its protagonist, a German immigrant to the United States, hopping onto a train bound for Oklahoma, where he and fellow dispossessed migrants have been promised jobs with the so-called Theater of Oklahoma. It’s Kafka’s version of a land rush. But for all of the surrealism in “Amerika,” whose runic metaphysics helped give rise to the adjective “Kafkaesque,” the manuscript doesn’t begin to match the genuinely American phantasmagoria of “Boom Town.” What’s most surreal about Oklahoma City, as brilliantly rendered in Anderson’s wild and gusty history, is that this city is for real. A picture caption with an earlier version of this review, using information from The Associated Press, misstated the location and date of the land run in the photograph. The photo shows an 1893 land run in northwest Oklahoma; it does not show Oklahoma City settlers in 1889. Also, the bibliographic note with an earlier version of the review omitted the words “Its Apocalyptic Weather” from the subtitle.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Old Zimbabwe Is the New Zimbabwe ,"Zimbabwe’s constitutional court has upheld the election of Emmerson Mnangagwa as the president of the country. Ms. Chigumadzi is the author of a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe. The old guns have retained power in Zimbabwe. On Friday the country’s constitutional court confirmed Emmerson Mnangagwa, the leader of the incumbent Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, as the president after rejecting a legal challenge by the leading opposition party seeking the annulment of the results of the country’s July 30 election. According to the official results, the incumbent ZANU-PF led by Mr. Mnangagwa narrowly won the elections — the first after the fall of Robert Mugabe — with 50.8 percent of the vote, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance led by Nelson Chamisa won 44.3 percent of the vote. Mr. Chamisa disputed the results, describing them as “fraudulent, illegal and illegitimate,” and claimed he had won 56 percent of the vote. On Aug. 10, he challenged the results in the constitutional court, which led to the postponement of Mr. Mnangagwa’s inauguration. Despite the opposition’s optimism, the legal challenge was not expected to succeed owing to the judiciary’s tilt toward ZANU-PF since independence from British colonial rule in 1980. Mr. Mnangagwa, as mandated by the constitution, is expected to take the oath as president within 48 hours of the court’s ruling. After replacing Mr. Mugabe in November, Mr. Mnangagwa has been eager to gain legitimacy and would repeatedly say in public that “the people’s voice is the voice of God.” The ouster of Mr. Mugabe did bring about the end of petty oppression. The police stopped harassing and taking bribes from drivers on the roads. Zimbabweans actively exercised their newfound freedom to speak out: Many energetically insulted President Mnangagwa in their comments on his social media accounts. Murehwa, my ancestral village in Zimbabwe, is a ZANU-PF stronghold. In late March, as the campaign season was picking up, my family was surprised to see Mr. Chamisa lead the first opposition rally in the area in years, without any incident. In April, I attended a performance of “Operation Restore Regasi,” a political satire about the ouster of Mr. Mugabe, in Harare. The play was directed by the celebrated Zimbabwean playwright Daves Guzha. In late July, I had an event about a book I wrote interrogating the events and history leading up to Mr. Mugabe’s fall at the same venue. Despite concerns about the wisdom of holding such an event in high electoral season, we were freely able to discuss controversial subjects such as Gukurahundi — the term used in Zimbabwe to describe the killing and torture of thousands of civilians from the Ndebele minority in the Matabeleland province between 1983 and 1987. The Ndebeles were accused of being “dissident” supporters of Joshua Nkomo, a rival of Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Mnangagwa ran internal security for Mr. Mugabe at the time. Despite these tentative democratic openings, the cynicism about a fair electoral process remained. On the eve of the elections, a young cousin who supports the charismatic and young Mr. Chamisa remarked, “The boy will win, but the old man will rule.” Many of us, though hopeful about change, were hard-pressed to see an outcome where the old men, the veterans of the liberation struggle of the 1970s, would cede to young Mr. Chamisa the power they consolidated after deposing Mr. Mugabe. In early August, Mr. Chamisa’s supporters poured into the streets of Harare disputing the election results. In contrast to November, when Zimbabweans formed an unprecedented alliance with the military to force out Mr. Mugabe, the military and the police used tear gas, water canons and live bullets against protesters from the opposition. Six civilians were killed. The actions of the military and police after the elections made it clear that in Mr. Mnangagwa’s “New Zimbabwe,” citizens enjoy their constitutional rights at the discretion of the state. Members of the opposition parties continued to be harassed, assaulted and arrested. On Aug. 4, riot police interrupted a news conference held by Mr. Chamisa in Harare. To control the bad press, Mr. Mnangagwa sent a minister to disperse the riot police, tweeted his regrets and promised an independent investigation. The police have reportedly suspended 16 officers for their conduct during the crackdown on postelection demonstrations. Police had also charged Tendai Biti, an opposition leader and former finance minister, with inciting violence and protests by proclaiming that the opposition had won the elections. A threatened Mr. Biti sought refuge in Zambia but the Zambian officials handed him over to Zimbabwean police. When Mr. Biti was produced in a Harare court, many foreign diplomats and election observers attended to observe the proceedings. Mr. Biti’s case became a test of Mr. Mnangagwa’s treatment of his political opponents and had ramifications for Zimbabwe’s attempts to better its relations with the global political and business community in the post-Mugabe world. The United States, the European Union, the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees and several additional countries criticized the mistreatment of the opposition leaders and activists. To contain the fallout, Mr. Mnangagwa tweeted that he had “intervened” to ensure that Mr. Biti gets bail and is released. Mr. Mnangagwa’s announcement revealed the judiciary’s lack of independence from the governing party. The United States has enacted a new law imposing tougher conditions that Zimbabwe is expected to meet before the sanctions imposed upon the country during the Mugabe regime can be removed. After taking over as president in November Mr. Mnangagwa has repeatedly stated, including in these pages, that the “New Zimbabwe” is open for business and will ensure democratic and human rights for all. The new United States law insists that the recent Zimbabwean election must be “widely accepted as free and fair,” and its army has to act as “nonpartisan” and “respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons,” before the sanctions can be removed. Without shedding the sanctions, Zimbabwe cannot readily get loans from global financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The sanctions ban defense-related trade with Zimbabwe as well as government assistance for numerous programs. The postelection repression and the renewed American sanctions are derailing Mr. Mnangagwa’s attempts to find international acceptance and secure funding from the international community to rebuild Zimbabwe’s fragile economy. Zimbabwe is rife with tales of multiple centers of power within the establishment. Many believe that Mr. Chiwenga, the army general who ensured Mr. Mugabe’s ouster and Mr. Mnangagwa’s ascension as president, is the power behind the throne. As with Mr. Mugabe, the biggest challenge to Mr. Mnangagwa’s rule is likely to come from his own ranks.

2018,Olga Tokarczuk’s Book ‘Flights’ Is Taking Off,"Profile The Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk had to wait until she was 28 to receive a passport and make her first trip abroad. Like many Poles, Ms. Tokarczuk (pronounced To-KAR-chook) rejoiced when over 40 years of Soviet-induced international isolation finally came to an end. The destination was hardly an exotic one — East Germany in 1990 — but it signaled the beginning of Ms. Tokarczuk’s love affair with travel and a delectable way of writing about it that continues to evolve. In May, Ms. Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize for her novel “Flights,” which treats travel as a uniquely corporeal experience. “Flights” is made up of 116 vignettes — both fiction and nonfiction — ranging from a Polish man’s desperate search for his wife and child after they disappear during a vacation in Croatia, to a historical account of Chopin’s heart being smuggled into Warsaw beneath his sister’s skirt. Critics have compared Ms. Tokarczuk’s nonlinear novels and short stories, which are often punctuated by mysterious maps and diagrams, to the work of celebrated European authors like W.G. Sebald and Milan Kundera. With “Flights,” Ms. Tokarczuk, 56, became the first Polish writer to win the British prize which is now awarded annually to a book in English-language translation. The Polish-born British writer Lisa Appiganesi, who chaired the judging, commended Ms. Tokarczuk’s novel for its narrative voice “which moves from wit and gleeful mischief to real emotional texture.” “Flights,” which sold over 160,000 hardcover copies when it was published in Poland in 2007 and won the country’s prestigious Nike Award, is being released in the United States by Riverhead Books on Aug. 14. In a recent Skype interview Ms. Tokarczuk said that when she began writing “Flights,” more than a dozen years ago, she set out to describe a world very different from the one we are living in now. “I wrote this book when the world was looking to be open for everybody,” she said. “Now we’re seeing how the European Union will probably become weakened by the policies of countries like Poland and Hungary, which are focused on their borders once again.” Speaking from her home in Wroclaw in southwestern Poland, Ms. Tokarczuk also referenced President Trump’s plan to build a wall on the United States border with Mexico. “Twelve years ago there was no mention of the idea of walls or borders, which were originally adopted by totalitarian systems,” she said. “Back then I must admit that I was sure that we had put totalitarianism behind us.” Ms. Tokarczuk’s first book was a volume of poetry (“Cities in Mirrors”) published in Poland in 1989. She has since gone on to write eight novels and two short story collections, which have made her a literary celebrity in her native country. Many of these — such as her breakthrough novel “Primeval and Other Times,” which was published in Poland in 1996 — have been written in the picaresque tradition and reflect the upheavals of Polish history. “Flights” is not her only book to be translated into English, but it is the first one to establish her international reputation. Its journey to translation owed everything to the persistence of its American translator Jennifer Croft who spent 10 years speaking to editors and publishing excerpts from the book in magazines like N+1 and Bomb. Ms. Croft, who received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to do the translation, eventually convinced the rising British independent publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions to gamble on “Flights,” which was released in Britain in 2017 to glowing reviews. “A lot of ‘Flights’ is about forging human connections and considering the other,” Ms. Croft said also via Skype. “So I think it happened to hit in the U.K. at a good moment right after Brexit, and I think probably that the reception in the U.S. is going to be similar.” Ms. Tokarczuk, who worked for several years as a clinical psychologist after graduating from the University of Warsaw in 1985, spent time traveling alone during the period when she wrote “Flights.” “I had just gotten divorced and had a huge need to change my life,” she said. “I found that traveling on my own created a different state of mind because when you travel with your partner or a friend there is an endless tendency to exchange information, feelings and associations.” While roaming Europe and Asia, Ms. Tokarczuk kept a logbook of her experiences but decided it was impossible to write a linear book of memoirs about traveling. “I realized that we don’t travel in such a linear way anymore but rather jump from one point to another and back again,” she said. “So I got this idea for a ‘constellation’ novel recounting experiences that were separate from each other but could still be connected on different psychological, physical and political levels.” Ms. Tokarczuk likened herself to a tailor making a dress. “The dress is beautiful and comfortable to wear,” she said. “But like the reader, the person who wears it is not expected to know precisely how all the materials that make it are connected.” When Ms. Tokarczuk finished writing “Flights” she gathered all her pages and spent a week studying them spread out on the floor of her living room. “It was funny because I had to climb onto a table to see how they looked from a high vantage point,” she said. “I trusted my intuition to find the book’s order, and I wouldn’t change anything now.” “Flights” is narrated by a nameless female traveler who is not so unlike the author herself. “The narrator is partly me and sometimes something more than me,” Ms. Tokarczuk said. As part of her research for “Flights” she enrolled at a university in Amsterdam to study the history of anatomy. Her narrator is obsessed by “trailing the errors and blunders of creation.” So naturally “Flights” is full of fascinating excursions to dusty waxwork museums and laboratories where flayed bodies and anomalous human life-forms are on display. If there is a central character in “Flights” then it is the human body, which is built to suffer. “It’s a very delicate vehicle that we have to travel through the world with and through time,” Ms. Tokarczuk said. In “Flights” “the bodies in motion” often belong to those on the fragile margins of society: an alcoholic ferry conductor with a penchant for “Moby Dick,” or a frantic single mother who decides to abandon her home and child. “This is something you can find in my other books too,” Ms. Tokarczuk said. “Reality is like a doughnut: Everything that is good and funny and juicy is outside the center, which is just emptiness.” Since “Flights” won the Man Booker prize, Fitzcarraldo has begun to ramp up other translations of Ms. Tokarczuk’s books. Foremost among these is “The Books of Jacob,” another winner of the Nike Award, which is scheduled to be released in Britain, in an English-language translation by Ms. Croft, in August 2019. This historical novel exploring the life of Jacob Frank, the Polish leader of a heretical Jewish splinter group that converted to Islam and then Catholicism, ranges nomadically across the Hapsburg and Ottoman Empires. Its message of tolerance caused a certain amount of consternation when it was published in Poland in 2014. “It’s about the freedom of not only changing the places you live in but also your culture and identity,” Ms. Tokarczuk said of her latest novel. “I think the deepest level of our freedom is being able to change our identity.”",The New York Times

2018,Olympian Erin Hamlin Marries a Childhood Playmate,"Vows Jonathan Hodge has a reputation for pulling off small miracles on the basketball court. But the miracle he’s proudest of — sweeping four-time Olympian Erin Hamlin off her feet — lends itself less to repeat viewings by his core audience of hoops fanatics and goggle-eyed Minnesota schoolchildren. Mr. Hodge, 33, a physical education teacher and assistant high school basketball coach in Barnesville, Minn., met Ms. Hamlin, 31, when he was 9 and she was 8, in the summer of 1994. He knew even then she was his kind of girl. “I didn’t chase her into the sandbox or anything,” he said. “But I’m pretty sure I had the hots for her.” They were forced playmates. Mr. Hodge’s father, Bruce, an electrician, was wiring a house in a forestlike 100-acre property in Remsen, N.Y., being built by Ms. Hamlin’s parents, Ron and Eilleen. Mr. Hodge and his sister, Jennifer, often tagged along. Their presence on the Hamlin property wasn’t unusual. In addition to being the Hamlins’ electrician, Bruce was Ron’s volleyball buddy in a local adult league. Like their fathers, Ms. Hamlin, Mr. Hodge and their siblings fell into playing together. “There was no finished house to play in, so we’d spend a lot of time outside, making forts and playing in trees,” Ms. Hamlin said. But that fall, the Hodge siblings left for school in Minnesota where, since their parents’ divorce in 1993, they lived with their mother, Kristie Tweeton Hodge. The forest playmates forgot each other. And even though Mr. Hodge and Jennifer returned to Remsen every summer, they never reconnected with Ms. Hamlin as children. Mr. Hodge eventually graduated from Barnesville High School in 2003 and set out to earn his teaching degree. By then, Ms. Hamlin was on her way to becoming the first American to medal in the singles competition in luge, a sport still mystifying to many Americans. Lugers lie on their backs while sledding down icy tracks up to 90 miles per hour with no brakes. Ms. Hamlin started when she was 12. Her father, who goes by the nickname Fella, was an engineer at Verizon, then one of the Olympic team’s sponsors. He saw a flier at work offering children a chance to try the sport in nearby Syracuse and thought his sporty daughter might be interested. “It seemed like something different, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into,” said Ms. Hamlin, who competed in her final Olympics this year and was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. On her first try in 1998, she wasn’t a natural, she said. By the time she was a junior at Remsen High School, she was still what she called “middle of the pack.” But by 2006, when she was 20, she represented the United States in the Olympics in Torino, Italy. Half a world away in Minnesota, Mr. Hodge was having flashbacks. Though he wasn’t a luge enthusiast, he heard about Ms. Hamlin’s ascent to the Olympics from relatives in Remsen and remembered her from their fort-making days. From afar, he started following her athletic career. “I’m a pretty big sports fan in general,” said Mr. Hodge, the basketball wizard behind a series of YouTube videos called “Trick Shot Friday,” in which he performs stunts like shooting baskets off a trampoline. The origins of “Trick Shot Friday” are with his elementary school students, who challenged him his first year as a phys-ed teacher to shoot from half court one Friday afternoon. That shot landed and he kept up the tradition, getting more creative with his stunts by the year. Last year, a “Trick Shot Friday” excerpt landed on “America’s Funniest Home Videos.” With Pepsi and We Are Teachers, a site for educators, he recently released “Trick Shot Recycling” to promote recycling. He is not quite the celebrated athlete Ms. Hamlin is, though. In Sochi in 2014, she won the singles bronze medal, becoming the first American of either gender to medal in a singles race and the first American woman luger to medal in any winter games. If she hadn’t, she might never have reunited with Mr. Hodge. Three months after earning her Olympic titles, she accepted a request to be the commencement speaker for Remsen High’s class of 2014. Mr. Hodge’s cousin, Spencer Lennon, was among the graduates. “My sister and I were sitting in the stands, and we were like, ‘Oh, that’s Erin Hamlin.’” Mr. Hodge said. “I was intrigued by her speech. It was about dreaming big and had a sky’s-the-limit type message, but it wasn’t clichéd. Plus she was super attractive. I was really into it.” Later, in a twist that seemed too good to be true, Ms. Hamlin came with her parents, who were still friendly with the Hodges, to Mr. Lennon’s backyard graduation party. Mr. Hodge was starry eyed. “He went in for a handshake, but I’m a hugger, so I guess I made the first move,” Ms. Hamlin said. The hug emboldened Mr. Hodge. “After I got that hug I went from nervous to python mode,” he said. “I was like, O.K., sweet. I’m going to step up the connect.” He asked her to be his teammate in a Frisbee game called KanJam. That, both say, is when the flirting started. Despite being in python mode, Mr. Hodge was too nervous to ask for Ms. Hamlin’s number when the night wound down. So he mentioned a street party in Utica happening later that week. “I had very little game. I was just wishing on a star,” he said. But the wish came true. In Utica, “we talked a ton and basically caught up on 20 years,” Ms. Hamlin said. By the end of the night, Mr. Hodge told Jennifer she would be flying back to Minnesota alone. “Jenny was like, ‘You’re nuts,’” Mr. Hodge said. But he stayed in New York anyway. When he left two weeks later to resume his P.E. classes, it was with an agreement from Ms. Hamlin that they would learn to navigate a long-distance relationship. They had their own cheering squad in the endeavor. “My dad was so happy,” Mr. Hodge said. “He was like, ‘You’re going to mess this up.’ What he meant was, O.K., prove me wrong.” Fella Hamlin was also rooting for them. “He thought it was sweet that his daughter was with his buddy’s son,” Ms. Hamlin said. And Spencer Lennon’s mother, Stephanie Lennon, knew as early as the KanJam game in her back yard that it was meant to be. “I had never seen Jon that in awe. We all wanted it to work out,” she said. Ms. Hamlin and Mr. Hodge were so in love they didn’t need the familial encouragement, though. Since the fall of 2014 they have made a practice of not letting more than eight weeks pass without a visit. And they talk at length daily. “People ask me all the time, How do you guys do the long-distance thing?” Mr. Hodge said. “But at the end of the day I want to be with her. So it’s not hard, it’s necessary.” Summers together in Remsen have been especially hardship-free, with the exception of last summer, when Mr. Hodge was struggling with how to propose. By July 4, he found what he called a “low-profile” ring at Lennon’s Jewelry Shop, owned by Mr. Lennon’s uncle, in New Hartford, N.Y. (“I knew she didn’t want anything sticking high off her hand because of her lifestyle,” he said. “It was kind of a safety protocol.”) By July 12, he had the ring in his pocket. But he still hadn’t come up with the perfect way to ask Ms. Hamlin to be his wife. Breakfast provided inspiration. Early in their relationship, Mr. Hodge found a box of Cheerios in Ms. Hamlin’s car. They commiserated over having the kind of parents who never let them eat sugary cereal before Mr. Hodge, on an ice cream outing, threw a handful into his cup for crunch. Cheerios became a staple in the cupboard of the Remsen apartment they share each summer. So is peanut butter, but only because Mr. Hodge can’t live without it. On the afternoon of July 17, while Ms. Hamlin was at the gym, he sent her a text: “Forgot to buy peanut butter. Can you pick some up?” The ploy to buy some extra time worked: When Ms. Hamlin arrived home, Mr. Hodge had spelled the words “Will you marry me?” in tiny oat circles up a staircase lit with tea candles. “I was crouching behind a door, waiting for her to get up the stairs. I was like, ‘Hurry up!,’” he said. When she opened the door and found him, he was on one knee, ring in hand. Ms. Hamlin’s reply to the question “Will you marry me?” was, “For real?” “We were both kind of shaking — It’s hard to remember because it was such a massive moment,” Mr. Hodge said. At some point, though, “yes” was uttered. On July 28, in Fella and Eilleen Hamlin’s still woodsy, sprawling back yard, the couple was married before 300 guests by Mr. Hodge’s college friend Brian Boettcher, who was ordained though American Marriage Ministries. Ms. Hamlin wore a beaded, floor-length white dress with spaghetti straps from Anthropologie’s BHLDN line and her hair in a long French braid; Mr. Hodge wore a gray linen suit. Ms. Hamlin, who had lost a game of rock, paper, scissors to Mr. Hodge earlier and had to read her handwritten vows second, said she never fathomed she would marry the boy she met in just that spot more than 20 years earlier. “But the universe had a plan,” she said. Mr. Hodge, who had read his vows first, had to pause twice to gather himself. He promised to always match or exceed Ms. Hamlin’s sense of adventure. Then he said, “every day away from you was worth every second. Today I’m the luckiest dude in the world.”",The New York Times
2018,"Omarosa Manigault Newman Releases Tape of Lara Trump’s $15,000-a-Month Job Offer","Omarosa Manigault Newman released a secret recording on Thursday that she said backed her claim that President Trump’s daughter-in-law had offered her a $15,000-a-month contract in exchange for her silence about her time as a White House adviser. The audio, released during an interview on MSNBC, is the latest in the trickle of recordings that Ms. Manigault Newman has made public to bolster the credibility — and sales — of her tell-some book, “Unhinged,” about her tenure at the White House. In the book, she claimed that the Trump 2020 campaign, which is partly overseen by Lara Trump, who is married to Mr. Trump’s son Eric, offered her a salary equal to what she had earned before being fired from the White House in December. Ms. Trump noted on the tape, which Ms. Manigault Newman said was recorded days after she was fired, that the money would come from campaign donors. “All the money that we raise and that pays salaries is directly from donors, small-dollar donors for the most part,” Ms. Trump said. “So I know you, you were making 179 at the White House, and I think we can work something out where we keep you right along those lines.” In a statement, Ms. Trump said that she had shared a bond with Ms. Manigault Newman during the 2016 campaign “as a friend and a campaign sister, and I am absolutely shocked and saddened by her betrayal and violation on a deeply personal level.” “I hope it’s all worth it for you, Omarosa, because some things you just can’t put a price on,” she continued. The tapes of Ms. Manigault Newman’s private conversations with Mr. Trump and other officials connected to him have rattled the White House in a way that few things other than the special counsel investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia have. Mr. Trump’s aides have been concerned that they will make appearances on other tapes, of which Ms. Manigault Newman is believed to have as many as 200. Her willingness to slowly deploy the tapes for maximum effect is straight from Mr. Trump’s playbook, which includes boasts of relying on “truthful hyperbole” to engage people, of threatening to expose people with recordings and of claiming to have scurrilous information about people that he might reveal at any moment. “Believe me,” Ms. Manigault Newman said on MSNBC, invoking one of Mr. Trump’s favorite phrases to convey his sincerity, “my tapes are much better than theirs.” Ms. Manigault Newman is not the only person who has caused Mr. Trump harm with his own tactics. Another is Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, who told allies he did not want to be made the scapegoat for Mr. Trump’s legal troubles. Mr. Cohen secretly recorded a conversation in which he and Mr. Trump discussed payments from The National Enquirer’s parent company to a Playboy model who had claimed she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s campaign said it had no knowledge of the payments, but the recording was made before those denials. Michael Avenatti — who represents Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who also said she had an affair with Mr. Trump and was paid hush money by Mr. Cohen — has also used the president’s own tactics to rattle him. Mr. Avenatti has waited for Mr. Trump to make denials and has then dribbled out contradictory information. He has been omnipresent on cable news, just as Mr. Trump was in 2016. On Thursday, officials at Simon & Schuster, the publisher of “Unhinged,” said they had received a legal warning letter against publication from Charles Harder, the libel lawyer whom Mr. Trump has retained in other matters. The publisher’s lawyer responded in kind, saying the president was using the highest platform in the land to censor someone. Some major donors to Mr. Trump were bothered by the revelations that the campaign may have been used as a slush fund to pay fired or troublesome employees, said Dan K.

Kelly, the White House chief of staff, as he fired her in December in the Situation Room, a breach of security protocols, but one that revealed him suggesting that she could face damage to her reputation if she did not leave quietly. The recording was played on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where Ms. Manigault Newman, a former adviser to President Trump, promoted her new book, “Unhinged.” In the memoir, which focuses on her relationship with Mr. Trump going back to her time on “The Apprentice,” she describes the world around the president as a cult in which he creates his own reality. On the recording, Mr. Kelly says Ms. Manigault Newman could be facing “pretty significant legal issues” over what he alleged was misuse of a government car. She denied misusing it. “I’d like to see this be a friendly departure,” Mr. Kelly says on the tape. “There are pretty significant legal issues that we hope don’t develop into something that, that’ll make it ugly for you.” “But I think it’s important to understand,” he adds, “that if we make this a friendly departure, we can all be, you know, you can look at, look at your time here in, in the White House as a year of service to the nation. And then you can go on without any type of difficulty in the future relative to your reputation.” Ms. Manigault Newman explained to Chuck Todd, the host of “Meet the Press,” that she recorded that conversation, as well as others that she has played for reporters and book publishers featuring her conversations with Mr. Trump, because “this is a White House where everybody lies.” The Situation Room is supposed to be devoid of personal electronic devices, which signs outside the room make clear. Former national security officials said it was not clear whether Ms. Manigault Newman had broken any laws, but she certainly violated the rules around what is supposed to be one of the most secure rooms in the capital. Privately, officials who worked with Ms. Manigault Newman said it was the type of damn-the-rules behavior that she had engaged in for months and which bothered many of her colleagues — but not Mr. Trump, who had to be cajoled into letting her be dismissed. People close to the White House said that she was a difficult colleague and that despite complaining of being blackballed by Mr. Kelly, Ms. Manigault Newman had indicated to incoming West Wing staff during the transition that they could face bad press if they did not give her a prominent role. Even Mr. Trump had begun wearying of Ms. Manigault Newman’s omnipresence in meetings by the middle of his first year, those people said. In a statement late Sunday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “The very idea a staff member would sneak a recording device into the White House Situation Room shows a blatant disregard for our national security — and then to brag about it on national television further proves the lack of character and integrity of this disgruntled former White House employee.” No White House official offered an explanation for why Ms. Manigault Newman was hired in the first place if people had such concerns about her. Mr. Trump has long been known to tape conversations over the phone and in person in his office at Trump Tower. He has threatened to produce tapes in the past as a way to instill fear in enemies, such as the fired F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. In turn, Ms. Manigault Newman and another former Trump employee, Michael D. Cohen, who was once his personal lawyer, both taped key moments involving their time with Mr. Trump. White House officials and Mr. Trump have portrayed Ms. Manigault Newman and Mr. Cohen, who is under investigation in New York, as disgruntled and discredited figures. “I think it’s incredibly important in Trump world that you protect yourself, because everyone constructs their own reality,” Ms. Manigault Newman told The New York Times on Sunday. “People around him try to reinforce that manufactured reality.” Ms. Manigault Newman claims that in one tape, Mr. Trump uses a racial slur in off-camera remarks during his time on “The Apprentice.” She describes the tape in her book but has said she does not have it herself. When Mr. Todd asked Ms. Manigault Newman if she had ever heard the president say the slur, she said, “You know, I was in his presence when he said inappropriate things, but he has never said the N-word in my presence. Ever.” She did not say which “inappropriate things” she had heard. But Ms. Manigault Newman said that, after finishing her book, she had gone to Los Angeles to visit a person who had a copy of the tape in which Mr. Trump is said to use the slur. “I heard his voice, as clear as you and I are sitting here,” she told Mr. Todd, adding: “It confirmed that he is truly a racist.” As Mr. Todd read quote after quote over several years in which Ms. Manigault Newman defended Mr. Trump in public, she said she had played a role in selling the administration’s version of reality to the public, calling herself “totally complicit.” “In fact, I had a blind spot where it came to Donald Trump,” she said. “I wanted to see the best in him. And obviously I, I felt miserably.” On ABC News’s “This Week,” the White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway, was pressed on Ms. Manigault Newman’s claim that she was offered a hush-money contract with the Trump re-election campaign for $15,000 a month. It is the same amount that a few others who have departed the White House under inauspicious circumstances are receiving. Ms. Conway said “that is not what was offered” to Ms. Manigault Newman. She acknowledged that all West Wing officials had signed nondisclosure agreements, a measure that Mr. Trump relied on for decades as a real estate developer. “Why wouldn’t we?” she asked when the host, Jon Karl, pressed her on the issue. Former White House lawyers and government ethics experts have said the agreements raised serious legal questions and reflected Mr. Trump’s refusal to submit to the norms of public disclosure or respect free speech rights. Ms. Conway said Ms. Manigault Newman was manufacturing events. “I have worked alongside that man for over two straight years now without interruption; I have never a single time heard him use a racial slur about anyone,” she said. “And it’s — and I also never heard Omarosa complain that he had done that. And so the only thing that’s changed is that she’s now selling books.”",The New York Times
2018,"On Broadway, Near La Salle","Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: It happened on a Sunday evening. My girlfriend and I were heading up Broadway near La Salle Street when we noticed a delivery man with a scooter standing near the curb and looking down into a storm drain. His mouth was open as if in disbelief or perhaps worry that his deliveries were late and getting cold. I approached him, and found out that his key ring had fallen down the drain. Despite a language barrier — I learned later that he was from Burkina Faso — we were on the same page. We shined the flashlights on our cellphones through the grate and spotted the keys near the rim of a pipe. I headed for my apartment, which wasn’t far away, to get a wire hanger. My girlfriend stayed behind. A lot went on while I was away. One man stopped and spoke to the delivery man in French before positioning his car to keep other drivers away. A second man arrived on a bike and took out a high-powered flashlight. Then another delivery man pulled up on a scooter. Finally, a cab stopped and a woman got out. She asked in Spanish what was happening. She also wanted to help. When I returned, we all crouched down around the drain under the high-powered light. I bent the hanger into a more helpful length and lowered it through the grate. Carefully, I hooked the key ring. By this point, a small crowd had gathered on the sidewalk. When the brassy shine of the key ring emerged from the grate, cheers echoed across the block. Then we all said our goodbyes. It was getting late, and we had somewhere to go.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | On Chores and Life Lessons,"letters Readers discuss their value to children, or a lack thereof. To the Editor: In “Happy Children Do Chores” (Sunday Review, Aug. 9), KJ Dell’Antonia says that the way to make your children caring, ethical, happy and successful is to require them to do chores. I beg to differ. In preindustrial society, “chores,” or “tasks,” that children performed were genuine contributions to the family’s economic survival, whether to gather the eggs or milk the cow or something similar. In industrial-postindustrial society, so-called chores are merely empty exercises that teach children no more than that they can be bullied into performing meaningless labor. Let me add that I never asked my daughter even to clean her room. My attitude was that if her room was untidy, and if that bothered me, then I should clean it. In addition, I never wanted even to ask her to do anything that in any way could be construed as a gender-specific task. In short, in my humble opinion, chores are for chumps. Bob ZaslavskyDecatur, Ga. To the Editor: When my children were in high school, one of them announced that I was a great parent because I had taught them something important: “Mom, the greatest thing you ever taught us was how to do the laundry.” I was hoping for better, but at least I had taught them a skill they could use.

2018,"On Hunt for Content, AT&T Closes Deal for Chernin’s Otter Media","LOS ANGELES — Jesse Jacobs, president of the Chernin Group, felt defeated. It was July 12, 2013, and Mr. Jacobs had just found out that a crucial deal — the independent media company’s proposed purchase of Hulu, in partnership with AT&T — had collapsed. Hulu’s owners had decided not to sell after all. “It was like Lucy pulling up the football from Charlie Brown at the last second,” Mr. Jacobs said. Still convinced that streaming services like Hulu were Hollywood’s future, Mr. Jacobs and his boss, the longtime media executive Peter Chernin, started acquisition talks the next day with Crunchyroll, a little-known streamer of anime videos. They bought it for $75 million, nurtured it, added other new media start-ups around it in a holding company called Otter Media — and sold the collection to AT&T on Tuesday. Analysts valued the deal, which had long been expected, at more than $1 billion. With the purchase, Otter Media ranks as one of the most valuable media upstarts of the last decade, said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates, a firm that focuses on emerging consumer technology. Others include Twitch, which streams video game sessions and was sold to Amazon for $970 million in 2014. “Otter is certainly a win,” Mr. Sappington said, noting that other new media companies have imploded — the most recent being AwesomenessTV, which was valued at $650 million in 2016 and sold to Viacom last month for about $50 million. “The challenge ahead for Otter is staying hot,” he added. “It’s not easy, as we just saw with Awesomeness.” Mr. Chernin predicted that AT&T would accelerate Otter’s growth by combining it with its new entertainment empire. In June, AT&T completed its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, which includes HBO, Warner Bros. and the Turner cable networks. John Stankey, chief executive of WarnerMedia, as Time Warner has been renamed, will oversee Otter. Mr. Stankey said in a statement that AT&T planned to “harness Otter’s expertise” to strengthen its own digital assets. He did not say which ones, but Warner Bros. owns niche video companies like Machinima, which focuses on gamers, and Boomerang, which offers episodes of classic cartoons like “The Flintstones” and “Scooby-Doo.” In addition to Crunchyroll, Otter owns Fullscreen, a studio and advertising agency for YouTube stars, or “online creators,” as Otter calls them; and Rooster Teeth, which makes video aimed at gamers, operates a streaming channel and has a growing events business. VRV, pronounced “verve,” is another Otter-owned video service. It bundles and delivers 11 niche online channels, including Cartoon Hangover and DramaFever, which focuses on Korean soap operas. Otter’s streaming services have more than two million paying subscribers in total, on par with CBS All Access. Otter also owns stakes in Gunpowder & Sky, a digital studio led by Van Toffler, who ran MTV during its “Beavis and Butt-Head” heyday; and Hello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon’s production company, which has sold multiple series to Apple for its coming streaming service. “They look at Otter as strategically key to several things they are trying to do, including serving customers with every type of content delivered through every possible distribution channel,” Mr. Chernin said of AT&T, which has been a minority investor in Otter since its founding in April 2014. It had long been anticipated that AT&T would buy Otter from the Chernin Group, whose investors include Providence Equity and Michael Bloomberg. AT&T delayed the purchase last year after the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. AT&T won that case in June and closed the acquisition, although the federal government has since mounted a new court effort that could dismantle the deal. Tony Goncalves, Otter’s chief executive, declined to say whether Otter was profitable. But he did give a hint about what AT&T has planned. “You’ll see a good amount of cross pollination, where some of that really wonderful Warner intellectual property and content will find its way into the businesses that are part of the Otter portfolio today,” said Mr. Goncalves, who was previously a senior AT&T executive overseeing digital initiatives, including the introduction of DirecTV Now, a streaming offering. AT&T, with its vast data on cellphone and broadband subscribers, plans to tailor ads on the Turner networks, which include CNN and TNT, based on who is watching. Otter will give AT&T more digital advertising inventory to sell the same way. Mr. Chernin, 67, and Mr. Jacobs, 42, began to invest aggressively in streaming at a time when Hollywood was hesitant to embrace the technology. Four years ago, some media executives were publicly scoffing that cord-cutting fears were overblown. Hulu’s owners could not decide what to do with the service. Netflix had only about 12 million subscribers — it now has 130 million. But the Chernin Group had a theory. “With every new wave of technology, great new brands emerge, and we wanted to own those brands,” Mr. Jacobs said. “They certainly weren’t going to be incubated inside the large media companies,” where they would have to compete for resources. The men focused on niches with hyper-passionate fan bases. “Fans willing to pay for video, buy merchandise, buy tickets to live events, engage with advertisers associated with the brand,” Mr. Jacobs said. About 100,000 people paid to attend Rooster Teeth fan conventions last year, for instance. Rooster Teeth-branded merchandise (hats, shirts, socks, beer mugs) generated millions of dollars in sales. Not every bet has paid off. Otter bought Creativebug, a maker of arts and crafts videos, in 2014 for about $10 million. Creativebug’s fan base never solidified, and Otter sold it for a loss last year. An effort to develop a site called Soompi into a destination for fans of Korean entertainment failed. Otter also had a setback with Fullscreen, which introduced and then shut down a subscription on-demand platform. For Mr. Chernin, the Otter sale raises the question of what he will do next. There has been speculation in Hollywood that he is planning to raise at least $500 million to invest in a new generation of media start-ups. Mr. Chernin declined to comment on the speculation. He said, however, “I think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands.” The Chernin Group owns other digital businesses, including Barstool Sports, whose reputation is so toxic that ESPN canceled a partnership with it after 10 day. The company also owns a minority stake in Headspace, which sells meditation via an app. Mr. Chernin, who previously ran Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire, also has a movie division — hits include the “Planet of the Apes” series — that supplies 20th Century Fox. About six years remain on that deal, Mr. Chernin said. Asked what would happen when Disney completes its $71.3 billion acquisition of the studio, he said, “I’m going to be a proud member of the Disney family.” An earlier version of this article misstated the Chernin Group’s interest in Headspace, a company that sells meditation via an app. Chernin owns a minority stake in Headspace, not full control.",The New York Times
2018,"On Multiple Screens, John Akomfrah Deftly Weaves Tales of the African Diaspora","Art Review John Akomfrah’s extraordinary survey at the New Museum, “Signs of Empire,” should be required viewing for those who consider themselves activists, artists, critics or leaders — or people who simply want to expand their worldview. His four video installations, which take up the museum’s entire second floor, explore postcolonial history, nature and migration. And several films, including his best-known work, “The Last Angel of History” (1995), serving as an investigation into the origins of Afrofuturism — how culture from Africa and the African diaspora intersects with technology — are screening on Wednesdays in the museum’s basement. Mr. Akomfrah, a Ghanaian-born, British artist who is receiving his first museum survey exhibition in the United States, emerged as an artist with the Black Audio Film Collective, a group formed in England in 1982 after the racially charged Brixton riots of 1981. Together they created the earliest work here, “Expeditions One: Signs of Empire” (1983). Its title comes from the Roland Barthes book “Empire of Signs” (1970), which used semiotics to explore Japanese culture. But this video suggests that the African diaspora lacks a similar, cohesive system of cultural codes. (The sly inversion of Barthes’s title suggests how colonialism erased these ties.) In the absence of written archives or histories — particularly with displaced peoples — these codes might be conjured or created through film and video. What’s most notable about this show — beyond the weight of history and the creation of new cultural vocabularies, or the identifying of overlooked ones — is Mr. Akomfrah’s facility in working with moving images on multiple screens. This method of presentation allows him to create works whose nonlinear development echoes newly evolving ideas about history and culture in philosophy and postmodern and postcolonial theory. “The Unfinished Conversation” (2012) is a brilliant example of this, a three-channel work that takes as its subject the Jamaican-born intellectual Stuart Hall, who says in the film that “identities are formed at the unstable point where personal lives meet the narrative of history,” adding, “Identity is an ever-unfinished conversation.” Mr. Hall, who died in 2014, felt like an outsider in his family, because he had a darker complexion than his other relatives, was at Oxford University in the 1950s and was the husband of a white woman in postwar Britain. In addition to contributing fresh approaches to the study of British culture and helping to invent the academic field of cultural studies, Mr. Hall describes feeling grounded in jazz, which not only permeates the film but also feels like a guiding framework for Mr. Akomfrah. Postcolonial history is central to “Transfigured Night” (2013/2018), a two-screen installation that juxtaposes footage of leaders from newly independent African countries visiting Washington in the early 1960s with texts by the philosophers Frantz Fanon and Friedrich Nietzsche, both narrated and appearing as written text in the film, and music by Arnold Schoenberg (whose string sextet gives the movie its title) and West African folk singers. The most recent film, “Vertigo Sea” (2015), which debuted at the 2015 Venice Biennale, is a tour de force of images, text and music that depicts the ocean as both beautiful and deadly, particularly for migrants, enslaved people and mammals hunted by humans, like whales and polar bears. Borrowing from Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick” and Caspar David Friedrich’s Romantic paintings of Europeans contemplating the sea, this immersive three-screen work slyly rethreads these ocean tales through the narrative of Olaudah Equiano (c.1745-1797), an enslaved man who bought his own freedom and sailed the world, which he later wrote about in his autobiography. Mr. Akomfrah’s video work might be compared to that of Isaac Julien or Arthur Jafa, who also explore imagery related to the African diaspora, or experimental filmmakers who caught his attention as a young man: Santiago Álvarez, Yvonne Rainer, Chantal Akerman, Victor Burgin or Alexander Kluge. What sets Mr. Akomfrah apart from some of them, though, is his practical use of everything from BBC nature and cultural footage to music. In “Unfinished Conversation,” Mr. Hall says that jazz feels like “modern life.” Mr. Akomfrah has a similar understanding of how images choreographed across different screens and paired with music can be composed — rhythmically and dynamically — into a new way of storytelling that grabs your attention and doesn’t let go. He makes film and history feel vital, pairing images and canonical and obscure texts in a way that emphasizes, as Mr. Hall says, that “we’re in a phase of permanent revolution.”",The New York Times
2018,On This Land: Dance Presenters Honor Manhattan’s First Inhabitants,"On an evening in early June, before the sun had gone down, a bonfire blazed outside Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side. Handmade quilts lined the steps of the outdoor amphitheater. Anyone walking down Grand Street could come in and take a seat. As a group of singers arranged themselves around a large cylindrical drum, the choreographer Emily Johnson stood up to speak a few careful, welcoming words. “I’d like to acknowledge and pay my deep respect to Lenape people and elders and ancestors — past, present and future,” she said. She gestured toward the ground and in the direction of the East River. “I acknowledge and offer deep gratitude to this Lenape land and water that supports us, as we’re gathered here right now together, and I invite you to join me in that acknowledgment, that respect and that gratitude.” In recognizing Manhattan’s original inhabitants — the Lenape (pronounced len-AH-pay) — and their ancestral homeland, Lenapehoking, Ms. Johnson was taking part in a ritual that, with her guidance, has become increasingly common at New York performing arts spaces in the past year. Routine at public gatherings in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the custom of Indigenous land acknowledgment, or acknowledgment of country, has only recently started to gain traction in the United States outside of tribal nations. In New York City the practice is sporadic but growing, occasionally heard at high-profile cultural and educational institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and New York University. A land acknowledgment of sorts has even made it to Broadway, embedded in the prelude to Young Jean Lee’s play “Straight White Men.” “Five years ago, it was uncommon to hear any mention of Lenape in Manhattan,” said Joe Baker, the executive director of the Lenape Center, a nonprofit promoting Lenape language, art and culture. Today, though: “You hear Lenapehoking. You hear Lenape. You hear an acknowledgment of the original people.” (Lenapehoking encompasses New York City, New Jersey, Delaware and parts of Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York State.) Ms. Johnson, 42, a Native Alaskan artist of Yupik descent, has been the catalyst for much of that progress in the city’s dance scene. Her own work casts a wide, generous net. Last summer she devised an overnight ceremony for 300 participants on Randalls Island; her 2015 “Shore in Lenapehoking” concluded with a communal feast on the banks of Newtown Creek in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Wherever she tours, she publicly honors — and engages with — the Indigenous people of that place. And behind the scenes she has been working to strengthen relationships between predominantly white institutions and Indigenous communities, to ensure that more Indigenous voices are heard at all organizational levels, from the artists onstage to the board of directors. That process, she said, begins with institutions recognizing where they are: on land taken from Indigenous peoples. “In some ways it’s simple,” she said in an interview at an East Village cafe. “But it’s a very important step.” While a land acknowledgment may sound unusual to someone hearing it for the first time — especially in the context of a theater before a show — the practice has a deep history among Indigenous peoples, stretching back to “before these borders were here,” Ms. Johnson said. “As an Indigenous person, you wouldn’t come onto another Indigenous person’s land and begin to hunt or fish or farm or build a house,” she said. “You would engage in a protocol of: Can I be here? There would be an exchange and either a yes or no, and that protocol I think is why we could, for example, live without building a wall.” This year, at least four downtown performance spaces have begun regularly acknowledging Indigenous land, in spoken or written form. At Performance Space New York, a standard preshow curtain speech now reminds (or informs) visitors that the theater “is situated on the Lenape island of Manhahtaan (Mannahatta) and more broadly in Lenapehoking, the Lenape homeland.” At Danspace Project and Gibney, a similar statement is printed in programs. At Abrons, a sign in the main lobby goes further with a promise of action, noting that the center is “committed to resisting colonialism and imbalance with Mother Earth through the support of Indigenous-led programming and Indigenous artistic practices.” Abrons staff members also speak the acknowledgment at public events. Ask the leaders of these institutions why and how they’ve adopted the practice and Ms. Johnson’s name will likely come up. Ali Rosa-Salas, Abrons’s director of programming, said the center developed its acknowledgment after hosting part of the First Nations Dialogues, a meeting of international presenters and artists that Ms. Johnson helped to organize in January. (Performance Space was also a host.) One long-term goal of the dialogues was to increase global support for Indigenous artists. Land acknowledgment, Ms. Rosa-Salas said, “seemed like a first actionable step.” Many others, it seems, have thought similarly. Last year, the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture — a self-described “people-powered department” with no government affiliation — published “Honor Native Land: A Guide and Call to Acknowledgment.” The group’s founder, Adam Horowitz, said that the guide had been downloaded more than 7,000 times and that more than 300 organizations had taken a pledge to introduce acknowledgment as policy. For anyone who has spent time in countries like Australia and Canada — home to federal truth and reconciliation efforts that the United States has yet to undertake — the question that land acknowledgment raises isn’t so much “Why do this?” as “What’s taken so long?” “It was interesting coming here and noticing that it wasn’t happening,” said Vallejo Gantner, the former artistic director of PS122 (now Performance Space New York), who is from Australia. That absence, he added, signaled a larger problem. “The fact that Indigenous artists didn’t appear on our stages, and that we weren’t consciously trying to address that, was really disturbing to me.” To address that persisting issue, he and Ms. Johnson are involved in creating a network of Australian and North American presenters dedicated to Indigenizing their institutions. (Ms. Johnson avoids the ubiquitous term “decolonize,” she said, as it too often serves as “a placebo for change.”) The two also worked together, with the Lenape Center, to write PS122’s land acknowledgment; Ms. Johnson has since done the same with Danspace, Abrons and some individual artists. She is well aware that acknowledgment can become rote, empty. To have an impact, she stressed, it must be done “in an embodied way.” “To me that means the words are spoken, and they are spoken with intention,” she said. Ideally that intention leads to meaningful partnerships. Progress at Abrons and Performance Space has been heartening, Ms. Johnson said. Abrons, for instance, has worked with her to host monthly fireside gatherings featuring the Silvercloud Singers, an intertribal Native American singing and dance group. The most recent was also a summer social for the American Indian Community House; the next (after a hiatus) coincides with the Lenape Center’s symposium on Oct. 13. Rick Chavolla, the board chairman of the American Indian Community House, cautioned against seeing land acknowledgment as a trend. “It’s something that we’ve always believed, and now other people outside of our communities are starting to kind of understand it,” he said. He added that he felt hopeful about the momentum, which he attributed in part to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. “I think we’re in a really special time right now.” For the inexperienced, speaking an acknowledgment can be awkward at first. Hadrien Coumans, a co-founder of the Lenape Center, said false starts were to be expected. “I believe it’s a process, and it’s a process that has only recently begun,” he said. While land acknowledgment might be a mere formality in some contexts, Mr. Coumans emphasized that he sees it as something much greater, an invitation to consider and appreciate where, really, you are standing. “We’re part of a living being,” he said. “Earth is a living entity, so in acknowledging land, what we’re really doing is acknowledging life. Not nationalism, not patriotism. Life.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | On Trump: Aid, Discomfort and Treason?","letters Readers discuss an Op-Ed article decrying Democrats’ “inflammatory rhetoric.” To the Editor: In “Stop Throwing the Word Treason Around” (Op-Ed, Aug. 9), Christopher Buskirk suggests that Democrats, in applying the word “treason” to Donald Trump’s actions, “are willing to pull down our institutions and tear apart the social and political fabric that holds us together.” Perhaps he has forgotten that President Trump himself has played fast and loose with the term. In Blue Ash, Ohio, on Feb. 5, for instance, Mr. Trump said Democratic lawmakers who failed to applaud his State of the Union address “were like death. And un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not! I mean they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.” The Constitution states, “Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” The framers carefully worded this definition, to prevent accusations of treason as a means of stifling political dissent. It does seem clear that this is the definition that would apply to the president, or any other American. As far as Mr. Trump is concerned, the question then becomes: Are the Russians our enemies, and has the president given them aid and comfort? I agree that we bandy about the word “treason,” and a great many other insulting terms, too readily in our current political discourse. It is time for us all to take a step back from heated rhetoric and look at the facts. Kim JohnsonStamford, Conn. To the Editor: Christopher Buskirk begins by accusing Democratic politicians of “inflammatory rhetoric,” then declares that uttering the word “treason” in connection with President Trump is setting us on a dangerous path “that could lead to a crisis of political legitimacy.” Indeed, we are on that path, and there is at this moment a crisis of political legitimacy, but it emanates from the words and actions of Mr. Trump, not from congressional Democrats. Mr. Buskirk goes on to complain that Democrats in Congress are “attacking the legitimacy of the election” — a legitimacy that has been in question since our intelligence community found that Russians played an active, interventionist part in it. He talks about Democrats’ “paranoid style” and “bully-boy tactics,” and says that this is the problem. But the real problem is Mr. Trump’s odd affinity for and connections to Russians — that he could stand next to Russia’s leader and say publicly he believes that person and not the entire American intelligence community. We seem to have a president who is overtly working with a hostile power, against the United States — what would you call that? I think “treason” is a good word for it. Elizabeth DiPalmaGhent, N.Y. To the Editor: The Democrats are trying to delegitimize the election? Really? What about the years Donald Trump spent insisting that the first black president simply had to have been born in Africa? Or his constant campaign complaint that if he lost the election, that would mean it was rigged? Or the chants about locking up his opponent? Or . . . Alan RobbinsNew York To the Editor: Christopher Buskirk asserts that the election of Donald Trump was “free, fair and open,” despite the growing mountain of evidence that something was, and still is, seriously amiss. By any reasonable measure, Mr. Trump’s fervent dismantling of government, his demonstrated contempt for the work of his predecessors and his penchant for cozying up to dictators suggest potentially dark purpose. Alarm bells are going off, and well they should. Michael HendrixFallbrook, Calif. To the Editor: I promise that I will stop throwing the word “treason” around when President Trump stops lying.

2018,"On a Civil Rights Trail, Essential Sites and Indelible Detours","The new United States Civil Rights Trail is a rewarding starting point but a history tour is even more meaningful when you don’t follow the map. The Gem Theater in Kansas City.CreditCreditRobert Rausch for The New York Times Sitting in an empty theater at Oklahoma State University, the playwright Tara Brooke Watkins swirled in her seat and pointed west, far out toward the rim of the valley that envelops the university. Ms. Watkins is a white woman who, for the past couple of years, has immersed herself in black history — or more specifically, the massacre of an entire northeast-side black community in Tulsa, her hometown. While awaiting the arrival of the all-black cast of her original production “Tulsa ’21: Black Wall Street” for a final rehearsal, Ms. Watkins waxed nostalgic about Tulsa’s promise at the turn of the century, inviting me to step back in time and imagine the gentrified neighborhood that now surrounds us on the morning of June 1, 1921. Back then, Greenwood, which the famous black scholar Booker T. Washington renamed the Negro Wall Street, was booming with more than 600 black-owned enterprises, including hotels, theaters and restaurants. “And then, on that hill, around sunrise,” Ms. Watkins said, her finger tracing a horizontal line in the air, “men gathered with machine guns and they started killing people from up there. White women and children gathered up there and took pictures, like a spectacle.” The killing spree, one of the bloodiest episodes of racial violence in American history, ended with, according to various historical accounts, as many as 300 black Tulsans dead and Greenwood, the wealthiest black community in the country, reduced to rubble. Admittedly, investigating a nearly 100-year-old mass murder was a detour from my intended journey. Earlier, I had set out on a nicely scripted jaunt to several sites listed on the United States Civil Rights Trail, a driving tour recently coordinated by state tourism agencies. The tour wends its way across 15 states and a succession of churches, courthouses, schools, museums and other landmarks where activists challenged segregation in the 1950s and 1960s, largely in the South. Initially, if the idea of landmark-hopping through a couple of states seemed an efficient way to gain insight into major events of the civil rights era, my compulsion to go rogue and wander off the map often got the better of me. Ultimately, I designed and followed a kind of hybrid trail, cobbling together sites designated by the tourism departments with decidedly middle-America places whose histories I believed were either too important or intriguing to pass by. To be sure, it’s only natural that a civil rights tour would find its heart in the South, in the epic and well-chronicled battles for equal access to public education, public transportation and voting rights. In Greensboro, N.C., you can visit the Woolworth’s lunch counter where black college students staged sit-ins; in Selma, Ala., walk the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where a bloody march led Congress to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act; or in Memphis, visit the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, and the Lorraine Motel, the site of his assassination, now expanded into the popular National Civil Rights Museum.

New Orleans By The New York Times Yet some of black America’s most important and compelling history is tucked away, often unceremoniously, in what some dismiss as “flyover country” — in Central Plains states like Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. (I relocated to the last of these a year ago, from Charlotte, N.C., to work as a journalism professor at University of Missouri, my alma mater.) In a sense, my United States Civil Rights tour became a convenient excuse for me to explore black history in the heartland. Indeed, Missouri and Kansas lay claim to at least two landmark civil rights cases — Dred Scott v. Sandford, in St. Louis, and Brown v. the Topeka, Kan., Board of Education. For my travels, I plotted a simple route: I would drive counterclockwise from central Missouri into Kansas, and then head into Oklahoma, and lastly north into the southwest corner of Missouri, stopping along the way at selected trail sites and a few others. Setting out on a hot weekday morning, I drove hours along peaceful highways, the mostly flat and infinitely green, serene farmland punctuated by rolling pastures sloping toward streams and lakes rushing past me. Starting in the early 1700s, Missouri began trading slaves to work in an economy fueled by farms rather than the large cotton or rice plantations in the South. In general, most Missouri masters held only one or two slaves, according to historical records. In 1860, for example, enslaved people accounted for some 10 percent of the state’s population, compared to, say, South Carolina’s 57 percent. Missouri’s slaves were deployed for a variety of tasks, from minding livestock to laying brick to blacksmithing, often laboring jointly with their masters and family. Still, they were viewed as property rather than human beings and their treatment was as brutal as in the South. Ultimately, as Diane Mutti Burke, an associate professor of history at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, writes: “The many contradictions and tensions inherent in the small-scale system of slavery practiced in Missouri resulted in the institution’s rapid collapse during the violent years of the Civil War.” My first stop, Independence, Mo., home of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, quickly proved me a wayward trailee. Less drawn to Truman’s 1948 signing an executive order to desegregate the armed forces, I found myself bypassing the museum, a major attraction on the trail, to explore an unlikely pre-Civil War alliance: William Quantrill, the notoriously savage Confederate guerrilla leader, and John Noland, a free slave who served as his primary scout and spy. Historians speculate that Noland teamed up with Quantrill’s raiders as a kind of revenge against Jayhawkers — often-violent gangs of abolitionist Kansans — who had abused Noland’s family. Quantrill is infamous for his murderous 1863 raid 50 miles southwest in Lawrence, Kan., a pro-Union army town and home of antislavery Senator James Lane. Lane escaped capture, but Quantrill’s forces left 183 residents dead, in some cases reportedly dragging men and boys into the street and killing them before their loved ones. After perusing 181-year-old Woodlawn Cemetery where Noland is buried, I spent some time at the 160-year-old Jackson County Marshal’s House and Jail Museum and did some hard time (about five minutes) in the cell where Quantrill and Frank James, the older brother of outlaw Jesse James, were once locked up. John Noland, one might conclude, died on the wrong side of history. Far more inspiring is the story of Hiram Young, a freed slave who became a wealthy manufacturer of freight wagons in Independence in the mid-1800s. Historians are uncertain about the circumstances that led to Young’s freedom; what’s clear is that, after purchasing his wife’s freedom and upon his arrival in Missouri from Tennessee, Hiram Young & Company made a small fortune building and selling thousands of high-quality wagons and yokes to westward-bound 49ers. By 1860, Young’s 50 to 60 employees, both hired hands and slave labor (many slaves purchased their freedom and continued working for him), were cranking out thousands of yokes and some 900 wagons a year. Young was so exalted throughout Independence that when he died in 1882, he was buried in the white section of Woodlawn Cemetery. Traveling a few miles south from Independence, I watched the landscape change from suburban sprawl to gritty urban streets as I arrived in Kansas City, where I met up with Erik Keith Stafford, a local history expert and tour guide. Kansas City, a trail suggestion for those visiting Independence, tells a familiar history of urban riots following King’s 1968 assassination, when citizens were gunned down by police, local businesses burned and National Guard troops swept in. Mr. Stafford and I talked about the city’s history of racial unrest as we hung out around 18th and Vine, the renowned mecca of black politics and entertainment in the city. We sat in the dimly lit Musicians Local 627 — the so-called Colored Musicians Union and social hub — surrounded by photos of such jazz greats as Count Basie, Duke Ellington and, of course, Charlie “Bird” Parker, the saxophonist and Kansas City native. Mr. Stafford riffed on how, back in the 1920s, K.C. earned its nickname, Paris of the Plains. During Prohibition, Mr. Stafford explained, the city’s political boss Tom Pendergast turned a blind eye to the sale of booze, which gave rise to hundreds of nightclubs and bars that attracted the country’s best jazz musicians. “New Orleans may have created jazz, but Kansas City is where it was perfected,” he said. As we strolled the neighborhood, past a colorful mural of the founders of the Kansas City-born Negro Leagues — the African-American baseball teams that played between the 1920s and 1950s — I took note of the rich history packed into a few city blocks, pausing at The Call building, headquarters of the famous black newspaper founded in 1919 and still operating. Its newsroom was home to one of my heroes, Lucile Bluford, who worked as a reporter and editor covering civil rights issues. Bluford won national attention in the 1930s when she was accepted into the University of Missouri’s journalism program but upon her arrival was rejected by university officials who cited “separate but equal” Jim Crow laws. Officials recommended that she apply to Lincoln University, an all-black institution that did not offer a graduate journalism program. Over the next few years, the persistent Bluford was denied Missouri admission 11 times. She triumphed in 1941 when the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Mizzou must open its doors to Bluford if Lincoln didn’t establish comparable journalism studies. But by then, the university had shut down all its graduate programs because of financial pressures caused by World War II, and ultimately Bluford was never able to attend Mizzou. In 1989, a half-century after Bluford’s first rejection, the university granted her an honorary doctoral degree in humanities. The United States Civil Rights Trail is heavy with tales of blacks struggling to gain access to an adequate education, but the theme crescendos in Topeka, Kan., a designated trail site, where Oliver Brown, the father of a black schoolgirl, challenged the nation’s “separate but equal” doctrine and changed the course of history. Monroe Elementary School, one of the city’s four segregated schools for blacks, is now converted to the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. Reading exhibits in its well-preserved hallways, I took in riveting details of how Brown’s third-grade daughter Linda’s desire to attend the elementary school close to her home, but which was all-white, would lead to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision that helped dismantle racial segregation in the United States. The story is bittersweet, in hindsight: As Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree Jr. writes in his best-selling memoir “All Deliberate Speed,” which explores Brown v. the Board of Education: “The more subtle forms of resistance, such as white flight, denial of funding for equalization and rejection of Brown principles by a conservative Supreme Court, have been the most effective in limiting the promise of Brown.” The most natural next step in my journey, I suppose, would have been to visit Little Rock, Ark., where nine black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, enrolled at Central High School under National Guard protection, in a momentous test of Brown v. Board. The story, though, felt familiar to me. I found myself instead on a four-hour trek south across long barren stretches of highway until I reached Tulsa, where for years I had heard vague and conflicting stories about the massacre of affluent blacks around the turn of the century. No wonder: Even as blacks rebounded to successfully rebuild Greenwood, remarkably becoming even more prosperous, then-mayor T.D. Evans discouraged Tulsans from talking publicly about the episode, according to a Tulsa Race Riot Commission Report, published in 2001. In her play, Tara Brooke Watkins takes on the white community’s response to the massacre, which she said amounted to sweeping it under the rug. “The fact that a city official, the mayor, encourages the entire city not to talk about what happened is key to understanding the trauma in Tulsa because that moment represents a worldview that silence is the way to move forward.” Some two hours north, off a two-lane gravel road in Diamond, Mo. — and off the designated trail — I encountered a far more prominent black success story at the George Washington Carver National Monument, established in 1943 by the National Park Service as the first installation dedicated to an African-American. Carver, born around 1865 into slavery, rose to become one of the world’s most renowned chemists, his inventions, agricultural research and teaching praised around the world. In his day, Carver was a kind of nerd celebrity: in 1921, when the peanut industry was seeking tariff protection, Carver appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee as the industry’s expert witness. He was also modest: as Carver, who died in 1943, once said of his legacy: “The primary idea in all of my work was to help the farmer and fill the poor man’s empty dinner pail.” At the end of my journey, glittering in the sunny distance along the Mississippi River, was the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, and beneath its long shadow the majestic Old Courthouse, a site on the trail. Hundreds of legal cases for various freedoms, including Virginia Minor’s case for a women’s right to vote, have played out in the 150-year-old courthouse. But the most famous occurred in 1847 when Dred Scott, with his wife, Harriet, sued for and were granted their freedom, only to have it revoked again. There were numerous appeals, but ultimately the Supreme Court ruled that the Scotts, who had resided in such free territories as Illinois and Wisconsin, were nonetheless slaves and therefore property with no right to sue — a decision, many historians say, that seeded the start of the Civil War. As Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote in the 1857 decision, the framers of the Constitution believed that blacks “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” Off the trail, with the sun fading — and a year-old N.A.A.C.P. travel advisory warning black drivers about the risks of driving through Missouri still in effect — I headed home exhausted, Taney’s words echoing across darkening highways and the nation’s “original sin” lurking always close in my rear view.

2018,"On a Ramshackle Compound in New Mexico, a Dead Boy and a Mystery","AMALIA, N.M. — Anyone trying to drop out of sight could do a lot worse than the hills surrounding this remote outpost in northern New Mexico, dotted with off-the-grid dwellings. But the sheriff’s office knew something was terribly wrong at one such compound when they received the message. “We’re starving,” read the desperate plea, which found its way to the authorities. Executing a search warrant, officers were stunned by what they found last week: 11 children and five adults subsisting in squalor in a decrepit trailer half buried in the high desert. They were well supplied with guns and ammunition and had barricaded themselves behind adobe walls and piles of tires, but were meagerly provisioned with food; the kitchen cabinet guarded some russet potatoes, a bag of pasta and Folgers coffee. The search of the compound also turned up the decomposing body of a young boy, thought to be that of Abdul Ghani-Wahhaj, 3. His mother had reported that he was abducted last year by his father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, one of the men arrested at the compound. Prosecutors said in a court filing that Mr. Wahhaj was training one of the other children in the use of an assault rifle “in preparation for future school shootings,” as reported by the child’s foster parent. The glimpse inside the trash-strewn compound has shaken people around this sparsely populated stretch of the mountainous Southwest, focusing scrutiny on Mr. Wahhaj’s ties to a prominent mosque in New York, on little-understood Islamic healing practices and the ease with which renegades can hide out in New Mexico’s backlands. Mr. Wahhaj’s father, Siraj Wahhaj, is the imam at Masjid at-Taqwa, a mosque in Brooklyn. The elder Mr. Wahhaj said on Thursday that the dead child found at the compound was his grandson, who had a condition that provoked seizures and prevented him from walking. Authorities here said that the remains had not yet been identified. “Something happened and we’re going to find out what happened,” said the elder Mr. Wahhaj, who was leaving the mosque in Brooklyn on Thursday on his way to New Mexico. “I want the truth to come out, whatever the truth is.” Pieces of the puzzling tragedy are starting to fall into place. Hakima Ramzi, the mother of the missing toddler, told authorities that her estranged husband, the younger Mr. Wahhaj, had abducted the boy late last year after saying he was taking the boy to a park in Jonesboro, Ga. Ms. Ramzi said Mr. Wahhaj had taken the boy with the aim of performing an Islamic alternative healing ritual known as ruqya, a form of prayerful meditation which is sometimes thought to mend damage from witchcraft. Mr. Wahhaj then had a brush with the police in December when the Ford Explorer he was in rolled over on Interstate 65 in Alabama. J.W. Earnhardt, the state trooper at the scene, said he was told that Mr. Wahhaj and others in the vehicle, including two other adults and five children, were on their way to New Mexico to go camping. He told them that he was traveling with his wife, and that they had recently moved to Tuskegee, Ala. Mr. Wahhaj was heavily armed, with two rifles and three handguns. He had a Kimber 9-mm pistol in a holster on his hip. A Glock .380 and a Smith and Wesson .38 special were in their factory cases, the officer wrote in the report, and were thrown from the vehicle during the crash. Mr. Wahhaj also had a bulletproof vest, several AR-style magazines and a bag that contained ammunition, according to the report. “Mr. Wahhaj repeatedly stated that he owned the firearms legally, and was in possession of a valid Georgia concealed-carry permit,” the police report from the accident said. “There were several Qurans on the ground that had been thrown from the vehicle during the crash and a few other books that were written in Arabic.” After arriving at Shelby Baptist Hospital, the trooper spoke to a female adult passenger injured in the wreck: Jany Leveille, who gave him a different story than Mr. Wahhaj had. She told the trooper that “they had not moved to Tuskegee, that they had only stayed there overnight,” Mr. Earnhardt wrote. “Ms. Leveille also stated that she and Mr. Wahhaj were not legally married, contradicting Mr. Wahhaj. She then stated that they were traveling from Georgia to New Mexico to see Mr. Wahhaj’s brother-in-law’s land.” “The stories Mr. Wahhaj and Ms. Leveille told were different and both were vague and did not provide much detail,” according to the report. After the rollover, they made their way to a plot of land outside Amalia, N.M., a ranching village near the Colorado border with about 200 people. Hispanic settlers founded the remote settlement in the 1840s; to this day, residents still irrigate their fields with water from a tributary of the Rio Grande. The compound raided by the authorities bears some resemblance to so-called earthships, dwellings made from discarded materials like bottles, tires and empty beer cans, which can be found around Taos. But the makeshift home was shoddier than similar structures, and included a 100-foot tunnel with areas containing bedding, according to an affidavit filed by Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe of Taos County. The remote compound lies at the end of a bumpy dirt road past the cemetery in Amalia. Aside from a couple of television news trucks, the site was empty on Thursday. Filthy clothes were strewn around the trailer, next to empty boxes of Remington rifle cartridges, operating instructions for Bushmaster rifles, notebooks scribbled in English and Arabic, a bilingual English-Arabic Quran and a third-grade home-schooling textbook. On the ground outside were battered pairs of children’s shoes, broken bicycles, a basketball net and empty wine bottles. Columns of old tires were placed around the trailer, seemingly as barricades. A knife protruded from a bag containing empty boxes of ammunition. Neighbors said they were unaware of the activities at the remote site. “You see a little bit of drugs, a few break-ins, but nothing ever like this,” said Lawrence Montoya, 77, a retired New Mexico state police officer who raises horses at a ranch near the compound. “We don’t see much law enforcement around here. This is a place where people end up who might not want to be found.” The younger Mr. Wahhaj had already come under the attention of federal law enforcement authorities. In 2005, Mr. Wahhaj was part of an unsuccessful federal lawsuit in which he claimed that he was detained, harassed, fingerprinted and photographed by Customs and Border Protection agents at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York when he was traveling to and returning from Morocco. Mr. Wahhaj, who represented himself in the case, wrote in one of the filings, “Plaintiff Wahhaj contends that the only reason for the ‘suspicion’ is because he is the son of a famous Muslim imam.” The elder Mr. Wahhaj has for decades been the imam of Masjid at-Taqwa, which several people connected to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center either attended or visited around the time of the attack. During the investigation of the bombing, the elder Mr. Wahhaj was named on a list of several dozen potential conspirators in the plot, though he was never charged in the case and the list was later criticized for being overly broad, some former terrorism prosecutors said. In Brooklyn, a spokesman for the mosque, Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, said in a video posted on Facebook Thursday that the news media and the authorities were engaging in “propaganda” by wrongfully injecting mentions of international terrorism and school violence into what amounted to “a domestic situation” in New Mexico. “They’re not bringing up accurate events — they’re bringing up false narratives,” Mr. Judan said. “Look how this case has turned from a domestic situation, and now they’re trying to create an atmosphere where his son is involved with an extremist radical group.” The elder Mr. Wahhaj has had a long career as a clergyman, traveling the world and delivering lectures on Islam, and even once gave a religious invocation in Congress. The authorities in New Mexico have offered few details about the alleged weapons training other than to say, in court papers filed this week, that a foster parent of one of the 11 children at the compound told them that the adults there had trained their child in the use of an assault rifle as part of a “conspiracy to commit school shootings.” At a court appearance on Wednesday, all five defendants pleaded not guilty to child abuse charges. In his Facebook video, Mr. Judan dismissed the weapons training allegation as “hearsay,” noting that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was legally licensed to carry firearms in “36 states.” “All you hear in the media is that they were heavily armed,” he said, adding, “Everybody’s armed in New Mexico. New Mexico is an open-carry state.” Taos police raided the compound last Friday, after receiving the plea for help, but local and federal authorities were warned months ago that Mr. Wahhaj and his son were at the site. A local couple, Jason and Tanyalyn Badger, told the sheriff’s office in April that they had seen a boy in January and February who they thought was Abdul Ghani-Wahhaj, who had been widely reported as missing. The F.B.I. then conducted aerial surveillance and unsuccessfully tried to identify people at the compound through photographs. “There was no credible evidence at the time to what they were saying,” said Steve Fuhlendorf, a spokesman for Taos County, regarding the tip from the Badgers. “It would not have been legal to enter the compound without more evidence.” The breakthrough came last week, when Imam Wahhaj said his daughter Subhana reached a friend in Atlanta, who then called the imam and relayed the message saying they were running short on food. Imam Wahhaj said he contacted the authorities, setting in motion the raid on the compound. Subhana Wahhaj, his daughter, was among the adults taken into custody by the authorities. In a video interview posted on Facebook on Thursday afternoon, Imam Wahhaj said that last year his son had taken his grandson from his mother and that the Wahhaj family had gone to the police. In recent months, he said, the family learned that the younger Mr. Wahhaj and his grandson were seen in New Mexico. Imam Wahhaj added that his son had cut off all relations with him, his mother and many of his friends. When he learned this week that the remains of a boy were found at the compound, Imam Wahhaj said he was devastated. “You can imagine how we feel right now,” he said. “We learned of the tragic death of our grandson. “ An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the accident involving the Ford Explorer Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was riding in. It was on Interstate 65 in Alabama, not Georgia.",The New York Times
2018,"On an Indonesian Island Hit by Multiple Earthquakes, Can Tourism Recover?","Update “Travelers are panicking” after Lombok, an emerging tourism destination, was hit by multiple earthquakes. But should they? After the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that has killed at least 90 people on Aug. 5, aftershocks have continued to shake the island. The quake followed a 6.4-magnitude on July 29, which killed 17; the island, home to hundreds of resorts, has been under various states of emergency since late July. Residents are slowly readjusting to the new normal as they have to pick up the pieces — in some cases literally — of their lives and rebuild. The damage to the island’s growing tourism industry is less clear. Tourism is an increasingly important part of Lombok’s economy, and while the island doesn’t get the numbers of neighboring Bali, it has been earmarked by the government as an emerging destination. Last year President Joko Widodo identified 10 places around Indonesia’s 17,000 islands to target as the next Bali, among them an integrated resort development in South Lombok called Mandalika. The earthquakes, though, may have temporary disrupted those plans. “Travelers are panicking,” wrote John Konstantinidis, general manager of Authentic Lombok, a tour operator based in the popular, west-coast beach area Senggigi, over email; he has lost 50 percent of bookings since the July 29 earthquake, he added. “A lot of people are also canceling because their hotels are damaged.” Supratman Samsi, who has run Adventure Lombok, an outfitter also based in Senggigi, since 2006, said his bookings have dropped 20 percent, even though large sections of the island were not damaged by the quakes. “People are scared — it’s the first word they write in their emails,” he said. “For sure the people here need to recover from the trauma but we also need the media to tell everyone how beautiful Lombok is, how amazing it still is. The areas affected were the east, north and west.” Gili Trawangan, where images and video of stranded tourists massed on beaches have gone viral, is off Lombok’s northwest coast. “Here in Senggigi many tourists have left, but some have stayed, saying that this can happen anywhere,” Mr. Samsi continued. “And I don’t think the effects will be forever.” Hotels in parts of the island have closed as owners and management assess damage. The Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort evacuated guests, many of whom chose to leave the island. While the property had no known reports of injuries to hotel guests or staff, it is not accepting bookings for now, as it assesses its structural integrity, according to a spokeswoman. The Aruna Senggigi Resort & Convention has also closed its main building “for tests,” said Indah Puritiara, the resort’s marketing communications assistant manager, adding that some online travel agents have canceled about 50 percent of their bookings because of the quake. “Our building is still safe but we want to check it and all the rooms,” she said. The Golden Palace, a four-star property in Mataram (the capital of West Nusa Tenggara, Lombok’s province) that welcomes mainly Indonesian guests, is also closed for safety checks while the luxury resort Oberoi Lombok, on the northwest coast near the Gili islands, is closed because of damage. Other properties in the northwest couldn’t be reached by phone, their lines out of service or permanently busy. Air carriers have also reported cancellations. A spokesman for Singapore Airlines Limited, parent company of SilkAir, one of two airlines that flies to the island from outside Indonesia (the other is AirAsia), confirmed the cancellations, but declined to give exact numbers. Yet among the gloom some travel analysts and observers see reason to be hopeful. “The observation I have made is that one would think increasing terrorism would put a dampener on business travel, but we have found this to not be the case, business travel is increasing,” said Dr. Robert Quigley, senior vice president and regional medical director for International SOS, a medical and travel security company. “If terrorism doesn’t have an impact on travel, then I am not sure this earthquake would have an effect.” He is quick to point out that the earthquake does present real dangers. “In addition to the seismic activity, the rubble, the physical trauma, broken bones, there is lots of dust in the atmosphere and this can exacerbate underlying conditions,” he said. People on the ground in and around Lombok note that the reality on the island is more nuanced than the viral images suggest. In some sections of Lombok, business continues as if nothing happened. At Sempiak Villas on the south coast, the rooms are full and the resort continues to receive inquiries from travelers that have left devastated areas. Erik Barreto, who is based in Singapore and a founder of Rascal Republic, a parent company that has hospitality projects around Indonesia, including Lombok, described the general situation in the south as stable. “There are people in affected areas that can’t get food and water. But we have a site in the south where we are building villas and a hotel called Samara Bay and there was no physical damage,” he said over the phone from neighboring Bali. But that doesn’t mean resumption of normality will happen quickly. “Places usually fully recover in two to three years” after major natural disasters. Others are more sanguine. Steven Moloney, who owns the boutique hotel Rascals Kuta Lombok (no relation to Mr. Barreto’s company), on the island’s south coast, said his property is at full occupancy. “People in south Lombok felt the earthquake like a tremor — there was a little bit of shock, and then everything went back to normal,” he said. “Some travelers who were staying in the north have now come down to Kuta. The restaurants here are full. People forget about things like this in two or three months.”",The New York Times

THE FIGHTERS Americans in Combat in Afghanistan and Iraq By C. J. Chivers 374 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28. C. J. Chivers, a senior writer for The New York Times and a former Marine infantry officer, begins his new book with a description of an American weapon, equipped with GPS sensors and a guidance system, hitting “precisely the wrong place” and killing and mutilating a family of women and children on the Afghan steppe as a consequence. But Chivers’s narrative has only begun to slam you in the gut; later on, the author captures the psychological effect the errant bomb has on the Marines at the scene. Indeed, because of the way the stories and characters spool into one another with mathematical intensity, and the second-by-second in-your-face descriptions of prolonged battles from a sergeant’s eye view, “The Fighters: Americans in Combat in Afghanistan and Iraq” could be the most powerful indictment yet of America’s recent Middle East wars. Chivers is interested in the chemistry between platoons and companies, not that between battalions and brigades: In other words, this is a book about the lower ranks who experience the thing itself, the gut-wrenching violence and confusion of war — history from the ground up, not from the top down, precisely what Washington elites miss. “The Fighters” constitutes an illusion-free zone, where the concrete triumphs over the abstract, where the best and most indelible of those profiled, from that vast working-class heart of the country, begin their military service in a blaze of patriotism following 9/11, and end up confused, cynical, betrayed and often disfigured or dead. Of course, all wars are messy in the bloodiest and worst ways. What can redeem them for the combatants is only strategy, so that their ordeals contain a larger purpose within a realistic context. But in the background of this book is the very absence of such strategy, not only on the larger political level but on the microlevel, too: missions, one after the other, that even the grunts can see make no sense at all. In the author’s telling, the American footprint in Afghanistan grows over the years from a sensible light-and-lethal affair to a mushrooming network of urban blast-barrier mazes of soldiers and Marines, even as the purpose of the war becomes completely lost. Specialist Robert Soto, an old man still in his teens, “had joined the Army to protect America. He was unsure how the Korengal Outpost” — in northeastern Afghanistan — “served that end. The circumstances in the valley, and many of the missions his platoon was ordered to perform, caused him to wonder what the Army was thinking. … Soto reduced the mission to its most basic rationale, We’re here because we’re here. If nothing else, the soldiers could fight for one another.” What makes this book such a classic of war reporting is the very absence of panorama. Rather, Chivers has reconstructed the moment-by-moment experiences of Navy corpsmen, helicopter pilots, soldiers and Marines at their most narrow and fundamental level. Minutes become hours and eat up breathless spells of 20 and more pages at a stretch. Soto, in the instant before battle, when there is often the click-on-click of metal coming from the automatic rifles, has a feeling of “absolute, intoxicating clarity.” There are the cousins Joe Dan Worley and Dustin Kirby, hospital corpsmen from Powder Springs, Ga. Their families thought they would be safe in the Navy, but corpsmen are the medics for Marines in combat. After Worley’s first mass casualty event in Iraq, “a solemn cleanup began. The remains of six of the platoon’s Marines, the Marine driver and three Iraqi police officers were put into body bags. Worley was blood-soaked, exhausted, grieving and enraged when he arrived back” at the base. “But he knew he had done what he was supposed to do. He had found his reason for being in Iraq.” Later on, after one more harrowing combat scene, Worley himself is wounded in an I.E.D. attack. “Marines who survived bomb blasts often acted according to pattern,” Chivers explains. “First they would see if they were alive. Then they would seek their weapon. Then they would ask if their genitals were still there. … He loosened his pants. He looked. There were no apparent wounds. … Worley was rushed inside an aid station. … He felt a catheter being pushed down into his urethra.” Worley knew while drifting into unconsciousness that if he survived “he would be an amputee.” While Worley loses his left leg above the knee, his cousin is even less fortunate. A handsome, unstoppable presence in battle, Kirby, who was always ministering to the wounded — he’s someone made for the movies — groggily urinates in an empty water bottle one night merely to save himself a walk to the foul portable toilets at Camp Falluja. He is punished by drawing guard duty, where he is shot in the face by the enemy. The reader meets him next some years later. “He was in constant pain and self-conscious about his appearance. He had gained 50 pounds. He was medically retired, unemployed, divorced and disfigured.” There is no down time in this relentless book. The Russian-American poet Joseph Brodsky said that good poetry “should be dark with nouns” on the page. Chivers’s book is the prose equivalent, full of nouns and the simplest, least affected adjectives. It reads the way soldiers and Marines talk, so the profanity comes across as poetry. It is real and in the moment. This history of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars is replete with air battles. But there is nothing removed and sterile about them. That is because the advance of technology has provided an ancientness to fighting in the sky. Glancing at a screen while they flew, “aviators now saw their target — be it building, vehicle or man — at the moment the bombs struck.” It was like being a sniper. They literally “watched their targets die.” In particular, Chivers chronicles the exploits in Iraq of the Kiowa helicopter pilots, whose platform, unlike the Black Hawk, is lightly armored. After a bullet passed through her sole and out through her ankle, one pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Lori Hill, seeing her blood-soaked sock and foot, quips, “At least I painted my toenails.” Even though these wars have become, at least at this juncture, a lost cause, every main character in Chivers’s account has a just-doing-my-job skill and heroism about him or her. Postmodern war, because of technology, has become complex beyond all imagining, even for the lowest infantry soldier. Thus, the troops America sent into combat between 2001 and the present have been the most skilled in our history. Chivers’s achievement has been to make his subjects mythic as well as human. Moreover, everyone depicted is profoundly moral. Take a Navy pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Layne McDowell, who in the midst of these wars is constantly worried about whether he killed a few civilians in a bomb he dropped during the air campaign in Kosovo in 1999, even though senior officers effectively told him to put the incident out of his mind. The author’s stories give heart-rending meaning to the lives and deaths of these men and women, even if policymakers generally have not.",The New York Times
2018,On the Trail of a Lover Boy in the Age of Enlightenment,"Art Review BOSTON — His parents were actors, his grandfather made shoes; he did not seem born for great things. Giacomo Casanova, though, had assets that outshone the lack of money and title: boldness, wit, a gift for languages, and charm enough to slide into a seat at a cardinal’s dinner table or a countess’s bed. In his native Venice, in glittering Paris, and then across the continent, he reinvented himself as he went, playing the roles of author, courtier, entrepreneur, spy. The actors’ son trod the boards of a different stage, one that stretched from London to Constantinople. The voracious Venetian hovers like a governing spirit over the art of the 18th century in “Casanova’s Europe,” a vivacious and often ingenious exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts here. Now his name is a bare synonym for sexual prowess, or worse — Casanova went to bed with his own daughter, and several of his romances fell well short of the contemporary bar of affirmative consent. But he was also, as this show asserts, a kind of working-class hero, whose rakish tastes and picaresque exploits only became possible as an old social order began to give way. The mid-18th century was an era of cultivation and refinement, but also prime time for hustlers, gold diggers and chancers of all sorts. Casanova, the most erudite of scammers, was the archetype of the age. The Boston museum is the third and final stop for this exhibition, and its yearlong run has coincided with an essential shift in how cultural institutions frame inequalities of gender, those of today and yesterday. (The show has been renamed for this last stop on its tour; at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth and the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, it went by the somewhat sexier “Casanova: The Seduction of Europe.”) Yet libertinage, or the celebration of the pleasures of the flesh, is just one of this show’s interests, and the lover boy himself is not really its subject. Casanova’s autobiography, “The Story of My Life,” provides granular insight into the 18th century’s social manners over its 3,700 handwritten pages: how high-living Europeans feasted and gambled, how they chose their clothes or styled their hair, how they maintained a veneer of piety while seducing one another. Those insights are the invisible frame around the more than 250 paintings, furnishings, costumes and books here, which the curators have mashed together to evoke a Pan-European social scene in which life took on the aspects of theater. Images of lusty shepherds and goddesses set the sexual tone of “Casanova’s Europe,” but decorative arts matter even more: velvet suits and beaver-trimmed hats, keyboards and poker tables, porcelain statues, gilded candelabras and silver soup tureens. We enter Casanova’s Venice through an initial gallery of half a dozen vedute, or cityscape paintings, by Canaletto: black-veiled women gossip beneath the arches of the Palazzo Ducale, and boatmen ply the lagoon between San Marco and San Giorgio Maggiore. Casanova was born there in 1725, and for centuries, a small number of families had enjoyed all the political power and all the good wine. By the mid-18th century, though, these Venetian aristocrats and merchants were living public lives, inviting attention in salons and cafes, putting on a show at the opera and in church. Now a young man from the wrong class might just about mingle with this crowd — if he looked and talked the part. First you needed clothing, and this show contains sumptuous ensembles for both sexes; a man on the make might have favored the silk and velvet three-piece suit on one mannequin here, its jacket gussied up with threads of silver and twinkling paillettes. Once inside the palazzo, you’d have to make conversation about the beautiful objects your host collected, his etched glasses, his gold sconces, or bawdy statuettes of lovers acquired from the porcelain factory in Meissen. You would play music with the lady of the house, on a harpsichord whose lid was painted with scenes of mythological romance. You would gossip about love and money, and deflect when asked about your past. Casanova got his entry into this shining world after saving the life of a grateful senator, and he took to it like a gondola to water. He also had another skill — a dirtier one, but one no less welcome in high society. The pursuit of pleasure had taken on philosophical and political importance in the mid-18th century, and Europeans were falling into bed every which way, the more operatic the better. The German painter Johann Zoffany appears here in a lusty self-portrait that functioned as the 18th-century equivalent of a cruising app profile, with two condoms, decorated with pretty pink string, prominently tacked to the wall behind him. A dozen pornographic drawings by the French artist Claude-Louis Desrais depict bewigged aristocrats in acrobatic ménages à trois (or more than trois), and three of them feature scenes of sadomasochism, the 18th-century sex practice par excellence. Two women in long dresses and bonnets thrash a third lover in a canopied bed. In another scene, a lady takes a bullwhip to a delighted man suspended from a pulley. Libertinage was, needless to add, a man’s privilege. Yet women knew the rules of the game, and for both men and women, sex became another kind of theater, in which what you said never really expressed what you meant. In a voluptuous painting here by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, which he gave the winkingly ironic title “The Useless Resistance” and completed in 1773, a maiden swaddled in silks tugs on the wig of an advancing seducer, who has lifted her skirt to reveal her opalescent thighs. It’s easy now to misread this picture as a scene of sexual assault, but the smiles on both lovers’ faces give it away: She is pantomiming her unwillingness, just as he is pantomiming his advance. Sex, too, was a masquerade, which allowed this (upper-class) woman to enjoy her desires and still hold onto her virtue. Even women in convents could have a vibrant sex life, if they played it right. In “Casanova’s Europe” you’ll find a tableau of ornately dressed mannequins in a parlatorio, a nunnery’s visiting room where laymen could speak to the young women whose wealthy parents had judged holy orders cheaper than dowries. It was in a Venetian parlatorio like this that Casanova would have met one of his most notorious lovers, a nun whom he gave the pseudonym M. M., who had numerous other paramours, male and female. She was not the only bride of Christ to break her vows; a naughty double-sided painting here depicts a young nun kneeling in prayer from the front and, from the back, opening her habit to reveal her bare bottom. That’s the European 18th century for you: age of Enlightenment, age of adultery. The two were especially mixed in Paris, where the regency of the promiscuous, hard-drinking Duke of Orleans had ushered in a new social tolerance for sex, and where Casanova arrived in 1750. Etchings here of masked balls, theatrical performances and nights of gambling evoke the pleasures of the Parisian night, and another tableau, of a married woman at her toilette arranging a tryst with a younger lover, gives a provocative spin to silver pieces, snuffboxes and other decorative objects that museumgoers often overlook. Casanova returned to Paris in 1757 after escaping a Venetian jail, where he was locked up for heresy, and which this show’s curators evoke through Piranesi’s nearly contemporary prints of shadowy imagined prisons. Casanova’s notoriety won him a place in the richest apartments in Versailles; soon he was running the Paris lottery, and spying for the French government. There were more schemes, money won and lost, time on the road and on the run. At last he aged out of love and went off to Bohemia, living quietly as a librarian and writing the story of his life, in French. How honest he was, and what the many women he bedded might have said if they could have, will always be unknown — and the Museum of Fine Art’s anxious decision to retitle this show encapsulates a real uncertainty, at museums today, of how best to address sexual inequalities of the past. Sex itself is not the problem. The problem, then and now, is power — and a fairer vision of power was also born in the salons and boudoirs of Enlightenment Europe. In the last gallery here we come across a portrait from 1766, by the Scottish painter Allan Ramsay, of a glowering man with intense brown eyes. Who is this stern-faced man in this house of pleasures? He is Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose “Confessions,” with its disclosures of his own amorous misadventures, inspired Casanova’s biography — and whose other writings helped foment revolutions in America, France and Haiti. Rousseau took a dim view of luxury and spat on the high society in which Casanova reveled. But human freedom, more than any carnal lust, was the 18th century’s most immoderate desire.",The New York Times
2018,"Once Bipartisan, an Election Security Bill Collapses in Rancor","WASHINGTON — The purpose of the bill seemed unassailable: to ensure that state officials could protect their elections against the kind of hacking or interference that has clouded the 2016 campaign. Although it started out backed by election integrity advocates and powerful senators from both parties, the Secure Elections Act has now all but collapsed. Lawmakers modified one of the bill’s key provisions after hearing relentless complaints from state officials, prompting many of its advocates to pull their support. Then last week delivered what one of the bill’s co-sponsors called “the gut punch” — the formal meeting to draft the bill before sending it to the floor was abruptly postponed, and the White House offered a statement critical of the legislation later that same day. No timetable has since been offered to reschedule it, and the election is two months away. “The message it sends to elections officials is that there isn’t a sense of urgency or priority to get this done,” said Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state. Introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, the bill would require states to use backup paper ballots and to implement postelection audits to ensure that voting systems were not compromised. It would also establish clear lines of communication between state election officials, the Department of Homeland Security and voting machine vendors. Though frustrated by the delay, Mr. Lankford remained hopeful. “People only start fighting over words and phrases and grammar in a bill when they actually think it’s going to pass,” Mr. Lankford said. Ms. Klobuchar was more circumspect: “I’m optimistic only because no one has put a dagger in it yet.” But while they repeat their mantra — “this isn’t a partisan issue, it’s a national security issue” — many of the divisions over the bill are now along partisan lines. Republicans say the measure oversteps Congress’s authority. Democrats, pointing to warnings from the nation’s top intelligence and cybersecurity officials, accuse Republicans of exhibiting indifference to attacks on American democracy. Last week, the White House joined the argument, suggesting the bill violates states’ rights. “We cannot support legislation with inappropriate mandates or that moves power or funding from the states to Washington for the planning and operation of elections,” spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. For now, the ebbing of Republican support has put the bill on ice. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, said in a statement that “additional majority support” would be necessary for “a truly bipartisan election security bill to reach the floor.” He said that individual secretaries of state had expressed concerns, singling out Jim Condos, president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. Mr. Condos, Vermont’s Democratic secretary of state who twice testified to Congress in favor of the bill, said he was “thrown under the bus.” “I had no intent of postponing the bill; I just was offering insight” after reporters asked him specific questions, Mr. Condos said. “I do support moving the bill forward, though I would hope there would be some necessary changes made.” Of biggest concern, he said, is the requirement that states conduct a postelection audit after federal elections to ensure its integrity was not compromised. The first version of the bill established a pilot program that would require state election officials to manually tally randomly selected ballots to ensure the reported outcome of the election is correct. Some secretaries of state called that too onerous and costly, and the pilot program came out. In response, election integrity advocates yanked their support. “The bill as it is, we now oppose it,” said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital advocacy group. “We don’t think it reaches the minimum bar.” But Republican election officials — and some Democrats — say that unless the bill allocates additional funding to states, it is essentially an unfunded mandate. “You have local jurisdictions that are cash strapped. Now you’re going to add more requirements to process ballots,” said Kim Wyman, Washington state’s chief election official. “Congress adds these requirements, but they’ve got to provide funding or you’re setting them up to fail.” Ms. Klobuchar said she hopes to introduce an amendment that would provide state election officials with additional funding. But Mr. Lankford is not on board. He said Congress already disbursed $380 million to the states for the purpose of election improvements. “While I’m sure states would love to have more money,” he said, “this is not some new mandate on states. They already have the responsibility to be able to manage it in a way that’s reliable and trustworthy.” Eric Rosenbach, a former assistant secretary of defense for global security who has been following the legislation, is optimistic that the bill will pass, saying that some of the political tensions surrounding the bill may ease after the midterm elections in November. Still, Mr. Rosenbach said, “I’m just nervous the price of not having the perfect bill will mean we don’t have anything. It seems like a pretty heavy price to pay.”",The New York Times
2018,"Once Dry Discussions, Cabinet Meetings Are Now Part of the Trump Show","White House Memo WASHINGTON — President Trump’s cabinet meeting on Thursday began with him calling the vaunted Queen of Soul a former employee. It ended with him musing that things were looking up for American farmers who have been stung by the effects of his trade war. In between, the president called on his top economic adviser to publicly share his “very beautiful” assessment of the economy, and said Mexico and China were waging a form of war against the United States by exporting drugs to kill Americans. In other words, it was a normal cabinet meeting in the age of Trump. What was once considered a dry policy discussion among restrained public servants has turned into a kind of West Wing performance art, featuring a president prone to exaggeration and his advisers taking turns praising him and his policies. By now, the ritual has become familiar, like a monthly installment of a faithfully watched reality show with a story line that has become almost comically consistent. “Despite the horrible laws, we’re doing very well,” the president said during Thursday’s episode. He then invited Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, to detail all the successes the Trump administration was having in stopping migrants at the southwestern border. (She made no mention of the hundreds of migrant children still separated from their parents as a result of Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, announced earlier this year, toward unauthorized immigrants.) Mr. Trump spent much of the session gently quizzing his cabinet secretaries with lead-ins prodding them to offer positive comments. Past sessions have occasionally featured a sharp comment directed at an unfortunate participant on the receiving end of a televised rhetorical swipe. On Thursday, cabinet members were largely spared the indignity. But when Mr. Trump turned to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general he likes to publicly insult, the president put the nation’s top law enforcement official on the spot with a call to bring a “major federal lawsuit” against drug companies over opioids. “In China, you have some pretty big companies sending that garbage and killing our people,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s almost a form of warfare, and I’d like to do whatever you can do legally to stop it from China and from Mexico.” Occasionally, Mr. Trump will overtake the agenda to publicly vent a particularly bitter grievance. His advisers shift uncomfortably in their chairs, avoiding eye contact or bracing to clean up a public-relations mess — as was the case last month when Mr. Trump used a cabinet meeting as the backdrop to attempt a halfhearted walkback of his widely criticized news conference in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Not so at Thursday’s gathering. Mr. Trump steered clear of the more controversial news of the day — including his decision to revoke the security clearance of a prominent critic and the unflattering tell-all book by a former aide — and instead began by noting the death of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul. “I want to begin today by expressing my condolences to the family of a person I knew well,” Mr. Trump said as he opened the meeting. “She worked for me on numerous occasions. She was terrific: Aretha Franklin.” It was not clear what the president was referring to, but Ms. Franklin did perform a handful of times at Mr. Trump’s properties during her lifetime, which was far more notable for her scores of chart-topping singles, her 18 competitive Grammy Awards, her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and her performances at the inauguration of Barack Obama and for other presidents. In the middle of a health care update from R. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, Mr. Trump engaged in some wishful thinking about the repeal of the health care law enacted under Mr. Obama. “We actually got rid of Obamacare,” the president said, “except for one vote.” The Affordable Care Act remains law, although parts of it have been rescinded or weakened; a Republican effort last summer to repeal it was thwarted most famously by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Two other Republicans also voted against its repeal, as did 48 Democrats. Mr. Trump also offered his own, inaccurate explanation — one rejected by state officials and firefighting experts — for the scourge of wildfires ravaging California. He said they were the result of water being diverted into the Pacific Ocean to save fish. “We’re spending a fortune in California because of poor maintenance and because, frankly, they’re sending a lot of water out to the Pacific to protect the smelt,” Mr. Trump said. He called on Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, to repeat an argument he had made earlier in the day on television — that climate change was not to blame for the deadly blazes. “Ryan was saying it’s not a global warming thing, it’s a management situation,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Zinke obliged, blaming Canadian lumber imports — one of Mr. Trump’s favorite trade villains — for what he called displacing American-grown lumber on the market, leaving fallen trees to rot and become combustible. “So ridiculous,” Mr. Trump said with a nod. On a day when he had tweeted that the “FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY” and as hundreds of newspapers, including The New York Times, ran editorials condemning his attacks as undermining press freedoms, Mr. Trump held out his live, 57-minute cabinet meeting as a counterpoint. “If you’d like, you can stay,” Mr. Trump told the small group of reporters representing the White House press corps at the meeting. “Or if you’d like, you can also leave. Don’t forget: freedom of the press!” The president did make some news of his own. At one point, he appeared to confirm a disputed account of a deal for Turkey to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, in exchange for Washington’s help in freeing a Turkish woman detained in Israel on charges of funding Hamas. The Turkish woman was freed, but Mr. Brunson remains under house arrest in Turkey. The deal was reported widely, but disputed privately by some American officials, and White House and State Department officials have refused to publicly discuss it. The president, however, was more than happy to hold forth. “We got somebody out for him,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “He needed help getting somebody out of someplace; they came out. They want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair. Not right.” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he was ready to impose additional sanctions on members of Mr. Erdogan’s government if Mr. Brunson was not freed quickly. Other news Mr. Trump wanted to share was of dubious authenticity. He asked Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, how American farmers are faring. “The farmers like Trump,” the president said. “They’re selling the corn, and they’re selling the soybean, and they’re selling everything at levels that are soon going to be pretty good levels,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m hearing it’s starting to really pick up.” Prices for agricultural exports fell last month by the largest percentage in seven years, driven in large part by a major drop for soybeans. Mr. Perdue pushed back a bit, but only gently. “Obviously there are some price constraints right now,” he began. But, Mr. Perdue told the president, the farmers were keeping the faith. “They believe what you’re doing in China, as you’ve tried to indicate to them, will lead to a better and brighter future,” Mr. Perdue said.",The New York Times
2018,"Once at Center of Yale Protests, Professor Wins the School’s Highest Honor","Three years after racial protests consumed Yale’s campus and propelled a national conversation about free speech, Nicholas A. Christakis, a professor at the heart of the controversy, has been awarded the university’s highest faculty honor, the Sterling Professorship. The appointment is the latest turn in Yale’s continued reckoning with the fallout of the protests, which were ignited in 2015, in part, by an email from Professor Christakis’s wife, Erika Christakis, but quickly spread to what students said was a broader culture of racism. As the protests gained national attention, they came to define Professor Christakis’s reputation in certain circles, making him arguably just as well-known for his confrontation with students in a college courtyard as for his groundbreaking sociological research. In the confrontation, videos of which went viral, Professor Christakis defended his wife’s email, in which she questioned guidance that the school had sent to students about wearing what might be seen as culturally inappropriate Halloween costumes. In it she asked, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious … a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” In the years since, Professor Christakis has been both hero and pariah on Yale’s campus, seen alternately as a fierce warrior of free expression or an unapologetic defender of ignorance. And Yale, suddenly a lightning rod for conservative and progressive critics alike, has repeatedly found itself forced to reaffirm its commitment to both ideological and racial diversity. After the protests subsided, Professor Christakis stepped down from his post as the head of a residential college but retained his tenured teaching position. Yale made no mention of the controversy in its decision, which was issued in a news release last month, when many students were away for the summer. The release cited Professor Christakis’s extensive educational record and published works and his research into topics from public health to artificial intelligence. Professor Christakis is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2009. Thomas Conroy, a university spokeswoman, said the decision was made purely on academic grounds. Candidates for endowed faculty chairs such as the Sterling are proposed by the university president and approved by the board of trustees, he said. “He’s highly regarded in academic circles, he’s an outstanding scholar worthy of Yale’s highest faculty recognition,” Mr. Conroy said of Professor Christakis, “and that’s why he was named.” When asked if the 2015 protests had affected the decision, Mr. Conroy referred to a statement the university issued at the time, in which it declared that the Christakises were “deeply valued members of the university community” who had the “full support of the Yale University leadership.” But despite the university’s insistence on the separation between Professor Christakis’s academic record and his political notoriety, the controversy has continued to shape campus conversation. The campus activism led to steps students considered victories, including changing the name of Calhoun College, a residential college that had been named for John C. Calhoun, the vice president who was an ardent proponent of slavery. Students have also loudly decried more recent racially tinged incidents, such as when a white graduate student called the police in May on a black student for napping in a common room. Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, has written numerous opinion pieces about his dedication to free speech, including one in The New York Times last November. Alumni have threatened to withhold donations, and at least one, James Kirchick, has mounted a petition campaign to join Yale’s board of trustees, citing his concern for Yale’s future in light of how it handled the 2015 protests. “Professor Christakis deserves this honor irrespective of any controversy,” Mr. Kirchick, who graduated in 2006, said of the Sterling professorship. But, he said, even if the award was intended to compensate for what happened during the protests, “I don’t think it makes up for the way he was treated,” adding that he thought Yale at the time had left Professor Christakis “hung out to dry.” The immediate response to Professor Christakis’s appointment seemed muted. One recent alumna who participated in the 2015 protests told the Yale Daily News that she was shocked by what she called the “cowardice” of announcing the decision during the summer. Others told the student paper that they lauded the decision. Professor Christakis did not return a request for comment. But he has continued to weigh in on the free speech debate, sometimes obliquely — such as in an opinion piece in The Times about “teaching inclusion in a divided world,” in which he did not mention the protests — and sometimes more explicitly, like when he denounced on Twitter the “distortions and out-of-context quotes” he said people had drawn from his wife’s original email. His remarks in Yale’s announcement of the recognition were brief. “I am deeply honored by this recognition, which reflects Yale’s substantial commitment to interdisciplinary science and also the vibrant contributions of the many students and scholars on my research team,” he said. “I am eager to make myself useful to Yale’s mission.”",The New York Times
2018,"Once ‘No Longer a Nuclear Threat,’ North Korea Now in Standoff With U.S.","WASHINGTON — North Korea is insisting that the United States declare that the Korean War is over before providing a detailed, written disclosure of all its atomic weapons stockpiles, its nuclear production facilities and its missiles as a first major step toward denuclearization. Two months after President Trump declared his summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong-un a complete success, North Korea has not yet even agreed to provide that list during private exchanges with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to American and South Korean officials familiar with the talks. Mr. Pompeo maintains progress is being made, although he has provided no details. But John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, this week said, “North Korea that has not taken the steps we feel are necessary to denuclearize.” On Thursday, North Korea’s state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, called the declaration of the end of the war “the demand of our time” and that would be the “first process” in moving toward a fulfillment of the June 12 deal struck between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. Pyonygang also wants peace treaty talks to begin before detailing its arsenal. If the standoff over the parallel declarations remains, it is hard to see how the two countries can move forward with an agreement. “The North Koreans have lied to us consistently for nearly 30 years,” Joseph Nye, who wrote one of the National Intelligence Council’s first assessments of the North’s weapons programs in 1993, said at the Aspen Institute on Tuesday. “Trump is in a long tradition of American presidents who have been taken to the cleaners,” Mr. Nye said. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Pompeo has acknowledged the impasse. But officials said South Korea has quietly backed the North Korean position, betting that once Mr. Trump has issued a “peace declaration” it would be harder for him to later threaten military action if the North fails to disarm or discard its nuclear arsenal. Against North Korea’s continuing nuclear buildup — and its threats to strike the United States — Washington has long refused to formally declare the end of the war, which was halted with a 1953 armistice but never officially brought to a close. And fears remain that making concessions to Pyongyang — especially after Mr. Trump shelved annual American military exercises with South Korea that he called “war games,’’ the phrase used by the North — would outrage Republicans in Congress and open Mr. Trump to charges that he has been outmaneuvered by the North Korean leader. The White House has never reconciled Mr. Trump’s post on Twitter after meeting Mr. Kim that “there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea” with Mr. Bolton’s assessment that the Singapore agreement has so far yielded almost no progress in the nuclear arena. That view is shared by many in Congress and the American intelligence agencies. For Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo, much rides on how this standoff is resolved — or whether it results in the collapse of what the president called his determination to “solve” the nuclear crisis. Mr. Pompeo has told associates that he believes his tenure as secretary of state will be judged largely on how he handles the negotiations. In recent weeks he has softened some of his statements toward North Korea, saying the United States is open to a step-by-step approach that most officials had previously rejected. “The ultimate timeline for denuclearization will be set by Chairman Kim,” Mr. Pompeo said last week — a stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s statements last year that North Korea should give up its weapons rapidly, or face tremendous, if unspecified, consequences. Challenged about the lack of progress so far, officials at the White House and State Department pointed to three developments as signs that the strategy with North Korea is advancing. They noted that North Korea has not conducted a missile or nuclear test since November. Since the Singapore summit, Pyongyang has returned the remains of about 55 Americans killed in the Korean War, which appear genuine, a good-will gesture though one unrelated to the nuclear program. And satellite evidence suggests North Korea has begun dismantling a test site where it has developed missile technologies and launched space satellite missions. Experts cautioned, however, that all the steps taken so far are easily reversible, much as North Korea rebuilt a nuclear reactor after blowing up its cooling tower on television at the end of the George W. Bush administration. “I had low expectations about Singapore, which have been more than met,” said Christopher Hill, who negotiated the accord that resulted in the blowing up of the reactor cooling tower. He noted that the agreement that Mr. Trump struck with Mr. Kim did not go beyond commitments the North had made to Presidents Clinton and Bush. But Mr. Trump has retained his enthusiastic tone, apparently convinced he can persuade Mr. Kim to give up his weapons as long as the personal line remains open between the two leaders. Mr. Pompeo has begun talking about keeping up sanctions pressure. But Mr. Trump has said little about his earlier promises of “maximum pressure’’ against Pyongyang, recently shifting his sanctions threats for Iran — which, unlike North Korea, has no nuclear weapons. North Korea is continuing to advance its nuclear and missile capability, although in less dramatic and visible ways than last year’s missile tests. Over the past two months, the North has expanded several significant programs critical to its continued production of nuclear material and the expansion of its nuclear stockpile. While there is no agreement on how many nuclear weapons North Korea now owns, the C.I.A.’s official estimate of around 20, issued when Mr. Trump came to office, is creeping up, officials said. The current estimates are closer to 40. The Defense Intelligence Agency uses a larger figure of 60, but that assumes highly efficient production capabilities, which many experts doubt. The wide variance in weapons estimates underscores the problem of knowing whether North Korea is actually giving up its arsenal. The declared listing of its current stockpiles and production facilities is meant as a critical first step, so that American intelligence agencies can compare it to their findings, and then challenge the North Koreans if they have not revealed suspected sites. But the North Koreans have many reasons to balk at providing the declaration. They fear that once they identify locations of key facilities, the United States will use that information to target any pre-emptive strikes in the future. And they also fear that the declaration will put them on a pathway to giving everything up — or being charged with lying about the true scope of their program. Some parts of that program are hard to hide. Analysts who study satellite images say the North is firing up a large new reactor — its second at Yongbyon, its top nuclear site. Such reactors make plutonium, a main fuel of nuclear arms. The new reactor, analysts say, can make four times more than the North’s existing large reactor, which long supplied plutonium for its nuclear arsenal. Last month in Senate testimony, Mr. Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea’s plants “continue to produce fissile material,” the technical term for the fuel at the core of nuclear warheads. Separately, American intelligence officials have found that the North is continuing to make long-range missiles at a sprawling manufacturing site just north of Pyongyang, according to news reports. Analysts who study satellite imagery say they see daily activity at the plant consistent with missile production. Arms control experts say such work is unsurprising since North Korea has committed itself to few particular denuclearization steps. Stopping activity unilaterally, the experts say, would undermine its leverage in any coming arms negotiations.",The New York Times
2018,"One Dead, 17 Sickened From Salmonella Linked to Kosher Chicken","A person in New York has died and 17 people from four states were sickened from a salmonella outbreak linked to chicken from the largest kosher poultry producer in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. The C.D.C., which investigated the outbreak, said eight people were hospitalized, and cases of the illness were reported in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The outbreak started in September 2017 and the last case was reported in June 2018. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc., issued a public health alert on Friday “out of an abundance of caution due to concerns.” Several of the people sickened reported eating kosher chicken from Empire Kosher, and the strain was also identified in two facilities, one of which processes the company’s chicken, the C.D.C. said. On its website, Empire Kosher is described as the “largest producer of kosher poultry in the United States.” A spokeswoman for Empire Kosher, with headquarters in Pennsylvania, said the company did not have data that would connect the outbreak to its products, but the company is working with the Food Safety Inspection Service and the C.D.C. “We are shocked and saddened to have just learned there may have been a death potentially related to a salmonella outbreak and we extend our sympathies to anyone affected,” Alecia Pulman, the spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added: “We take food safety and the health of our consumers very seriously and any illness, even potentially linked to our products, is unacceptable. We continue to very aggressively work to ensure the quality and safety of our products.” The C.D.C. said in a news release that it is not advising people to avoid eating kosher chicken or Empire Kosher brand chicken. “This outbreak is a reminder that germs in raw chicken can spread around food preparation areas and can make you sick,” said Brittany Behm, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. “We advise that people always cook raw chicken to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid food poisoning.”",The New York Times
2018,One Hundred Miles From Here,"solver stories Solving the crossword helps a young woman stay connected to family as she ventures toward independence. In the living room, in the light thrown by a flickering fire, my dad is doing the crossword. He has one ankle propped on the other knee. There’s a window open and the smell of wood smoke from other people’s fires drifts inside. His reading glasses are balanced over the bridge of his nose, his mouth fixed in a hard line of concentration, blue eyes squinting. The only sounds are the crackle of sparks in the grate, the soft flutter of newsprint whenever he shifts in his seat on the couch. His pen hovers one inch above the paper, waiting. I used to sit up nights watching him as he studied the crossword, that sustained stillness and then the flash of a grin whenever he decoded a resistant clue, the pen punctuating the air like a triumphant baton. I marveled at his completed puzzles, not a single box crossed out or empty, the sureness of the ink. Everything was knowable. And my dad had all the answers. My dad has been my protector and my guide, but he is also my mirror image. We are both stubborn and intense. We share an eager skepticism and a wry sense of humor. When I was in high school, our similarities, charged with emotion, could explode into anger. Crossword puzzles gave us a quiet space for bonding, a shared contentment. My dad has taught me many things: How to bend my left hand into the shape of a guitar chord; how to whistle with a blade of grass pressed between my thumbs; how to fine-tune a sentence until it sings. When I wanted to learn how to do the crossword as a teenager, he patiently explained the rules of the game to me, the tricks and signals, the three-letter responses that show up once a week. Mostly I learned by sitting by his side, mimicking his squint, leaning over when I got stuck. I did two or three or four puzzles a day, covering activity books with scribbled mistakes. I was ecstatic when I graduated to The New York Times crossword, practicing and practicing until I could race through Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, though, I tended to crash against the limits of my knowledge and experience. I struggled with Thursdays because there always seemed to be some unforeseen ruse hidden among the clues. Frustration burned into doubt. Would I ever be as smart as my dad? There were so many things I didn’t know and guessing didn’t help. When, after many months of effort, I finally finished a Thursday for the first time, I could hardly believe it. I was prouder of this moment than any ‘A’ on my report card. Here was proof that I could conquer something difficult, that a growing stack of attempts didn’t necessarily mean I had failed. My willfulness, so often a source of friction with my father, could propel me through long stretches of fruitlessness. This was a lesson I would return to again and again. As I’ve muddled through young adulthood, I’ve often felt dejected or lost. I would call my Dad, late at night, hoping there was something he could say to erase this grief or that ache. His steadiness has always been a solace to me, but in the face of rejection — romantic, professional or otherwise — sometimes all he could do was listen. I have learned by now that my Dad doesn’t know all the answers, that there are problems he cannot solve. There are times when even he can’t summon the right words, when he sputters for trying. Much as I would like to draw borders around the edges of my setbacks, to define and close them off, most heartbreaks and disappointments have no outline; they bleed ragged and without warning. Some empty boxes can’t be neatly filled. But solving has also taught me that there are few obstacles that persistence won’t wear down, that slow, careful work can yield the kind of victory worth savoring. Shortcuts won’t get you anywhere; true accomplishment is work. I have learned how to train the full force of my attention on one word, turning it over and over until it splits into unexpected meanings. It is no accident that I became a writer. When I was growing up, New York City was more of a vision than a place. It was barely one hundred miles from my parents’ house in suburban Philadelphia, but it hardly felt real, a noisy daydream patched together from television shows and novels. I read the words at the top of the newspaper on the kitchen table every morning, The New York Times, but I had nothing tangible to match to them. I made the big move to the city after college, and the crossword became a comfort to me. Seeing other passengers on the subway with the puzzle clasped against a book sent a current of recognition pattering through my chest. This is how I built belonging in a new town, one stranger’s caught glance at a time. But even after five years in New York City, there are times I fear my heart is still back in Pennsylvania, the streets and yards where my family has lived for generations. You can still find my Dad by the fire after dinner with the crossword folded into quarters on his lap. Most days, he still outpaces me in solving (except when it’s clear that a millennial constructed the grid. Then it’s he who asks for a hint). When I’m lonely for the sense of home I left behind, I buy the paper at the bodega on the corner and carry it to my apartment tucked under one elbow. I flip through the pages until I find the puzzle and fold the Arts section into quarters, cross my legs on the couch, and think of my dad, holding the same pose just one hundred miles from here.

2018,"One Last Time, McCain Counterprograms Trump","Critic’s Notebook Thursday morning, in images carried live on every major cable news network, the body of Senator John McCain arrived at the North Phoenix Baptist Church in a hearse with the word “Dignity” on the rear window. Inside, the Republican senator was remembered, by a man who ran on a ticket against him, for a friendship that transcended political difference. Thursday night, at an Indiana campaign rally carried live on Fox News, President Trump accused his former opponent, Hillary Clinton, of “getting away with” unnamed misdeeds; attacked his own Justice Department and F.B.I. for not “doing their job”; and taunted “elite” detractors: “I’m president, and they’re not.” The broadcasts were separate. But they were not unrelated. They amounted to a last argument between the senator and the president who clashed with him in life (“I like people who weren’t captured”) and slighted him in death. They were competing programs with competing visions, not of policy, but of civic life. Mr. McCain, who died Saturday, had no control over the president’s itinerary. But as an omnipresent Sunday-show guest who courted reporters on his “Straight Talk Express” campaign bus, he was not unaware in life of how things played on TV. As he worked out the details of his ceremonies in his final days, he had to know that he was not only orchestrating his farewell. He was also counterprogramming the long-running, corrosive TV serial in which Mr. Trump is accustomed to being the star. Mr. McCain planned the itinerary. He picked the music. (Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” played as the recessional.) And he invited the speakers, especially — an unmistakable retort to the never-forgive-never-forget Trump spirit — his rivals. On Saturday, the former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both of whom he ran against, will eulogize him in Washington. On Thursday, a succession of speakers led to former Vice President Joseph Biden. “My name’s Joe Biden,” he said. “I’m a Democrat. And I love John McCain.” Mr. Biden’s speech was tender and empathetic, drawing on his own loss of his wife and children to sympathize with the McCain family. But it turned fiery, his voice roused to a holler, when he praised his colleague’s personal code. “You could come to a different conclusion,” Mr. Biden said. “But where he’d part company with you is if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing that this project is bigger than yourself.” If it wasn’t already clear, Mr. Biden was grieving more than the loss of a friend. Mr. Biden did not confine his criticism to the Trump era. He recalled when party leaders warned him and Mr. McCain against being friendly on the Senate floor — “It doesn’t look good” — in the 1990s, which he said was “when things began to change for the worse.” Pundits on cable saw the anecdote as a challenge to the senators at the service. But he could as well have been addressing the networks themselves, and the environment of strife they thrive in. The 1990s, after all, were not just the era of culture war and the Clinton impeachment, but also when Fox and MSNBC joined CNN on the air. No one mentioned Mr. Trump by name, though Tommy Espinoza, a Democrat who spoke for Mr. McCain at the 2008 Republican National Convention, said of his friend, “What he knew was that we all make America great.” Mr. McCain pointedly did not invite Mr. Trump. And what if he had? It’s nearly impossible to imagine Mr. Trump carrying out an unwritten responsibility of office in the TV era: comforting the bereaved, speaking with kindness of someone with whom he disagreed, putting another person’s memory before his own presence. Instead, he’s become a civic freelancer, heading the government but peripheral to the moral function of society. Tragedy strikes and people simultaneously wish the President would make a statement and hope that Donald Trump doesn’t say anything. Mr. Trump did not say anything about Mr. McCain in his hour-plus Indiana appearance. The rally was standard Trump combo platter, casting Mr. Trump as the president of the people who voted for him, and encouraging them to revel in grievance and animus. He rehashed his 2016 election win, more than once. He whipped up the crowd against the media, the day the F.B.I. arrested a man for threatening to kill Boston Globe employees, using Mr. Trump’s phrase “enemy of the people.” He said that he was no longer allowed to call Hispanic gang members “animals,” a term he then repeated several times. He invited his crowd to imagine “if Crooked Hillary Clinton had won.” Mr. McCain’s colleagues remembered a man who was a friend even while they fought. Mr. Trump, still playing his campaign-rally character on TV, promises the joy of savaging your enemies even after they’ve been defeated. His rally crowds (including the one in Indiana) still chant “Lock her up!” nearly two years after Mrs. Clinton’s loss, joined in one case by his attorney general. This was the bargain the country made electing someone who became a celebrity for saying “You’re fired,” who uses the terms “nice” and “Boy Scout” as insults, who once told People magazine, “Man is the most vicious of all animals, and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat.” John McCain was, per nearly everyone who spoke about him, a battler, too. But he coordinated his last media blitz to say that American leaders should, after and even amid a fight, see their opponents as humans and not simply obstacles to be crushed. It was his last argument from the grave, but as Mr. Trump has made clear, it is not something we can expect, for the moment anyway, in this life.",The New York Times
2018,"One Pound of Shrimp, a Meal for Four","City KITCHEN Here, a little shrimp — chopped, spiced and tossed with rice noodles — goes a long way. Here’s how to feed a family of four with a pound of shrimp: It starts with a visit to the fish market, and ends with a dish of spicy, deeply flavorful shrimp-flecked rice noodles. You’ll first want to look for wild shrimp in the shell, fresh or frozen, unless you have access to sustainably raised farmed shrimp. Be aware that most farmed frozen shrimp, though inexpensive, are of dubious origin, and are likely dipped in some kind of preservative solution. I’d rather get a small amount of higher-priced wild shrimp. Ask to have the shrimp peeled and deveined, or do it yourself at home. Then, start chopping: Using a large knife, cut the shrimp crosswise into rough quarter- to half-inch pieces. In a few minutes, you’ll have a nice pile. You are essentially making a flavorful mixture of spiced minced shrimp that’s similar in shape and bite to crumbled sausage. You’ll add ginger, garlic, soy sauce, scallions, sesame oil and hot red pepper and let the flavors meld: The longer it rests in the fridge, the more aromatic the mixture becomes. (By the way, this mixture could also be used as a won ton filling, but that’s another story and a bigger project.) For this recipe, an optional but desirable ingredient is dried shrimp, found in Latin American and Asian grocers. I buy mine in Manhattan’s Chinatown, where a generic type and a superior quality wild dried shrimp from Louisiana are available. It’s surprising how just a tablespoon deepens the flavor of the shrimp mixture. (If you do end up seeking out dried shrimp, don’t let it languish in the back of your pantry: It can also be used to enhance fish stews.) Once you’ve marinated the chopped shrimp, stir-fry it in a large wok or frying pan over high heat until it sizzles and achieves a crumbly texture, just as you would when frying any other sort of minced meat. It’s then combined with cooked rice noodles, just to heat them through and coat them with the well-seasoned shrimp meat and its juices. Sprinkled with chopped peanuts and a few herb sprigs, your dinner for four is ready. It’s that easy.

2018,One Tesla Investor Wants It to Stay Public,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Elon Musk has insisted that taking Tesla private would allow the company to achieve its potential. On Thursday, one Tesla investor took issue with Mr. Musk’s argument. In a public letter, Catherine Wood, the chief investment officer of ARK Invest, beseeched Tesla’s chief executive not to go forward with his plan. On Aug. 7, Mr. Musk proposed in a tweet taking Tesla private at $420 a share, which would value the company at about $71.6 billion. He did not elaborate on any sources of financing that day but said he expected about two-thirds of Tesla’s current shareholders to “roll over into a private Tesla.” In a blog post on Tesla’s website, Mr. Musk explained his reasoning. “As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,” he said. Ms. Wood — whose firm owned a roughly 0.26 percent stake in Tesla as of June 30, according to public filings — argued in her letter that the public markets would better support Tesla’s growth over the long term. From her letter: “If you do not take Tesla private, you will be surprised and gratified at investor reaction once they realize and understand the scope and ramifications of your long-term vision and strategies. With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.” Ms. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a “mobility as a service” provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm’s calculations, that could lift Tesla’s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent. But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing. ARK’s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla’s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company’s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock. ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK’s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings. If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm’s forecast for what the company’s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.",The New York Times
2018,One Wine Glass to Rule Them All,"Front burner For a wine critic’s personal stemware line, one size fits all. Choosing stemware for every varietal does not interest the English wine critic Jancis Robinson. Her line includes a single mouth-blown wine glass with a generous bowl and a gently tapering tulip shape that she says can be used to serve anything: Champagne, white and red wines, sherries and ports. The glass holds a good 15.5 ounces, but a drinkable four ounces will fill it to the widest part. It’s comfortable to grasp, to swirl and to drink from. (There’s a companion stemless water glass in the same shape.) Yet when it comes to decanters, Ms. Robinson does not think one size fits all. There’s a broad-based young wine decanter that will expose the liquid to more air and soften it, and a narrower one for older wines shaped to help retain the fragile fruit and aroma. The line — designed by Richard Brendon of London — is lead-free and dishwasher safe.

2018,Open Thread: Fashion Week Is Coming,"Get ready! Also, some thoughts on sneakers for work and life, not sports. Hello and happy end of summer. I know, I know. It hurts just to write it. Also, it’s so hot in New York it doesn’t feel possible. Yet here I am, back at my desk after two weeks of vacation, pining for the ratty old shorts I’ve worn for the last many days, and preparing for both school and fashion month to begin. ON THE SAME DAY. Help. Normally this period is the calm before the designer deluge, so I can do things like schedule dental appointments. And yet, in the last few days: 1. Zegna bought Thom Browne, saying it was worth $500 million, making that brand potentially the most global of the generation of American names that emerged after the Marc-Michael-Narciso gang. 2. Lanvin has announced a new chief executive, which means that a new designer cannot be far behind. That in turn raises the question of whether the memory of what once was (Alber Elbaz) is now so eroded by past corporate misjudgment that there is opportunity to rebuild, or there’s just no going back. 3. And Nina Ricci named two upstart creative directors to replace the former designer Guillaume Henry: Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh. They won the top prize at the Hyères fashion festival and were finalists in the LVMH young designer awards, which suggests that Ms. Ricci may now be angling for the cool youth vote as opposed to jolie madame nostalgia. All of that at the end of August! What gives? It’s interfering with my pre-fashion week prep (which mostly involves meditative breathing in the face of what’s to come, and dry cleaning all the clothes I haven’t worn while I’ve been in the woods). It all starts next week — officially Thursday but actually (because this is fashion, and fashion follows its own inconsistent calendar) Wednesday evening, when Tom Ford kicks things off with his show at the Park Avenue Armory. Then it’s all shows all the time through the following Wednesday, when Rihanna brings the New York schedule to a close with her Savage x Fenty show (that’s her lingerie line), which is taking place somewhere in Brooklyn. There will be a bittersweet cast over the event, as the fashion world mourns the loss of Ruth Finley, one of its unsung heroes and the founder of the calendar. She was effectively the godmother of what became modern Fashion Week. We (that is, Matthew Schneier, Guy Trebay, Ruth La Ferla and I) will be your guides through it all, so follow us on Twitter and Instagram, check in for daily reviews and features, and email this newsletter with any questions you may have about this strange ritual known as the Shows. But before that, watch some U.S. Open tennis to take your mind off what’s coming and decide if you agree with this piece I wrote about the tennis dress; remember the woman who created Chanel’s Vamp nail polish (I loved Vamp. Did you?); and check out the looks at Afropunk. Have a good long weekend. Q: I’m confused. I know that it seems to be increasingly acceptable to wear sneakers to work, for going out, etc. I went to Footlocker and other sporty stores; the new sneakers there are insane. There are so many layers of sneakerhead-dom that I am lost in a sea of sneakers. All I DO know is that I HATE the way those Balenciaga triple-sole sneakers look (and would never … could never … pay $875 for a pair of tennies). I already have two pairs of Stan Smiths, but they are so flat that my poor feet rebel. I am looking for some kind of pseudo running shoe. Help? — Maria, Cold Spring, N.Y. A: As someone approaching the marathon of fashion month, I have converted to spending much of my work life in Nikes and am all for the emergence of sneakers from sports to subculture to mainstream staple. But with such an explosion comes the related ill: option anxiety. Every brand is jumping on the bandwagon, and pretty much every trend is represented. I have some friends who adore this kind of choice, but personally I tend to find it overwhelming. (In my early 20s, when I was buying my first sofa, I went to Macy’s and was surrounded by so many couches that I actually sat down on one and cried.) So here’s what I’d do: Start with a basic color — I like black because white gets so dirty — and silhouette. My favorite is the Nike LunarSolo (in black), which has a pretty minimal profile and a very comfortable sole. Malina Joseph Gilchrist, T’s style director, said: “Personally, I wear the Nike Air Max in all white with black swoosh. They are classic, cool and comfortable.” She also recommends these Adidas Originals, in both colors and neutrals. If you are willing to go further afield, though, I’d look a Chuck Taylor II low-tops, which are both less expensive and also explicitly made for more arch support. (Also, I really love their collaboration with JW Anderson, if you are feeling adventurous.) And if you prefer a sneaker that is not immediately branded or recognizable, which is no bad thing, check out the Greats: Brooklyn-based, Italian-made and conceived for the sports of office and social politics. Or, if you are willing to spend a bit more, Malina suggests the Swedish brand Eytys, which has a Scandinavian aesthetic and built-in arch support. Very Alfred Nobel.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Opera of Demons ,"Trump has created a series of odd bedfellows. Opinion Columnist Donald Trump has warped reality. He has turned porn star Stormy Daniels into Joan of Arc. He has brought Robert Mueller’s protectors to the defense of the horrid Jeff Sessions, who may well be a racist and is definitely a monster for conducting the policy of family separations at our southern border. He has made foul-mouthed, bullying Michael Cohen, Trump’s “fixer,” emerge as an antihero. He has made Senators Bob Corker and the Tea Party darling Jeff Flake appear as valiant crusaders for integrity, unafraid to put principle above party. In this dramatic opera of demons, the lesser evils are part of the phalanx standing between us and the greater evils: Trump’s corruption, possible criminality, and definite rage, racism and cruelty. They are also what has helped to buy time for Mueller to complete his investigation before Trump can end it. This is where we are now: building coalitions around causes, often with those to whom we take offense or even despise. The enemy of my enemy is my temporary tool. Hopefully these coalitions will not need to be longstanding. Trump’s fortress of fraudulence is showing cracks. A life lived on the edges of the law is inching into full view. Justice is yearning to be served. Last week, not only did Cohen implicate Trump in a criminal conspiracy, Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, told MSNBC: “Mr. Cohen has knowledge of certain subjects that should be of interest to the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election.” Cohen flipped, and Trump flipped out. He gave a rambling, nearly incoherent interview to Fox News, in which he not only seemed to confess to a campaign finance violation, one of the things Cohen pleaded guilty to, but he also made himself sound more like a mob boss than a law-and-order president. He told the network: “If somebody defrauded a bank and he is going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you will go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made, in all fairness to him, most people are going to do that. … And I have seen it many times. I have had many friends involved in this stuff. It’s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal.” The use of informants is a central part of how some criminal prosecutions are executed. This is how the justice system works. Trump is a man who has lived a life evading justice, using the legal system and the threat of legal action against people. For him, the justice system is a tool at the disposal of the wealthy and the ruthless, one to be used against anyone of lesser means and lesser fortitude. In his mind, the fact that he may be implicated by the justice system is a blasphemy, a distortion of the American power structure, in which the wealthy almost always win. As he told Fox: “I’ve always had controversy in my life and I’ve always succeeded. I’ve always won. I’ve always won.” CNN’s Chris Cillizza wrote about that comment: Two notes here: a) he’s right — his entire life has been controversial and b) he only sees things through the lens of winning or losing. There is no other measure of success or failure. If you win, you were right. Not only has Cohen flipped, but The New York Times also reported last week: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan struck a deal earlier this summer with Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, granting him immunity for his grand jury testimony about Michael D. Cohen, a person briefed on the arrangement said Friday.” And not only that, but The Wall Street Journal reported last week that David Pecker, chairman and C.E.O. of American Media — which publishes the National Enquirer — was also granted immunity in the Cohen case. This wannabe-king’s court is filled with rats and weasels more interested in their own preservation than his. Trump demands loyalty, and loyalty freely given should be honored and revered. When the dishonorable attempt to purchase it, either with money or fear, it will always prove false in the end. No one can outrun the truth forever. Eventually, the truth always catches up. It comes out. It shines. I predict that the whole truth of Trump will shock the world, even more than it is already shocked. Trump may have the undying loyalty of the zombies who rose from what was once the mainstream Republican Party, but not even that can forever stave off the reckoning. I’m not a very religious person, but I am fond of Galatians 6:7 in the Bible: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,Operalia Opens Doors to the Best Stages; Winners Claim the Prize,"PARIS — Along with talent and determination, the path to operatic glory demands strong nerves, charm and charisma, good connections and a healthy dose of luck. But if you can add to that a top prize in Plácido Domingo’s Operalia, then a glittering career is off to a solid start. Here are seven singers for whom this competition proved a turning point. Ms. Stemme was a Mozartian coloratura soprano when she became the joint winner of the first Operalia held in Paris 25 years ago. Since then, she has taken on ever more dramatic parts, passing through Puccini’s lighter roles, such as Mimi in “La Bohème,” to the “big voice” leads in “Tosca” and “Turandot.” Then she was offered Wagner. Before agreeing to sing Isolde at Glyndebourne in 2003, she consulted her idol (and fellow Swede), the great dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson. Ms. Stemme went ahead, won plaudits and later recorded the opera, “Tristan und Isolde,” with Mr. Domingo as Tristan. Today, it is as a Wagnerian soprano that Ms. Stemme is most in demand. Now 55, with “Turandot” and “Tosca” again on her 2019 schedule along with Richard Strauss’s “Elektra” at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, she is clearly not ready to live off her many laurels. By the time Mr. Schrott, a Uruguayan-born bass-baritone, won the top prize in Operalia in 1998, the competition had become the place where leading opera houses looked for new talent. Mr. Schrott, who had moved from Montevideo to Italy just two years earlier to gain experience, was still only 26. Almost overnight, Operalia launched him onto the world’s great stages, from La Scala in Milan and London’s Royal Opera House to the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Los Angeles Opera. On his calling card were three names — Don Giovanni, Leporello and Figaro — those wonderful Mozartian roles that demand both good acting and a resonant yet lyrical voice. For some years, Mr. Schrott and the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko were partners on stage and in life, singing together in recitals and operas and having a son together in 2008. Even now, as friends, they occasionally appear together. Don Giovanni is still the role that Mr. Schrott is most offered, but he is also called on to sing Mephistopheles in both Gounod’s “Faust” and Arrigo Boito’s “Mefistofele” as well as Escamillo in Bizet’s “Carmen,” Banquo in Verdi’s “Macbeth” and Dulcamara in Donizetti’s “L’Elisir d’Amore.” Operalia 1998 proved to be an excellent vintage because Ms. DiDonato, the American mezzo-soprano who came second to Mr. Schrott, has also gone on to enjoy a scintillating career. Her voice is well suited for Mozart and Handel, but she has also taken on many of the bel canto roles created by Rossini, as in “La Cenerentola,” “Semiramide,” “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” and “L’Italiana in Algeri” as well as Donizetti’s “Maria Stuarda.” Today, at 49, Ms. DiDonato has joined a privileged circle of singers whose casting in any opera suffices to draw a big audience. The Kansas-born singer also gives frequent recitals, and she led the noisy crowd in “Rule Britannia” at the Last Night of the Proms in London in 2013. But to break away from the familiar, Ms. DiDonato has also sung some of the choice roles in the mezzo canon, among them Charlotte in Massenet’s “Werther,” the composer in Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos” and the trouser role of Octavian in Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier.” Another who can thank Operalia for his immediate recognition is Mr. Villazón, a Mexican tenor who was just 27 when he won second prize in 1999 (along with the Prize of the Audience and the Zarzuela Prize). In the decade that followed, he emerged as the most exciting of the post-Pavarotti and post-Domingo generation of tenors, with his acting — and his sense of humor — part of his considerable appeal. His early roles included Nemorino in “L’Elisir d’Amore,” Des Grieux in Massenet’s “Manon” and Macduff in Verdi’s “Macbeth.” But it was the romantic roles of Rodolfo in “La Bohème” and Alfredo in “La Traviata,” often singing opposite Ms. Netrebko, which won him immense popularity. Some critics, though, warned that he was singing too much and, indeed, between 2007 and 2011, he suffered vocal problems that at one point required surgery. Since his return, Mr. Villazón has been more cautious, opting for Mozart operas and recitals over heavier Verdi roles. A Bulgarian soprano, Ms. Yoncheva, 36, has become one of the most sought-after singers in the eight years since she shared the top prize in Operalia 2010. In her 20s, she was lucky to belong to William Christie’s ensemble, Le Jardin des Voix, which focuses on early and Baroque music. After major opera houses spotted her at Operalia, she followed the customary path of rising sopranos through “La Bohème,” “La Traviata” and “Rigoletto.” This then led to heavier title roles, such as Bellini’s “Norma” at Covent Garden and Verdi’s “Luisa Miller” at the Met in New York as well as the ill-fated Elisabeth da Valois in Verdi’s “Don Carlos” in a Paris Opera French version this season. Ms. Yoncheva’s professional calendar is already filled well into the 2020s. Long before Ms. Yende had discovered opera, even longer before she won joint first prize and two other prizes in Operalia 2011 in Moscow, she had learned the joy of singing thanks to church choirs in her native South Africa. Yet from then to now, Ms. Yende, 33, has made her mark in this highly competitive arena at a remarkable speed. Luck, of course, can play its part. Her debut at the Met in New York in 2013 came when, at the last minute, she was called on to sing the role of Countess Adèle in Rossini’s “Le Comte Ory,” opposite Juan Diego Flórez, the reigning Rossini tenor of our times. Since then, Ms. Yende has become a major box-office draw at the Met in her own right, taking on lead roles in “L’Elisir d’Amore,” Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor,” Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette” and Bellini’s “Il Puritani.” And she returns this season as Marie in Donizetti’s “La Fille du Régiment” and as Leïla in Bizet’s “Les Pêcheurs de Perles.” She has added Micaëla in “Carmen” and Pamina in “Die Zauberflöte,” among others. And her career has barely begun. Nothing delights the opera world more than a grand entrance of a young soprano with glamour and voice to match. That happened with Ms. Netrebko some years ago, it is happening now with Ms. Yoncheva and Ms. Yende and, hot on their heels, here comes Ms. Garifullina, who at the age of 25 won first prize in Operalia 2013. After her triumph, she joined the Vienna State Opera company where, over three years, she built up a repertory of new roles, including Zerlina in “Don Giovanni,” the part in which she will make her debut at the Met in January. Indeed, in the way opera houses rush to sign up rising stars, her dance card is rapidly filling up. Ms. Garifullina also seems ready for adventure. On June 13, the eve of the opening of the World Cup in Russia, she performed in a concert in Red Square and appeared the next day before an audience of hundreds of millions, singing a duet with the pop star Robbie Williams (above).",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Orthodox and Secular Views of Israel’s Path,"letters Readers discuss an Op-Ed article lamenting Israeli actions in the past year. To the Editor: In his essay “Israel, This Is Not Who We Are” (Op-Ed, Aug. 14), Ronald S. Lauder sees the Israeli sky falling, as a result of Israel’s “destructive actions” like the maintenance of traditional Jewish religious decorum at the Western Wall, which Mr. Lauder criticizes as coming at the expense of a planned egalitarian prayer space, and a new Israeli law that establishes Israel as a state with a Jewish identity, which he says “damages the sense of equality and belonging of Israel’s Druze, Christian and Muslim citizens.” But Israel, as a self-described Jewish state, needs a Jewish standard for public behavior at religious sites and to inform religious personal status issues. The standard that has served the state since its formation has been the Jewish standard of the ages — what the world calls Orthodoxy. And, whether or not the nation-state law was necessary or wise, it does not impinge in any way on the equality before the law of any Israeli citizen. Israel is not, as Mr. Lauder says some think, “losing its way.” It is the vast majority of the world’s Jews, those who do not regard their religious heritage as important, who are in danger of being lost — to the Jewish people. And it is those indifferent Jews who have the most to gain from the example of Israel preserving the traditional Jewish standards and values that have stood the test of history. Avi ShafranNew YorkThe writer, a rabbi, is the director of public affairs for Agudath Israel of America. To the Editor: I’ll bet that reading Ronald S. Lauder’s Op-Ed article helped thousands of American secular Jews like me — someone who has been so proud of the genius of Israel — to breathe again. We had been holding our breath because under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Orthodox Jews were removing democracy, the brick on which the Jewish state had been built, from its core of values. Israel can be a true Jewish state only if every person is valued equally. Jews across the world pray and hope for that to happen. Sandra EisdorferChapel Hill, N.C.",The New York Times

2018,"Oscar Niemeyer Defined Modern Brazil. Now, an Artist Is Rethinking One of His Houses.","Set against the dramatic hills of Rio de Janeiro, Adriana Varejão’s recently renovated home brings the architect’s vision to startling new life. Adriana Varejão and Pedro Buarque’s concrete house in the Jardim Botânico neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro was designed by Oscar Niemeyer in 1969.CreditCreditStefan Ruiz DRIVING UP THE STREET — which, this being a nice residential neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, is a fortress of fences and high-level security gates — you nearly miss it. Nestled in the verdant Jardim Botânico district — where toucans fly from tree to tree and monkeys can be heard laughing in the afternoon — sits an elegant house designed in 1969 by the great Modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. It is a stack of white boxes along a hilltop, all right angles against the lush green flora of Brazil, with a spiral staircase to reach the highest box, which stands like a turret overlooking the city. The cliffs that encircle Rio tower dramatically above, beyond which rise the outstretched arms of the city’s Christ the Redeemer statue. Read more: A Guide to Rio de Janeiro’s Coastal Cool Niemeyer originally designed the property for his wife’s sister, Carmen Baldo. Seven years ago, Baldo’s children sold it to the artist Adriana Varejão and her partner, the film producer Pedro Buarque. Despite its Modernist allure, the house was not an easy sell. The glass walls between the terrace and the living room no longer opened. The ceramic steps and floors that blanketed the property looked dingy. The concrete railing — concrete is cheap, and Niemeyer’s sister-in-law wasn’t wealthy — had failed to acquire a patina. The narrow driveway alongside the house leading to the garage was impossible to navigate because there was no room to turn around. Downstairs, where the bedrooms had been placed along a looming corridor, was dark and gloomy. To fix these problems, the couple embarked on an ambitious five-year renovation that honors the legacy of Niemeyer and the promise of Brazilian Modernism perhaps even better than his original design. In recent decades, Modernism has become solely an aesthetic, divorced from its original intentions. And so, more unusual than the fact of Varejão and Buarque’s restoration is how well it pays homage to Niemeyer’s heritage and architectural philosophy — his lyrical and idiosyncratic sensibilities, scaled perfectly to the mountainous terrain, with large open spaces where the indoors blends seamlessly with the outside. OSCAR RIBEIRO DE Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho, born in 1907 in Rio de Janeiro, was one of Brazil’s greatest architects, and certainly its most famous. No other hand has done as much as his to shape the dimensions of the country, reflecting back its primitive beauty — the roiling depths of the sea, the undulating curves of the shoreline, the dense jungle — in its buildings. Along with his teacher-mentor, the architect and urban planner Lúcio Costa, and the landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, Niemeyer was part of a group of Brazilian Modernists who believed in constructing a nation that would usher itself into a new era of equality and prosperity. All three, but especially Niemeyer, were deeply influenced by the French architect Le Corbusier. Like Le Corbusier, Niemeyer was partial to working with reinforced concrete, the flexibility and sturdiness of which helped his structures achieve the poetic, biomorphic forms that came to define his work. Just look at the hovering saucer of the Niterói Contemporary Art Museum (1996), perched at the edge of Rio’s Guanabara Bay, or the Cathedral of Brasília’s (1970) brilliant white crown of spears, which seems to sprout from the earth. As Niemeyer famously wrote in 1998, “I am not attracted to straight angles or to the straight line, hard and inflexible, created by man. I am attracted to free-flowing, sensual curves. The curves that I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the ocean and on the body of the beloved woman.” Niemeyer’s legacy rests largely in his creation of the city of Brasília in the late 1950s, which he conceived with Costa, at the behest of Brazil’s president at the time, Juscelino Kubitschek, who had campaigned with the slogan “Fifty years’ progress in five.” Kubitschek was an ambitious leader who believed Brazil could industrialize at lightning speed, shed its colonial past and compete in the global economy. Located hundreds of miles inland, Brasília was erected in just three and a half years at an exorbitant cost (estimates put it at the tens of billions in today’s dollars), replacing Rio as the country’s capital in 1960. Niemeyer, who found inspiration in Le Corbusier’s unrealized Radiant City, a utopian concept where life was ordered by design, wrote: “The seat of government must be established in the heart of Brazil’s vast territory, so that it surveys the whole national panorama, so that it will be within reach of all the classes and all the regions.” But once made, the large plazas meant to stimulate civic life remained empty. The thousands of workers who had traveled from the less industrialized parts of the country were left stranded in the low-income housing, or favelas, that had been hastily erected during construction. In 1964, a military coup supported by the United States government changed the course of the nation forever. Politically to the left of the new military regime, Niemeyer moved to Paris in 1967. His career suffered. Over the decades, architectural Modernism became less popular, perceived as too dogmatic — but Niemeyer continued to work, finding newfound appreciation in the years before his death at the age of 104 in 2012. Some of his most stunning works are in Brasília, including the Supreme Court (1958-60), whose columns of concrete clad in white marble echo the fluttering of a sheet in the wind. Ultimately, though, Brasília’s failure overshadows its monumental promise. Brasília is also where Varejão spent the beginning of her childhood. The artist was born in Rio, but her parents moved to the city when she was 2 years old. Her father was a pilot in the air force. Her mother worked in public health as a nutritionist in Sobradinho, one of the several satellite cities ringing Brasília’s perimeter. Accompanying her on hospital visits, Varejão witnessed firsthand the inequality Brasília created. “The future never happened,” Varejão tells me, “Brasília left us with some very nice buildings — I’m not saying they aren’t important — but it was at a very high cost.” ONE MAY AFTERNOON, Varejão, 53, welcomes me to her studio, located five minutes from her home. It is autumn in Rio, though it feels like spring until I sense the sun hastily setting over the horizon. Varejão is preparing for a summer show with the Victoria Miro gallery in Venice, as well as her largest and most significant show to date with Gagosian Gallery, to be held in New York City in early 2020. She is at work on some large-scale paintings inspired by Mexican ceramic tiles (talaveras) as well as a series of sculptures made from polyurethane, painted to resemble tiled walls but whose insides are revealed as bloody innards. Her process for the former involves pouring a mixture of glue and plaster into a flat, lipped canvas, which is then left to dry over several days. The plaster cracks naturally, and Varejão paints them in a monochromatic white, coloring the edges a claylike shade to lend them the appearance of cracked terra cotta. In previous work, Varejão has created abstract, vaguely discomfiting images on the cracked canvases — on others, the distinctive blue patterns of traditional Portuguese tiles (azulejos). To Varejão, the azulejo is a metaphor for the complicated history that defines Brazil; it is hers to manipulate in various formations and with various patterns, at once beautiful and familiar, but also deeply disquieting. Varejão is one of Brazil’s most important living artists. She is primarily a painter, but she has worked in other mediums such as photography, video and sculpture. Her work is, in many ways, in dialogue with that of last century’s Italian painter Lucio Fontana, who famously took the scalpel to the canvas and slashed it — “Art dies but is saved by gesture,” he wrote in 1948. If Fontana alluded to pain with his holes and cuts, then Varejão takes the symbolism one step further, illustrating violence through literal renderings of blood and gore. At Varejão’s urging, I visit the São Bento Monastery, a Benedictine abbey completed in 1671, located across the city in downtown Rio. Inside, its Baroque details — ornate gold-leaf gilding and Rococo painted tiles — are transportive, delivering one to a much older Brazil. But after witnessing the violence rendered by Varejão’s brush, I cannot help but see this other Brazil as tainted with the complicity of colonialism’s brutality. The strange geometry of Brasília is a world apart. Niemeyer’s idealism — his belief that architecture could create a world that was post-race and post-class — was naïve, perhaps, but understandable. How else can a nation propel itself forward after having been so carelessly used — stripped and mined, bought and sold, without any consideration for anything but profit? The clean lines and syncopated curves of Niemeyer’s architecture seem necessary compared to Baroque’s dense hierarchy. TODAY, THE CARMEN Baldo house is no longer a relic. In a dramatic reconfiguration, Varejão and Buarque decided to move the garage underground, which required digging deep into the hill. Even more flamboyantly, they purchased the property next door and demolished it, which allowed them to build a pool, a lush outdoor living space, a patio and a larger garden. They cut a large circular window into the living room so that it would overlook the pool, providing a sense of continuity between the two spaces. There are smaller touches as well: Though they kept the original color of the marigold yellow Formica in the kitchen, they knocked down the back wall, echoing the fluidity between the living room and the front terrace. Niemeyer understood the beauty of Modernism in Brazil’s climate, and his open-air plans integrated perfectly with the textured scenery of the tropical outdoors. Lastly, all of the ceramic flooring as well as the terrace railing was replaced with Brazilian soapstone, its dark mossy green jagged with electric white stripes. That night, I am invited to dinner by Varejão and Buarque. I’m curious to see the house as it was intended: full of people, made imperfect by a kind of kinetic carelessness. When I arrive, open bottles of wine sweat in an ice bucket beneath a Lygia Clark painting. I sag into a leather chair by Lina Bo Bardi. Varejão serves a traditional meal that we eat on a large dining table made by Sergio Rodrigues — picadinho (beef stew) and baked fish, rice and beans, a banana purée, fried quail’s eggs, and chopped cabbage from the countryside garden of Varejão’s friends, the filmmaker Walter Salles and his wife, the artist Maria Klabin. Varejão and Buarque’s friends are artists, singers, musicians, writers — we discuss everything from João Guimarães Rosa’s Joycean novel “The Devil to Pay in the Backlands” (1956) to the pessimism that surrounds Brazilian politics today. Modernism may have become an empty expression of bourgeoisie taste, but here it feels reinvigorated, charged. I’m told many times that I must visit Brasília, which is less than two hours away by plane. Instead, the next day, I go to the house Niemeyer built for himself in Rio in 1953. It is past Leblon, the wealthy beachside neighborhood, in Barra de Tijuca, another wealthy beachside neighborhood. On my winding drive there, I glimpse the favelas. This is Rio, too, where immense poverty abuts immense wealth. Niemeyer was disdainful of money, even if he worked with those who had it. He rarely wrote about the private residences he designed, and he allowed only a handful to be illustrated or listed — as is the case with many prominent architects, he largely considered these designs exceptions, favors or one-offs. But his own house, with its views of both the mountains and the ocean, is canonical for its elegant curves and its cloudlike roof that sweeps across the horizon. To Niemeyer, light was a form of pleasure. The house now sits unused but open to visitors; two volunteers from the Oscar Niemeyer Foundation inform me that the furniture is contemporary. That Niemeyer couch was his. But the fabric is soiled. The books downstairs belong to his personal library. But the pages have warped from the humidity. The pool, less a kidney and more of a chickpea, is filled with leaves. I feel like someone discovering a bronze Roman statue at the bottom of the Aegean Sea, its beauty disguised by oxidization, its form marred by barnacles and tangled seaweed. As I flip through a pamphlet laid out for visitors, I see pictures of the house sometime in the 1950s, filled with guests at a party. They are nattily dressed, laughing, with cocktails and cigarettes in their hands. They look as if they are still waiting for the future to arrive.",The New York Times
2018,"Oscars to Add ‘Popular Film’ Category, Creating Questions","LOS ANGELES — Alarmed by plunging television ratings for the Academy Awards, the organization behind the Oscars said on Wednesday it would add a category for blockbuster films and shorten the telecast by giving out some statuettes during commercial breaks. Yet adding a category for “outstanding achievement in popular film,” as John Bailey, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, put it in a letter to members, could create new problems for the beleaguered organization. What if a movie many see as a legitimate best picture contender — the worldwide smash “Black Panther,” for instance — receives a nomination for the populist Oscar but not for best overall picture? Does that mean “Black Panther” and films like it are second-class citizens? The letter, co-signed by Dawn Hudson, the academy’s chief executive, did not say what would constitute a “popular” film or whether movies nominated in that category could also be nominated for best picture. (An academy spokeswoman later clarified that they could.) The category will make its debut at the next Oscars ceremony, which will be held on Feb. 24 and televised on ABC. “Eligibility requirements and other key details will be forthcoming,” the letter said. The academy did not respond to a request to interview Ms. Hudson or Mr. Bailey, who was re-elected to a second one-year term as president at a board meeting on Tuesday night. The academy’s board also voted to keep the telecast to three hours, which it described as an effort to deliver “a more accessible Oscars for our viewers worldwide.” To trim the telecast — the last show, in March, stretched nearly four hours — the academy said it would present “select categories” during commercial breaks, with the winning moments edited and aired later during the broadcast. It did not say which categories could be edged aside. The most likely are the three Oscars presented for short films. Producers hired to shape the annual telecast have long pressed the academy to reduce the number of awards presented on air. (There are now 25.) But academy traditionalists — some of whom have left the board in recent years — always pushed back. A third change will not take effect until 2020, the academy said. The telecast will be held earlier in the year in an attempt to speed up Hollywood’s awards season, which in recent years has stretched to four solid months of ceremonies. By the time the Oscars roll around, there is little suspense about who will win what, and the honorees themselves have a catatonic look, having been trotted from one awards podium to the next. The change in dates may force other telecasts, including the Grammy Awards, to recalibrate their own positions on the calendar. The addition of a category for blockbusters was immediately assailed by some prominent film critics. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the changes “stupid, insulting and pathetically desperate” on Twitter. While some responses were favorable, the academy also drew wide mockery, with the social media universe suggesting other categories that might draw more viewers, like hottest onscreen kiss or best stunts. Whether its remedies are the correct ones or not, the academy had to take some kind of action: The Oscars are increasingly out of touch. A record low of 26.5 million people watched this year’s telecast, a nearly 20 percent drop from a year earlier. As recently as four years ago, the Academy Awards had an audience of 43.7 million viewers. “We have heard from many of you about improvements needed to keep the Oscars and our academy relevant in a changing world,” Mr. Bailey wrote. “The Board of Governors took this charge seriously.” The Oscar telecast is a big business, generating 83 percent of the academy’s $148 million in annual revenue. ABC controls broadcast rights for the show until 2028 at a cost of roughly $75 million a year. ABC was seeking as much as $2.8 million per 30-second commercial for the most recent telecast. Nose-diving ratings threaten all of that income, not to mention eroding the position of the Oscars in comparison to the more free-wheeling Golden Globe Awards. A few more years of declines and the Globes will be the higher-rated show. Reasons for the Oscars’ decline abound — the general fragmentation of the media landscape is one — but the central complaints have been about the telecast’s marathon length and increasing tendency to honor niche films that the majority of American moviegoers have not seen. Last year’s best picture winner, “The Shape of Water,” had sold about $60 million in tickets at the time after playing in theaters for 14 weeks. “Black Panther,” by comparison, took in $202 million over its first three days in North American theaters alone. In 2009, the academy tried to make room for more widely seen films by doubling the number of potential nominees for the best-picture award to 10 from five. That shift occurred after “The Dark Knight,” a critically acclaimed superhero film, was shut out of the best-picture category, despite receiving nominations in eight others and winning in two. But allowing more best-picture nominations did little to solve the problem. For the most part, moviedom’s elite continued to bypass films with large audiences and simply put forward additional niche ones. One rumpus after another has roiled the academy in recent years. After black actors and films that focused on black characters were overlooked for Oscar nominations in 2015 and 2016, the #OscarsSoWhite social media outcry was so fierce that the academy raced membership changes into effect. There has been progress, but it’s still mostly white and male. The 2017 Oscars added the humiliation of naming the wrong movie, “La La Land,” as the best picture winner, before the error was corrected from the stage and “Moonlight” was given the trophy. More recently, the academy has been struggling to contend with the #MeToo movement. The organization put behavioral guidelines in place for members — only to have Mr. Bailey become the policy’s first test. A woman accused him of inappropriate touching during a van ride on a movie set. The academy said in March that it had conducted an investigation and concluded that the claim had no merit.",The New York Times

Why do we run so many contests? We believe in student voice. We want young people to be active content creators, not just consumers. And we’re proud to offer places where they can create for an authentic audience of students, teachers, parents and other readers from around the world. Here’s how our contests work: In general, our contests are open to students ages 13 and up. This year, however, we’re excited to announce that our review contest will be open to all middle schoolers — a first for us. In fact, we may open up many of our spring contests to middle schoolers as well. But as internet privacy laws in the United States and around the world change, we’ll be experimenting with different age ranges and new submission forms this school year, so please stay tuned for the details. On the day each contest begins, we will add a link here, on this page, to the contest announcement so students and teachers can submit entries. The work students send us is always considered by our staff and other experts, whether Times journalists, outside educators from partner organizations, or professional practitioners in a related field. For example, we have members of the Times podcast team help judge our podcast contest, Opinion writers and editors help judge our editorial contest, and professional cartoonists help judge our editorial cartoon contest. Judging for our contests is blind. That means we see only the entries themselves, and not student names or schools when we make our decisions. About a month after the contest closes, we’ll announce the winners, runners-up and honorable mentions. We often celebrate dozens of students for each contest. For our 2018 editorial contest, for example, in which we had nearly 11,000 submissions, we honored 120 students. Winners get their work published on The Learning Network. Some may also be featured in a special section of the print New York Times. Our contests are also an integral component of our free school-year writing curriculum, which offers daily writing activities, mentor texts, and related lesson plans to prepare students for each contest. Learn more here. If you’re a return visitor, you may have noticed that we have dropped our decade-old poetry contest this year. We may bring it back in the future, but we needed to take a break this school year while we experiment with new contests and age ranges. Want to make sure you don’t miss a contest announcement?

2018,Opinion | Our Blind Spots Often Hide the Truth About America ,"Responding to readers, the author of a recent Op-Ed about “Trump Country” says that we must remain vigilant against easy, reductive frameworks and labels. Ms. Smarsh is the author of the forthcoming “Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.” Editor’s note: An Op-Ed by Sarah Smarsh, “Liberal Blind Spots Are Hiding the Truth About ‘Trump Country,’” received more than 1,500 comments from readers. Here are a selection of the comments, which raised questions that we put to the author. Mary V., Virginia: I had a conversation last week with a woman I had recently met. We were talking about the importance of supporting women in all types of roles — as professional chefs, doctors (she is an emergency-room physician) and throughout all levels of society, including politics. I casually mentioned how cool I thought it was that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had won her race in the Bronx. My companion’s demeanor immediately changed, and she flatly replied, “As a Christian and a capitalist, I have absolutely no interest in anything that socialist has to say.” The speed with which this happened was both startling and disturbing. Our friendly conversation was wiped out in a matter of seconds by her swift application of labels — her own self-identification, and to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Q: To what extent do labels prevent productive dialogue? Sarah Smarsh: A couple of years ago, over beers at a bar in Texas, my dad — a white construction worker from rural Kansas, described in my piece — shocked me by saying, “If you get past everything you’ve been told and really read up on it, ‘socialism’ doesn’t sound all that bad.” Soon after that, a democratic socialist, Bernie Sanders, won the Democratic caucus or primary for president in 22 states, including our home state of Kansas. Not everyone is so open-minded. The weaponization of terms such as “feminist,” “liberal” and “socialist” — and thus the vilification of those who claim those labels — has long been a successful pillar of strategies to preserve power. Labels always oversimplify, but at their worst they dehumanize: “illegals” or any racial epithet. You are right to be disturbed by the negative charge with which your acquaintance said “that socialist.” Diminishing a perceived opponent or an inconvenient fact through name-calling — say, “fake news” — is a hallmark of the current Republican administration, but dangerous labels work in all directions. Envisioning a “red state” as a field of “deplorables” leads some self-righteous liberals to say those states “get what they deserve” — as though everyone suffering for lack of Medicaid expansion voted for their conservative state officials, as though everyone even gets to vote. In most states, the losing political party receives 30 to 40 percent of the vote. Those millions of people, along with the disenfranchised, are no more represented by their state administrations than liberals nationally are represented by our current president. Calling their home “Trump country” is thus a childish misnomer. Labels even err when self-ascribed. Into my early 20s, I inaccurately called myself “conservative” with little understanding of what that meant. One of the most destructive assumptions we make in political discourse is that people’s parties and votes align with their beliefs. In fact, a better indicator of political behavior is one’s place, culture and social group — things we’re born into, by no virtue or fault of our own. Productive dialogue requires that we set aside our assumptions about other people and places and refuse to reduce them to labels — even ones that they themselves embrace. We must remain vigilant against easy, reductive frameworks, perhaps especially those that appeal to our own biases. Leonard Ray, Baton Rouge, La.: I live in the area that you might think people describe as “Trump Country” (our state voted 58-38 for Donald Trump). To be honest, most of the white people I know don’t have many African-American neighbors … sometimes co-workers, yes, but many times not even that. “Trump Country” (as well as “non-Trump Country”) isn’t exactly racially integrated to a great degree … there are pockets where it is, but not many. So I’m not sure there’s much opportunity to be, in a personal sense, mad at co-workers or neighbors of color. Q: You say your father works alongside minorities, but what about people who have few interactions with people outside their race? Smarsh: I grew up mostly in a small town that was overwhelmingly white. The handful of students of color were embraced — not because white students were liberally minded, I think, but because by virtue of our shared home a minority student was “one of us.” As the researcher Brené Brown has written: “People are hard to hate up close. Move in.” I am certain, however, that some of the white students in my hometown who loved their individual brown peers harbored racist views about those minorities as a group. Similarly, my father’s positive working relationship and friendships with laborers of color does not preclude him from racist thoughts or actions. Where the limitations of individual experience revert to tribalism, I summon the power of information and education to help us transcend our own groups and narrow visions of the world. What if “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States,” by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, were required reading in a public school’s social studies curriculum? What if public college were available to everyone, tuition free? One doesn’t need a degree to know the difference between love and hate, right and wrong. One does, in a world of racist messages, need unbiased facts to form a worldview that does not favor whiteness. While we work toward systemic justice and integration, we can strive at the individual level to break free from our proverbial bubbles. My humble attempt at this involves attending public events, celebrations and church services in communities outside my own, and following and reading people of color, whose wisdom for answering your question likely exceeds mine. Sean C., Charlottetown: Ms. Smarsh’s article is one part anecdotal and one part wishful thinking (it would be nice if economic populism was the key to reaching Trump voters). There has been extensive polling and social science assessment of Trump voters, and white racial grievance is overwhelmingly the biggest predictor of support for him. Indeed, white racial grievance has been driving the white working class toward the Republicans since the 1960s. She is correct to note that Mr. Trump also won plenty of white college graduates, but that is a different issue, as the well-off have always supported Republicans. It’s easy to see what they get from Mr. Trump — a big tax cut. Q: Are white racial grievances deciding factors for higher-earning Trump supporters as well, just more easily hidden in their votes for a tax cut? Smarsh: I agree that motivations among different income brackets of white Trump voters surely differ, but only in the version of power they seek to preserve: Ultimately, though it might be harder to see in one group or another, they all reap both racial and economic advantage. However, your response is misplaced here. You seem to be responding, as did a number of commenters, as though I wrote a piece about “Trump voters” — a group that has, by my estimation, enjoyed too much attention. I wrote instead about people like my white, working-class family who are presumed, based on their place and identity, to be Trump supporters but are, in fact, something else — apathetic or disenfranchised nonvoters, Democrats, newly minted democratic socialists, independents and even moderate Republicans. As I wrote, “I am far less interested in calls for empathy toward struggling white Americans who spout or abide hatred than I am in tapping into the political power of those who don’t.” Yet from another comment recommended more than 1,300 times: “To the author: If your father and good people like him hate unfair power, corporations and bosses that exploit workers, then wouldn’t supporting Trump be against their own interests?” To which I answer, yes, it would. That’s why the people I wrote about don’t do that. This dissonance between my story and a large portion of the reaction (Me: Not everyone in “Trump Country” is for Trump. Them: Then why are they all for Trump!) proves the point of my piece — that the dominant narrative about much of our country is not just inaccurate but willfully blind. Lissa, Virginia: “The trouble begins with language: The elite pundits regularly …” This article gives all of us a lot to ponder. But I cannot get past the number of times I have written a comment asking for an explanation of the word “elite” in the context in which the word is used in a specific article. Extrapolating terms incorrectly and otherwise generalizing is at the core of what Ms. Smarsh is arguing. She begins by doing the very thing she goes on to lament. I don’t want to take away from her very real points, but the word “elite” is one of the words that has been misused as a tool for division and often as a tool for deriding high levels of education. Q: Does the term “elite” get misused and applied too broadly, just as “working class” often is? Smarsh: The term “elite” is successfully leveraged by conservative propagandists seeking to cast coastal liberals as condescending snobs. A native of rural Kansas, I’ve lived in “blue” urban places, where some of my dearest friends and most staunch professional advocates reside. Having straddled that cultural divide, as a writer and citizen, I resist the stereotyping of either side. However, objections to valid class critiques — feeling outraged when working-class people express their grievances toward wealth without pausing to point out all the virtuous people who possess it — often strike me as the class equivalent of whites accusing people of color of reverse racism, or men accusing feminists of misandry. The prevailing narratives of our media and culture operate in service to those male, white or financially comfortable people who claim equal offense. So we must listen with particular concern to the protests of those for whom inaccurate portrayals represent not just distasteful generalizations but economic and even mortal danger. If articulating that injustice comes with an edge of anger, well, try being on the losing end of a narrative every day of your life and see how patient it makes your language. My piece uses the term in question once: “Elite pundits regularly misuse ‘working class’ as shorthand for right-wing white guys wearing tool belts.” Here I am describing political commentators who hold the immense privilege of being called upon for their opinions in national media. That is, by definition, an elite platform, and its rarefied stature is relevant to my discussion of classist narratives. I’m not generalizing but rather specifying a real power structure in our country. Steve Paradis, Flint, Mich.: I wonder what the newspapers are like in Wichita, Kan. I grew up watching my parents reading the daily paper and picked up the habit from them. Front to back page, too, just as it was delivered, scanning every page, even the boring local stuff about zoning boards and school board meetings. That same paper now has about three pages of local news — mostly crime or mayhem — and the obits. The rest is homogenized stories from the various wire services; the paper itself is a midstate edition covering about a hundred- mile radius. That means the local political news coverage is gone, and there’s only a page or two of state news. So you don’t see your life in the paper anymore, no more than you see on television, broadcast or cable. You don’t see yourself or people like you in the media, and it’s easy to think that the media doesn’t think you matter. Q: Does your father seek news outlets different from that of other working class members of his community? Does he feel he is incorrectly portrayed by more “liberal” news outlets? Smarsh: Like most newspapers in midsize cities, The Wichita Eagle staff and print product has shrunk since my childhood in the 1980s and ’90s. I grew up at the tail end of the newspaper era and still “take the paper,” reading it front to back each morning. I was a member of the last class of my journalism school to receive an old-fashioned newspaper training before the digital era altered curriculums toward “media convergence.” The demise of local news was the backdrop of my early career, making me keenly aware of how a dearth of local reporting resources is inextricably woven into today’s divisive political climate. My piece names disparate information sources among the electorate as one of the most overlooked influences on political ideologies, party identification and voting habits. I have spent much of my career developing strategies to counteract that civic media crisis. It’s one reason that I still live in my home state of Kansas rather than a major media center — a sense of responsibility to live in the place I write. Coastal media is often criticized for inadequate “parachute journalism” into Middle America, but it shouldn’t be New York’s job to understand Nebraska. Nebraska understands Nebraska. I am sure that state is teeming with qualified journalists who still have local contacts and understandings, who were laid off in the last 15 years, and who would gladly report for duty if someone paid them to do so. Until then, as you say, people there and in so many places are left with wildly biased and polarized social media “silos,” national outlets that rarely mention their home, and — if they’re lucky — cash-strapped local outlets for their information. For those in rural America, I know firsthand, the resulting sense of not just isolation but misrepresentation and even invisibility is profound. That’s shifted some in the last few years, but now when they’re written about, it’s all Trump or opioids or economic despair. There’s a lot more to those communities. There’s joy, heroic community problem-solving and even some Democrats. To remain unseen and unheard in national conversation is an invalidation. It’s no surprise that some might be suspicious of “the media” and vulnerable to messaging that journalists aren’t trustworthy. As for my dad, he believes his best news source is folks on the ground — his fellow construction workers on job sites, locals in line at gas stations and, as he traverses the Midwest and South for the next job, cashiers he chats up at the grocery store. He makes a point of asking them what’s going on in their communities and what they think about current events, and he shares his information in kind. Even with a daughter for a journalist, he most prizes stories straight from the mouths of those who live them. So do I. As he put it when I asked him, “I get my news from the people I talk to, not Sean Hannity.” Liz, New York City: As a native Arkansan, I so deeply appreciate what Ms. Smarsh is saying about seeing the complexity of people’s experience, and the urgent necessity for working people of all races, sexes and locations to band together. As an adopted New Yorker, I felt stabbed by the word “elite,” which has become a catchword by which conservatives dismiss and disparage everything that folks in this great city think and feel. I am a queer theologian, a single mother of two who works three jobs and, like most New Yorkers, struggles every month to pay the exorbitant rent. I am nearly desperate for a movement to take hold along the lines Ms. Smarsh describes: Those of us who struggle refusing to be duped by the powerful and wealthy forces that pit us against one another for their own gain, seeing one another as we really are, as we really struggle, as we really hope and dream for a better life, for all of us. For that reason, I’ll tamp down my visceral reaction to the unfortunate word “elite.” Ms. Smarsh, thank you for this eloquent piece. We have more in common than even you may know, and I hope we can keep building that mutual understanding. Q: What would you say to those who feel hidden behind a label? Smarsh: I told my dad to never read the comments, but he did — and yours was the one he told me I should read. It moved him deeply, so I’ll let him respond: “This person is what the world needs. I am inspired by her grit, determination, hope, unity as an answer. Her life should not be like this in America.” Sarah Smarsh (@Sarah_Smarsh) is the author of the forthcoming “Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Our Coronary Complacency,"Deaths from heart attacks are dropping, but the number of people whose hearts cannot pump enough blood for a healthy, comfortable existence is on the rise. Ms. Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of “Ticker, the Quest to Build an Artificial Heart.” HOUSTON — When Ally Babineaux was 22, before she had the first of two heart transplants but after she had nearly died from a ruthless virus that attacked her heart, a woman accosted her in a parking lot. As sick as Ally was on that day in 2010, she was, still, a classic Texas beauty, with long blond hair, flashing blue eyes and just a hint of the trim, muscular body years of ballet had given her. She was fresh from a monthslong hospital stay — her recovery never assured — and was trying to do some quick shopping before the last of her energy drained away. She parked her car close to the store entrance and hooked her handicapped sticker on the rearview mirror. As she slid out of the driver’s seat, the woman began screaming at her for taking up a space for sick people. Being short-tempered can be a contributor to heart disease, but it can also be a sign of self-preservation. Standing in the sun, Ally lifted her blouse to show off the tube running from her belly to the small battery pack she carried in a shoulder bag — the battery that powered the tiny pump that kept the left side of her heart beating, that kept her alive. “Is this handicapped enough for you?” Ally demanded. I thought about Ally many times as I was writing about heart disease over the past few years. In particular I wondered why, despite its still being the major killer in the United States — responsible for about 610,000 deaths according to the American Heart Association — it seems to generate less fear among the public than cancer, which is expected to take 609,000 lives this year, or even the opioid epidemic, which killed 72,000 people in 2017. One of the greatest terrors of women’s lives is breast cancer, which accounts for one in 30 female deaths a year, and yet one in every four female deaths stem from heart disease. As nonprofit fund-raising literature repeats ad infinitum, more women die of heart disease than all cancers combined. Two studies completed recently showed a frightening increase in the number of women suffering from heart attacks and heart failure before, during and immediately after giving birth. And while the number of deaths from heart attacks is falling, the number of people living with heart failure — who often feel they are suffocating daily because their hearts cannot pump enough blood for a healthy, comfortable existence — is on the rise, up to 6.5 million in 2011-2014 from 5.7 million in 2009-2013. With the number of aging Americans growing, cardiovascular disease in all forms is going to be with us for a long time. And yet, complacency persists. That’s partly because of the many advances made since the 1960s, when the causal link between cigarette smoking and heart disease became convincing enough for everyone but cigarette manufacturers. Nor has it ever been a secret that staying healthy helps: All a person has to do to avoid a heart attack, supposedly, is to quit smoking, get proper sleep and exercise, control stress and avoid junk food. We now have better medications, like cholesterol-lowering drugs, and medical devices like pacemakers and defibrillators, and even microsurgery for in utero repairs of the heart muscle in embryos. Who can forget heart transplants, which were mind-blowing in the late 1960s but now seem almost routine? (Unless you are getting one.) Mechanical hearts and hearts grown from our own stem cells seem just around the corner. The treatment for heart disease, unlike cancer, can also seem invisible. Maybe, in the later stages, you can find yourself tethered to an oxygen tank, but no one goes bald as a treatment for open-heart surgery, and no one suffers a disfiguring loss that can threaten a person’s sexual being. “You hear the word ‘chemo’ and you see what it does to people,” Ally reminded me. “I never looked sick until it was really bad. You can’t really tell who has heart disease unless you know they do.” In truth, heart disease has become a victim of its own success. Yes, 90 percent of all heart attacks are preventable — but more than 735,000 Americans annually still suffer one. And while it may be easy to persuade a college-educated white woman to start going to spin class to save herself, there are far fewer options for poor people of color in the United States, who often lack access to grocery stores with fresh food, just for starters. And blaming victims does little good, especially when many have no way of knowing they are at risk: The newborn with the heart defect, the high school football star who collapses on the field, the middle-aged runner who drops dead on his morning jog, the vast number of women whose condition is still misdiagnosed by doctors who have yet to recognize that the symptoms of heart disease differ by gender — such people are not responsible for their condition, which can be as silent and lethal as any cancer. Worst case, there’s always a transplant at the end of the road, right? Not necessarily. Heart donors are scarce. In one of those dark public health coincidences, the near universal use of seatbelts caused a precipitous drop in automobile deaths — and in turn, hearts for those in need. The number available for transplant has remained static at 2,500 a year, while the number of people waiting for a heart at any given time is at least 3,000. Waiting times, which can be fatal, are growing. Ally was on a transplant list twice after that day in the parking lot. She’s now married, living with her second heart and a long, jagged scar, the top of which is visible whenever she wears an open-necked shirt. She has endured more surgeries for heart-related conditions, and more hospitalizations, and near daily wrangling with insurance companies. She manages, usually with good grace. Except for the abuse of passers-by who don’t know how lucky they are.

2018,Our Day With Twitter’s Jack Dorsey,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. SAN FRANCISCO — It had been eight years since my last interview with Jack Dorsey, the 41-year-old chief executive of Twitter, and he had changed from his start-up days. He now has a long beard with flecks of gray and a wisp of a silver nose ring. Wearing a lush, black cashmere hoodie, black knit pants and black sneakers, he carries a sort of shabby-chic, tech-billionaire style. My colleague, Kate Conger, and I were invited to interview Mr. Dorsey on Friday, after attending a meeting in which he convened 18 company leaders in a small glass room for a standing-only meeting to hash out a nascent plan to rid the site of “dehumanizing” content, which the room struggled to clearly define. The invitation came after I had tweeted skeptically earlier in the week about Mr. Dorsey’s explanations for why Twitter had decided to keep posts of Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, on the site. One of my criticisms of Twitter and other social media firms was their lack of transparency on how decisions like the one made about Mr. Jones are made. A Twitter spokesman called to say the company agreed that they needed to be more transparent. So they invited us to be flies on the wall to see how they make policies and to interview Mr. Dorsey. We knew there was a risk that the meeting might dive deep into the policy weeds and not provide concrete enough plans for change to be relevant to the average reader or Twitter user. But it was also a rare opportunity for us to witness what kinds of conversations take place within the company and spend some time with Mr. Dorsey, a taciturn figure who doesn’t often give interviews. I felt that depicting a policy meeting that didn’t result in substantive changes, which was basically what happened, was in itself revealing about the state of Twitter. We wanted some clues as to why it’s been so hard for Twitter to rid its site of harassment, misinformation and the promotion of fringe hate groups, and what the company was going to do to address those problems. At the one-hour afternoon meeting, the conversation got wonky fast. There was a lot of back and forth on basic definitions of “dehumanizing” speech and how it would be policed. How could tweets that described immigrants with obscenities, for example, contribute to violence and hatred toward immigrants in real life? Currently, if someone doesn’t directly level a threat or hate language directly toward a specific individual on Twitter, then it’s hard to take the post or account offline. The biggest decision to come from the discussion was a plan to draft a policy and open a comment period in the near future. In many ways, the meeting revealed how far behind the group of Twitter’s top executives and members of its legal and safety teams were and how they may not be prepared to move as quickly as they need to to impose new rules. Mr. Dorsey, who spoke little during the meeting, paced with his hands alternating from stroking his beard to digging into his pockets. He asked if consequences for dehumanizing content should be a greater priority than other work by the policy team. The ideas, overall, felt iterative and high concept. I saw the irony in Twitter asking us not to name people on the legal and safety team because they could become the target of threats on the platform. We agreed because of the safety concerns. But it was striking that the company couldn’t protect its own employees on its site — a sign of its difficulty moderating its own platform. After the meeting, we had about 20 minutes to talk with Mr. Dorsey. In the interview, I was struck by how much Mr. Dorsey still sounded the same. Eight years ago, we met to talk about his support for an Obama administration plan to promote open access to the internet around the world. Mr. Dorsey was optimistic about how social media platforms would empower the oppressed and challenge authoritarian regimes. He, like many others at the time, imagined social media as a great force for good. Now, with Twitter and other social media sites under intense pressure for permitting harassment, giving voice to hate groups and spreading misinformation, Mr. Dorsey is rethinking the underlying values of the site. It isn’t enough to promote free expression, he told me and Kate. He spoke about high-altitude and vague ideas. And when we prodded him on how exactly the site would accomplish these aspirations, he said the site needs to be a healthier and safer environment. But he admitted he hasn’t had “explicit” conversations yet on some of those goals. When asked about criticism for maintaining most of the posts by Mr. Jones, Mr. Dorsey was philosophical. He had been talking for some time about whether Mr. Jones’s posts violated rules before the blowup over his account in the past week. Still, he emphasized that Twitter would not let public opinion influence its decisions. Kara Swisher, the executive editor of Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The Times, called on Mr. Dorsey to take a moral stand against people like Mr. Jones, even if those actors on Twitter don’t technically break Twitter’s safety rules. Mr. Dorsey defended the logic. “She wanted to see values over rules. And I think what is missing in that discussion is that I think it is a false dichotomy,” Mr. Dorsey said. “Our rules derived from our original values. I think we might have focused too much on one value without looking more broadly at other values that we should integrate, but also how we should prioritize those values.” He said the company is thinking about other values it needs to adopt. As for what those values actually are? Mr. Dorsey said the specific plans are still in the works.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Our Deepest Condolences,"THE BIG IDEAs We are a long way from the Stoicism of Seneca, but grief and how we deal with it is still a vital part of the human experience. Ms. Adebayo is a novelist. Almost two millennia ago, the Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger, wrote a consolation letter to his mother, Helvia, on the occasion of his banishment from Rome. Seneca, who had been sent into exile to Corsica on the charge of having an affair with the niece of the Roman emperor, Claudius, wrote that “a man lifting his head from the very funeral pyre must need some novel vocabulary not drawn from ordinary everyday condolence to comfort his own dear ones. But every great and overpowering grief must take away the capacity to choose words, since it often stifles the voice itself.” Although most of us will never produce a rhetorical masterpiece that transcends the ordinary as Seneca’s does, we nonetheless try in response to grief to find words, in the moments, months or even a lifetime after a tragedy, that express what we find inexplicable. As a teenager in Nigeria, I was ambivalent about condolence messages. Any attempt to find the right words felt futile. How could words possibly bridge the chasm that loss had cleaved between the bereaved and the well-meaning mourners? When a classmate lost his father, the cursive font on the card I picked out felt laughable, even vulgar. When he returned to school days after the funeral, my girlfriends and I went to sit with him, ready to reel out the heartfelt commiserations we had discussed. In the end I couldn’t give him the card, and I mouthed my words of consolation with little conviction. I felt like a fraud, confronting his agony with platitudes when it was clear that anything short of reversing time to return his father to life would prove inadequate. I regurgitated predictions about a future when some as-yet-undefined purpose would overtake the pain he now felt, repeating almost verbatim the hollowed-out assurances I’d been hearing since my own father passed away. Like most who have sat with a bereft friend, relative or even stranger, I wanted to say something that could give solace. Yet what I knew reeked of despair: Grief was a wilderness with no signposts, a desert littered with mirages that made progress impossible to evaluate. I couldn’t write that on a card; it felt more appropriate to pontificate about rainbows appearing at the end of storms. Besides, what I thought to be closer to the truth also felt inordinately personal: Since none of those who had commiserated with me had spoken about the utter bottomlessness of grief, perhaps I was the only one who had yet to see the rainbow, and nothing I’d experienced could be of use to anyone. It would be years before C.S. Lewis’s question in “A Grief Observed” — Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral? — filled me with the relief of self-recognition, and made me wonder if perhaps I should have shared it with my classmate in addition to my more sanguine predictions. While much has changed about the world since Seneca’s time, grief and the ways we deal with it, both individually and as communities, remains a vital part of our human experience, inextricably intertwined with the highs of love and affection. In some ways the beloved is also the bereaved-in-waiting, and just as in the course of our lives we wish people well as they graduate, marry or reach some other milestone, eventually we will find ourselves struggling to find the appropriate way to commiserate with loved ones when a member of our community achieves that final, inescapable one. Commiseration comes in several guises, and over the years I’ve become intrigued by a certain form. Many families open a condolence register when they lose a loved one. In Nigeria, the registers are often modest hardcover notebooks that mourners fill with cherished memories of the deceased: a colleague praises her acuity, a co-chorister rhapsodizes about that time he brought an audience to tears with his rendition of “Amazing Grace,” a neighbor recalls how she helped him pay his hospital bills. I often address the deceased directly in these registers, but of course I am the one who sometimes experiences a cathartic release after scribbling my gratitude, and I write hoping that my fond memories might bring comfort to the bereft should they ever open the register again. Our acts of mourning, even when intended to honor the dead, primarily comfort the living. Perhaps it is this well-intended effort to comfort the living that compels us to offer as consolation only hopeful anecdotes that glance off a tragedy, focusing instead on some point beyond it. Writing to Helvia, Seneca reminds her of distant and recent catastrophes, the death of her own mother while giving birth to her, the loss of her grandson and Seneca’s own exile. “I have kept away not one of your misfortunes from you,” he writes, “but piled them all up in front of you. I have done this courageously for I decided to conquer your grief, not cheat it.” His is an attempt to help his distraught mother find perspective through the adoption of the Stoic principles he lays out. While the idea that grief can be conquered is suspect, the unflinching acknowledgment of devastation that has already occurred, which he appears to view as an essential part of an attempt to conquer grief, remains worthy of consideration. It is understandable that we seek to protect the bereaved by responding with hope when they express despair, giving our assurances of light at the end of the tunnel and rainbows after the storm. Contrary to what Seneca believed, sometimes that very distraction is a necessary part of the process. However while there’s no meteorological guarantee that those who survive a storm will sight a rainbow, they must at least deal with the reality of wet and slippery ground beneath their feet, and the labor of figuring out how to walk the path. Even if we don’t agree with his principles, Seneca shows us in his consolation to Helvia that we can offer a hope that acknowledges the reality of despair. If, to paraphrase a quote attributed to Thomas Mann, a person’s dying is more his family’s affair than his own, the event is for most families cataclysmic and life-altering. Even in offering comfort, there is room to acknowledge that, and a willingness to contemplate this reality with the bereaved can itself be a consolation. Ayobami Adebayo is a novelist. She is the author of the novel “Stay With Me.” Now in print: “Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments,” and “The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,” with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.

2018,Our Fat Pets,"Sixty percent of cats tip the scales at unhealthy weights, slightly more than the 56 percent of dogs. It’s not good for them. Like most cats, Max had a swagger in his walk. But because he was slightly overweight, the 15-year-old Maine coon began having trouble “jumping up on things,” his owner says, the extra pounds worsening his arthritis. So his owner, Jaime Wilson, decided her pet needed to go on a diet — barely two tablespoons of dry food in the morning and again at night, along with a larger portion of canned wet food once a day and a supervised exercise program that included treadmill work and running through stationary poles. “He was ravenous all the time,” his owner concedes. But after six months, “he’s very sleek and thin,” says Mrs. Wilson, who works at the University of Florida’s Small Animal Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. “Not having the extra pounds has been great for his joints.” The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention estimates that in the United States, veterinarians now classify more than 100 million dogs and cats as overweight or obese, up from 80 million five years ago. Sixty percent of cats tip the scales at unhealthy weights, slightly more than the 56 percent of dogs. Worse yet, many pet owners fail to recognize the potential severity of the problem, finding their pets’ weight gain of little concern or even “cute,” says Dr. Justin Shmalberg, service chief of integrative medicine at the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville. And show animals, often held up as exemplary models, he says, sometimes tend toward the pudgy side. “In part, it’s an issue of perception,” Dr. Shmalberg says. “Generally, the public is more tolerant of obese animals than they are of thin ones. There’s not as much stigma with animals being overweight as with people.” Obesity and the inflammatory effects of excess fat can bring a host of health problems. Max’s six-month journey to a healthier weight reduced his risk for insulin-dependent diabetes, the most common health problem veterinarians see in overweight or obese cats. Overweight dogs rarely develop this form of diabetes, veterinarians say, though large breeds often face joint injuries from excess weight, while smaller ones can have breathing difficulties if airways collapse. Along with diabetes and arthritis, extra heft puts pets at increased risk for liver and kidney diseases, high blood pressure, heart failure and even some cancers. And at least one widely cited study in Labrador retrievers found that even moderately overweight dogs have shorter life spans than their lean counterparts. Veterinarians assess a pet’s overall body health using a system similar to the body mass index, or B.M.I., used in people. Emaciated dogs or cats get the lowest score on a nine-point scale, obese ones the highest, with a desirable weight usually in the four to five range, says Dr. Deborah Linder, head of Tufts University’s obesity clinic for animals in Boston. An animal at six is considered clinically overweight, with a score of seven or more, obese. Veterinarians also complete a physical exam to assess obesity, feeling over the rib cage by the animal’s armpit, “where tissue should be no thicker than the back of your hand,” Dr. Linder says. Another sign of healthy girth, she says, is a tuck in the belly, similar to an “hourglass figure.” Although some pets are genetically vulnerable to unwanted pounds, others may have diseases like hyperthyroidism or Cushing’s disease, in which the adrenal glands pump out too much of a stress hormone, stimulating appetite. Once these conditions are ruled out, veterinarians say, aging itself poses an ongoing risk as metabolism slows — the pet version of middle-age spread. Neutering or spaying also decreases an animal’s energy needs by a third, Dr. Shmalberg says, so “calories in, calories out,” takes on greater importance in maintaining a pet’s proper weight. Researchers have recently identified another risk factor for pet obesity: rapid growth in early life, though the reasons for this remain poorly understood. “Dogs and cats that grow quickly are highly likely to become obese later in life,” says Dr. Alex German, a professor at the University of Liverpool in England. But veterinarians single out overfeeding as the greatest contributor to pet obesity. Giving pets easy access to food around the house, or “free feeding,” can quickly add unwanted pounds, they say, as can an overindulgence in high-calorie treats. Throw small children into the household mix with “sneak feeding” and the situation becomes worse, says Dr. Sarah Nold, a staff veterinarian at Trupanion, a Seattle-based pet insurer. “It’s definitely not uncommon,” she says with a laugh. Whether pets, like some owners, “stress eat” is difficult to measure. “In my experience, when animals are stressed, they tend to go off feeding,” Dr. Nold says. “But we don’t know.” “Pets don’t open the fridge by themselves,” so stressed owners may stress-feed their pets, Dr. Linder says. “The concept of food and love are tightly interconnected, and we need to address it.” Some veterinarians cite the pet food industry’s push to include better labeling on foods, including calories per serving, as an advance in helping with weight control. But others describe the print as too small and the calorie information unhelpful because calorie needs vary widely by breed, genetics and current weight. Many dogs and cats that are overweight will need their calories reduced by at least a third, according to the University of Florida’s Dr. Shmalberg. An average-size indoor cat needs between 150 to 200 calories per day to maintain weight, while dogs’ ideal weights are trickier to assess. But the most important factor, Dr. Shmalberg says, is that owners adjust food to reach an “ideal body condition,” such as the dog and cat weight charts suggested by the pet food company Purina. Experts also disagree on which type of food promotes better weight loss, wet or dry. Some data suggests wet food’s higher water and protein content carries more benefit because it reduces appetite, says Dr. Jonathan Stockman, who runs the clinical nutrition service at Colorado State University’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital, in Ft. Collins, Colo. But dry food has a higher fiber content, he says, so a similar argument can be made for that. “One really is no better than the other,” Dr. Stockman says. “We usually go with prescription diets because the nutrient density can be controlled and you can cut calories without causing a nutritional deficiency.” Other options, such as fat-blocking drugs or stomach-shrinking surgeries available to people, seldom play a part in veterinary medicine. Most veterinarians feel that weight loss can best be managed through diet. The goal is to get to a healthy weight before health issues take hold, veterinarians agree. Even though diabetes in cats, for example, can be reversed by aggressive dietary measures, says Dr. Lori Teller, a veterinarian at the Meyerland Animal Clinic in Houston, they work only with early diagnosis. Diabetes in dogs, rarely related to obesity, is considered irreversible, she and others say, because insulin production shuts down completely. “Our current approach is failing,” Dr. German says, citing the need for new strategies and more vigorous prevention. Studies have found that only half of dogs and cats placed on weight-loss programs achieve their target goal, he says, and half of that number rebound to unhealthy weights. Instead of aiming for a complete or “perfect” weight loss, he suggests, it might be more realistic to push for a modest weight loss, which can still have benefits. Studies have shown that in overweight people, for example, even a relatively modest weight loss of 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight can delay the onset of diabetes, and the same may apply to pets. Max’s weight loss was more extreme, and he is faring well. His owner is vigilant about not letting his diet and exercise routines lapse. “If I free feed him now,” Mrs. Wilson says, “he would just balloon back up, I’m sure.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a veterinarian.

2018,Our Favorite Tools to Stay on Top of Your Financial Life,"Here are some of the best apps and services to help keep your money on track, whether you’ve never created a budget or you’re a seasoned investor. Getting your finances in order isn’t a one-time task — it’s an ongoing process. Whether it’s budgeting, planning your debt payoff, or monitoring your credit, your financial life needs regular, reliable attention. The right set of tools can help. We’ve rounded up some of the best money apps and services to help you get on track and stay there, whether you’ve never created a budget or you’re a seasoned investor. Unless otherwise noted, all of these apps are free. Keep in mind, most of these tools require you to provide and link your bank or credit information. While they use strict security measures to protect your data, you should always read the terms and conditions on any app before you use it so that you know what you’re getting into. Welcome to Personal Finance Week at Smarter Living! Catch up on our previous stories in this series: We’re All Afraid to Talk About Money. Here’s How to Break the Taboo. • What to Do When You’re Bad at Money Mint: Mint is one of the most popular online budgeting tools, and for good reason. Their web app makes it easy to set budgets for your spending, track how much money you have coming in every month, and stay on top of your expenses. Once you link your spending accounts to the service, your purchases are automatically categorized as restaurants, groceries, bills — you can even set your own categories and rules for purchases. Who this is for: Anyone who wants to track their financial life — including bills, credit score and budgets — in one place. You Need a Budget: You Need a Budget is another popular option among beginner budgeters and personal finance experts alike. This tool isn’t free. YNAB will cost you $6.99 a month, but for that fee, you’ll get access to financial literacy workshops and a community where you can meet and chat with other users about your financial progress. Like Mint, you can use YNAB via its online web app or download the app to your phone. YNAB is also the favorite budgeting tool of Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products. (YNAB currently offering three months free to Wirecutter readers.) Who this is for: Overspenders who need a little extra help keeping track of their money. More in-depth and hands-on than Mint, YNAB’s goal is to get you to track every penny and stay on top of your finances regularly. You tag and categorize every dollar of your income and allocate how you’ll spend it each month. Mint Goals: Even if you had already heard about Mint, you might not have heard of Mint’s Goals feature, which helps you create a financial goal and then tracks your progress toward that goal. Who this is for: This tool is especially useful for paying off multiple credit card debts. Mint will give you a plan to pay each debt off, then track your progress for you. SoFi: SoFi is a financial services company popular among borrowers who refinance their student loans. Refinancing, or rolling your loans into a new loan with a lower interest rate, isn’t always the ideal financial move (you could potentially lose federal loan benefits and relief options), but SoFi seems to stay true to their commitment to help users get out of debt, offering money workshops and tools to help you along the way. (Disclosure: I did a Q. and A. with SoFi while promoting my book, “Get Money.”) Who this is for: Borrowers with abnormally high interest rates. SoFi annual percentage rates are relatively low, with variable rates ranging from about 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent for automatic payments. Unbury.me: Unbury.me lets you keep track of your debts without linking them to any of your online accounts or even creating a login. You simply type your loan(s) by hand into their calculator, and unbury.me will organize them and provide you with a payoff plan. Who this is for: Anyone who’s looking for a simple solution for managing debt, with a basic, no-frills payoff plan. Qapital + IFTTT: Qapital is a mobile app that makes saving money fun (well, as fun as saving can be). Once you link your bank accounts and credit cards to the app, you can transfer money into your Qapital account automatically using any of their rules. For example, its “Guilty Pleasure” rule automatically saves a set amount in your Qapital account any time you spend at a specified store. Its “Freelancer Rule” saves a percentage of any deposit over $100 into your account. Who this is for: Those who want to gamify their finances. You can link Qapital to an online tool called If This, Then That. IFTTT connects the apps and features you use on your phone or computer so you can use them together. For example, there’s an IFTTT recipe that saves in your Qapital account if your Fitbit step goals aren’t met. Another recipe will automatically pay yourself every time you go to the gym. Yet another recipe will save every time you complete a task on your to-do list. You can find even more recipes here. Tip Yourself: While it has fewer frills than Qapital, Tip Yourself is another good app for saving pocket cash every now and then. The app encourages you to “tip yourself” every time you go to the gym, skip an impulse buy or stick to your budget, but it’s up to you to decide when and how much to pay yourself. It’s not automatic, but the app does allow you to set certain goals for your saving. As you approach your goal, you’ll see your virtual tip jar fill up. Who this is for: Anyone who wants a simple, hands-on way to save some extra cash. Splitwise: This phone app makes it easy to split everything from your dinner bill to rent. It will also calculate everyone’s share and keep track of any I.O.U.s. Who this is for: It’s best for renters with multiple roommates, but works well for any kind of transactions that need splitting. Venmo: Venmo is another popular app that works with PayPal to make it easy for users to exchange or request cash. You can use the tool’s memo section to include quick notes, too. Who this is for: Friends who need an easy way to split the dinner bill or other expenses. Unbill: Unbill connects to online bill providers so you can make automatic monthly payments and split them among a group of roommates or friends. Who this is for: Friends, roommates or families who share monthly bills. If you find it hard to trust a free credit monitoring service, your skepticism isn’t unfounded. Over the years, a handful of “free” credit monitoring services have been in trouble for misleading customers into a monthly service. Still, there are plenty of trustworthy options available, and below are a few of the best. As a general rule, a free service should never ask you for your credit card information to check your credit. (For a primer on building credit, check out this Wirecutter guide.) Credit Karma: Credit scores and reports can be hard to decipher, and Credit Karma gives you a free look at both, breaking down the basics. The tool details different factors that affect your score, like the average age of all your credit accounts and how much of your credit you use, something formally called credit utilization. Credit Karma monitors your credit, too, so you can get notifications if anyone opens a fraudulent account in your name — a feature that’s especially helpful in light of last year’s Equifax breach. Who this is for: Consumers who want a basic, easy-to-read breakdown of their credit score and history. One consumer complaint about Credit Karma and similar services is that the score is different from what customers may see on other credit monitoring sites. There’s an easy explanation for this: You don’t just have one credit score! Consumers have many credit scores. Mint: If you’re already using Mint, you might as well get access to their free credit score feature. Like Credit Karma and another service called WalletHub, Mint breaks down credit factors and reveals the potentially negative items on your report. You can explore quite a bit of detail with each factor, too. For example, Mint tells you when you opened specific accounts and how you’ve used them over time. Your credit score is updated monthly. Who this is for: Existing Mint users who want an easy way to monitor their credit. AnnualCreditReport.com: Finally, the website AnnualCreditReport.com is the only credit report source that’s authorized by federal law. If you want a copy of your actual credit report, rather than just a breakdown from a third party, this is the website to visit. You’re legally entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of the three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) every year. You could check each of these reports all at once on AnnualCreditReport.com, or space them out throughout the year. When you request your report, the site will ask a series of questions to verify your identity, including your Social Security number. The site assures visitors that they use “the highest level of SSL Certificate encryption” to protect your data. Who this is for: Everyone! But specifically, consumers who want to look at an actual copy of their credit report. Keep in mind, AnnualCreditReport.com does not offer a credit score, as your report and score are two different things. When lenders check your credit, your report carries far more weight than your score. Your score is simply an indicator that sums up what’s on your report. Investing is the logical next step after you have saved at least six months of living expenses in cash — more if your cost of living is especially high — you’ve maxed out your 401(k) contributions ($18,500 for people under 50 as of this year) and you’ve investigated other investing options, like IRAs. Personal Capital: When it comes to managing your investments, Personal Capital is the tool to beat. The website, which is also available as an app on your phone, offers a deep dive into your portfolio, telling you which industries you’re invested in, which industries you should invest in more and how your investments have performed over time compared with the S & P 500, which is the “market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies by market value.” Who this is for: Personal investors who want to dig deeper and understand their portfolio. You’ll fill out a basic profile that tells Personal Capital how your investments should look, depending on when you want to retire and how well you tolerate risk. Once you add your investment accounts, Personal Capital gives you insight on everything from your investment fees to your estimated future Social Security benefits. It’s everything you need to know about your investments in one spot. Acorns: Acorns will help invest your money so you can get a better return. Acorns lets you invest with your spare change, simplifying something that’s otherwise fairly intimidating. You can start investing with just a few bucks, and Acorns will do the work for you. Keep in mind: The standard version of Acorns is not a retirement account, however, and thus doesn’t come with the same tax benefits most retirement accounts include. As their website notes, “you might need to pay taxes on realized capital gains, dividends received and other transactions occurring in your Acorns account.” Recently, however, the company launched Acorns Later, which is indeed an Individual Retirement Account. Who this is for: Savers who want to take their savings to the next level. While you’re lucky to get 1 percent interest with most traditional savings accounts, investing in the broad stock market will theoretically (and historically) yield better results.

2018,Opinion | Our Hubris Will Be Our End,"THE big ideas Then we’ll adapt and start telling ourselves new stories, just as humans have always done. Mr. Scranton is the author of “We’re Doomed. Now What? Essays on War and Climate Change.” You can walk to the beach from where we are staying. It’s a long peel of dun-colored sand bordered by tidy rainbow summer houses, monotonous black and white condos and monstrous blue McMansions that blister the length of the Delmarva Peninsula. On the other side of the sand lies the heaving, implacable mass of unfathomable gray-green water that covers nearly three-quarters of the globe, once a boundary between the known and unknown, a limit-space of mystery and terror, now tamed, or so we think, to a vacation fun zone. There are lifeguards, though, lean summer kids with lazy tans, and to the north, rising from the low trees, towers built to defend the American coastline from Nazi subs. Ten minutes away, the highway connects you to an outlet mall, a Walmart and a cinema showing the latest superhero movie. We walk back and forth from the beach to the house, brave the cold Atlantic rush and the biting flies, make dinner, put the baby to bed, play a board game and sink at last into our screens, each of us burrowed into a different dark corner of the living room. Tablet light, phone light, laptop light flicker on our slack, rapt gazes. Five hundred years ago, the people who lived here did not believe in progress. They did not believe in individual liberty, the autonomous self, the freedom of markets, human rights, the state or the concept of nature as something distinct from culture. They lived for generations without electricity, refrigeration, automobiles, Wi-Fi, on-demand streaming, police, homogenized milk, antibiotics or even The New York Times, and they were almost entirely wiped out in the centuries-long campaign of displacement and genocide that forms the through-line of North American history from 1492 to the end of the Apache Wars in the 1920s. The paucity of historical evidence and the eradication of native peoples’ culture by European colonizers make it difficult to reconstruct precontact indigenous life in all its detail. What evidence there is, combined with anthropological insights into similarly premodern cultures, strongly suggests that despite having to persevere without the miraculous comforts, devices and potions upon which we thoughtlessly depend, they almost certainly lived lives at least as meaningful, complex, rich and joyful as our own. Indeed, some historians and anthropologists — such as James C. Scott, in his book “Against the Grain” — argue that life before modernity was better than our own, with more leisure time, fewer diseases and afflictions, and a more robust phenomenological and spiritual engagement with the world around us. True or not, the argument feels right, especially any time I find myself sitting by a campfire after hiking through the woods all day, or hanging out at the beach watching the waves crash. Then I go back to my habits: the computer at which I write; the gas range, with its reliable, smokeless flame on which I heat my coffee; the flush toilet — indoors! — that carries away all bodily waste; the electric lamp I turn on to read by; the heating and air-conditioning that regulate our house’s microclimate. And I cannot help but feel an abiding sense of relief. I am adapted, whether I like it or not, to a certain built environment, a certain sense of space, a certain social order. We humans of the Anthropocene Era, inhabitants of a global capitalist civilization built on fossil fuels, slavery and genocide, are used to living with the fruits of that civilization. We are accustomed to walking on concrete in mass produced shoes. When it rains we go inside or open an umbrella made of nylon, a synthetic polymer first designed in 1930. When we have to travel, we take a train, bus, car or plane, journeying hundreds of miles in a few hours, at speeds that would have been unimaginable 250 years ago. When it gets hot, we turn on the air-conditioning or go to the beach. The extended coastal urban areas where about 40 percent of all humans now live, so blessedly near the sea, including this very beach town from which I write, would have been incomprehensibly strange, even grotesque, to the people who used to live here. Yet we are no different from them in any essential way, only accustomed to a different way of life, a different built environment, a different set of narratives and concepts that shape our sense of reality. The thing we humans of the Anthropocene share with the Nanticoke and the Unami-speaking Lenape who used to live on the Delmarva Peninsula, and with the !Kung of the Kalahari, the Yukaghir of Siberia, the medieval Persians, the ancient Mayans, the blue-painted Picts, the Neolithic proto-Chinese Peiligang peoples and the Paleolithic nomads of the Pleistocene Era is precisely our ability to adapt to changing conditions, primarily through the collective use of symbolic reasoning and narrative. Homo sapiens can live almost anywhere on Earth, under almost any conditions; all we need is a story telling us why our lives matter. In the transition from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic eras, around 65 million years ago, when the North American continent began to take shape, much of what we call the Eastern Seaboard was under water. No human beings existed then; it would be millions of years before any hominids evolved. Today, Delmarva’s highest point is barely above sea level, a low hill on the peninsula’s west coast where you can sit and watch Chesapeake Bay slowly rise as Antarctica and Greenland melt, as the planet warms one-tenth degree by one-tenth degree, and the world to which we have adapted changes into something else. The beach will disappear, the McMansions will fill with water, the lifeguards will age and die and even the towers built to watch for Nazis will crumble and fall. In some unknown future, on some strange and novel shore, human beings just like us will adapt to a whole new world. You can see them sitting circled around a fire on the beach, the light flickering on their rapt faces, one telling a story about a mighty civilization doomed by its hubris, an age of wonders long past.

2018,Ouster of Zuma Loyalist Bolsters South Africa’s Corruption Fight,"CAPE TOWN — South Africa on Monday took an important step toward restoring a more independent justice system, removing a chief prosecutor widely seen as an obstacle to reining in the country’s rampant corruption. The prosecutor, Shaun Abrahams, the director of public prosecutions, was ordered to step down immediately by the country’s highest court, a decision that left room for South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to take a tougher stance on the endemic graft within his party, the African National Congress. When he took office in February, Mr. Ramaphosa pledged to usher in a new era of clean government, which he would accomplish in part by clearing out officials tied to the abuses of his predecessor as president, Jacob Zuma. With the power to name a new chief prosecutor, Mr. Ramaphosa can now put his stamp on the office that effectively determines “who or what gets prosecuted” in South Africa, said Sithembile Mbete, who teaches politics at the University of Pretoria. Monday’s judgment provides the Ramaphosa administration with an opportunity to address “root issues of political interference” in prosecutorial decisions, Ms. Mbete added. As head of the National Prosecuting Authority, or N.P.A., Mr. Abrahams gained a reputation for loyally defending Mr. Zuma’s interests, earning him the nickname of Shaun the Sheep in the local news media. Among his more notable and criticized decisions was declining to charge officials linked to allegations of state capture by the Guptas, an Indian business family with close ties to Mr. Zuma. State capture is a type of corruption in which a small number of private businesses shape government policy to their own advantage. Working through friends and family of Mr. Zuma, including one of his sons, Duduzane, 34, the Guptas won lucrative state contracts in industries as varied as mining and agriculture, siphoning millions of dollars from the public purse and influencing ministerial appointments. Another controversial decision by Mr. Abrahams was his refusal to charge Duduzane Zuma with culpable homicide after he crashed his Porsche into a minibus taxi in 2014, killing two people. The charges were reinstated this year, after Mr. Ramaphosa took office. In a majority ruling, the Constitutional Court on Monday found that the 2015 appointment of Mr. Abrahams was invalid and had come about through an “abuse of power” by Mr. Zuma. Mr. Zuma had offered Mr. Abrahams’ predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, a payout of more than $1 million to resign, clearing the way for an appointment of a prosecutor more favorable to his interests. Analysts hoped the dismissal of Mr. Abrahams would help restore the independence of a justice system drawn into factional battles within the governing party, the A.N.C., and hamstrung by high-level corruption. “This judgment is critical for addressing state capture,” said Ben Theron, chief operations officer at the Organization Undoing Tax Abuse, a local corruption watchdog. “We hope that era of capturing N.P.A. and manipulation has been brought to a stop.” While Mr. Ramaphosa has made fighting corruption a priority of his administration, he also relies on political support from top party officials implicated in multiple corruption scandals, raising questions about his ability to enact meaningful change. “There will be people within the A.N.C., and their backers, who won’t want an effective and independent prosecutions director because they won’t be able to interfere with cases politically,” Ms. Mbete said. The A.N.C. welcomed the court’s decision in a statement, calling for “speed and urgency” in appointing a new head prosecutor. Mr. Ramaphosa has 90 days to name a replacement. “What is critical for the A.N.C. is the restoration of the independence, integrity and credibility of this key law enforcement agency,” said a party spokesman, Pule Mabe. “Anything that compromises the independence of the N.P.A. will undermine its credibility and lead to a serious erosion of the rule of law.” A spokesman for the prosecuting authority, Luvuyo Mfaku, said that Mr. Abrahams was “gravely disappointed” but would respect the judgment, which instructed him to vacate his office immediately.",The New York Times
2018,Out From Under the Family Name,"The Restaurant Preview Away from the uptown empire, a son of Eli Zabar will open his own restaurant on the Lower East Side. Working in a family business can be both a privilege and a burden. If you are a young person with a last name that looms, it is perhaps natural to want to create something of your own. So it is with Oliver Zabar, a son of Eli Zabar, whose name blankets the Upper East Side on food markets, takeout shops, wine and beer bars, a wholesale bakery, a restaurant and a wine shop. For the last few years, the younger Mr. Zabar, 27, has managed Eli’s Night Shift at 79th Street and Third Avenue, a grab-and-go cafe by day and a busy, convivial beer bar by night. Now, he is stepping out and away. This fall, he will open Devon, a casual restaurant and cocktail bar, in an old tenement building on the Lower East Side, with an adjacent retail bakery that will supply the restaurant with breads and pastries. Devon will offer what Mr. Zabar calls “elevated American bar food” with a French influence. In a departure from family tradition, Devon is named after his mother, Devon Fredericks, who Mr. Zabar said is a creative behind-the-scenes force in the Eli’s empire. Although Kilian Robin, who is also the wine director for Eli Zabar, is involved in the project (smartly choosing the concise wine list, which focuses on tradition-minded producers, with prices that are more modest than those at Eli Zabar’s restaurant and wine bars uptown), Oliver Zabar insisted that Devon was not a family collaboration. “From start to finish, this has been my project,” he said. “If you knew me, you would say: ‘It’s very Oliver: He would choose that color, that material.’ It’s my concept. I’ve been working on it a long time.” The consulting chef is Ken Addington, who cooked at Five Leaves in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Cocktails will be the domain of Sean Saunders, who has worked at Slowly Shirley and the Happiest Hour in the West Village. Many of the drinks will include sodas made at the restaurant, and Devon will feature beers made in New York City. “I set out to create my ideal neighborhood spot,” said Mr. Zabar, who lives a few blocks away. “Good, accessible food; great drinks and a comfortable environment where you can feel at home.” Devon 252 Broome Street (between Orchard and Ludlow Streets), devonnyc.com, October.

2018,Outside Influence: The Veterans Agency’s Shadowy Leadership,"A new secretary was sworn in at the Department of Veterans Affairs in late July, but the people actually in charge of the agency may not have changed, and they are not at the headquarters in Washington, but on the manicured grounds of Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s West Palm Beach estate. A shadowy threesome known in the department as the “Mar-a-Lago crowd” has been quietly empowered by the president to help steer the veterans agency, and the men are exerting their influence in ways that affect millions of veterans, according to interviews with four former senior officials at the department and a report by the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica. The three men pushed the agency’s health care system toward the use of more privately provided health care, tried to derail a critical contract, blocked moves to fire employees they considered allies, and were instrumental in the firing of the former secretary, Dr. David J. Shulkin, according to the report and the interviews. All of the former officials agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution. Now, veterans organizations and lawmakers say, the group may be putting the same pressure on the new secretary, Robert L. Wilkie, who was sworn in on July 30. “We’re concerned the people in Mar-a-Lago are still calling the shots,” said Paul Rieckhoff, the head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Mr. Wilkie, he said, “seems like a good guy, but if he isn’t allowed to actually lead, the department could be ripped apart inside by special interests.” According to reports, Mr. Wilkie had planned to quickly name a new leadership team and dismiss several of the political appointees who had clashed with Dr. Shulkin. But many of those appointees are allied with the Mar-a-Lago group, former department officials say. So far, Mr. Wilkie’s office has announced no staff changes. The Mar-a-Lago group is led by the reclusive chairman of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac Perlmutter, 75, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s and a member of his West Palm Beach golf club. Mr. Perlmutter, who served briefly in the Israeli Army before becoming an American citizen, offered to advise Mr. Trump on veterans affairs during the 2016 presidential campaign. According to the former agency officials, Mr. Perlmutter then brought in his personal doctor and fellow club member, Bruce Moskowitz, 70, who specializes in connecting wealthy patients to premium care. Mr. Moskowitz recruited his squash partner, Marc Sherman, 63, a lawyer with the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, who specializes in fraud and white-collar crime investigations. None have served in the United States military or in government. The men barraged Secretary Shulkin with calls, several times a day, sometimes on nights and weekends, according to department staff members. If they felt Dr. Shulkin was not receptive, they called Mr. Trump. The White house did not respond to requests for comment. Democrats are calling for an investigation. “This situation reeks of corruption and cronyism,” said Representative Tim Walz, Democrat of Minnesota and the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. On Wednesday he sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs, demanding all correspondence between the department and the three men. The three men did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement to ProPublica, they said their advisory role was neither secret nor improper. The statement added: “We provided our advice and suggestions so that members of the administration could consider them as they wished to make their own decisions on actions to be taken. To the extent anyone thought our role was anything other than that, we don’t believe it was the result of anything we said or did.” According to the former senior officials, the three men’s first accomplishment was getting their preferred candidate, Dr. Shulkin, picked to become secretary. They also gave personal approval for the selection of Tom Bowman as deputy secretary. In an email to Dr. Shulkin obtained by ProPublica, Dr. Moskowitz then dictated what access he wanted. “We do not need to meet in person monthly, but meet face to face only when necessary,” he wrote. “We will set up phone conference calls at a convenient time.” At first, the former officials said, Mr. Shulkin and Mr. Bowman viewed the three men as allies with connections in the business and health care worlds. But the three men barraged the secretary with criticisms and suggestions, including many that had little basis in fact. They once called the secretary with complaints about a $200 million contract that did not exist, according to the official who had to hunt for the nonexistent paperwork. Another time, according to documents obtained by ProPublica, they asked the secretary to solve a problem for a friend’s son that was an issue with the military, not veterans affairs. By late 2017, the relationship with Dr. Shulkin had begun to sour. The Mar-a-Lago crowd had reservations about a $10 billion contract the department was preparing to sign for an electronic health record system. Dr. Moskowitz had used a similar system by the same company, Cerner, and did not like it. The department assembled panels of experts to address the concerns, but the three men pushed to kill the deal. Eventually, the secretary, frustrated by their constant demands, decided to move ahead on his own. “That is where his problems started,” one senior staff member said. Dr. Shulkin had also split with political appointees over how to oversee privately provided health care. In December, the Florida advisers and the political appointees formed a plan to change leadership. The details were revealed in a memo left on a copy machine in January: Mr. Perlmutter would help get the secretary replaced. They would also replace the deputy secretary and chief of staff. Dr. Shulkin tried to fight back, meeting several times with the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, but neither the secretary nor Mr. Kelly had authority to fire the appointees, according to one of the former officials. Dr. Shulkin, who was facing criticism over lavish travel spending, was fired in March, shortly before he planned to finalize the Cerner deal. The morning after Dr. Shulkin was fired, one of the Mar-a-Lago members, Mr. Sherman, was in the headquarters to greet Mr. Wilkie, who became the acting secretary, according to department records. Both Mr. Wilkie and Peter O’Rourke, who also briefly served as acting secretary, visited Mar-a-Lago to meet with the three men, according to two of the former officials. Several staff members who worked with Mr. Wilkie said they believed he was independent and wanted to succeed in running the department, but questioned whether he would be able to do so. A department spokesman, Curt Cashour, who was one of the men the former secretary was unable to fire, said there had been “no personnel announcements at this time.” Asked for comment from Mr. Wilkie, Mr. Cashour did not respond.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Clara Lemlich Shavelson, Crusading Leader of Labor Rights","Shavelson ignited a huge strike by women garment workers that helped galvanize the labor movement. She went on to fight for suffrage and tenants’ rights. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. A slight young woman with lively dark eyes pushed her way to the front of a crowd of garment workers at a union meeting in New York City in 1909 and demanded to be heard. “I am tired of listening to speakers who talk in general terms,” the woman, Clara Lemlich Shavelson, declared in Yiddish, as the audience lifted her onto the platform. “I move that we go on a general strike!” The crowd roared its approval, according to news reports at the time. Male union officials had cautioned against a strike, arguing it would be too difficult and too costly, especially for young women working in the factories. But the day after the speech, thousands of young women were among the garment workers who formed the Uprising of the 20,000, a milestone action in a swelling labor movement that made workplaces safer, workdays shorter and wages higher. Shavelson, already a battle-worn veteran of the movement at 23, has pushed to the margins of history books, sometimes remembered as an anonymous “wisp of a girl.” But she was an influential woman in a labor movement dominated by men, advancing feminist ideas and later grass-roots tactics, like consumer boycotts, that were ahead of her time. By the time she spoke that day, at Cooper Union in Manhattan, she had been arrested 17 times and beaten by police and company guards, who broke six of her ribs. She had hidden her injuries from her parents, fearing they would forbid her from returning to the picket line. The Uprising of the 20,000 ended when many shops agreed to pay higher wages, adopt a 52-hour week and recognize the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union on the factory floor. (One holdout was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where an infamous fire killed 146 workers a year later. The male union negotiators had ignored the striking women’s safety concerns, letting factories off the hook for conditions inside.) The strike also had a different kind of impact, as a weekly paper noted in 1910: “These young, inexperienced girls have proved that women can strike, and strike successfully.” Shavelson would go on to become a radical across causes, galvanizing working-class women to fight for suffrage, battling landlords and evictions in the 1920s and ’30s, and leading housewives in a struggle for lower food and rent prices during the Great Depression. (The New York Times, for instance, reported on a “boycott of high-priced meat spread by militant housewives” in 1935 that was organized by Shavelson.) Described by contemporaries as warm and vivacious, with a nearly absolutist certainty about what was right, Shavelson viewed every aspect of her life through a political lens. “When you don’t work, and you don’t work in the movement, you’re nothing,” she was quoted as saying in “Common Sense and a Little Fire” (1995), a book by Annelise Orleck about Shavelson and three other female labor leaders. Shavelson was born Clara Lemlich in the Ukrainian village of Gorodok in 1886. When she arrived in the United States at age 16, she was already committed to the Marxist revolutionary movement that had begun in Russia. She found work sewing dresses in a crammed factory in New York City and threw herself into learning. A 1954 article in Jewish Life Magazine detailed how after 11-hour workdays, she read Russian classics at the local public library and studied Marxist theory. Shavelson dedicated herself early on to helping working women, and after the 1909 strike she began to see the women’s vote as an essential tool. “The manufacturer has a vote; the bosses have votes; the foremen have votes; the inspectors have votes. The working girl has no vote,” she wrote in Good Housekeeping in 1912. “When she asks to have the building in which she must work made clean and safe, the officials do not have to listen.” Clara married Joe Shavelson in the early 1910s, and they had three children, prompting her to shift her focus to the political and social conditions under which the wives and mothers around her lived. She pursued a vision of motherhood that was almost unheard-of at the time, bringing her children with her to Socialist meetings as soon as they were old enough to walk and organizing rent strikes that got her family evicted from at least one home. She and other working-class women in her Brooklyn neighborhood formed tenants’ unions, fighting for rent control and taking militant action, like pouring boiling water from teakettles onto those who arrived to carry out evictions. Shavelson joined the Communist Party U.S.A. around 1926, and she remained loyal to it throughout her life, despite mounting evidence of Stalin’s murderous crimes against his people. After a trip to the Soviet Union in 1951, she praised Soviet health care and education. She was subsequently summoned to Washington to testify, and her passport was revoked. It was only years later that she admitted, reluctantly, that she had been wrong about the Soviet Union. Shavelson died on July 25, 1982, in California at 96. Near the end of her life, she moved into the Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles, where she organized the nurses and orderlies, according to “Common Sense.” “How much worse could these conditions get?” Shavelson, then 83, asked hesitant staffers before they successfully unionized. “You’d be crazy not to join a union.”",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Doria Shafik, Who Led Egypt’s Women’s Liberation Movement","Her hunger strikes and demonstrations made her one of the most influential women in the history of the Arab world. Yet few Egyptians today know her name. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. By age 32, Doria Shafik had earned a doctorate in philosophy from the Sorbonne, competed in the Miss Egypt contest, published essays and poetry in Arabic and French, founded an Egyptian feminist organization and took on the editorship of two feminist magazines. But it was what she did on Feb. 19, 1951, that had the biggest impact on Egyptian history. She convened a crowd of 1,500 women at a lecture hall at the American University of Cairo for what she billed “a feminist congress.” But that was a just ruse to fool the police. Shafik had other plans. “Our meeting today is not a congress but a parliament,” she said. “A true one! That of women.” Moments later, she led her army of women as they stormed through the marble gates and onto the floor of Egypt’s all-male parliament — “the parliament of the other half of the nation,” she called it that day. “We are here by the force of our right,” Shafik told a parliamentary leader who tried in vain to stop them. Her demonstrators shut down the legislature for more than four hours, until the president of its upper chamber pledged to take up their key demands: the right of women to vote and to hold office. (He did not address their other demands, for pay equity and reforms to the marriage and divorce laws.) The demonstration helped earn Shafik a place among the most influential women in the history of the Arab world. Yet many Egyptians today have never heard her name. Just six years later, in 1957, she denounced the “dictatorship” of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who then put her under house arrest, shut down her magazine and movement, and erased any mention of her from history books and the news media. Banished from the public stage, Shafik died in obscurity on Sept. 20, 1975. She threw herself from a sixth-floor balcony. Her memory has been preserved mainly by a handful of Egyptian feminists who have sought, with mixed success, to rebuild an independent feminist movement. Shafik was born on Dec. 14, 1908. Her father, Ahmad Chafik, was a civil servant whose jobs moved the family among the Nile Delta towns of Tanta, Mansoura and Alexandria, while her mother, Ratiba Nassif, kept house. After graduating from an elementary school run by French missionaries in Alexandria, Doria Shafik found that further education there was open only to boys. So she studied on her own and completed the official French curricular exams ahead of schedule; the teachers who shut her out were forced to acknowledge that she had earned among the top scores in Egypt. On the strength of that performance, she appealed for help from Huda el-Shaarawi, an aristocrat who had organized elite women to form the Egyptian Feminist Union, which sought social freedoms for women and supported independence from Britain. Unlike Shafik, Shaarawi never pushed for political rights for women and is still celebrated as a national hero. Shaarawi used her status to help elevate Shafik into government scholarship and to study philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. Returning to Alexandria for the summer of 1935, Shafik saw that a beauty pageant was taking place to select a Miss Egypt. Teachers of Islam extolled the virtue of modesty, including the full covering of women’s bodies and hair, and only women of European or Coptic Christian heritage had ever entered the contest — never a Muslim like Shafik. She saw that as an opportunity. “In Paris I had asserted myself in the intellectual sphere. Now I wanted to assert myself in the feminine sphere,” she once said, according to “Doria Shafik, Egyptian Feminist: A Woman Apart” (1996), by Cynthia Nelson, Shafik’s English-language biographer. Shafik wrote of her beauty, “It was as if nature, in a sort of immanent justice, having deprived me of class, status and wealth, had compensated me with these qualities.” She entered the contest without telling her family and was named first runner-up. But the Egyptian press was scandalized. “I was a Muslim girl who had acted against Islam!” Shafik recalled. While studying in Paris she met and married Nour al-Din Ragai, who was earning a doctorate in commercial law. They had two daughters, Aziza and Jehane. Doria earned her doctorate in 1940, but Egypt’s national university refused her a teaching position, evidently on the grounds that her beauty and liberal mores might somehow damage its scholarly reputation. Then her patron, Shaarawi, shut Shafik out as well, excluding her from the elite Feminist Union because of her middle-class background. Shafik instead started her own movement, the Daughters of the Nile Union, dedicated to educating and organizing working women of all classes. The Daughters of the Nile ran literacy classes, an employment agency, mutual aid programs, a discounted cafeteria and cultural events, including theatrical performances for women. Most of all, it agitated for political rights. “No one will deliver freedom to the woman except the woman herself,” Shafik later wrote. “I decided to fight until the last drop of blood to break the chains shackling the women of my country.” When Egyptians were campaigning for independence from Britain, Shafik started a uniformed paramilitary unit of the Daughters of the Nile. In January 1952, she led a brigade of its members to surround and shut down a branch of Barclays Bank, deeming it a symbol of British colonial rule. (After the crowd outside turned rowdy, the security police hauled her away and dispersed them.) Shafik had expected that once the British-backed monarchy was overthrown in 1952, Egypt would see “the beginning of a renaissance for women.” But nothing changed: Women were still not permitted to vote or participate in a constituent assembly. In 1954, Shafik tried a new tactic: She vowed to go on a hunger strike “to my last breath” and was joined by a handful of other women in a fast that made headlines around the world. “We are convinced that the women who form more than half of the Egyptian nation must not, at any cost, be governed by a Constitution in the making of which they played no part,” she said in messages to the ruling party, according to a report in The New York Times. After 10 days without food, hospitalized because of her deteriorating condition, Sharik appeared to succeed; the acting president promised her that women would have “full political rights.” But it turned out that no one would have such rights. Nasser had consolidated his power as Egypt’s new strongman, giving neither men nor women the right to exercise a meaningful franchise. In 1957 Sharik tried another hunger strike, this time for six days. The Nasserite news media attacked her as a traitor. Her female allies now turned against her, and she was expelled from her own Daughters of the Nile. With almost no one on her side, she was forced to spend the next 18 years in near total seclusion. A decade later, Nasser also jailed Shafik’s husband for several months on suspicion of subversion unrelated to her. Blacklisted in Egypt, he was forced to travel abroad to continue to work. Their separation and divorce, in 1967, completed her isolation. “There was a day when Doria Shafik was the only man in Egypt,” the Egyptian feminist Fatima Abd al-Khalak wrote in the state newspaper Al Ahram decades later, after Shafik’s suicide in 1975. Nasser had died five years earlier, removing the danger from such sentiments. “Doria Shafik emerged in 1957 to tell us that we were on the way into dictatorship,” she said, but “we were ‘struck dumb.’ ” David D. Kirkpatrick is the author of the recently published book, “Into the Hands of the Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East,” from which this article is adapted. An earlier version of this obituary misstated when Gamal Abdel Nasser died. It was 1970, not 1968.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Julia Sand, Whose Letters Inspired a President","A housebound New York woman sought to influence the heart of Chester A. Arthur at a time when no one believed in him. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Julia Sand was 31, unmarried and homebound from an illness when she wrote the first of a remarkable series of letters to Chester A. Arthur. It was the summer of 1881, and President James A. Garfield was dying a slow death after being shot. Arthur, his vice president, was a notorious member of the Republican political machine who was hiding from the public eye when he read Sand’s first letter. The nation had been dreading the prospect of an Arthur presidency. A Chicago Tribune editorial described it as “a pending calamity of the utmost magnitude.” The New York Times wrote that Arthur was “about the last man who would be considered eligible” for the job. The historian Andrew Dickson White noted that even Arthur’s closest friends were reported to have said, “Chet Arthur President of the United States! Good God!” But Sand believed in Arthur, who became president later that year. He had started his career as an idealistic lawyer, arguing and winning Jennings v. Third Ave. Railroad, a federal case decided in a Brooklyn circuit court that led to the desegregation of New York City streetcars. Sand wrote that the attempt on Garfield’s life and the lack of faith the country seemed to have in Arthur had moved her to try to inspire him. “Great emergencies awaken generous traits which have lain dormant half a life,” Sand wrote. “If there is a spark of true nobility in you, now is the occasion to let it shine.” Her letter urged him, “Reform!” And reform he did. Arthur shocked the nation, his party and his closest friends by calling on Congress to pass the Pendleton act, the nation’s first Civil Service reform. The act required that government employees pass a competitive examination to win their jobs, meaning merit — not party affiliation — determined who would work for the federal government. Sand continued to write to Arthur throughout his presidency. In nearly two dozen letters she advised, cajoled and scolded him on policy matters large and small, from whom to keep in his cabinet to major pieces of legislation, like the Chinese Exclusion Act, which halted immigration from China and prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming American citizens. After Arthur signed the act, despite initially vetoing a version, Sand chastised him: “Why do you not do what you do with your whole soul? — or have you only half of one? When you vetoed the Chinese Bill, the better class of people throughout the country were delighted. Now you sign it. And what is the difference, as it now stands?” In her letters Sand would call herself Arthur’s “little dwarf,” a reference to the only member of the king’s court who would dare to tell him the truth. There is no evidence Arthur ever responded, but some historians are convinced that she was heard. “We’ll never know for sure, but there’s good reason to believe that this anonymous young woman helped to change the course of the presidency,” Scott S. Greenberger, author of “The Unexpected President: The Life and Times of Chester A. Arthur” (2017), said in an interview. “At a time when women didn’t have the ability to be involved in politics, she used these letters to influence a president and change the course of history.” Arthur’s wife, Ellen, died of pneumonia just before he was elected vice president, and he served as president only for the rest of what would have been Garfield’s term. While in office Arthur was given a diagnosis of Bright’s disease, a kidney ailment, which, combined with grief and the strains of the presidency, left him depressed, exhausted and nauseated. He made a halfhearted bid for re-election in 1884 but lost the nomination to James G. Blaine and died of the disease two years later, on Nov. 18, 1886. He was 57. Whatever Sand’s impact was on Arthur’s actions, it seemed he valued the relationship. Shortly before he died, Arthur ordered that all his papers be burned except for Sand’s letters. He also visited her once, at her brother’s home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, on Aug. 20, 1882. Julia Isabella Sand was born in Brooklyn in 1850 to Christian Henry and Isabella Sand. Her father was a German immigrant who worked his way up to become the president of the Metropolitan Gas-Light Company of New York. Julia Sand never married. She enjoyed the privileges of wealth: She spoke French, read poetry and vacationed in Newport, R.I., and Saratoga Springs, N.Y. She spent her days reading newspapers and discussing politics. One of her nephews, Paul B. Rossire, described Sand as “a talented woman, something of a bluestocking,” or intellectual. By the age of 31 she had become plagued by an illness whose conditions included spinal trouble and deafness, leaving her mostly confined to her home. She died in May 1933 in a home for the mentally ill on Long Island and is buried with her family in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. She was 83. The exact cause of her death was unknown. According to Michelle Krowl, a specialist at the Library of Congress, Sand had published articles in The Century, Harper’s and other magazines. The words she will be remembered for, however, were addressed to an audience of one. “It is for you to choose whether your record shall be written in black or gold,” Sand wrote Arthur in that first letter. “For the sake of your country, for your own sake, and for the sakes of all who have ever loved you, let it be pure and bright.”",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Ruby Payne-Scott, Who Explored Space With Radio Waves","Payne-Scott helped establish the field of radio astronomy by using radio waves to detect solar bursts, but she was forced to resign after she got married. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Every so often our sun emits an invisible burst of energy. This energy ripples through space as electromagnetic waves and then crashes into planets and meteors and space debris and one another, causing a great cacophony above and around us. A cacophony that was inaudible, until Ruby Payne-Scott entered a laboratory. In the 1940s, Payne-Scott helped lay the foundation for a new field of science called radio astronomy. Her work led to the discovery of deep-space phenomena like black holes and pulsars and later helped astronauts understand how solar storms disrupt weather in space and electrical grids on Earth. Yet as a married woman she was denied equal employment status and compensation. She challenged the scientific establishment in her native Australia and fought for the rights of women in the workplace, but ultimately left science to raise her children full time. World War II opened the door to Payne-Scott’s scientific career. The Australian armed forces needed physicists, and men were joining the military to fight instead. Bored with her job at Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), where she cataloged and calibrated equipment for radio technicians, Payne-Scott applied for a government posting seeking a physicist. Her experience piqued the interest of the government’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. There she became one of two women working as research scientists in the division of radio physics, a laboratory with a top-secret mission: to enable radar systems to track incoming Japanese fighter planes. Radar was already in use on the European front, but the same systems were not working properly in the Southern Hemisphere, leaving Allied forces and Australian citizens vulnerable. Payne-Scott determined that tropical weather in the Pacific was to blame. She created a device called an S-band noise tube to check the sensitivity of receivers and measure the intensity of incoming signals. “She understood the hardware, but she also understood the physics, which is incredible,” said Miller Goss, astronomer emeritus at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the author of “Making Waves,” a biography of Payne-Scott. “No radio astronomer in the 21st century could do something like that.” Payne-Scott became an expert at distinguishing Japanese aircraft from other sources of radio static, like ships, lighthouses, buildings and cliffs. This enabled scientists to track planes from farther away, even at night and during storms — a vast improvement over relying on the naked eye to spot the enemy. By 1944, with the war turning in the Allies’ favor, Payne-Scott and other scientists began searching for postwar applications for their research. A British physicist, James Stanley Hey, wrote a classified report that was circulated among just a few Allied scientists, including Payne-Scott. It hypothesized that a mysterious radio noise was coming not from aircraft or signal jamming, but rather from the sun. Hey’s report inspired Payne-Scott to join the race to legitimize a new branch of science: radio astronomy. Ruby Violet Payne-Scott was born in South Grafton, New South Wales, on May 28, 1912, to Cyril and Amy (Neale) Payne-Scott. Home-schooled until age 11, she ultimately landed a spot at the prestigious Sydney Girls High School, graduating at 16. She earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in physics from the University of Sydney — only the third woman to do so, Goss said in an interview. But there were few opportunities for physicists or women when Payne-Scott earned her graduate degree in 1936, so she became a schoolteacher and then took the job at Amalgamated Wireless. She married William Hall in 1944. They shared political views that were fairly radical; they were feminists, environmental conservationists, atheists and communists. Some of Payne-Scott’s colleagues called her “Red Ruby.” But her marriage would present a problem: Women in public service were expected to resign when they wed. Her colleagues at the government research center considered her so integral to their work that they helped keep her marriage a secret; she wore her wedding band on a necklace. Her boss, J.L. Pawsey, “valued her judgment and experience so highly that when she was absent from a meeting, he would often not make a final decision until she had been consulted,” Goss wrote in “Making Waves.” She maintained her secret for several years, during which she helped Pawsey discover what would become known as Type I solar bursts. Their work, published in the journal Nature in February 1946, demonstrated that electromagnetic waves were spewing from the sun. Unlike solar flares, which were visible during eclipses using traditional telescopes, these spontaneous emissions were now detectable using radios. Payne-Scott would later discover two more types of solar bursts and help create a device called the swept-lobe interferometer, which panned the sky dozens of times per second, allowing radio astronomers to identify and zoom in on single wave formations. Her final contribution “predicted the whole future of radio astronomy,” Goss said. Like watching an instant replay from multiple camera angles at the same time, her method gave radio astronomers a more complete picture of the frequency and shape of waves emanating from space. Martin Ryle shared the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics using this method. Then, in 1950, the department was restructured, and in the process Payne-Scott’s marriage was uncovered by regulators. “There were many men who were very unsympathetic to the notion that women would continue to work after they were married,” said Claire Hooker, senior lecturer in health and medical humanities at the University of Sydney. “You didn’t have two breadwinners in the family,” she continued. “And it was just assumed that it was the man’s job to win the bread.” Payne-Scott challenged the rule, taking her fight to the head of the department in a series of contentious letters. But she was forced to resign and give up her pension. Pawsey hired her back on “temporary” status and gave her a raise, but she decided to leave the lab a year later, five months pregnant and excited to become a mother. Her son, Peter Gavin Hall, became an influential statistician. Her daughter, Fiona Margaret Hall, born in 1953, is a prominent Australian artist currently working on a war memorial. Payne-Scott died of complications of dementia on May 25, 1981. She was 68. Hall said in an interview that while her mother was known publicly for being outspoken, she lived a relatively quiet family life in the suburbs of Sydney — except for the occasional trip to protest the Vietnam War. But sometimes, she said, “as a child you’d ask her a question, a classic childhood question like ‘Why does the sun come up in the morning,’ and my mum would always have a very complicated answer.”",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Sissieretta Jones, a Soprano Who Shattered Racial Barriers","She was the first African-American woman to headline a concert at Carnegie Hall, but she didn’t care for her stage name, “the Black Patti,” which compared her to a white diva. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Sissieretta Jones forged an unconventional path to singing opera, becoming the first African-American woman to headline a concert on the main stage of Carnegie Hall, in 1893. She sang at the White House, toured the nation and the world, and, in a performance at Madison Square Garden, was conducted by the composer Antonin Dvorak. But there were color lines she never managed to break, like the one that kept the nation’s major opera companies segregated, denying her the chance to perform in fully staged operas. “They tell me my color is against me,” she once lamented to a reporter from The Detroit Tribune. When another interviewer suggested that she transform herself with makeup and wigs, she dismissed the idea. “Try to hide my race and deny my own people?” she responded in the interview, which was published by The San Francisco Call in 1896. “Oh, I would never do that.” She added: “I am proud of belonging to them and would not hide what I am even for an evening.” Jones was perhaps the most famous of an early generation of African-American singers who shattered racial barriers in classical music, more than a half-century before Marian Anderson became the first black artist to sing a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. “Thirty years out of slavery for African-Americans in this country, here she was on the stage of Carnegie Hall,” Jessye Norman, who became a great African-American diva in the late 20th century, said in an interview. Nicknamed “the Black Patti” for publicity purposes — a comparison to the white diva Adelina Patti — she became the star of a touring company called the Black Patti Troubadours. All the performers were black, but the managers were white. Performances would open with skits that had roots in minstrel shows, including songs in dialect called “coon songs.” But they would close in another key entirely: with Jones as the star of an “Operatic Kaleidoscope.” An early show that began with a skit called “At Jolly Coon-ey Island” ended with Jones singing arias by Verdi and Offenbach — in costume, backed by a chorus. “She took no other part in the show, but was the great drawing card,” James Weldon Johnson, the author, civil rights activist and songwriter wrote in his 1930 book, “Black Manhattan.” He added that she “had most of the qualities essential in a great singer: the natural voice, the physical figure, the grand air, and the engaging personality.” The Troubadours began touring in 1896, and she held the stage with them and a successor company for nearly two decades. Matilda Sissieretta Joyner was born in Portsmouth, Va., in either 1868 or 1869 (records disagree); her father was a carpenter and pastor who was born into slavery, and her mother sang in the choir at the nearby Ebenezer Baptist Church. The family moved to Providence, R.I., where a young Sissieretta sang in church and began her vocal training. Her marriage to David Jones ended in divorce; their daughter, Mabel, died at the age of 2. After studying singing in Providence and Boston, she began appearing in concerts in New York, New England and Philadelphia, and in 1888 went on her first tour, of the Caribbean and South America. On a tour of England, she performed for the Prince of Wales. She sang at the White House in 1892 for President Benjamin Harrison, her first of several appearances there. But Jones attributed her success to an engagement months later at Madison Square Garden billed as a “Grand Negro Jubilee.” After several instrumentals played by the band, some songs by the Jubilee Chorus and a fight scene, Jones took to the stage of the Garden. “Wearing long white gloves, a pearl gray gown, and a chestful of medals, Sissieretta smiled broadly as she walked confidently up the steps to the platform in the center of the huge amphitheater,” her biographer, Maureen D. Lee, wrote in “Sissieretta Jones: ‘The Greatest Singer of Her Race,’ 1868-1933” (2012). “If she was nervous, she did not let her audience see any evidence of it.” Jones was a hit. In its review of her performances there, The New York Dramatic Mirror wrote that she had “one of the most pleasing soprano voices ever heard in this city,” and added that she had a “purity of tone, an accuracy of phrasing, and a richness and a power.” Jones later said: “I woke up famous after singing at the Garden and didn’t know it.” She followed in the footsteps of earlier African-American concert singers who upended racial stereotypes, including Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, who began her singing career before the Civil War, Flora Batson and Marie Selika Williams, the first black singer to perform at the White House, in 1878. Jones became one of the most successful, though, amassing a large collection of medals from international admirers that she often wore at concerts, and becoming one of the best-paid African-American performers of her day, according to modern scholars. But she frequently had to endure racism, and all manner of indignities. Segregated hotels turned her away, and not only in the South. The same year the Troubadours were founded, 1896, the United States Supreme Court allowed racial segregation in its Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which held that “separate but equal” facilities were constitutional. That fall, when Jones’s young company tried to tour Hartford, every hotel refused them, according to The New York Times. She eventually got a private rail car to live in while on the road. When a contract dispute with her powerful white manager, Maj. James B. Pond, landed in court, the judge chided her for ingratitude. And singing for black and white audiences was not always easy in a segregated era. After an 1893 concert in Louisville, where black patrons were restricted to the packed upper gallery while some of the best seats, reserved for whites, sat empty, Jones spoke out. “I think people of my race ought not to be shut out in this way,” she told The Louisville Commercial. She retired from the stage in 1915 to look after her mother in Providence, slipped from view and ran through her savings. When she died on June 24, 1933, relatively few took notice. But since then, people have worked to keep her memory alive. In 1944, W.C. Handy, sometimes called the father of the blues, edited a songbook, “Unsung Americans Sung,” that included a song about her. Langston Hughes and Milton Meltzer wrote of her as a “stunning woman with a beautiful voice” in their 1967 book “Black Magic.” In recent years her story has become more widely known. She appears in Tyehimba Jess’s “Olio,” an exploration of the lives of African-American performers that won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. In June her unmarked grave in Providence finally received a headstone to mark the 150th anniversary of her birth, with money provided by a GoFundMe campaign spearheaded by Lee, her biographer, and Stages of Freedom, a Providence nonprofit that held three days of events about her life. (Lee cites Jones’s birth year as 1868.) And Norman, the soprano, is developing a project exploring Jones’s life that will be presented at National Sawdust, the performance space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She hopes that projects like hers will spread Jones’s fame wider. But she has one overarching wish: finding a recording of her voice. There are no known recordings of Jones. The Library of Congress notes that black artists rarely performed on early recordings. Gino Francesconi, the director of Carnegie Hall’s archives and Rose Museum, said he was still searching for such a track. “I just wish we had recordings,” Norman said,” so we could actually listen to the sounds she made.”",The New York Times
