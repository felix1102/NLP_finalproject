2019,"With Ground Zero Payments Slashed, a Push to Replenish a 9/11 Fund","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] It has been more than 17 years since the World Trade Center collapsed in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, and since 2011, a rededicated fund has compensated emergency personnel and others who responded to the scene and have since gotten sick, as well as the families of the deceased. But with medical claims on the rise, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund is running out of money: Already, more than $5 billion of the $7.375 billion it was allotted in 2015 to give away over five years has been spent. The fund’s special master announced in mid-February that it would be necessary to slash in half the payouts for those already waiting in line; new claimants could see payments cut by as much as 70 percent. The severe reductions have sparked a renewed push in Congress to press for more money to replenish the depleted fund — resurrecting fears of another protracted battle with Senate Republicans, who nearly quashed the fund in 2011. On Monday, top lawmakers from New York, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has pressed for the legislation for years, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, held a Capitol Hill news conference to call for the fund to be extended for the lifetime of those who were at ground zero. They were joined by Jon Stewart, the comedian and former talk show host, who has been outspoken on behalf of ground zero workers since the attack. Mr. Stewart went out of his way to praise President Trump’s Justice Department for handling claims quickly, tapping the microphone as he said the administration was doing an “excellent job.” “Now it’s Congress’s job to fund it properly and let these people live in peace,” Mr. Stewart said. Mr. Stewart characterized the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, as an “impediment.” A spokesman for Mr. McConnell said he was “reviewing the legislation” and “we do not have any announcements at this time.” The fund first operated from 2001 to 2004, covering people who died or were injured during the attacks. It doled out $6 billion to victims’ families and $1 billion to the injured. The fund then went dormant, before reopening in 2011, after Congress passed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. When the Zadroga Act first came up in 2011, some Republican members of Congress were unsure about the wisdom of creating a new federal entitlement, and suggested that perhaps the expenses of 9/11 care should fall to the states. In general, the legislation has not drawn loud opposition on Capitol Hill, but instead has gotten bogged down in political maneuverings. It was renewed in 2015, and allows claims to be submitted until Dec. 18, 2020. “It’s an arbitrary date that was set,” said Robert Tilearcio Jr., whose father was a firefighter in Engine 266 who worked on ground zero in the months following the attack. His father was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2015 and died in 2017. Mr. Tilearcio Jr., whose father lobbied Capitol Hill for the fund when he was healthy, is awaiting a wrongful death claim that could now be cut in half, which he called “a slap in the face.” The number of compensation claimants has spiked drastically. The special master who oversees the program, Rupa Bhattacharyya, has said that in the fund’s first five years, through 2016, there were 19,000 compensation forms filed. In the two years after that, there were almost 20,000 more. And in January 2019 alone, there were another 4,800 claims. “The stark reality of the data leaves me no choice,” Ms. Bhattacharyya said when announcing the payment cutbacks. The average payout has been $240,000, according to her office, with the average claim for deceased individuals a much higher $682,807. The highest payout was $4.1 million. John Feal, who was a demolition supervisor at ground zero, lost his foot when a giant steel beam crushed it; he has become one of the leading advocates for a permanent victims compensation fund. “People are sick and dying and this is a morbid, perverted game that Congress plays that’s just not right,” said Mr. Feal, who was in Washington this week. “I have people in wheelchairs, people with six months to live and oxygen tanks on this trip.” Mr. Feal is a veteran of these legislative battles. “In 2010, we had to beg. In 2015, we had to ask nicely,” he said. “In 2019, we’re demanding it.” The fate of the new effort in Congress remains unclear. There was bipartisan support on Monday, with Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, and Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, both in attendance at the news conference with Mr. Stewart. In the House, the legislation will go through the House Judiciary Committee, where the chairman, Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat, is supportive. Under the Zadroga Act, the fund was expanded to include recovery workers and those who were near the site of the attacks who have since suffered from illnesses, such as certain cancers, that might be related to exposure to toxins in the dust and debris. “The compensation fund is their apology to us,” said Bridget Gormley, whose father was a Brooklyn-based firefighter who spent the months after the attack at ground zero. He died in 2017 after being diagnosed with bladder cancer and then lung cancer. Ms. Gormley now works with a law firm that advocates for 9/11 compensation claimants and is one herself. Now she faces a large cutback. “They seem to think that cancer works on a timeline and has five-year cycles,” she said of Congress, “and it doesn’t.”",The New York Times
2019,"With India’s Election Looking Close, Modi Packs Budget With Handouts","NEW DELHI — A new pension plan for rickshaw pullers. More money for fisheries. Tax breaks for the middle class and cash handouts to struggling farmers. On Friday, the Indian government announced its budget, and with a major election looming in the next few months, the spending plan was stuffed with financial inducements intended to woo voters, though they will increase India’s debt beyond targets the government itself has set. At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers have been trying to deflect criticism that they tried to bury an official jobs report that showed unemployment at a 45-year high. Mr. Modi came to power five years ago promising to create millions of jobs for India’s 1.3 billion people. The latest numbers, leaked to the Indian news media this week, show that even while India’s total economy has been growing, at an impressive 7 percent rate or even higher, unemployment also has been rising, hitting 6.1 percent. Two top statistics commissioners resigned in protest over what appeared to be a concerted government effort to suppress the jobs report. P. C. Mohanan, a career statistician, was one of them. On Friday, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mohanan said it was “the responsibility of every government to bring out official statistics as public information.” How does the election work? Will Modi win? What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters? “We approved the report to be released, and it did not get released to the public after that,” he said. “I have no idea who decided that report will not be released.” Government economists have tried to defend the decision to withhold the report, saying that it was still a draft and that the jobs data needed to be verified. Newspapers across India carried front-page articles on the controversy. But on Friday, Mr. Mohanan could not have been clearer. “We approved the report,” he repeated. He said that the National Statistical Commission, for which he was the acting chairman, had decided months ago that the report should have been published in December. India is preparing for a hotly contested election that pits Mr. Modi and his Hindu nationalist political party against an increasingly assertive opposition led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion to a storied political dynasty. His father, Rajiv, was prime minister and so was his grandmother Indira, considered the Iron Lady of Indian politics, who loomed over this country for years. Both were assassinated. Mr. Modi still leads in opinion polls against Rahul Gandhi, whose Indian National Congress party was deeply damaged by corruption scandals when it was in power. The party’s identity as a family dynasty — Mr. Gandhi recently tapped his younger sister, Priyanka, as a party leader in a strategic state — has alienated some voters, though others seem energized by Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into politics. She is considered a strong public speaker and a forceful personality. The Congress party is counting on her to appeal to women across caste and religious lines. As the days draw closer to the election, expected to be held in early May, the Congress party is gaining momentum. A race that once seemed a walk for Mr. Modi now seems too close to call. Indian voters are known for suddenly turning against incumbent leaders. India’s political landscape is highly fragmented, like Indian society itself. In the last election, in 2014, more than a dozen political parties, rooted in caste, region or religious beliefs, won seats in Parliament. Most analysts believe neither Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Congress party will win an outright majority. Regional and caste-based parties will probably become the kingmakers, trading their support for central positions in the next government. This is where the farmers come in. Farmers are a huge source of votes in India. More than half of India’s population still depends on agriculture to survive. Recent studies show growing distress in farming communities because of population growth, shrinking plots of land, climate change and high fertilizer prices. Each year, thousands of farmers, despondent over dwindling yields and seemingly endless bills, commit suicide. So few were surprised that one of the signature handouts in Mr. Modi’s budget unveiled on Friday was cash payments to farmers with less than two hectares — about five acres — of land. Under the new program, small-scale farmers will get 6,000 rupees, around $85, in cash. For many farmers, 6,000 rupees is about a month’s earnings. Workers in the informal sector, which includes rickshaw pullers, brick layers, tea sellers, maids, drivers, watchmen and millions of others, also are to be given financial bonuses under the new budget, but it seemed Mr. Modi was especially interested in pleasing farmers. “Our hard-working farmers were not getting the full value of their produce,” Piyush Goyal, Mr. Modi’s acting finance minister, said in his budget speech. “There is a need for providing structured income support to the poor landholder farmer families,” he added. “Such support will help them in avoiding indebtedness as well and falling into clutches of money lenders.” Even so, many farmers were critical, calling the payments insufficient. “They have done a crude joke to farmers,” said Vijay Jawandhia, a farmer leader in Maharashtra, India’s third-largest state. “How will 500 rupees per month remove the distress of farmers?”",The New York Times
2019,"With North Macedonia’s Inclusion, NATO Gets a Boost That Sends a Message","BRUSSELS — The small European country now known as the Republic of North Macedonia may not seem like a significant addition to NATO. But it plugs another gap in what was once the former Soviet Union’s backyard, and comes at a time when East-West tensions are rising. North Macedonia’s inclusion also means NATO will soon have 30 members, all committed to their collective defense. That is double what NATO’s membership was in 1991, when many experts thought the alliance would disband with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. On Wednesday, in a ceremony at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, member countries formally signed a letter of accession for North Macedonia, which should become a full member by year’s end. Political analysts said the addition was a setback for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who sees NATO as an expansionist military force on his country’s doorstep. Mr. Putin has for many years argued that NATO is no longer needed because, he says, Russia poses no threat. But with Russia openly working to restore its influence in the former Soviet sphere, most vividly in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine, NATO is an attractive club for small nations like North Macedonia. “One of Putin’s main hopes has been that NATO would go away or become fragmented,” said Stephen J. Flanagan, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation in Washington. North Macedonia’s accession, he said, “kind of undermines the Russian narrative.” More worrisome to some NATO supporters may be President Trump, who has complained vocally that other member countries do not spend enough on defense. He has referred to the alliance as “obsolete” and even threatened to withdraw. Mr. Trump also evidently worries that small NATO nations in difficult neighborhoods could drag the United States into war under the alliance’s collective security provision known as Article V: an attack against one is an attack against all. In July, Mr. Trump suggested that NATO’s 29th member, Montenegro, a country of 600,000 people that he described as “very aggressive,” could start World War III. Mr. Trump’s views raised questions about whether he was committed to coming to the aid of another NATO member state if it were attacked. Torrey Taussig, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who is based in Berlin, said that even though the Trump administration put a fair amount of diplomatic support behind the Macedonian pathway to NATO, doubts about Mr. Trump’s commitment to Article V have not gone away. “When that central node of deterrence gets called into question, every NATO member state’s security gets called into question with it — whether NATO were to have 10, 30 or 50 members,” she said. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the American ambassador to NATO, has said the United States “strongly supports” membership of North Macedonia and its 2.1 million people. In addition, Congress and the Pentagon remain committed to an alliance that supporters have long credited for helping keep the peace in Europe and deterring Moscow for the past seven decades. Only last month, the House of Representatives resoundingly passed a bipartisan measure, by a vote of 357 to 22, to prohibit the Trump administration from using federal funds to pull the United States out of NATO, rebuking the president for his frequent attacks against the alliance and for suggesting he might seek to withdraw. Russia’s efforts to sow discord in the alliance have been evident in the Balkans, where it has been promoting its influence in the former Yugoslavia, which both of the newest NATO members were a part of. Russia was accused of trying to overthrow the government of Montenegro in October 2016, for example, in a last-ditch effort to stop the country from joining NATO. In August, Greece angrily accused Russia of meddling before an important vote in the Greek Parliament on a name change for Macedonia that would clear the way for its accession to NATO. Greece, which has historically enjoyed cordial relations with Russia because of their Eastern Orthodox constituencies, expelled four Russian diplomats. Despite those setbacks to Russia, it continues to exert significant influence in Serbia, where Mr. Putin just made a state visit and where Russia has major interests in infrastructure. The persistent dispute between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo, which Serbia and Russia refuse to recognize as an independent state, has kept Kosovo from applying to join NATO. Nikola Dimitrov, North Macedonia’s foreign minister, said NATO membership would place the country in “a zone of stability in a region that still has pockets of uncertainty.” Membership was so valuable to the country that it agreed after years of negotiations with Greece, a NATO member, to change its name from the Republic of Macedonia. The Greeks argued that they already had a northern territory called Macedonia, that historically, Alexander the Great was Greek — Alexander of Macedon — and that the ancient kingdom of Macedonia sits within modern Greece. Until the name change, Greece had vetoed Macedonian membership in NATO, much to the annoyance of the rest of the alliance. The name issue had for years kept the Macedonians from trying to join the European Union as well, since, like NATO it also operates by consensus. Only now that Greece has lifted its veto can actual accession talks to the European Union begin. “This really is a big moment,” said Stevo Pendarovski, a Macedonian official who is the coordinator of the country’s NATO accession efforts. While NATO is proud of its expansion, NATO members remain wary of Mr. Trump’s anger and his habit of interrupting the proceedings for disquisitions on the failings of his allies, which was on display at the last NATO summit meeting, in July. This April is the 70th anniversary of the alliance, which would normally be celebrated in a summit meeting of all NATO leaders in Washington. This year there will be no such gathering in Washington, but a meeting instead of foreign ministers.",The New York Times
2019,"With Northam Picture, Obscure Publication Plays Big Role in Virginia Politics","A racist photograph on the 1984 yearbook page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia. An accusation of sexual assault against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax. Both reports — the first triggering an earthquake in Virginia politics last week, the second setting off an aftershock on Monday — were originally published by an obscure right-wing news site, Big League Politics, which has promoted conspiracy theories and written favorably about white nationalist candidates. But as mainstream news outlets scrambled to confirm the photograph on Mr. Northam’s medical school yearbook page on Friday, it became clear that Big League Politics — and its mission of promoting the Trump agenda and nationalist causes — had assumed outsized influence in an increasingly Democratic state. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] The website has dealt a severe blow to Mr. Northam, who first admitted to posing for the photograph, then reversed himself and has refused to resign despite enormous pressure from fellow Democrats in Virginia and around the nation, throwing his state’s politics into a crisis. A cloud also now hangs over the head of Mr. Fairfax, who would succeed Mr. Northam if he resigns, after Big League Politics published unsubstantiated accusations that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. Big League Politics is a relatively new entry to the constellation of right-wing media outlets that sprung up during Donald Trump’s rise, and until the bombshell yearbook report, its readership had remained small. Patrick Howley, the editor in chief, said he received the photograph showing a pair of figures in blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes from a “concerned citizen,” declining to add more details. But one of Big League Politics’s owners, Noel Fritsch, described the source of the photograph as “some people who were classmates of Northam,” who brought it to light out of anger at the governor’s remarks early last week defending late-term abortions. In its mission statement, Big League Politics purports to be “not conservative” and “not liberal,” but it has trafficked in conspiracy theories favored by the far right, like the case of Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose murder in Washington was falsely seized on by conservative commentators as linked to WikiLeaks. And Mr. Fritsch, a North Carolina-based political consultant, has worked for Paul Nehlen, an anti-Semitic Wisconsin congressional candidate who challenged former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers. Last year, Mr. Fritsch was fired as a top aide by Corey Stewart, the Republican senatorial nominee in Virginia, after reports of anti-Muslim comments he had made on social media, as well as saying Senator John McCain “sold all his comrades down the river” as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Mr. Howley, before hanging up his own agitprop shingle, had a rocky tour of duty at some of Washington’s leading conservative news organizations. Provocation is a stock-in-trade for right-wing writers in Washington, but former colleagues said Mr. Howley’s behavior, in public tweets and private emails, went beyond mischief and into darker territory. His tenure at The Daily Caller, then overseen by Tucker Carlson, was marred by a vicious online attack directed at a female reporter for BuzzFeed News; Mr. Howley later apologized. Later, at Breitbart News, Mr. Howley earned colleagues’ ire when he questioned the credibility of Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter who said she was assaulted by Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at a Florida rally. Mr. Howley, 29, co-founded Big League Politics in 2017, after deciding that Breitbart, which had aggressively backed Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, had gone soft. “They got very scared after Trump actually won, which I think the management was not expecting, out of concern for what people would think and toned things down for a while,” he said. In an article in The Daily Caller in 2017, Mr. Howley called the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has claimed the Sandy Hook school massacre was faked, as “basically my Walter Cronkite now.’’ On Sunday night, Big League Politics was the first to publish the accusations the woman aimed at Mr. Fairfax, after they had been privately circulated by both Democrats and Republicans in Richmond, according to people who were sent a screen shot of a private Facebook post by the woman. On Monday, The Washington Post said it had been aware of the accusation for more than a year, and had investigated but declined to publish a story because it could not corroborate the woman’s account or find people she had told about the alleged assault. Mr. Howley defended running the story without trying to verify its truthfulness. “The fact The Washington Post did not run that despite in other cases running things about Brett Kavanaugh and other people based on thinner sourcing is, I think, a dereliction of duty,” he said. In an overnight response to the story, Mr. Fairfax’s office denied the woman’s accusation and added, “Tellingly, not one other reputable media outlet has seen fit to air this false claim.” Mainstream Republican operatives said Big League Politics, and similar sites, are friendly places for candidates and campaigns to leak damaging research about political opponents without their fingerprints showing and without the kind of independent scrubbing done in the mainstream press. “They don’t practice journalism in the traditional sense of trying to tell the story from both sides; they speak to their audience, which is far-right base conservatives and ethno-state types,” said a Republican consultant who has worked extensively in Virginia politics, and asked to remain anonymous to protect professional relationships. Mr. Fritsch, who acquired an ownership interest in Big League Politics in 2018 with another North Carolina-based consultant, Reilly O’Neal, described the mission differently: “To rip off the mask of the corporate media,” he said, adding that “many conservative media, so-called conservative members of the media had evidence that was easily verifiable of Ralph Northam’s racism.” In December, the site received about 550,000 unique visitors, a pittance in the world of online news. The site averaged about 500,000 readers in the last half of 2018, compared to an average of 7.4 million for Breitbart News, according to statistics from comScore.",The New York Times
2019,"With Paul Goldschmidt, the Cardinals Try to Recreate a Formula That Worked","On Baseball The St. Louis Cardinals went three long seasons without a playoff berth. To rouse themselves from this interminable slumber, they traded for a former All-Star who had played his entire career for a West division team, winning multiple Gold Gloves but never reaching the World Series. The player was facing the end of his contract, but the Cardinals hoped to persuade him to stay for many years. This is true of Paul Goldschmidt now. Nineteen years ago, it was true for Jim Edmonds. The latter partnership worked quite well: Edmonds, who had come up with the Angels, signed a long-term contract during his first season in St. Louis, led the Cardinals to a division title and eventually helped them win a World Series. The Gold Gloves and All-Star selections kept coming for Edmonds, who earned the coveted red sports coat last summer as a member of the team’s Hall of Fame. “It’s Cardinal baseball, it’s the Midwest, it’s one of the best places to play in the country, and you find that out from Day 1,” said Edmonds, now a guest instructor and broadcaster for the Cardinals. “It’s a different time, a different era and I don’t know what the players are going through now, but hopefully he likes it and blends in. It’s also an organizational thing, too. Do they really want to keep him, and how does he play this year?” The Cardinals, who last reached the postseason in 2015, very much want to keep Goldschmidt, a six-time All-Star first baseman with three Gold Gloves. They acquired him from the Arizona Diamondbacks last Dec. 5 for pitcher Luke Weaver, catcher Carson Kelly, infielder Andy Young and a draft pick, finally landing the high-impact slugger they’ve been missing. “Anytime you complete a deal, there’s always some level of satisfaction, especially this magnitude of player — but, really, the excitement’s going to come when he gets introduced at Busch Stadium,” said John Mozeliak, the Cardinals’ president of baseball operations. “There’s a lot leading up to that, but I think he’s going to realize that St. Louis is a very special place and ultimately one that we want him to someday call home.” Mozeliak has not yet spoken with Goldschmidt or his agent, Casey Close, about a contract extension — “Both sides will know when the time is right,” he said — and Goldschmidt declined to comment on his future. Any answer he could give would be incomplete, because he has not yet experienced life as a Cardinal. The team has finished second in the National League in attendance in each of the last six seasons — behind the Los Angeles Dodgers — and has a 15-year streak of drawing at least 3 million fans. The Diamondbacks have not reached 3 million fans since 2002, when Goldschmidt was a high school freshman near Houston. “There’s a ton of support for the Cardinals organization, for the players there,” Goldschmidt said. “They love their team. There’s high expectations from the fans, and rightfully so. Hopefully we’ll play well, give them a good show and find a way to win a lot of games.” The Cardinals last won the World Series eight years ago, a fact they emphasized on printouts taped by the clubhouse door Monday, when they held their first full-squad workout of spring training. The sheet listed a few goals — “trust, prepare, execute, celebrate” — and included three columns of championship years, with a conspicuously blank line beneath 2011. Only one player from that World Series roster, catcher Yadier Molina, remains on the team. The Cardinals have stayed above .500 ever since — and even won a pennant in 2013 — but rivals have passed them by. “It’s tough, man,” said second baseman Kolten Wong, who has played six seasons in St. Louis. “For me, all I knew when I first got to the big leagues was playoffs every single year. To go from that to not making it the past three years, I’m itching to get back. Everyone deserves to get back, and our fans deserve it more.” In the seven seasons since 2011 — Albert Pujols’s last in St. Louis before signing with the Angels as a free agent — no Cardinals player has hit 30 home runs with a .900 on-base plus slugging percentage in the same season. This has been done 67 times in those seasons by 39 different players — including four times by Goldschmidt. Yet Goldschmidt, 31, is more than a power hitter. He has a .297 career average and five seasons of at least 15 stolen bases, plus the three Gold Gloves. Before reporting to camp, he spoke with coaches on the phone about the finer points of base running. “He actually initiated those, and they’re not short conversations, and they’re not forced,” Manager Mike Shildt said. “He loves it, he’s a baseball guy, and he’s got the details.” The Cardinals turned to Shildt, an organizational lifer, after firing Mike Matheny as manager last July. The players responded with a late push for a playoff spot, finishing with 88 victories and a renewed sense of identity. As an organization well-known for attention to fundamentals, it was startling for the Cardinals to lead the majors in errors. Yet they committed in the second half to strong defenders like Wong at second and Harrison Bader in center field, and in the winter they stabilized their bullpen with a two-year, $25 million deal for Andrew Miller. Wherever he has gone recently — Boston, Baltimore, the Yankees, Cleveland — Miller’s teams have made the playoffs. The Cardinals have their three-year drought, but Miller has a six-year streak. He believes it will continue. “When you’re at the stage of your career that I am, that’s where you tend to find yourself,” Miller said. “The teams that seek you out, that’s their intention: ‘Not next year, not five years down the road, but this year.’” This year — for now — is the extent of the Cardinals’ future with Goldschmidt. In time, their owners will put a value on how much they want to keep him. On opening day in St. Louis, the fans will start their effort, too. “Talking about it is hard to sell,” Mozeliak said. “But experiencing it is different.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Procedural Maneuver, House G.O.P. Elevates Anti-Semitism as Political Issue","WASHINGTON — The House voted unanimously on Wednesday to condemn anti-Semitism and “all attempts to delegitimize and deny Israel’s right to exist,” adopting language put forth by Republicans who have spent weeks trying to paint two freshman Democrats as anti-Semites and dozens of other Democrats as their enablers. The surprise vote attached the nonbinding resolution to an unrelated measure demanding an end to American support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. Republicans, taking advantage of a procedural rule that permits them to move to send a bill back to committee, attached the anti-Semitism language to the motion. Democrats, led by one of their most prominent Jewish members, Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, accepted it. Every member of the House voted in favor, except for two Republicans who voted present: Representatives Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who said the measure should not clutter a War Powers Resolution. (Republicans agreed that the bill would not be sent back to committee.) The anti-Semitism resolution comes two days after Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the entire Democratic leadership condemned Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, and forced her to apologize for a Twitter post in which she insinuated that American support for Israel is fueled by money from donors and pressure from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group known as Aipac. But Democratic leaders are losing patience with a continuing campaign by Republicans to smear Democrats as anti-Semitic when some of their own leaders — including President Trump — have trafficked their own anti-Semitic tropes and failed to renounce anti-Semitic followers. “She apologized for her remarks,” Ms. Pelosi said of Ms. Omar. “I’m still waiting for some of the Republicans to apologize for their ‘Jew-S-A’ chants that they had at their rallies right in front of the president’s face, and he never rejected that.” “They don’t have clean hands on this. A newcomer member of Congress has apologized for her remarks. It took them, what, 13 years to notice Steve King?” Ms. Pelosi continued, referring to the Iowa Republican recently stripped of his committee posts for embracing white supremacy. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Ms. Omar and another freshman Democrat, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, as anti-Semitic, citing remarks that both have made on Twitter. They have been deeply critical of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. The resolution does not mention either woman by name. But it expresses opposition to the movement to boycott, divest from and impose sanctions on Israel — known as the B.D.S. movement — that they support. The National Republican Congressional Committee blasted out emails on Wednesday insinuating that two freshman House Democrats, Elaine Luria of Virginia and Mike Levin of California, were covering for Ms. Omar’s anti-Semitism. Ms. Luria is Jewish, and Mr. Levin has spoken openly about the anti-Semitism faced by his paternal grandparents. Democrats say Republicans are being hypocritical. They note that the Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, was himself accused of anti-Semitism in the fall when he said the Jewish billionaires George Soros, Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer were trying to buy the election. “We are still waiting for an apology” from Mr. McCarthy, Representative Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told reporters on Wednesday. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Democratic leader, echoed her point, adding that Mr. Trump routinely makes offensive comments — such as his recent tweet making light of the Trail of Tears, the genocidal removal of Indians from their homelands — while Republicans remain silent. Mr. Trump, too, has been accused of anti-Semitism. When he was running for office, he posted a tweet showing Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, on a pile of money and a Star of David, calling her the “most corrupt candidate ever!” He later deleted the tweet amid an outcry from those who said he was playing into the anti-Semitic trope about Jews using their money to wield influence. The latest war of words over anti-Semitism on Capitol Hill is making some Jewish leaders increasingly uneasy. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish lobbying group, said in a recent interview that he worries that charges of anti-Semitism are being thrown around lightly. “This pattern of overheated, ill-considered and reductive attacks, playing out on social media and in the press, has failed to address these issues with the nuance, sensitivity and seriousness that they deserve,” Mr. Ben-Ami said Monday in a statement, after Ms. Omar apologized. “It does nothing to advance the true interests and needs of Israelis or Palestinians, nor those of the American Jewish community.” But Aipac praised the vote: “We applaud the overwhelming, bipartisan rejection of anti-Semitism and B.D.S. by the House of Representatives today.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Savings to Burn, Russia Turns (Again) to a State-Led Spending Plan","MOSCOW — Russia has become a world-class saver. So much gold has piled up in its central bank that Russia surpassed China last year to become the world’s fifth-largest holder of gold. The International Monetary Fund often has to badger developing nations to bulk up foreign currency reserves. Russia has $472 billion in reserves, more than the country’s combined public and foreign debt of $453 billion and nearly three times what the I.M.F. recommends. Economists don’t consider either of these eye-popping sums of savings a good thing. They reflect, in part, how investment has lagged in Russia and how Western sanctions have dulled its economy. But the lode is also making for an odd back-to-the-future moment of state-directed economic activity as Russia shifts policy and aims to spend about $100 billion on big infrastructure projects. The new drive, promoted last month at an economic forum paradoxically named for Yegor T. Gaidar, a former prime minister who championed privatization, is a full-throttle build-and-spend effort to rev Russia’s way to stable growth. Oligarchs are among the businessmen who have been publicly ordered to rally, with moneyed enthusiasm, behind the plan. Known by the mouthful National Goals and Strategic Objective of the Russian Federation Until 2024, the program is not called a “five-year plan,” the centralized tool that the Soviet Union relied on to set economic goals and direct state spending. But it will last five years, with the first outlays expected in the first half of this year. “Nobody is hiding it now,” said Aleksandr Abramov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics who attended the forum. “State spending is the economic theme of 2019.” Clemens Grafe, the chief Russia economist at Goldman Sachs, described it as “a very different development model” from what Russia has pursued for years under President Vladimir V. Putin. The government, he said, is shifting from encouraging consumer spending with public-sector pay increases to pouring money into roads, ports and hospitals. Since 2014, the year of its disputed annexation of Crimea, which spurred Western reprisals, Russia has languished in recession or realized only minuscule growth. The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2018, the state statistics agency said on Monday. At the same time, the Russian government and companies have accumulated vast savings. By law, taxes from the export of oil, which has been keeping the economy afloat, must be saved when the price is above $40 per barrel, so money is ending up in sovereign wealth funds. American and European sanctions have also, paradoxically, fattened Russia’s piggy bank. The sanctions prevented the country’s largest banks and oil companies from rolling over loans from Western banks, so companies paid down debt as it came due, a process known as deleveraging. The result has been a piling up of savings and little investment. “They are pulling resources out of the economy,” Mr. Grafe, the Goldman economist, said. The goal of the new program is to increase capital investments to 25 percent of gross domestic product, from about 20 percent today. Mr. Putin is promoting this, and his minister of finance, Anton G. Siluanov, told an audience of economists at the Gaidar Forum that the state was enforcing a new style of management. “Our current situation is different from the previous six years in that we are now building a vertically integrated system of management,” Mr. Siluanov said. “It will come from the top and go to the bottom.” Tweaks to tax, pension and budget policy will fund the investment projects. Russia last year reduced pension spending by elevating the retirement age by five years and raised its value-added tax by two percentage points starting this year, to 20 percent, both shifts meant to free up money for infrastructure spending. Parliament in recent months changed the law imposing a balanced primary budget, or the budget before interest costs, to allow a deficit of 0.5 percent of gross domestic product when oil prices are above the $40 per barrel reference price, a measure also intended to increase spending. Government officials say they have been consulting with business owners and requesting detailed investment plans. It’s not clear whether this will go smoothly or advance with fear and bullying. The Kremlin expects wealthy businessmen to respond to its policies with what it defines as patriotism — and to resist has been disastrous, financially and personally, for some. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, once Russia’s richest man, spent a decade in prison after financing the political opposition and arguing against higher oil taxes. Just before the Gaidar Forum, Aleksei A. Mordashov, the principal shareholder and chairman of the Russian steel company Severstal, wrote in an opinion piece that he and fellow industrialists should join in willingly. They should not “point to foreign difficulties and not delay investments and transforming your companies ‘until better times,’” he wrote in Vedomosti, a Russian business newspaper. Mr. Mordashov announced a plan to invest $1.4 billion annually in his steel mills. Other Russian industrialists have also quietly increased their spending plans, suggesting the arm twisting is working. Economists, though, are cautioning that greater government involvement in the economy is a rake Russia has stepped on before. “They say: ‘The government has the money. The government will pay, for everything,’” said Yuri Danilov, a research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences. “This is a very detrimental school of thought.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Shutdown Looming, Border Deal Is Reached ‘in Principle’","WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators on Monday night agreed in principle to provide $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the Mexican border, part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding President Trump’s wall. The agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing, with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns, according to two congressional aides, who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations. That is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel-and-concrete wall that Mr. Trump demanded — and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer, before Democrats took control of the House. The deal, which must still pass the House and the Senate, and secure Mr. Trump’s signature, came together just before Mr. Trump, framed by banners emblazoned with “Finish the Wall” at an event in El Paso, doubled down on his demands. “We’re building the wall anyway,” he told the crowd, saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress. The funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had demanded and marginally less than the $1.6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed last year. In December, the president, concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise, refused to sign onto that legislation, forcing the nation’s longest government shutdown. The negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention. Democrats’ demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the United States had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend, but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand. Instead, lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels, set by a number of detention beds, established in the previous budget. That would fund 40,520 beds, a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps. Privately, Democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ICE assigned for detainees. There is nothing to prevent Trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number, and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses, as ICE officials have done routinely in recent years, the aides said. Beyond the border barriers, the agreement, which primarily funds the Department of Homeland Security, would provide $1.7 billion more for border security, including technology at ports of entry, more officers and humanitarian aid. Here’s how much the proposed border deal would add to existing barriers. [Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.] The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees announced the agreement, which includes seven unfinished spending bills, after three private meetings on Monday. Disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included, and lawmakers said they would address it separately. It is expected to be finalized as early as Tuesday, well before the Friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies. With fears of another damaging shutdown, lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that Mr. Trump would be willing to sign the agreement. “We think so,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the president’s signature. “We hope so.” “The specter of another government shutdown this close, I thought tonight we didn’t want that to happen,” he added later. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had urged him to “get it done” in negotiations, Mr. Shelby said. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she had been in close communication with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and expected her support. “She has confidence that I made the right decision,” Ms. Lowey told reporters. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement, and the president’s conservative allies on Monday night were already denouncing the deal. Sean Hannity, a Fox News commentator and a confidant of the president’s, called it “a garbage compromise.” Pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that Mr. Trump would declare a national emergency, something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding. But Republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold. “This has been a difficult one,” said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. “I think everyone will say, ‘Good work.’” A specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ICE, which had stalled talks over the weekend. House Democrats, urged on by immigration rights groups, had pushed hard, hoping to leverage White House fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the president’s hard-line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families, wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official American immigration policy. The Democrats’ goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds, including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border, from its current level of around 49,000 to 34,000, the number funded during the Obama administration, Democratic aides said. That, they say, would end sweeps and roundups, and force ICE to focus on pursuing hardened criminals. “We started at zero on the wall, and we compromised a lot after that, and we are now asking them to change, too,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and a member of the 17-member House and Senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise. Mr. Trump caught on. When Mr. Shelby presented him with the Democrats’ demand, he rejected it quickly, according to two people briefed on the exchange. “These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don’t want in our country,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday. “That’s why they don’t want to give us what we call ‘the beds.’ It’s much more complicated than beds, but we call them ‘the beds.’” In private, Republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap, including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes, including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies. That, in turn, was rejected by Democrats. “You have ICE agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods. That’s why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall,” said Ms. Roybal-Allard, whose Los Angeles-area district is 85 percent Hispanic, the highest percentage of any district in the country. The number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time, influenced by a variety of factors, including ICE enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with Mexico. The rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border, crime, gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from Mexico and Central America to California and the Southwest. The number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25,000 to 40,000 for most of the past decade, but has risen to about 50,000 over the past several months, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Homeland Security. If ICE does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain, they must loosen their enforcement actions, creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally, Trump administration officials say. “You cannot have border security, without strong interior enforcement, whether there is a wall there or not,” said Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, on Monday in a conference call with reporters. Republicans closed ranks to blast the plan. “This is a poison pill that no administration, not this one, not the previous one, should ever accept,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Imagine the absurdity of this: House Democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Trump’s Tough Deterrents, Many Asylum Seekers on the Border are Giving Up","TIJUANA, Mexico — Pushed beyond their limits by prolonged waits in dangerous and squalid conditions in parts of Northern Mexico, thousands of caravan members who had been waiting to seek asylum in the United States appear to have given up, Mexican officials said, dealing President Trump an apparent win after a humbling week for his immigration agenda. About 6,000 asylum seekers who had traveled en masse, many of them in defiance of Mr. Trump’s demands that they turn around, arrived in Northern Mexico in late November as part of a caravan that originated in Honduras. Since then, more than 1,000 have accepted an offer to be returned home by the Mexican government, the officials said. Another 1,000 have decided to stay in Mexico, accepting work permits that were offered to them last fall, at the height of international consternation over how to deal with the growing presence of migrant caravans. Mr. Trump resorted on Friday to declaring a national emergency after he failed to secure funding from Congress for a border wall that he said would block migrants from entering the United States. But the data from Mexican officials suggested that harsh policies he has introduced to crack down on asylum seekers may already be achieving some of its intended effects. Added this week to new policies that are bearing down on asylum seekers — which include tight limits on the number of people who can apply for the status each day and a heightened standard of proof to qualify — was the extension of a rule that certain asylum seekers must wait in Mexico for the full duration of their legal cases, which can take years. [Read the first edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.] The requirement originally applied only to adults, but the Department of Homeland Security expanded it to include families with children as well. Among those who have been dissuaded, at least for now, is Natali, 32, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she feared for her safety. Speaking from her modest apartment atop a steep hill in western Tijuana, she explained that she and her husband had fled their home in El Progreso, Honduras, after she witnessed a murder carried out by a local criminal gang. Soon after, she began to receive threats in the mail warning her to keep quiet. Once in Mexico, they heard about the increasingly long odds of receiving asylum in the United States, and feared more than anything that officials there would return them to their home country. Rather than crossing the border, they decided to seek humanitarian visas to remain in Mexico legally for at least one year, and have slowly begun to build a life. She still believes she might ask for asylum in the United States, but is realistic about her chances. “I like Tijuana,” she said. “It’s a very pretty city and there’s a lot of work.” More than anything, she fears the United States would deport her back to Honduras. Mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given up their quest for asylum in the United States reinforced an idea that is often raised by Mr. Trump: that many caravan members are not truly desperate for protection. “What happened is that many people came on an adventure, trying their luck,” said Cesar Palencia, Tijuana’s chief of migrant services. “When they realized that it was hard to cross and the conditions in Mexico were also difficult, among many factors, they decided to return home.” The Honduran caravan ballooned in size as it swept through impoverished villages, drawing a swarm of national media attention and an eclectic mix of participants. Many came from poverty, lacking education and resources, and said they were unfamiliar with the complex set of laws that would ultimately determine who would be granted legal status in the United States, and who would not. Immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers. But they pointed to the roughly 4,000 members who had successfully entered the United States and had at least requested protected status to argue that most had legitimate claims. Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, warned that while Mr. Trump’s tough policies may discourage the undeserving, they might also endanger people who need protection. She said they would likely drive vulnerable migrants into the arms of human traffickers, who promise to provide passage into the United States. “It may look like it’s working in the short term,” Ms. Brané said, “But I don’t think it’s a long-term solution. It’s driving people further into the shadows and that’s exactly the opposite of what we want.” When they arrived in Mexico, many of the caravan members had been living in squalor, sleeping in tents or lean-tos inside the Benito Juárez sports complex. A downpour devastated the grounds, and those who remained fled to a new expansive shelter called Barretal on the outskirts of Tijuana. Once packed with 2,500 people, that location also recently closed because it had shrunk to fewer than 200. “It is not the same as when we had Barretal and Benito Juárez,” said Esme Flores, an immigrant-rights advocate at the San Diego office of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It really feels that the population has moved on.” On Friday, all that remained of the formerly bustling migrant quarter around the Barretal shelter was a small camp around the corner, only partially covered by a tin roof. The conditions are far from comfortable, but the occupants said it was better than sleeping on sidewalks. Most were not yet ready to give up trying to enter the United States, but knew of others who had. Elde Rodriguez, 26, said he had left Honduras hoping to send money back to his wife and daughter. Believing that he would not qualify for asylum, he tried last week to cross the border illegally but he and a friend were unable to find their away across and turned back. “There’s enough work here in Mexico, and you can live on that if you’re alone. But you can’t make enough to send money home, and that’s the point about all this,” he said. “If I can’t get in, I’ll just keep trying.” While Tijuana appears to be emptying, large groups of migrants have accumulated in other areas along the border as a result of the new policies. After a riot the day before, authorities in Mexico said on Friday that they would disband a group of 1,400 Central American asylum seekers who had been waiting in the city of Piedras Negras to cross the border into Eagle Pass, Tex., according to news reports. The Trump administration has said that the latest policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, which it called Migrant Protection Protocols, is a vital response to a crisis at the border. Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has said the policy aims to alleviate a humanitarian crisis on the border and secure the United States. Introduced as a pilot program across the border from San Diego, the administration plans to expand the policy into Texas. Border Patrol apprehensions of families along the southwest border remain near all-time highs, though there was a slight downward turn in January, as is often the case, according the latest government figures. Customs and Border Protection said more than 1,800 Central American parents and children crossed the border illegally on Monday, the largest number of families recorded on a single day. And like other asylum policies of this administration, the “remain in Mexico” policy has already drawn legal scrutiny, leaving its future uncertain. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and two other groups sued the administration on behalf of 11 asylum seekers who were required to wait in Mexico, claiming that the policy, which was introduced last month at the San Ysidro port of entry, near San Diego, violates United States and international laws. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador who feared for their lives in Mexico, according to the complaint. One of them was robbed at gunpoint and told by the assailant that he would be killed if he was seen again. Two others said that they had been threatened by local residents wielding rocks or sticks. Another plaintiff said he had to bribe a police officer to avoid arrest. “Asylum seekers in Mexico face a heightened risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, sexual assault and murder, among other harms,” said the complaint. In December, the A.C.L.U. successfully sued the administration over another new rule that became known as the “asylum ban” because it significantly restricted the locations where people could request the status. That policy remains enjoined by a federal court; the Supreme Court declined to reinstate it. Like members of the caravan, many of those who continue to come to the United States each day lack a comprehensive understanding of the system they are entering. Ela Marina Rodriguez, 49, and her daughter, Duña Ventura, 16, arrived in Tijuana about three weeks ago and were taken to the small shelter by a man whom they had been traveling with. Ms. Rodriguez said she had heard on the news that bringing her daughter would guarantee them admission into the United States, and the two thought if they could make it through the journey they would have an opportunity for a better life. “That’s why we came all this way,” she said. “I’ve dreamed of doing this my entire life but I was afraid. Hiding through the desert and the mountains, I never had the courage before, until we heard they were giving papers to families.” Her eyes grew wide when she heard from a reporter that some asylum seekers are being made to wait in Mexico. She sighed heavily and replied: “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t want to be here.” Ms. Rodriguez said that “honestly, yes” she would cross illegally if that is what it takes to get into the United States. But if she is unable to gain entry to the United States, she said, she would likely turn back to Honduras. “I mean, what else can you do in that case?”",The New York Times
2019,"With a Trump Ally Taking the Gavel, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Goes Quiet","WASHINGTON — Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee used his perch atop the storied Foreign Relations Committee to offer barbed criticisms of the president’s foreign policy, once acidly referring to the White House as an “adult day care center” that would set the nation on a path to World War III. For two years, the committee served as an arena for senators to air their grievances with President Trump’s isolationist foreign policy, as Mr. Corker strove to take his place among the powerhouses who once wielded the gavel — Henry Clay, Charles Sumner, Henry Cabot Lodge, Arthur H. Vandenberg, J. William Fulbright, Frank Church, Joseph R. Biden Jr., John Kerry and Richard Lugar. Its new chairman, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, appears intent on taking the committee in a new direction. “My repertoire does not include sparring publicly with the president of the United States,” Mr. Risch told the Idaho Press newspaper last month. “For many, many different reasons, I think that’s counterproductive, and you won’t see me doing it.” He added, “We exchange ideas about how we feel on things, but when we do disagree, we do it face to face, and not on the front page of The New York Times.” Mr. Risch, a former trial lawyer and current cattle rancher, has taken the gavel of the vaunted committee as dissatisfaction among Senate Republicans with the president’s foreign policy has only mounted. In December, Senate Republicans publicly broke with the president to approve a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. This month, they were even more emphatic, voting almost unanimously to express their disapproval of his abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan. House Republicans voted overwhelmingly last month to bar an American exit from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had expressed an interest in shattering the alliance. But none of those issues have merited a hearing before the new Senate Foreign Relations Committee or a sharp word from the new chairman. A spokeswoman for Mr. Risch explained that while he takes seriously the committee’s oversight role, he is confident that he has the president’s ear on matters of foreign policy; he believes he is more effective when he raises his concerns with Mr. Trump privately on concerns where they may differ. “He’ll be addressing a lot of key issues,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a committee member, said, expressing confidence in Mr. Risch. Besides, Mr. Portman added, “members are independent actors, and we’re all going to speak up and let our views be known.” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and another committee member, hit on the same point: “I understand that Chairman Risch has a different style and approach perhaps than Chairman Corker did, but I am determined that the committee will be no less effective.” Some foreign policy experts say even Mr. Corker was derelict in his duty to turn acerbic comments into real oversight or legislation. Under Mr. Risch, even the words might go silent. And that will have real consequences. Leveraging the committee’s oversight power is “a critical element of getting to the right place,” said Wendy R. Sherman, an under secretary of state and acting deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama. “I’m not saying that Senator Risch should be combative with the president, but where there is disagreement, we rely on the U.S. Senate,” Ms. Sherman said. “They can take the long view, and for them to defer to the president on everything really undermines the strength of that committee and the historic role that it’s played.” Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former policy staffer at the State Department under President George W. Bush, said, “It’s not enough simply to make, as Bob Corker did pretty frequently, made-for-TV sound bites expressing alarm or discomfort about U.S. policy unless there’s going to be substantive hearings about the wisdom of those choices.” He added, “The danger with Mr. Risch is that we are going to get neither expressions of alarm when the administration is off track, nor effective oversight.” Allies of the new chairman describe him as a workhorse, not a showhorse. But on policy, Mr. Trump has a friend at the helm of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Risch has broken with the president on occasion, joining his colleagues to protest Mr. Trump’s appetite for leaving the Atlantic alliance, and taking an aggressive stance on Russia. But after The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump disclosed classified information provided by Israel to the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Risch told CNN: “There’s a weasel here and the weasel is not the president of the United States. It’s the traitor who disclosed these facts to The Washington Post.” While he joined his peers in voting for a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, which warned the president of the dangers of a “precipitous withdrawal” of troops from Syria and Afghanistan, he took to the Senate floor to chastise news outlets for “badly mischaracterizing” the measure as a rebuke to Mr. Trump. Instead, he said, it commended the president “for all the things he’s been able to do in Syria in getting ISIS contained down to the very small area that remains.” And he has remained sanguine about the president’s ability to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, telling PBS NewsHour over the summer that Mr. Trump “should be given credit” for the work he had already accomplished. “The president is committed to seeing this through, and as such we should all remember that negotiations involve both public and private diplomacy,” Mr. Risch said in a statement. “Sometimes that means there will be public posturing on both sides, but I hope we can all give the president space to continue to move us in the right direction with North Korea.” Mr. Risch will have his issues, but they are likely to dovetail with President Trump’s. He intends to delve into “the very real threat China poses to U.S. business and interests,” he said in a statement. And he is likely to join another member of the committee, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, in taking an aggressive stand challenging the regime of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. In the House, Democrats will be more than happy to fulfill that oversight mandate, and have already listed a series of investigations that the House Foreign Affairs Committee might oversee, including scrutinizing accusations that Mr. Trump hid details of his meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from the public and his own staff. But without a partner in the Senate, that committee’s legislative work can only go so far. That has Senate Democrats already expressing frustration. At a time when “our allies are questioning our commitments and our adversaries are relishing the chaos the administration’s policies have borne,” Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said, it “can be constructive” to suggest alternatives to the administration’s current policies. “I understand that Senator Risch has said he won’t be taking on the president publicly, but there are times when both on the jurisdiction of your committee and on the issues you truly believe, you can shape the direction of things,” Mr. Menendez added. “It can be constructive"" to make your thoughts known.",The New York Times
2019,"With or Without Bryce Harper, the Phillies Like Their Winter Haul","On Baseball CLEARWATER, Fla. — Bryce Harper will soon be the most scrutinized athlete in Philadelphia, or the most hated. Neither role sounds fun. If he signs a record contract with the Phillies, Harper will be both hailed as a savior and held to nearly impossible standards. If he signs somewhere else, he will be a pariah. Maybe Harper simply wants no part of the Phillies, or maybe he is just waiting for their owner, John Middleton, to blow past the 10-year, $300 million agreement Manny Machado reached this week with the San Diego Padres. As Harper and his agent, Scott Boras, take their time, the Phillies are not dangling a blank check. “The most important things for any organization is to have continuity and a consensus from ownership through management,” Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak said on Wednesday in his office at Spectrum Field after a long day of meetings. “We know what we’re willing to do, and we know what we’re not willing to do, and everybody’s on board.” The Phillies loved Machado, perhaps even more than they do Harper. They tried to trade for Machado last summer, they met with him in person this winter, and they offered him a lucrative deal — but would not go to $300 million. The Phillies might do so for Harper, but insist they will not act out of desperation. Middleton did give that impression in November, when he told Bob Nightengale of USA Today that the team was “expecting to spend money, and maybe even be a little stupid about it.” The Phillies have spent money, but they have not been stupid. After stumbling down the stretch to an 80-82 finish last season, the Phillies have added four high-impact players, all with All-Star pedigrees: left fielder Andrew McCutchen, catcher J.T. Realmuto, reliever David Robertson and shortstop Jean Segura. They signed their ace, Aaron Nola, to a four-year, $45 million contract extension, and added other relievers in trades. The moves improved a dreadful defense and a lineup that produced the fewest hits in the majors last season. They were prudent, responsible moves, but Middleton’s statement was widely viewed as a promise of something bolder, setting up a binary view of the Phillies’ winter: success (Machado or Harper) or failure (anything else). “I’m well aware of the perception this off-season,” Klentak said. “I would shift the focus to the body of work in our off-season. We’ve spent about $180 million this off-season. We’ve spent plenty of money. This is not an ownership that is sitting on its hands and going cheap.” So far, the Phillies’ biggest free-agent splash was a three-year $50 million contract for McCutchen, 32, a former Most Valuable Player for the Pittsburgh Pirates. McCutchen will play left field, with the slugger Rhys Hoskins shifting back to first base, his best position. Carlos Santana, who played first base last year, went to the Seattle Mariners in a deal for Segura, who hit .304 with 20 steals last season and once led the National League in hits. “I think we have the pieces to go as far as we want to, and that’s to the championship,” McCutchen said. “It’s a very strong team all around. You look at the lineup and there’s some good names in there, and the pitching’s unreal. I remember facing these guys when I was on the Giants and looking at the starting rotation and the bullpen. I was like, ‘Man, they’ve got some arms. There’s no break here.’” In Realmuto, who arrived this month in a trade with the Miami Marlins, the Phillies have the majors’ best catcher. Robertson solidifies a deep bullpen. The Phillies seem comfortable with their rotation — Nola, Jake Arrieta, Nick Pivetta, Vince Velasquez and Zach Eflin — but if they lose out on Harper, they could theoretically upgrade that group. “We are always going to be open-minded to opportunities to make our team better,” Klentak said. “But this is not the last free-agent class of all time. There will be other opportunities for the Philadelphia Phillies to spend money in the future, whether it’s July at the trade deadline, or next off-season, or the off-season after that. We have to take that into account. “Are there players remaining in free agency that would make us better? Are we going to have needs next year and are there going to be players in next year’s class that we’re going to want to sign? Yes. We have to balance the short term and the long term in everything that we do.” The Phillies’ long-term fantasy is to sign Mike Trout if he leaves the Los Angeles Angels as a free agent after the 2020 season. But Trout, an unabashed Philadelphia sports fan from Millville, N.J., might never hit the open market, and with Realmuto under team control for only the next two seasons, the Phillies’ short-term window is open. Harper could help them burst through it. “I think we’re a good team with or without adding Harper,” Robertson said. “Obviously, he’s a great player and fits in on any roster; who wouldn’t want a guy that’s capable of hitting 40 home runs and hitting .300? But you can’t look at stuff like that. We’re in the now.” The players seem to understand that, for now, the fans are preoccupied with one guy not in that room: Harper. “To me, personally, I don’t really care, but I think for the city, they want a guy like that,” reliever Pat Neshek said. “With all the talk, I feel like they’re expecting one of the two, and now Manny’s gone. But they’re trying their best. They’ve made awesome moves so far, and the N.L. East is going to be tough no matter what.” It is hard to see clearly now, with the Harper haze hanging over the team and the sport. But what if the Phillies have done enough already with McCutchen, Realmuto, Robertson and Segura? That is their stance, and they might be right. “In a typical off-season, that is a very thorough, complete and successful off-season,” Klentak said. “We addressed everything we wanted to address.”",The New York Times
2019,"Without Pelosi as a Foil, Trump Tries Out Some Alternatives","White House Memo WASHINGTON — The Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives was a blessing in disguise for a president who needed a foil, Republicans predicted last November. President Trump, who had only the press and the special counsel to battle with, they said, would find a useful antagonist in Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It hasn’t exactly turned out that way. After a series of misadventures, Mr. Trump has conspicuously laid off personal attacks aimed at Ms. Pelosi. Even as the standoff over funding a border wall appears to be finally ending with a deal seen as a defeat for the president, he has blamed unnamed Democrats but not their most prominent leader. And there has been no undermining Trumpian nickname — the president has said his moniker for Ms. Pelosi is, simply, “Nancy.” Mr. Trump, who once stalked Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic nominee, around the presidential debate stage and continues to encourage “lock her up” chants at his rallies more than two years later, simply gazed up at Ms. Pelosi during his State of the Union address — and then found himself the target of ridicule for the picture of her giving him what appeared to be a dismissive clap of the hands. “She has a unified Democratic caucus behind her, and she’s not intimidated,” said Representative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts. “I don’t think that Donald Trump has run into that too often in his life, and he doesn’t know quite what to make of it all.” Without his anticipated punching bag, Mr. Trump has been left searching for an alternative, delivering haphazard attacks on Democrats as they announce their presidential campaigns, trial-and-error hits on an inchoate field of 2020 contenders. The question is whether a strategy of personal attacks that helped lift Mr. Trump to victory in 2016 will work when there’s no clear political opponent who rises above the rest. “Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!” Giving it right back, Ms. Klobuchar responded, “I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?” On Saturday, Mr. Trump officially welcomed Senator Elizabeth Warren to the presidential field, writing on Twitter: “Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” At a rally in El Paso on Monday night, Mr. Trump attacked Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who is considering a presidential bid. “We were challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz,” Mr. Trump said. “They said, ‘Hey, you’re supposed to win in order to run.’ By the way we — I — I’m one for one.” Democratic operatives predicted Mr. Trump’s attempts to personally demonize his political opponents won’t work when it’s not one on one. “He’s better with a foil, but unless he can hone in on one or two people, it ends up being less than the sum of its parts,” said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “If he’s scattershot weighing in on everyone who announces a presidential campaign, it’s not going to have the intended effect.” Mr. Trump’s allies disagree. “The Democratic field is both undefined and starting out with positions on the far left,” said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who is now advising Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign. “Raising the profile of these out-of-touch positions and their controversies plays to the president’s advantage.” Some of Mr. Trump’s attacks appear to be doing just that. Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Trump has long viewed as an easy target, has apologized for identifying herself as Native American for two decades, essentially admitting that she did what Mr. Trump has accused her of: misrepresenting her race. Republican National Committee officials said they credited Mr. Trump with forcing the Native American issue back to the forefront. “The president reignited the conversation about her false Native American heritage claims last year, and she still can’t move past it,” said Ronna McDaniel, the committee’s chairwoman. But in general, his denigration of Democratic presidential candidates is not being guided by any field data from his campaign about who his most viable opponent is, and what the candidates’ biggest weaknesses are, according to a campaign operative. Trump officials said they viewed Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Ms. Warren as the three most viable candidates, so far, to enter the race. But Mr. Trump has not landed on a strategy for diminishing Ms. Harris, and has praised her instead. “I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last month. “Better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat.” Meanwhile, he has weighed in on candidates considered second tier, as well as those who have yet to enter the race. Ms. Klobuchar’s snow-blanketed kickoff rally turned into a briefly viral moment that Mr. Trump simply couldn’t pass up, the operative said. His strikes against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has yet to decide whether he will run, appear to be in the workshop phase. “When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it’s on purpose; it’s not a gaffe,” Mr. Trump said at a recent off-the-record lunch with network anchors. “When Biden says something dumb, it’s because he’s dumb.” Rather than individuals, Mr. Trump’s campaign operatives, meanwhile, are hoping to elevate Democratic positions that seem out of step with the mainstream, like a 70 percent top tax rate, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and questioning American support for Israel. The only presidential tweet backed by political advice, they said, was Mr. Trump’s broadside against the “Green New Deal,” an ambitious Democratic proposal that seeks to combat climate change by calling for the United States to eliminate additional carbon emissions by 2030. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, discussed the Green New Deal with Mr. Trump, an aide said, citing it as an example of a vulnerability for Democrats, and a way to brand them as “socialists.” “I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military — even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”",The New York Times
2019,Woman Delivers Stillborn Baby While in ICE Custody,"A 24-year-old Honduran woman gave birth to a stillborn baby boy last week while in ICE custody, the authorities said Monday, further raising concerns about the care pregnant women receive while detained. The woman, whose name has not been released, was apprehended by United States Border Patrol officials near Hidalgo, Tex., on Feb. 18, according to a joint statement issued Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. She told the authorities that she was six months pregnant, and she was taken to a hospital and examined, the agencies said. The woman was placed in ICE custody at the Port Isabel Detention Center near Los Frenos, Tex., and set to be released last Friday. Then she complained of abdominal pain and was to be sent to a hospital, but went into labor. She gave birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Danielle Bennett, an ICE spokeswoman, said she had seen no information that indicated the woman’s detention contributed to the stillbirth. “Although for investigative and reporting purposes, a stillbirth is not considered an in-custody death, ICE and CBP officials are proactively disclosing the details of this tragic event to be transparent with Congress, the media and the public,” the agencies said in the statement. Ms. Bennett said that ICE has 60 pregnant detainees in custody and that between Oct. 1, 2017, and Aug. 31, 2018, more than 1,600 pregnant women had been booked into ICE custody. Twenty-eight women “may have experienced a miscarriage just prior to, or while in ICE custody” between Oct. 1, 2016, and Aug. 31, 2018, she said. Ms. Bennett said that without a full understanding of someone’s medical history, it was difficult to tell what caused a miscarriage or when exactly it began. Randy Capps, director of United States research for the Migration Policy Institute, said because the woman’s detention was only for a few days, “it would seem unlikely detention was the cause” of the stillbirth. But how immigration officials care for people in their custody has been under scrutiny in recent months. An 8-year-old Guatemalan boy, Felipe Gómez Alonso, died on Christmas Eve while in United States custody, and three weeks earlier, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, died in Border Patrol custody. “There has been more and more public death,” said Erika Andiola, chief of advocacy for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or Raices, a nonprofit organization that provides low-cost legal defense services to immigrant and refugee families in Texas. She said the treatment of pregnant women had been a particular focus after the Trump administration said it would stop assuming pregnant women should be released, instead detaining them on a case-by-case basis. Ms. Andiola said based on interviews with migrants who have recently left detention centers, some pregnant women do not get the care they need at the centers. For example, some were told they would be taken to off-site medical professionals but never were, she said. “We know those are not the best conditions for pregnant women at all,” Ms. Andiola said. “This is not surprising, really.” The story of the Honduran woman detailed Monday still has many uncertainties. It is not clear how or why she was taken into custody by the Border Patrol officers or how it was determined that she should be released. Ms. Bennett, the spokeswoman, referred questions about the woman’s apprehension to Customs and Border Protection. C.B.P. did not answer questions seeking more information Monday.",The New York Times

2019,Woman Dies After Eating at Michelin-Starred Restaurant in Spain,"The authorities in Valencia are investigating the death of a woman who had eaten at a Michelin-starred restaurant, its owner said this week, as Spanish news outlets reported that the establishment had been tied to as many as 28 other cases of food poisoning. The restaurant, RiFF, has closed indefinitely as regional health officials investigate. Bernd H. Knöller, the owner and head chef of RiFF, said in a statement that the restaurant would be closed until “the causes of what happened are established and we can resume work with full guarantees for both the staff and customers.” He said the decision was based on what he had learned from Valencian health authorities about “different gastric illnesses in several customers of the restaurant, including the death of one.” Mr. Knöller said that he had offered his “full collaboration” with the investigation by the regional Ministry of Health to determine what caused the death. The woman, who has not been publicly identified by the authorities, died at her home on Sunday morning, the restaurant said in an emailed statement. “We are awaiting the results of the official investigation, which will determine whether the cause of death has any connection with the food served at the restaurant,” it said. “All other guests have recovered from the symptoms.” Valencia’s Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment. The head of the ministry, Ana Barceló, told reporters on Thursday that investigators had interviewed 75 people who had eaten at the restaurant from Feb. 13 to Feb. 16, according to the Spanish news outlet Europa Press. Of those 75, investigators found 29 with symptoms of food poisoning, including the woman who died, the Spanish newspaper El País reported. The other 28 people were said to have suffered mild symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea, it said. Ms. Barceló declined to comment on speculation in the local media that a mushroom might have caused the outbreak, saying it was “irresponsible to establish the origin” before an autopsy and other tests were completed. She also said that an initial inspection of the restaurant found that “everything appears normal,” according to El País. Citing anonymous sources within the ministry, the newspaper said that the authorities first learned of food poisoning symptoms on Feb. 17, the day after the woman who died had fallen ill, as had her husband and their son. Ms. Barceló said that the authorities had collected samples from the restaurant’s tasting menu for tests by the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Science. RiFF was awarded a star by the prestigious Michelin Guide in 2009, according to the restaurant’s website. The guide said the chef, Mr. Knöller, created “innovative cuisine” and “interesting set menus” based on “the highest quality, seasonal, local products.” In his statement, Mr. Knöller said that initial inspections of the restaurant had found it complied with sanitary regulations. “Regardless of what reason may have caused this situation,” he added, “I want to convey my profound regret for what happened.”",The New York Times
2019,"Woman Killed by Fire in Menstruation Hut, as Nepal Fights a Tradition","KATHMANDU, Nepal — Parbati Bogati knew what to do when her period came. Ms. Bogati, 21, sequestered herself in an abandoned house, in keeping with a centuries-old taboo that declares menstruating women impure, officials from her area in rural western Nepal said. As the temperature dropped below freezing on Wednesday evening, she tried to keep warm, apparently burning wood and clothing. By the next morning, her legs were charred and she was dead. “It seems she also died from suffocation,” said Lal Bahadur Dhami, the deputy superintendent of the area’s police. At least three other people died this year while following the same superstition. The taboo, which has its roots in Hinduism, is called chhaupadi, from the Nepali words meaning someone who bears an impurity. During women’s periods, it bars them from touching neighbors’ food or entering temples. They cannot use communal water sources or kitchen utensils. It is considered bad luck to touch them. Instead, women who observe the taboo are banished to mud or stone huts, some of them no bigger than closets. Each year, at least a couple of women die in these huts from exposure, animal bites or smoke inhalation after building fires to stay warm during the Himalayan winter. Many women who follow chhaupadi say they do so out of social pressure or guilt. Reports of sexual assault from men who prey on them while they are alone are also common. A 2010 Nepali government survey, which was cited in a State Department human rights report, found that 19 percent of women age 15 to 49 in the country followed chhaupadi. But in Nepal’s midwestern and far western regions, some of the poorest pockets of Asia, the proportion climbed to 50 percent. Women’s rights activists have desperately tried to end chhaupadi. Nepal’s Supreme Court banned the practice in 2005. Last August, the government went a step further and criminalized it. Anyone who forces menstruating women into huts faces up to three months in jail. But the law has barely rippled through many villages in western Nepal, and activists say the police are not enforcing it. Last month, Amba Bohara, 35, and two of her sons — ages 7 and 9 — apparently suffocated in a menstruation hut after lighting a fire to stay warm. Nobody has been arrested in their deaths. Officials said no men forced Ms. Bogati to follow chhaupadi in her village of Purbichauki, a small outpost in western Nepal. Ms. Bogati’s father-in-law was dead. Her husband, Shankar, was in Malaysia for a job. She stayed more or less on her own, which complicated the task of filing charges, the police said. “She was alone in her house,” Mr. Dhami said. “Tell us, who should be held responsible for this crime?” Mr. Dhami said the local government had organized more than 50 programs educating people from Ms. Bogati’s district about the dangers of chhaupadi and its illegality. A few days before her death, Ms. Bogati had attended one of these programs, according to a distant relative, Dirgha Raj Bogati. That did not stop her from following chhaupadi. One villager, Chandra Bogati, blamed Ms. Bogati for her death. “She would be alive if she had not gone to the abandoned house to follow chhaupadi and burned the fire,” he said. Activists said they planned to demolish many menstruation huts starting next month. But Amrita Thapa, a lawmaker based in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, said it was hard to imagine the situation improving anytime soon. On a recent visit to the village where Ms. Bohara and her two children died last month, she found shocking levels of resistance. “I realized that changing people’s mind-sets and ending chhaupadi was more difficult than hardships we endured while fighting in the war,” she said, referring to a conflict with a Maoist insurgency in Nepal in which thousands of people died.",The New York Times
2019,Women Sue Yale Over a Fraternity Culture They Say Enables Harassment,"Three Yale students who claim they were groped at fraternity parties have filed a class-action lawsuit against the university, arguing the school has fostered an environment where alcohol-fueled gatherings at off-campus fraternity houses dictate the undergraduate social scene. While the New Haven, Conn., university presents itself as a campus where fraternities are not a major presence, the lawsuit states that few options besides fraternity parties exist for women who want to socialize and meet other students. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Connecticut, comes as universities across the country have been trying to crack down on bad behavior by fraternities, from binge drinking and sexual harassment to abusive hazing rituals that have led to several deaths. Aware that their image has been tarnished, fraternities have often been partners with universities in trying to change party culture. A class-action lawsuit against Yale and its fraternities claims the university has fostered an environment where the fraternity houses dictate the campus social scene. Yale has often looked the other way, the plaintiffs claim, while parties rage and women from Yale and surrounding colleges are routinely sexually harassed and abused. Joan Gilbride, a lawyer for the fraternities named in the lawsuit, said the accusations are “baseless and unfounded,” and that the fraternities and their national organizations would vigorously defend themselves against the claims. A Yale spokesman, Thomas Conroy, said he could not comment on the specifics of the lawsuit. But he shared a message to Yale students last month from the dean of Yale College, Marvin Chun, after a yearlong review of campus culture, including fraternity culture. It said in part, “I condemn the culture described in these accounts; it runs counter to our community’s values of making everyone feel welcome, respected, and safe. I also offer some plain advice about events like these: don’t go to them.” The dean said that Yale “plays no formal role in the organizations not affiliated with the university, including Greek organizations,” and he said the university was working on providing alternative social spaces and events on campus. The lawsuit acknowledges that there may be questions about Yale’s ability to regulate off-campus organizations. “Yale often claims that the university cannot punish the fraternities because they are unregistered, off-campus organizations,” the lawsuit says. But it argues that this position is disingenuous, because the fraternities “act as extensions of Yale,” providing party space, while Yale permits them to use the Yale name, Yale email addresses, Yale bulletin boards and campus facilities for recruitment. Peter McDonough, general counsel of the American Council on Education, a university trade group, said universities have been reluctant to become too deeply involved in regulating fraternity life. “The very concept of a campus is where people learn not only from each other but through shared experiences,” he said. “And this isn’t the K through 12 environment.” The plaintiffs — a sophomore and two juniors — have demanded in the lawsuit that Yale and its fraternities rein in the parties. They have also asked for a court order that would force the fraternities to admit women and allow them to share in the benefits of membership, like housing and powerful alumni networks that can lead to jobs, internships and social capital. “Simply put, fraternities elevate men to social gatekeepers and relegate women and non-binary students to sexual objects,” the lawsuit said. “Moreover, Yale’s fraternities have alumni and professional connections to the business world, including banking and consulting firms, which often result in coveted job offers and economic opportunities.” The three women who filed the suit are Anna McNeil, 20, a junior from Brooklyn majoring in art history; Eliana Singer, 19, a sophomore from Minneapolis majoring in political science; and Ry Walker, 20, a junior from Brooklyn majoring in astrophysics and African-American studies. The law firm representing them, Sanford Heisler Sharp, is also representing women who are suing Dartmouth College for sexual assault and discrimination by three professors who they said turned a human behavior research department “into a 21st-century Animal House.” All three women in the Yale case said they were groped at fraternity parties during their first semesters. In the lawsuit, Ms. Walker, who is African-American, said she was passed over by fraternity brothers controlling admission to a party, while white women behind her were admitted. “We eat together, take classes together, exist in this coeducational place,” Ms. Walker said in an interview. “But somehow because of the way Greek life operates on campus and the control they have over social spaces here, that means that on weekend nights, men are the only ones who have power.” Sororities are not a substitute for fraternities, the plaintiffs said, because they have been around for much less time, and do not have the depth of contacts that fraternities have. The lawsuit, filed as a class-action complaint, accuses Yale of violating Title IX of federal education law, which prohibits sex discrimination by institutions receiving federal funding, and breach of contract for not providing the educational environment it promised. It accuses the fraternities of violating the Fair Housing Act for offering housing only to men, and Yale and the fraternities of violating Connecticut’s law against discrimination in places of public accommodation. It seeks unspecified damages. The women belong to a student group called Engender that has used civil rights-type tactics to try to force fraternities to accept women. For the past three years, women and “non-binary” students from Engender have tried to join fraternities. Only one fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, let them apply, according to court papers. But in the end they were denied and the fraternity chapter said it was because their national chapter did not allow women, the lawsuit says. The complaint suggests that there is a “symbiotic” relationship between Yale and its fraternities, which involves letting the fraternities manage social life on campus, in exchange for Yale officials looking the other way when parties get out of hand. “The fraternities take on the liability associated with student alcohol consumption, and in exchange, Yale allows the fraternities to use Yale resources (and recruit Yale students) and largely turns a blind eye to the sexual harassment and assault occurring in connection with the fraternities,” the complaint says. The lawsuit claims that Yale lags behind peers like Harvard, which in 2016 announced that it was discouraging students from joining single-sex social clubs by barring them from leadership positions on campus and from receiving endorsements for prestigious scholarships like the Rhodes. In December, Harvard was sued by fraternities, sororities and students saying the new policy is discriminatory.",The New York Times
2019,Women Win at the Art Show,"Art Review Uncompromising female artists dominate in the top booths at this annual fair at the Park Avenue Armory. The best thing about the Art Show, the annual fair sponsored by the Art Dealers Association of America in the Park Avenue Armory, is that ticket sales benefit the Henry Street Settlement, which has been bringing art and culture to the Lower East Side since 1893. The second best thing is that all 72 exhibitors are in a single room, albeit a large and drafty one: You can take it all in with a leisurely stroll. What you’ll find this year is a program dominated by uncompromising female artists. The very best of them are two joint presentations: the painter Judith Linhares with the sculptor Annabeth Rosen at P.P.O.W. and Anglim Gilbert, and Alice Neel’s paintings with photographs by Diane Arbus, brought together by David Zwirner and Fraenkel Gallery. Be on the lookout as well for a survey of work by the turn-of-the-century African-American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner (Michael Rosenfeld, A16); the mysteriously magical paintings of Markus Lüpertz (Michael Werner, C8); Gordon Parks’s amazing color photograph of a tightly packed, jubilant crowd at the 1963 March on Washington (Howard Greenberg, A12); Rackstraw Downes’s pocket-size oil painting “Vent Tower and Salt Shed,” in which two Department of Sanitation structures become found abstractions in a quiet city scene (Betty Cuningham, D18); and the disconcerting spot where Seth Price’s large-scale, lightbox images of human skin (Petzel, B4) face off against Roberto Cuoghi’s bird corpses cast in agar-agar and pork gelatin (Hauser & Wirth, B3). Here are some especially notable booths. Booths C10/D11 Judith Linhares, who uses thick, glowing lines to depict titanic female figures, brings out the color in Annabeth Rosen’s work — wire-wrapped ceramic assemblages that evoke seashells, ballast or construction sites on the moon. In this presentation, both artists present a muscular and unapologetic femininity that feels not only welcome right now but necessary. Booths A6/B5 San Francisco’s Fraenkel Gallery and New York’s own David Zwirner, which co-represent the estate of Diane Arbus, mount an extraordinary pairing of Arbus’s portrait photographs with paintings by Alice Neel in these conjoined booths. Uncanny formal similarities, such as the way Neel’s “David Sokola,” from 1973, and Arbus’s “Norman Mailer at home, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1963” both sprawl in their armchairs, make for a fascinating typology of posture and performance. One juxtaposition, of Neel’s 1932 “Danny Lasser” with Arbus’s “Boy in the subway, N.Y.C. 1956,” goes even further: The two little boys with blank stares, one sadder, one more distant, suggest an infinite continuum of emotion. Booth A9 The fair’s most stunning display is at Susan Inglett Gallery, where four large paper cuttings by William Villalongo, a Brooklyn-based artist working in painting, printmaking and installation, neatly fill the booth’s gray walls. Each features a storm of decorative slivers cut into black velour paper. Accented with collaged-in photos of jewels and African sculptures, or painted arms and legs, these storms become ingenious summations of black American identity: They’re bodies composed of innumerable traumas that somehow hold together — and even look good. Booth A10 A full booth at the Washburn Gallery is dedicated to the painter Alice Trumbull Mason (1904-1971), with a focus on drawings and paintings from the 1940s, whose surfaces are broken into rhythmic showers of narrow shapes. In “Bearings Charted With Yellow,” from 1946, the overlapping rhombuses have a dizzying effect, suggesting a teasing motion that doesn’t actually get anywhere, while “Bearings in Transition,” beside it, is as still as the grave. Booth A14 Six large oils by Jordan Casteel, painted from snapshots taken on the subway, manage to capture the M.T.A.’s loud colors and distinctive surfaces without overlooking its moments of hidden repose. Though her subjects’ faces are cropped, hidden or turned away, the artist’s sympathetic interest imbues them with life. Booth D4 Two large oils by Joan Semmel at Alexander Gray overpower diffident abstractions by Betty Parsons in another compelling two-woman presentation. A precisely rendered view of Ms. Semmel’s naked body anchors “Beachbody,” 1985, a windblown scene of unruly brush strokes and tilting horizon. In the almost identically composed “Weathered,” 2018, the artist lets this torrent of visible strokes invade her arms. Booth D29 The small gouaches by Maira Kalman that ring Julie Saul’s booth are illustrations for a forthcoming reissue of “The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas” by Gertrude Stein. Starting with a portrait of Toklas, her chin sharp and uneven, her nose hanging down like a bloated sardine, they continue through scenes of the couple’s famous friends and glamorous life abroad to a portrait of Stein seated under Picasso’s portrait of her. You can’t help but be charmed by Ms. Kalman’s detailed, slightly wonky drawing. Her palette of dark greens, pale blues and rosy pinks, meanwhile, is like German Expressionism made friendly. Booth D10 The 62-year-old Castelli Gallery, which helped found the Art Dealers Association of America but hasn’t shown in its fair for two decades, reappears with a brilliantly minimal group of notebook-size colored-pencil studies by Roy Lichtenstein. The chance to see hand-drawn lines by an artist known for clean edges feels like an illicit pleasure. Booth C12 Here are six decades’ worth of boxes made by 17 artists, from Joseph Beuys’s 1968 “Intuition Box,” a shallow wooden tray that hangs on the wall like an empty frame, to Damien Hirst’s cheeky 2005 “Pharmacy,” very much like a medicine cabinet but more expensive. John Dogg’s 1986 “Untitled (Classic Belted),” a round tire circumscribed by a square box, and a 1975 paintbrush in a box by H.C. Westermann express a similar insight, somewhere between banal and profound. John McCracken’s 1988 “Alpha-6,” a mirror-polished steel block, is hypnotizing.

2019,"Women and People of Color Starred in Hit Movies in Record Numbers, Study Finds","A new report has found that in 2018, more women and people of color starred in top movies than in any other year since 2007, when researchers began their study. The report, released Tuesday by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, found that 40 of the 100 top films from last year had a woman in the starring or co-starring role, up from 32 the year before. In 2007, that number was just 20. And people of color played a starring or co-starring role in 28 of the top 100 films in 2018, compared with 21 in 2017 and just 13 in 2007. Gains were also made by women of color and women 45 or older. Eleven of last year’s 100 top movies starred a woman from an underrepresented ethnicity, compared with four in 2017. Similarly, 11 top films starred or co-starred a woman 45 or older, up from five a year earlier. While the figures have yet to reflect the makeup of the United States population, they are a clear indicator that in 2018 at least, when “Black Panther” and “Crazy Rich Asians” broke box office records, Hollywood studios heeded demands to bring a broader array of story lines and actors to screens, and seemingly reaped rewards from doing so. Last year’s crop of movies “offers hope that industry members have taken action to create content that better reflects the world in which we live, and the box office seems to have rewarded them for it,” said Stacy L. Smith, director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. “This data shows us that it is possible for change to be achieved.”",The New York Times
2019,Women of Color Organize for Access and Accountability in Photojournalism,"lens The Authority Collective, whose members are women, transgender or nonbinary photographers, is building a supportive community while challenging industry leaders’ thinking about diversity and representation. Tara Pixley often felt isolated in the newsrooms where she worked as a photographer or photo editor. As a “black woman who was the child of immigrants, raised by a single mom, and also a first-generation college student,” she struggled for a decade to fit in. She was the only woman of color in the photo departments where she worked and was ignored or treated dismissively. She originally blamed herself for not fitting in, but after talking with other photographers who were women of color, she realized that they all had similar experiences of being shut out of conversations. “There is a three-prong gender/race/class identity space, and the bias and marginalization that it brings down on a visual journalist is very real and makes it difficult for women of color to succeed in this industry,” Ms. Pixley said. “Add to that being gender nonconforming, non-binary or trans, then you’re just this kind of oddity that no one seems to know how to engage.” Ms. Pixley met with nine other photographers and filmmakers to share resources and discuss the state of the industry last year, which led to the creation of the Authority Collective, which now numbers 150 members. “I’ve never been around this much diversity of opinions and perspectives in any other space in photojournalism,” exclaimed Ms. Pixley, who now is a professor of Journalism at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. While statistics on the number of women of color in photography are hard to come by, Akili-Casundria Ramsess, the executive director of the National Press Photographers Association, said there were few working as photojournalists in newspapers and magazines in the United States. African-American women staff photographers are like “unicorns,” she said, because they are so rare. “I literally know every black woman photojournalist in the United States, and I can count them on both hands,” said Ms. Ramsess, who became one of the few black female directors of photography when she was hired by the Orlando Sentinel in Florida. The collective focuses on building a supportive community as well as challenging industry leaders to shift how they think about diversity and representation. It works to even the playing field by pooling resources, and developing a list of photo editors, curators and directors, while a Slack channel lets members share experiences and ask advice. An internal newsletter lists job opportunities and calls for grant proposals and exhibition entries. Last year, the Authority Collective, in cooperation with Diversify, created the “Lit List” a group of 30 photographers “of marginalized identities” to watch, which led to an exhibition at Photoville in New York. Danielle Villasana, a photographer whose father is of Mexican heritage, describes herself as “a woman whose identity is layered, in terms of race, in terms of sexual orientation and in terms of social status.” At times she has benefited from privileges of skin color but has also faced challenges in the industry around gender, she said. Beyond advocating more diversity, the collective also looks at how people of color and women are represented, and who tells their stories. “The issue is that for too long within photojournalism the storytellers have been largely white men,” said Ms. Villasana, who is based in Turkey. “Now if the storytellers had been all women, that would also be a problem. Our storytellers have been homogeneous while our society is incredibly diverse.” There is value in both insider and outsider perspectives, said Jovelle Tamayo, a founding board member of the collective who describes herself as a woman of color and an immigrant from the Philippines. But the current imbalance often results in portrayals that are deeply personal for her, as well as many of her Authority Collective colleagues, she said. “Our communities have been either erased completely or misrepresented or under represented,” she said. “It’s no longer acceptable that media outlets continue to push forward those dangerous narratives. Diversity adds better representation of our communities, but it also helps cut out narratives that may claim objectivity but actually do more harm than good.” These questionable images are not only frequently found in mainstream media but are often rewarded in major contests where historically, Ms. Pixley said, “you almost have to have a photo of starving or dying or war-torn black or brown bodies to win.” The Authority Collective has challenged camera manufacturers over their promotions and the photographers they choose to represent them. It’s not just that women and people of color are often not represented, Ms. Pixley said, but it is also the type of imagery that is held up as exemplary. After an uproar over Nikon announcing a group of 32 photographers — all men — to promote a new camera, and Sony announcing winners of its Alpha Female Creator-in-Residence Program awards that featured “problematic images,” Ms. Pixley said, the collective issued an open letter to camera manufacturers decrying the reliance of stereotypes that reinforce one-sided narratives that date back to the origins of the medium. Mary Kang, a board member who immigrated from Korea and grew up in Austin, Tex., gets angry seeing simplistic, clichéd narratives that perpetuate fear of people of color. Though she thinks there is a place for “righteous anger,” the Authority Collective has helped her to transform these feelings into positive actions. “The Authority Collective comes from a place of love for photography and the photo industry but when marginalized people are disrespected we feel our love is not reciprocated,” Ms. Kang said. “We don’t want to bring other people down just because they made a mistake, but we want to figure how we can all be better.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2019,Woody Allen Is Shooting a New Movie in Spain,"Just weeks after suing Amazon for canceling a four-movie deal, Woody Allen is working on a new film in Spain. The project is being backed by Mediapro, a Barcelona-based conglomerate that has financed several films by Allen, including the romantic dramas “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” and “Midnight in Paris.” A spokeswoman for the company confirmed Allen was already working on the film, but said she could not confirm any other details such as local media reports that he had already scouted locations. Allen has been under scrutiny over longstanding abuse allegations that he molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992. In August 2017, Amazon reached a $68 million deal with Allen’s production company to fund and distribute at least four movies, including “A Rainy Day in New York.” Later that year, Farrow wrote an op-ed piece in The Los Angeles Times, arguing that the #MeToo movement has “spared” the once-revered director. According to a lawsuit, Amazon executives met with members of Allen’s team to discuss postponing the release of “A Rainy Day in New York,” which Allen had completed, to 2019. The studio said it had already been facing “negative publicity and reputational harm” for its past association with Harvey Weinstein. Last June, Amazon Studios sent an email to Allen’s representatives saying that the deal was terminated, citing the renewed allegations, the director’s “own comments, and the increasing refusal of top talent to work with or be associated with him in any way, all of which have frustrated the purpose of the agreement.” “A Rainy Day in New York” has yet to be released; the last of Allen’s films to hit theaters in the United States was the 2017 drama “Wonder Wheel,” which was distributed by Amazon Studios. Amazon has partnered with Mediapro in the past, but it is not involved with Allen’s new project. And Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, said in a New York Times report this week that the company does not have plans to release any movies by the director. When asked why it was working with Allen given that Amazon had stopped doing so, Mediapro said in a statement, “We have a 10-year relationship with Mr. Allen and, like all projects we produce, we judge the creator by its work.” “All of our projects have a unique personality, and we support all types of artistic voices and ideas and remain committed to producing well-defined and creative projects for audiences worldwide,” the statement continued. Allen’s work has long found more success abroad, particularly in Europe. In an interview with The Times in 1998, Allen said his movies rarely break even in the United States. He added: “I’ve always depended on Europe to supplement my grosses.” “Wonder Wheel” brought in only $1.4 million in North America. It collected nearly $14.5 million overseas, with its highest revenues in France, Italy and Spain, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks ticket sales. Allen’s reputation may have cost him the Amazon deal and alienated a number of A-list actors, but some have come to his defense. In October, Javier Bardem, who starred in “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” called the upheaval surrounding the abuse allegations a “public lynching” and said he would work with Allen again. In an interview in The Times published in November, Jude Law, who worked with Allen on “A Rainy Day in New York,” said the shelving of the film by Amazon was a “terrible shame.” “I’d love to see it,” Law said. “People worked really hard and put a lot in, obviously himself included.” Even as the filmmaker was wrapping up production on “A Rainy Day in New York” last year, he had already secured financing for a script he was working on outside the Amazon agreement, Letty Aronson, Allen’s sister and longtime producer, told The Times. “I have no doubt,” she said, “that he’ll be able to find new talent.”",The New York Times
2019,Woody Allen Sues Amazon Over Canceled $68 Million Deal,"Woody Allen sued Amazon in federal court on Thursday, seeking at least $68 million and saying that the company’s streaming service had improperly backed out of a four-movie deal because of a renewed focus on allegations of sexual abuse on Allen’s part. The filing, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said that Amazon had justified ending the deal by “referencing a 25-year old, baseless allegation against Mr. Allen,” presumably the accusation that he had molested his daughter, Dylan Farrow, in 1992, when she was 7. He has denied the allegations and has not been charged with any crime. “That allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allen,” the lawsuit said. “And, in any event, it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract. There simply was no legitimate ground for Amazon to renege on its promises.” [Read a timeline of the accusations involving Woody Allen and his family.] Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a representative for Allen. The accusations against him date back to the 1990s, when they were at the center of a bitter child custody battle between Allen and his former partner, Mia Farrow. Allen’s affair with Soon-Yi Previn, who had been adopted by Farrow and would later marry Allen, also figured in the dispute, which split the family. In recent years, the journalist Ronan Farrow, a son of Mia Farrow and Allen, has come out in support of his mother and sister Dylan. Moses Farrow, a brother of Ronan, has sided with Allen. As the #MeToo movement began placing a spotlight on the behavior of powerful men in Hollywood, the longstanding accusations received new life. In December 2017, Dylan Farrow wrote an op-ed piece for The Los Angeles Times titled “Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?” Several Hollywood figures, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Peter Sarsgaard, have said they would not do another film with Allen. Amazon already had a relationship with Allen dating back to 2016, when it distributed his film “Café Society,” starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, followed by “Wonder Wheel,” featuring Justin Timberlake, the next year. According to the lawsuit, in August 2017, Amazon reached a deal with Allen’s production company to finance and distribute at least four films, including “A Rainy Day in New York,” which Allen completed. One of the movie’s stars, Timothée Chalamet, donated his salary from the film to charity. The deal called for Allen’s company to be paid at least $68 million. Four months after the agreement was signed, the lawsuit said, Amazon executives met with Allen’s representatives to discuss delaying the release of “A Rainy Day in New York” to 2019, in part because of “negative publicity and reputational harm” Amazon was facing because of the studio’s past association with Harvey Weinstein. In the meantime, Allen began work on the other three films agreed to in the deal, the suit said. Last June, according to the court documents, Ajay Patel, an associate general counsel for Amazon Studios, sent an email to representatives of Allen, saying that the production deal was being terminated. Allen’s team protested, asking for a reason. Amazon, according to the suit, said that the deal had become “impracticable” because of “supervening events, including renewed allegations against Mr. Allen, his own controversial comments, and the increasing refusal of top talent to work with or be associated with him in any way, all of which have frustrated the purpose of the agreement.” Allen’s projects are among several tied to high-profile men that have been canceled or pulled back because of allegations of sexual wrongdoing. The Orchard, an independent distribution company, shelved Louis C.K.’s film, “I Love You, Daddy,” after the comedian admitted to sexual misconduct with multiple colleagues. Following accusations of sexual assault against Kevin Spacey, his scenes in “All The Money in The World” were erased and reshot with Christopher Plummer.",The New York Times

Mr. Swenson, a memorably swaggering presence in the last Broadway revival of “Hair,” makes a fabulous entrance. He slouches into view, hunched and defeated, “like a dead man walking slow behind his own coffin,” as Josie says. Then, aware that he’s being watched, he sardonically strikes the pose of a ham actor greeting his audience. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

Neon continues to grip him, and one appeal of his works in light today, when many younger artists have gone for full-out theatricality, is their ad hoc, unassuming spirit. At the Parrish, skeins of neon in lavender or sea-foam green weave among the building’s wooden rafters.

2019,Worker Who Opened Fire Inside Factory Had Been Barred From Having Gun,"AURORA, Ill. — An angry worker who stormed through a suburban Chicago factory shooting his co-workers after being fired was barred from having the handgun he was carrying, the authorities said on Saturday. Gary Martin, 45, who died in a shootout with the police after a rampage on Friday that left five workers dead and at least six other people wounded, had his state weapons permit revoked years ago because of a felony assault conviction, the police in Aurora, Ill., said. Still, they said, Mr. Martin’s gun — a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun with a laser sight — was never taken away. “Some disgruntled person walked in and had access to a firearm that he shouldn’t have had access to,” said Kristen L. Ziman, the chief of police in Aurora, where the shooting took place. [Read more about the shooting here.] Chief Ziman said that the police were trying to determine why Mr. Martin still had a gun, despite having his permit revoked five years ago. According to Illinois gun law, a person must be granted a Firearm Owners Identification card, or FOID, to possess a firearm. At least two million people in the state have the cards. But under the law, the process of removing firearms from people whose cards have been revoked is weak, making it easy for some to keep their weapons with little threat of enforcement or penalty. That appears to have been the case with Mr. Martin, who the police said received a card in January 2014. That March, he applied for a concealed-carry permit, and a background check revealed that he had a felony conviction for aggravated assault in Mississippi from 1995. With that, the Illinois State Police revoked Mr. Martin’s card and mailed him a letter ordering him to relinquish his firearm and card within 48 hours. The statute allows law enforcement agencies to petition the courts to seize weapons if they aren’t turned in, but in many instances, the remaining weapons go unchecked. Experts said that the state rules — without a clear, mandatory enforcement requirement — leave a gaping loophole for those who choose not to give up their guns. In 2016, only about 4,000 of the 11,000 people whose cards were revoked submitted the mandatory reports explaining what they did with their guns, The Chicago Tribune reported in 2017. Sgt. Bill Rowley, a spokesman for the Aurora Police Department, said the police had no record of being notified by the state police that Mr. Martin had not volunteered his firearm as required in 2014. It was unclear whether Mr. Martin, who lived in Aurora at the time of his death, also lived there in 2014. The police on Saturday gave a fuller account of the deadly events inside the Henry Pratt Company warehouse on Friday afternoon, and identified the five workers — all co-workers of Mr. Martin — who were killed. The victims included some of the company’s most experienced workers but also its newest: Josh Pinkard, who was the plant manager of the warehouse, perished in the shooting, as did Trevor Wehner, who was a student at Northern Illinois University and an intern in the company’s human resources department. Mr. Wehner was expected to graduate from college in May. Friday was the first day of his internship, according to officials from Northern Illinois University. “He knew he wanted to work in the H.R. business and was hoping this internship would lead into a full-time job in the future,” said Winter Lane, Mr. Wehner’s girlfriend of more than three years, who grew up with him in the same small town of Serena, in north central Illinois. Everyone there knew Mr. Wehner. He was kind, the most selfless person she had ever met, she said, someone with a big smile and a personality to match. “He always saw the good in everyone,” she said. Also killed, the police said, were Vicente Juarez, a stock room attendant and forklift operator; Clayton Parks, the human resources manager; and Russell Beyer, a mold operator. Officials at Northern Illinois said that Mr. Parks had also graduated from the university, in 2014, and that it was offering counseling help to those in need. (The school, in DeKalb, Ill., was the site of another mass shooting 11 years ago.) Abby Parks, the wife of Clayton Parks, said he was devoted to their son, Axel, who is 8 months old. “The family we created together was Clay’s greatest joy,” she said. “He took his responsibilities as a husband and father very seriously and held those titles above all else.” The couple had been married since 2016. The police first received several 911 calls at 1:24 p.m. on Friday, as frantic callers said there was a shooter at the warehouse. Mr. Martin had been summoned to what the police described as a “termination meeting” at the warehouse where he had worked for at least 15 years. At least two victims were shot at the scene of that meeting. Four minutes later, the police arrived and were confronted by the gunman. Two of the first four officers to arrive were shot and transported to hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening. According to the police, Mr. Martin then retreated into the 29,000-square-foot building, hiding from officers in a machine shop near the back of the facility. It took about 90 minutes for officers to find, shoot and kill him. Scott Hall, the chief executive of Mueller Water Products, of which the Henry Pratt Company is a subsidiary, said that Friday was “the worst day our company has ever had.” Mr. Martin was being fired on Friday for a “culmination of various workplace rules violations,” he said, declining to describe the violations. The firing came at the end of a “progressive discipline process,” he said. The company conducted a background check upon Mr. Martin’s hiring 15 years ago that did not surface his felony conviction in Mississippi. Before Friday, there was no indication that Mr. Martin was violent. “If we have reason to believe that somebody is going to be violent, we take precautions,” he said. “I can only assume that we did not.” Family members of Mr. Martin arrived at the Aurora police station on Friday afternoon, weeping and hugging one another after officers told them that he was dead. “He was the shooter,” said Tameka Martin, who said she was Mr. Martin’s sister. “He shot officers. If they did shoot him and kill him, they were, I guess, defending themselves.” Ms. Martin said that her brother had told his family that he had lost his job at Henry Pratt. At dinner a few nights ago at their mother’s home, Mr. Martin would barely speak about it. He was “very depressed,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,Workers’ Activism Rises as China’s Economy Slows. Xi Aims to Rein Them In.,"BEIJING — Factory workers across China are staging sit-ins demanding unpaid wages for “blood and sweat.” Taxi drivers are surrounding government offices to call for better treatment. Construction workers are threatening to jump from buildings if they don’t get paid. With economic growth in China weakening to its slowest pace in nearly three decades, thousands of Chinese workers are holding small-scale protests and strikes to fight efforts by businesses to withhold compensation and cut hours. The authorities have responded with a sustained campaign to rein in the protests, and most recently detained several prominent activists in the southern city of Shenzhen late last month. Such protests are a glaring example of the challenges the sharp economic slowdown poses to China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, who has aggressively promoted the “Chinese dream,” his signature vision of greater wealth and a fairer society. Workers protested over unpaid wages at a construction site in Anhui Province this month. Cao Ping’an As Chinese families gather this week to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year in China, many workers say they are struggling to pay basic expenses like food and rent. “Nobody cares about us anymore,” said Zhou Liang, 46, who took part in a protest last month in Shenzhen outside an electronics factory that he says owes him more than $3,000. “I sacrificed my health for the company,” he said, “and now I can’t afford to buy even a bag of rice.” China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group in Hong Kong that tracks protests, recorded at least 1,700 labor disputes last year, up from about 1,200 the year before. Those figures represent only a fraction of disputes across China, since many conflicts go unreported and Mr. Xi has intensified censorship. The authorities have detained more than 150 people since August, a sharp increase from previous years, including teachers, taxi drivers, construction workers and leftist students leading a campaign against factory abuses. The unrest puts the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position. Since the days of Mao Zedong, the party has staked its reputation on protecting everyday workers, but increasingly many are blaming party officials for not doing more to defend their rights. As protests have multiplied, Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful leader since Mao, has sought to reassure workers that he understands their plight. “You are the most diligent, like diligent bees, traveling here and there and being exposed to the sun and rain,” he said on Friday as he ventured into the streets of Beijing to wish a happy new year to delivery workers, a photo opportunity that was heavily featured in the state-run media. “It’s not easy.” But experts warn that public trust in the party and Mr. Xi’s “Chinese dream” could suffer if he does not do more to help workers. “If teachers refuse to work, truck drivers stop delivering goods, construction workers stop building infrastructure, it will be hard to chase dreams,” said Diana Fu, an assistant professor of Asian politics at the University of Toronto. The unrest has also affected newer industries, including companies that provide food delivery and ride-sharing services, as workers complain of backbreaking schedules and low pay. Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, faces a variety of headwinds that are complicating his efforts to manage a smooth transition to a high-tech economy. Consumer and business confidence is falling, the housing market is sputtering and a trade dispute with the United States is dragging on. The government says the economy grew by 6.6 percent last year, the weakest pace of growth since 1990. Many experts, noting problems like declining property sales and sluggish factory activity, say the actual rate may be even lower. As economic forecasts have turned more sober, Mr. Xi has sought to defuse tensions by urging companies to pay salaries for low-income workers on time. The State Council, China’s cabinet, says it wants to eliminate wage arrears by next year. Labor protests in China are common, and to avoid protracted conflicts, local officials often put pressure on businesses to settle disputes. But companies may be more unwilling — or unable — to do so now as they struggle to find money. Mr. Xi has expanded the party’s oversight of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the party-controlled organ that is supposed to mediate disputes for its more than 300 million members but often sides with management. He has also dismantled nonprofit labor advocacy groups, which in the past provided advice to workers and helped with collective bargaining. In a crackdown in Shenzhen in late January, the authorities detained five veteran labor rights advocates and accused them of “disturbing public order,” a vague charge the party often uses against its critics. Now, with no independent unions, courts or news outlets to turn to, some workers are resorting to extreme measures to settle disputes. Wang Xiao, 33, a construction worker, grew tired of lobbying his bosses for more than $2,000 in unpaid wages for a project in the eastern province of Shandong. So last week he turned to social media, threatening to jump off the headquarters of the company overseeing the project. “If I get to the roof of the building and make a scene, then the money will be given to me more quickly,” he said in an interview. (Mr. Wang did not carry out his threat.) Despite the restrictions, activists have had some success in organizing protests across provincial lines, often with the help of social media. Crane operators across China coordinated a Labor Day strike last year that involved tens of thousands of workers from at least 10 provinces. But at a time of economic uncertainty and rising tensions with the West, Mr. Xi has emphasized social stability above all else. At a meeting on “risk prevention” last month, he called on provincial leaders and senior officials to redouble efforts to expand ideological and social control. Geoffrey Crothall, the communications director for China Labour Bulletin, said the country’s leaders were “taking a much more stringent approach to making sure that large-scale protests don’t happen again.” Chinese leaders see labor unrest as a potential political threat and are particularly sensitive to demonstrations because this year is the 30th anniversary of the military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square. Mr. Xi has particularly sought to suppress a resurgence of labor activism on college campuses, including a high-profile campaign for workers’ rights led by young communists at elite universities. The activists have used the teachings of Mao and Marx to argue that China’s embrace of capitalism has exploited workers. Last summer, they tried to help workers in southern China organize an independent labor union, saying that corrupt local officials were colluding with managers to abuse workers. The authorities have repeatedly tried to quash the protests, leading to the disappearances and detentions of more than 50 people associated with the campaign. The authorities have responded so forcefully to the young communists in part because their demands are ideological, not material, said Professor Fu, who has studied unrest in China. “To the government, calling out the party for not being Marxist is like children openly denouncing their birth parents,” she said. “It is seen as outright defiance and rejection of the state-led socialism.” But most workers are less focused on challenging the party than they are on trying to make ends meet. Song Zuhe, 50, who packages ceramic tile at a ceramic tile factory in southern China, says he is owed $1,500 in back pay and has not received a paycheck in three months. Mr. Song worries that he will not be able to pay medical bills for his wife or support his son. He recently posted on social media a poem he had written about his predicament: Work is hard and work is exhausting, I don’t have money to pay my way home, My life as a laborer is bitter. This year, when Mr. Song returned to his hometown in southwestern China to celebrate Lunar New Year with his family, they sat down to a small dinner of chicken and vegetables. “My burden is heavy,” he said. “It’s very tough.”",The New York Times
2019,Working for a New Normal in Italian Fashion’s Understanding of Race,"The Gucci blackface sweater and Dolce & Gabbana’s missteps in China have the knitwear designer Edward Buchanan seeking change. MILAN — At age 26, Edward Buchanan, an African-American graduate of Parsons School of Design, got his dream job: design director for Bottega Veneta. “I’d walk into factories with my dreadlocks, not speaking Italian,” he said with a laugh. “I was very green.” And he was received, he recalled, with “curious discomfort.” It was 1996. Twenty-two years later — and now the head of his own under-the-radar knitwear label, Sansovino 6, as well as a consultant for luxury fashion houses — he is still one of the few black men working in Italian fashion. “Every fashion house I worked at in Italy, or consulted for,” he said, “I was the only person of color on the design team.” But as Prada’s Sambo charm, Gucci’s blackface balaclava sweater and Dolce & Gabbana’s stereotypical videos on China roil the fashion world, the industry may finally be waking up to its lack of racial representation and cultural understanding. And Mr. Buchanan finds himself as an activist, a role he had not expected. “Many houses here don’t employ creatives of color,” said Mr. Buchanan, 48. “The conversations that I’m having, and I want to have, on this subject are super important.” Emanuele Farneti, editor of Vogue Italia, wrote in an email: “For many years, Italy, like other countries, has ignored the subject of diversity. You need the courage to admit it.” But, he continued, “In a historic moment in Italy in which a political agenda of selfishness and closure is prevailing, some encouraging signals are there. We’re growing a new generation of Italians who consider diversity the norm both in music and sport. We also hope in the fashion industry that so desperately needs it.” Certainly, things have changed — somewhat. Max Mara, where Mr. Buchanan once worked, has a senior designer from Sierra Leone who has been with the house since 2000 (company policy bars naming members of the design team). In October Roberto Cavalli, in partnership with the nonprofit organization Fra Noi, hired three refugees from Gambia, Pakistan and El Salvador to work in its pattern-cutting department, atelier and Just Cavalli’s style office. And Lawrence Steele, an African-American designer who is the associate creative director of Marni and who has lived and worked in Milan for years, said, “I’ve had no difficulties whatsoever in getting a job. They’ve happened spontaneously, and at the brands where I have worked, there has been a language of openness.” He said that Marni has long had a multicultural design team. But still, as the Milan fall shows open this week, there is only one designer of color on the official schedule: Stella Jean, a Haitian-Italian designer based in Rome who, in 2011, became the first black designer to win the Vogue Italia’s talent contest Who Is On Next. The Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana, the Italian fashion trade association, said it does not have statistics on the racial breakdown of industry workers in Italy. However, Carlo Capasa, the organization’s president, said he believed the issue was one of availability. “There aren’t so many designers of color showing here but not because it’s a problem of discrimination,” he said during an interview. “Traditionally Italy has been an extremely homogeneous population. Simply put, we don’t have a large population of color.” A spokesman for Italy’s National Institute of Statistics, which maintains the country’s census, said it would not release information about the racial makeup of the population. Mr. Buchanan is not entirely convinced. “There are loopholes in the system where creatives are not even arriving at the door. It’s the headhunters, the education system,” he said. “It’s not a question of hiring designers solely because of diversity’s sake. There are talented people of color in the system now, more than qualified for these jobs, and they’re not being selected.” So he has been addressing the reality in the most effective way he knows how: with a collection. He started in 2017 with the project “Check Your Neck,” featuring three jacquard scarves emblazoned with slogans: “Resist,” “Wake Up for Freedom” and “We Are All Migrants.” Mr. Buchanan gave them to the model Aymeline Valade and to his designer friends like Stefano Pilati; Riccardo Tisci and Marcelo Burlon, who is behind the County of Milan label and co-founder of the New Guards Group (its labels include Off-White and Palm Angels; LVMH is reportedly considering a stake). The scarves are sold on the Sansovino website for about $45 (the cost of manufacturing, Mr. Buchanan said) and with the request that customers post photos of themselves wearing the scarves or communicate in some way what the slogans mean to them. “After the elections here and in America, and living as a black man in Italy,” Mr. Buchanan said, “I wanted to question what was going on.” Now he’s trying to build on that momentum with a capsule women’s wear line he was scheduled to introduce on Wednesday. With 10 styles based on his favorite basics, including a dickey, biker shorts, leggings and a roll-neck sweater, the knitwear collection is being offered in hues that reflect a full spectrum of skin tones. The goal, Mr. Buchanan said, is to be the Fenty Beauty of knits — although this being the cashmere business, colors have names like shore (cream), vintage vicuña (brown) and hoopoe (pink.) “The first idea we own is the color of our skin,” Mr. Buchanan said. “Whether you’re Irish, Jamaican or Korean, I love the idea you put something on that blends with your skin.” In addition, dense fringes and multicolored jacquards on the sweaters are meant to symbolize the flags of countries like Germany, the United States and Italy, countries where immigrants often continue to be perceived as outsiders. “These settlers may be third generation but they inhabit the fringes of society,” Mr. Buchanan said. “I wanted to build awareness and question it.” Of that idea, Stephen Galloway, the Los Angeles-based choreographer and creative consultant who has known Mr. Buchanan since they met in 1998, quoted the rapper Q-Tip: ”People gravitate towards the truth sooner or later.” Mr. Galloway said he applied the quote “to Edward’s journey as a designer. It’s his time, the time is now.” Mr. Buchanan had a burst of fame during his time at Bottega, too, when he dressed the singer-songwriter Lauryn Hill. “Many companies weren’t giving clothing to hip-hop and R&B stars,” he said, “because they weren’t considered a valid reflection of existing consumers. I attempted to stomp that theory out.” At the time, he recalled, his network of fashion friends like Emil Wilbekin, a founding editor of Vibe magazine, and Marni Senofonte, an L.A.-based stylist, told him how luxury houses refused to lend their products and how the two were buying from stores to dress rhythm and blues performers. “I was fortunate because I had a high level of support and security on the inside,” Mr. Buchanan said, noting that Laura Moltedo, who owned Bottega at the time, approved of his actions. “There was no resistance from the top,” he said, “although things were different in the marketing department.” In 2001, after Bottega was sold to Gucci Group (now Kering), Mr. Buchanan left and opened his own clothing and accessories label, called Leflesh, which he designed with Manuela Morin, a close friend and former Bottega accessories designer. Described by the Italian journalist Angelo Flaccavento as, “a mix of Victoriana and R&B,” the fashion label garnered attention from Cher and Iman. Mr. Buchanan later left Italy for New York and went on to consult for Jennifer Lopez’s Sweetface line and Sean Combs’s Sean John collection, eventually closing Leflesh to concentrate on his outside work. In 2009 he returned to Milan and the following year he started Sansovino 6, naming the unisex cashmere line for the factory that produced it. The singer-songwriter Erykah Badu snapped up early pieces. Now Mr. Buchanan is hopeful the industry will start another conversation. Last week Prada announced plans to create an inclusion advisory committee led by the artist and activist Theaster Gates and the director Ava DuVernay. Mr. Buchanan described the move as “very positive,” although he noted that brands “tend to run to the upper echelons of celebrity when addressed with such issues’’ rather than turning for advice to people already working in the business. “A diverse design team has the power to nip cultural mistakes in the bud,” he said. “Words have the power to initiate introspection and real conversation, as well as immediate action for the future.” Ms. Jean, the Haitian-Italian designer, agreed. “To be multicultural is not just putting an African print on the runway,” she said. “Aesthetics are a channel but they’re not the end result.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Would Congress Care More if Parkland Had Been a Plane Crash?,"Seventeen of my classmates and teachers died in the Parkland shooting, yet lawmakers still drag their feet on controlling guns. Ms. Corin, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, is a founder of March For Our Lives. PARKLAND, Fla. — When I arrived at school on Feb. 14, 2018, like any junior, I was mostly caught up in Valentine’s Day chatter and events. But that all changed in the space of a few minutes that afternoon when a gunman opened fire on my classmates and my teachers, killing 17 of them and injuring just as many. Despite the countless tragedies you see on TV, nothing prepares you for the day it happens to your community. The familiar images of students fleeing their school as SWAT teams entered, of parents waiting by the perimeter desperately praying to get their kids back, were now my reality. They were my classmates and friends, too many of whom never came home. After the shooting, my friends at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and I decided we couldn’t sit by as school shootings and gun violence became a normal part of life in America. We were determined to turn an act of violence into a movement, to do everything we could to send a powerful message to the country and to Washington. There’s not a day that goes by that I’m not reminded of the shooting. When I hear the sound of sirens or fireworks, I’m taken back to that horrific afternoon. For me, Valentine’s Day will now forever be a reminder of loss. Yet our community isn’t alone in its tragedy. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans died as a result of guns, an average of 109 people a day. And according to a tally from Education Week, there were 24 school shootings that resulted in gun-related deaths or injuries in 2018 alone. While several states have taken positive legislative measures in response, there have been zero bipartisan investigations or new laws from Congress. Not a single federal law has been passed since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012 to address the crisis of school shootings. This year could be different — but only if we organize and insist on it. Last week, Congress held its first hearing on gun violence prevention since 2011. This week, the House Judiciary Committee is poised to approve a bipartisan bill to requiring background checks for all gun purchases, a proposal that represents one important step toward keeping deadly firearms out of the wrong hands. However, it’s also likely this bill won’t get a hearing, let alone a vote, in the Senate. That chamber’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, needs to explain to all of us who have survived a shooting or lost someone to gun violence why the Senate won’t even vote on such a bill even though there’s been over half a million gun deaths since 2000, the year I was born. And Americans should truly reckon with why this epidemic of gun deaths is treated so differently from any other health crisis in our country. Imagine for a moment that all these gun deaths were caused by something else widely feared: airplane crashes. There’s no universe in which we wouldn’t see it as a national emergency worthy of our undivided attention. In fact, 2017 was a remarkable year in aviation. No one died in a commercial airplane crash, meaning it was safer for me to fly than it was for me to go to high school. It would take hundreds of completely full Boeing 737 flights crashing without survivors to total the number of people who died by guns in America in just 2017. If even a handful of such crashes occurred, the government would declare a national emergency. All 737s would be grounded, there would be an independent commission created to investigate the crisis, and Boeing would be called before Congress to answer for its failures. So why then don’t more than 30,000 gun deaths in a year rise to the level of a national crisis for America’s conservative leaders? The past year has been one with the deepest of lows and, at times, the highest of highs — moments when the hope that springs from fighting for a better world makes anything feel possible. On Thursday, the anniversary of the shooting, I will be in the only place that matters, nestled in my community and with my family. And for the next four days, the organization I helped found, March For Our Lives, will go dark to honor those we lost and their memory. I am deeply proud of all that my friends and I have accomplished in the last year. Still, I can’t help but wonder why so many lawmakers are ignoring — and, at their worst, enabling — the horrific gun deaths that occur in our country each day. Jaclyn Corin, a founder of March For Our Lives, is a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Writers Guild Award Goes to a Film Snubbed by the Oscars,"The Carpetbagger Snubbed by the Oscars? The Writers Guild of America has got your back. In ceremonies held Sunday night on both coasts, the last major Hollywood guild to weigh in on this awards season added some new surprises to the mix: The original-screenplay winner was Bo Burnham for “Eighth Grade,” a film the Oscars overlooked entirely, while Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty won the adapted-screenplay prize for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” over several movies that are Oscar-nominated for best picture, including “BlacKkKlansman,” “Black Panther” and “A Star Is Born.” [Fill out your ballot for the Oscars.] “To the other nominees in the category: Have fun at the Oscars, losers!” Burnham joked upon receiving his WGA Award. Then, looking down at his award with evident amazement, he muttered, “What is happening?” For his film about an awkward middle-schooler, Burnham beat some stiff competition — best-picture front-runners “Roma” and “Green Book” were also-rans in his category — though it wasn’t the first time this season that the 28-year-old has notched an unexpected win: Earlier this month, Burnham also prevailed over “A Star Is Born” filmmaker Bradley Cooper for the Directors Guild’s first-timer prize. Holofcener seemed just as surprised by her film’s win. “It’s been a very long road,” she said in her acceptance speech, referring to a complicated back story. Holofcener was initially going to take the director’s chair, and Julianne Moore and Chris O’Dowd were cast as the leads. When that iteration fell apart, the director Marielle Heller came on board with new stars, Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant, who have both received Oscar nominations. The Writers Guild wins for both films shed little light on this year’s diffuse Oscar writing races: “The Favourite” was not eligible in the original-screenplay category due to guild rules, though it remains a strong contender for the Academy Award, while many pundits think “BlacKkKlansman” has a better shot at triumphing in the Oscar race for adapted screenplay since it would provide an opportunity for Spike Lee to win his first competitive Oscar. In any case, the writing awards underline that this is an Oscar season where anything can happen. The major Hollywood guilds have come to no consensus with their top prizes: The Producers Guild favored “Green Book,” the Directors Guild picked “Roma,” and “Black Panther” won the ensemble award from the Screen Actors Guild, while “The Favourite” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” both took home wins from the American Cinema Editors. Meanwhile, though “BlacKkKlansman” and “A Star Is Born” have notched no major wins, they were by far the most consistently nominated by guilds. With Oscar voting ending on Tuesday, this remains anyone’s game.",The New York Times
2019,Wynn Resorts Fined $20 Million Over Handling of Steve Wynn Misconduct Claims,"Sexual misconduct claims have toppled many powerful men in recent years, including the billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn. But few companies have faced regulatory fines for how they handled the accusations. On Tuesday, the Nevada Gaming Commission fined Wynn Resorts, the casino empire that Mr. Wynn founded and ran for years, $20 million for ignoring multiple complaints about his behavior. The fine, which the commission approved unanimously, is the largest imposed against a gambling licensee in Nevada. The previous record was $5.5 million in 2014. “It demonstrates a recognition that papering over sexual harassment and assault is a form of corporate corruption that is within the scope of regulators’ jurisdiction,” said Emily Martin, the vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. “It is an important reflection of the fact that, while harassment and assault harms victims and they need to be compensated, it also has broader harms.” Mr. Wynn resigned as the company’s chairman and chief executive last February after a Wall Street Journal report described a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct, including accusations that he pressured employees for sex. He was not paid severance and liquidated his shares in Wynn Resorts. Mr. Wynn, 77, denied the allegations, but faced immediate and intense backlash. He resigned as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his name was removed from university buildings and programs. Shareholders filed multiple lawsuits, and several regulatory agencies began investigations into the allegations. Last month, Wynn Resorts and the Nevada Gaming Commission reached a settlement that allowed the company to keep its gambling license. The company acknowledged allegations, laid out by the agency, that several executives and board members had known about complaints against Mr. Wynn. Those complaints included an accusation from a former salon employee that Mr. Wynn raped her and made her pregnant, a claim he paid $7.5 million in 2005 to settle. A cocktail server said Mr. Wynn had pressured her to have sex from 2005 to 2006, resulting in a $975,000 settlement with Mr. Wynn but no investigation by the company, according to the gaming commission. Wynn Resorts said in a statement that it had gone through a “paradigm shift” over the past year and “refreshed its culture.” It said that women now made up nearly half its board and that it had removed all employees who were aware of but did not act on the allegations against Mr. Wynn. “The completion of the review by Nevada regulators is an important step forward, and we deeply appreciate the trust and confidence they have placed in the new leadership of Wynn Resorts to grow and prosper,” the company said. The allegations against Mr. Wynn raised concerns that damage to the company’s reputation could imperil lucrative Wynn properties in Macau and a development project in Massachusetts. Companies are often held legally liable in sexual misconduct cases. CBS has made multiple payouts to women with harassment and sexual assault claims. Fox News also struck agreements to settle sexual harassment allegations against Bill O’Reilly. But regulatory fines in such situations are uncommon, said Ms. Martin, the legal expert. The gaming commission’s involvement in the Wynn case, she said, shows “the cultural shift that has caused these matters to be taken seriously as issues of corporate governance as well as individual behavior.”",The New York Times
2019,XPO Logistics Will Close Warehouse Where Some Pregnant Workers Miscarried,"XPO Logistics will close a Memphis warehouse where employees had complained about widespread discrimination and a number of pregnant workers had miscarriages. The company said it would close the site because Verizon, whose cellphones and other products XPO ships from the warehouse, had decided to stop using the facility. The moves followed a New York Times report into working conditions there. More than 400 XPO employees will lose their jobs. “Our presence in the Memphis community remains strong, and we have new jobs available for the majority of these employees in our 11 other local facilities,” Lissa Perlman, an XPO spokeswoman, said in a statement on Thursday. Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman, said the company would continue to work with XPO at other sites. “We’re constantly evaluating the needs of our business and make adjustments accordingly,” he said. “There is nothing unique about this transition.” The Teamsters union, which has been trying to organize workers at the warehouse, said the closing was retaliation against employees who publicized incidents of sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination. The group’s organizing efforts there have been underway since 2017, when a worker collapsed and died of cardiac arrest on the warehouse floor. In October, The Times reported that six women had miscarriages after lifting heavy boxes at the warehouse and being denied breaks from physically intense work. Some of the episodes occurred while the warehouse was operated by another company, New Breed Logistics, which XPO bought in 2014. Workers at the site lift boxes weighing up to 45 pounds. The facility does not have air-conditioning, and indoor temperatures in the summer can rise past 100 degrees. “They are just cutting and running and closing the place instead of addressing the problem of pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment,” Jim Hoffa, the Teamsters president, said in an interview. Mr. Hoffa said the Teamsters were considering filing a formal complaint about the warehouse’s closing with the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that handles labor disputes. Lakeisha Nelson, an employee at the XPO facility, has been vocal about conditions there. “The warehouse is closing because management chose to run this place like it’s their personal plantation, rather than running it like it’s a company,” she said Thursday. After The Times published its article, nine senators wrote to XPO and Verizon demanding that the companies address the allegations. Two weeks later, nearly 100 members of the House called for an investigation by its Committee on Education and the Workforce into working conditions at the facility. In a statement on Thursday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the senators who organized the letter to the companies, said the move “reeks of retaliation.” Federal law prohibits employers from firing workers or closing a facility to punish employees for organizing a union or for collectively complaining about workplace conditions. XPO said previously that it had asked an independent law firm to look into the pregnancy accommodation issues, and it announced new policies for accommodating pregnant workers in addition to more generous parental leave. In a letter sent to employees on Wednesday, XPO told workers that their “employment will terminate during a two-week period commencing on April 15, 2019.” XPO and Verizon said their decisions were unrelated to the Times article or efforts to organize workers.",The New York Times
2019,Xavier Becerra on His State of the Union Response,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Tonight, President Trump will deliver his State of the Union address. Immigration is expected to be a major theme of the night, though officials have been hesitant to say much about what’s in his speech. Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California, who has made his office the center of the Golden State’s resistance to the Trump administration, will be watching the speech closely — and preparing for his own. He was chosen to deliver the Democrats’ Spanish-language response to the State of the Union, a practice that dates back to 2011, and is seen as a kind of audition for ambitious political figures. I talked to Mr. Becerra, who’s set to deliver his response from his alma mater, C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento. Here’s our conversation, condensed and edited for clarity. Jill Cowan: What are you expecting to hear from President Trump, and what will be your response? Xavier Becerra: I suspect it’ll be vintage Donald Trump, whatever year of the vintage we’re going to get. And I suspect we’re going to hear a lot about walls; I suspect we’re going to hear a lot about “No collusion.” We’ll probably hear that everything’s been a wild success and I think I’ll be ready to talk about what’s really going on in America. Your office has been seen as a leader in California’s fights with the Trump administration. What’s the count of lawsuits you’ve filed against the administration? I think we’re at about 45. What do you consider your most important battle? It is hard to narrow, because so many of these are consequential — these aren’t lawsuits that affect just a small community or part of California. Most of these lawsuits impact the entire state, plus people outside. I suspect that because health care has become such an expensive commodity and finally we were beginning to find the secret sauce on it, our defense of the Affordable Care Act for not just Californians, but every American carries consequences that reverberate way beyond just one state. What do you consider your biggest victory so far in any of those lawsuits? We’ve had success on the health care side, stopping some of the erosion of services under the Affordable Care Act — for example, women’s reproductive rights services. We were able to get injunctions to stop the Trump administration from eliminating some of those services. That was critical. The protection of all people, if they want to give service in the military, to our government, they should be able to regardless of their gender identity status. I think the victories we’ve had so far in our litigation on the census, which could easily be the most consequential because it impacts trillions of dollars and hundreds of millions of people. Those successes today, I hope will lead to a thorough trial that will lead us to the right conclusion. I suspect it’s going to get all the way to the Supreme Court. What do you hope Californians or any Americans take away from your speech? What do you hope that they feel? Major takeaways from the speech will be that it’s an opportunity for everyone in America to hear what the state of the union is and to hear the other side. Today, it’s pretty commonplace to have the response in Spanish — 20 years ago it would’ve been a bit of a surprise to people. I think that’s a great sign about where America’s heading. We want every American to understand where the country is, for everybody to be included. That message, just the fact that there’s a response to the State of the Union in Spanish is a truly critical message we’re sending throughout America — especially for those that are going to rely on a Spanish language response. I think they’re going to feel like they count. Is there anything you anticipate you’ll have to respond to besides “the wall,” related to immigration? What are your key points about immigration? I wish I could fact check quick enough to be able to respond. There’s always good, bad and ugly about anything in life. I think it’s important to give a true and candid picture and not to try to mask or misrepresent what the state of our union is. • The back-and-forth over whether the address would happen in the midst of a historic government shutdown was driven by a rival who’s managed to flummox Mr. Trump more than most: Representative Nancy Pelosi.

2019,Xi Jinping’s New Year Tour: Dumplings and Riot Gear,"BEIJING — He cooked dumplings with families, made small talk with delivery workers and tried out riot gear with the police. President Xi Jinping of China sought to project an image as a strong and folksy leader during a two-day tour of Beijing ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Tuesday. Facing a slowing economy at home and a trade war with the United States, he used the occasion to defend his policies, including his efforts to create jobs and the Communist Party’s increasingly tight grip on society. Here are the highlights. China Central Television Mr. Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, rarely mingles with the public. But ahead of the Year of the Pig, he made an exception, visiting a famous Beijing alleyway on Friday to hang decorations with residents and make dumplings, a favorite New Year food. The visit was yet another attempt by Mr. Xi to be seen as sympathetic to the struggles of ordinary people. With China’s economy slowing after years of breakneck growth, he does not want to risk being seen as out of touch. In the alleyway, Mr. Xi asked about the cost of electricity, wished a restaurant owner success and patted children on the head. Later, he spoke with delivery workers, comparing them to “diligent honeybees,” and vowed to create more jobs. Mr. Xi is often portrayed as a transformative, paternalistic figure on a pedestal with Mao. During his visit to the alleyway, his words were met with smiles and energetic applause. Critics say Mr. Xi’s propaganda efforts risk creating a Mao-style personality cult. While Mr. Xi cannot yet match Mao’s dominance over daily life, there are some similarities, including the use of endearing nicknames. At one point during his visit, an older woman in the crowd urged a young girl to refer to Mr. Xi as “yeye,” or grandpa. China Central Television It was perhaps no surprise that Mr. Xi’s New Year tour prominently featured a visit with soldiers. Since rising to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has tried to forge a close relationship with the military. He has led a sweeping overhaul of its ranks, purging commanders and installing allies to key posts. Mr. Xi on Friday also visited a police command center, where he spoke about the importance of maintaining social stability. He has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks of the need to tighten control of society, in part because of a number of sensitive political anniversaries this year. On Saturday, he joined soldiers as they raised a flag in the Forbidden City. He inspected their dormitories, asking whether they were warm enough with only one layer of quilts. The reviews by the state-run news media were rapturous: “The soldiers stood by President Xi’s side filled with happiness and joy.” October commemorates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre falls in June. Party leaders are probably concerned about widespread protests. To emphasize his call for stability at the command center, Mr. Xi picked up a riot shield and held it in front of his body. China Central Television Mr. Xi’s signature phrase is the “Chinese dream,” a nationalistic promise of prosperity and rejuvenation for China and its people. He often invokes the term in describing his vision for the economy, politics, science and foreign affairs. During a visit to a training center for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing, Mr. Xi made clear that achieving success in athletics was also central to the “Chinese dream.” The Olympics are a source of national pride as Beijing will become the first city to host both the Winter and Summer Games. Many see the games as a sign of China’s rising power and prominence on the global stage. “If sports are strong,” Mr. Xi told the crowd of athletes, “then the country will be strong.”",The New York Times

2019,"Xinjiang, Labour Party, Venezuela: Your Friday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. China builds a database of Uighurs’ DNA, an ex-spy chief turns on Venezuela’s president and a fire in Bangladesh fits a disturbing pattern. Here’s the latest: China is collecting genetic material as part of a vast campaign of oppression against Muslim minority groups. Human rights groups and Uighur activists say the DNA could be used to chase down anyone who resists conforming. To help build out the DNA database, China used equipment from a U.S. company, Thermo Fisher, and got material from a prominent Yale geneticist for comparing Uighur DNA with genetic material from people around the world. How it unfolded: Under the guise of free medical checkups in the western region of Xinjiang, where much of the population is Uighur, the government collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data of tens of millions of people. In some cases, people were told the checkups were mandatory. Background: In 2016, the government set out to make Uighurs and other minority groups more subservient to the Communist Party, detaining up to a million people in what it calls “re-education” camps. The response: Thermo Fisher said it would stop selling equipment in Xinjiang. And the Yale researcher said he had believed that the Chinese authorities were operating within scientific norms that require the informed consent of DNA donors. Wavertree — a tiny, multiethnic, mostly working-class constituency in Liverpool, England — is at the center of a national row over whether anti-Semitism is rife in the Labour Party. Luciana Berger, the member of Parliament for the area, resigned this week after local Labour activists called her a “disruptive Zionist” and a supporter of a “murdering” Israeli government. She is one of eight Labour defectors who quit in protest of their left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, criticizing his ambiguity over Britain’s exit from the European Union and accusing him of tolerating anti-Semitism in the party. Details: Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said that the party is investigating the Wavertree branch. Bigger picture: Mr. Corbyn’s supporters, many of them Jewish, deny that he has brooked prejudice, arguing that instances of anti-Semitism in the party have fallen since he became leader and that criticizing the Israeli government, as Mr. Corbyn does unapologetically, does not equate to a hatred of Jews. Critics say there is anti-Semitism under the surface, as when a Labour lawmaker suggested that the defectors might have had financial backing from Israel. A former Venezuelan intelligence chief called President Nicolás Maduro a dictator with a corrupt inner circle, one of the most public rejections to date. In interviews with The Times, the former spy chief, Hugo Carvajal, urged the military to break with Mr. Maduro ahead of a showdown with the opposition on Saturday, when tons of aid from the U.S. and other countries is slated to arrive. U.S. investigators have accused Mr. Carvajal of drug trafficking. In interviews, he denied those claims, but depicted other senior Venezuelan officials as a criminal claque in league with drug traffickers. Other developments: To thwart aid shipments, Mr. Maduro ordered the closing of Venezuela’s border with Brazil, having already blocked air and sea traffic from three Caribbean islands. Pope Francis, his moral authority in question and his papal legacy in the balance, opened a historic four-day conference at the Vatican to address child sexual abuse in the church. “We hear the cry of the little ones,” he said. Before 190 church leaders, he called for “concrete and effective measures” to address clerical sexual abuse. Victims are putting enormous pressure on the Vatican to take action on an issue that in some parts of the world has eroded trust in the Roman Catholic Church while being ignored and denied in others. Other issues: The conference is shadowed by a series of fresh scandals: the sexual abuse of nuns, the shaming and closeting of gay priests, and revelations that the church has secret guidelines for dealing with priests who father children. Mueller investigation: The special counsel is expected to submit his report to the attorney general within weeks. In an Op-Ed, the acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama argues that it will probably act as a “road map” for more investigations, rather than the beginning of their end. Syria: The White House said it would keep 200 U.S. troops in the country, reversing a vow of a full withdrawal. India: The country appears determined to follow through on a threat to cut back Pakistan’s water supply after two recent attacks on Indian troops in Kashmir. A top official said the Indus River, which provides water for hundreds of millions of people across the subcontinent, could be diverted. Bangladesh: An inferno on Wednesday night claimed at least 110 lives in a historic neighborhood in Dhaka, adding to the toll of hundreds who have died in the country in recent years in fires that tore through crowded, unsafe structures. A promised crackdown on building violations, which are abetted by greed and corruption, has fallen short. Johnson & Johnson: The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating concerns about possible asbestos contamination of the company’s popular baby powder and other talc-based products. The company faces about 13,000 lawsuits around the world in which its body powders are blamed for causing ovarian cancer or mesothelioma. Green New Deal: A proposal by congressional Democrats for a “10-year national mobilization” to make the U.S. carbon-neutral would cost trillions of dollars and probably take longer than that — but it would be feasible and a major victory against global warming, experts and economists told us. Jussie Smollett: After his arrest in Chicago on Wednesday over accusations that he staged a homophobic and racist attack on himself, the actor was said to be back at work on the Fox show “Empire,” raising awkward questions for Fox about the future of his character and the show itself. Prosecutors have said he was upset by his salary and seeking publicity. Spain: RiFF, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Valencia, has closed indefinitely as health officials investigate the death of a woman who ate there. Spanish news outlets reported that the restaurant had been tied to as many as 28 cases of food poisoning. Space: Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft landed on an asteroid and fired a bullet to help with the gathering of samples. And an Israeli company’s lander blasted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, aiming to become the first private craft to land on the moon. Academy Awards: Our expert has been closely following the races and the voters, all season. Here’s what he thinks will happen at the Oscars ceremony on Sunday. Karl Lagerfeld’s cat: Choupette, the designer’s immensely pampered and incredibly famous white Birman, is expected to receive a substantial inheritance. Tips for a more fulfilling life.

2019,Y.A. Thrillers That Put Teenagers to the Test,"Children’s Books With thrillers on the rise in young adult literature, novelists are asking a question that adult authors and filmmakers have posed for years: “Who can you really trust?” The difference is that with Y.A., the answer generally isn’t nobody. It’s not that the stakes aren’t high for teenagers. In four new novels, love, friendship and identity prove to be fraught — even deadly — propositions. Still, at some point in their struggle, the main characters decide to trust someone. And that, as the poet says, makes all the difference. S. E. Grove’s provocative new novel, THE WANING AGE (Viking, 273 pp., $18.99; ages 12 and up), isn’t overtly political, but it extrapolates from what might gently be called the downward trend in empathy in some pockets of America. Natalia Peña is an 18-year-old hotel maid living in San Francisco in a dystopian near-future. In her desensitized world, people lose all capacity for emotion at about 10, psychotic gangs called Fish ravage the city, and hateful 1-percenters buy “synaffs” from a pharmaceutical behemoth named RealCorp just so they can feel. Love, fury and agony have become playthings and status symbols — Botox for the heart. This being a dystopian novel, the folks at RealCorp clearly aren’t the good guys. Early on, Natalia discovers that they’ve kidnapped her precious 11-year-old brother, Calvino, for testing. Calvino has never “waned,” possibly because of the trauma surrounding his mom’s death. He is a true empath and hence an invaluable lab rat. Grove, author of the “Mapmakers” trilogy, mixes action, noir, brain science and moral philosophy here. The book has its shaggy moments, as when it bogs down by distinguishing emotions from instincts. But at its best, “The Waning Age” is visceral and disarmingly smart. Natalia’s quest to free Cal — and Cal’s increasingly desperate loneliness at RealCorp — becomes gripping. And Grove refuses to write down to her audience, which makes her kin to her main character. Natalia may just barely remember what it means to feel, but she’s as defiant and loyal a big sister as anyone could ask for. It’s been said that there are only seven plots in existence: the slaying of a monster, the rise from rags to riches and so on. Karen M. McManus’s debut smash, “One of Us Is Lying,” a crackling murder mystery about high school detention, reminded us to add an eighth to the list: “The Breakfast Club.” Her new novel, TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET (IF ONE IS DEAD) (Delacorte, 352 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), may be titled and packaged to look as much like a sequel as the law will allow, but it’s actually a different beast — unfortunately, a tamer one. The new novel is set in Echo Ridge, Vt., that “Echo” being a wink from the author: It seems that whoever killed the homecoming queen five years ago has either returned or inspired a gloating copycat now targeting this year’s festivities. “Two” unspools more slowly than “One,” and the mystery doesn’t deepen as the townspeople gossip — it just gets more convoluted. We warm to the alternating narrators as they warm to each other: Malcolm, “the band nerd with the disreputable family,” and Ellery, the true-crime buff whose mom is in rehab. But there’s a solar system of others meant to distract us from the true killer and, honestly, they’re just kind of distracting. McManus is a gifted writer with a devious mind for crime. She could have done more to transform these scary-movie tropes, just as she jolted “The Breakfast Club.” Both her novels trade on the idea that even teenagers have secrets worth lying and possibly dying for — which is empowering, in an odd way. But “Two Can Keep a Secret” is a holding gesture rather than an advance. Read it, but know that McManus has more electrifying novels to come. What are heroic knights supposed to do once they’ve finished saving the kingdom and it’s time to break up the band? Open a theme restaurant? Release solo albums? E. K. Johnston’s sly, funny, foamy adventure THE AFTERWARD (Dutton, 337 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up) intertwines a quest to vanquish an evil old god with the aftermath of the expedition, in which our heroes try to establish a new normal in a world where people sing ballads about their awesomeness. “The Afterward” is written as Arthurian high fantasy and takes place in a land called Cadrium, which, appealingly, doesn’t have our dogmatic notions of gender and sexuality. Virtually everyone in the brave cast of characters is a young woman or identifies as such. What pulls you along, more than the scuffling over an all-powerful “godsgem,” is the love story between the thrill-seeking thief named Olsa and the stouthearted apprentice Kalanthe, whom she sweetly refers to as “my brave nearly-a-knight.” The structure of “The Afterward” is trickier than it needs to be. It not only moves back and forth through time but also alternates between first and third person. (Whoever decided that the book could forgo the convention of putting characters’ names at the beginning of each chapter they narrated was … incorrect.) But the gender flip is effortless and enlivening: “I leaned into her, and she looked down at me. Then, because I was a thief, I stole a kiss.” Even the less vivid chapters have rousing set pieces, and Johnston’s love for storytelling is catching. Here’s hoping “The Afterward” becomes the first in a series. Kalanthe and Olsa’s happily ever after will be like no one else’s. The first test of a whodunit is how heart-stopping and strange a thing has actually been dun. In SPIN (Scholastic, 400 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up) Lamar Giles (no relation) nails the murder: An up-and-coming young D.J. named Paris Secord is found in an “almost religious” tableau, slumped over her turntables and bleeding from the head. Giles also puts a pair of memorable “detectives” on the case: two of Paris’s sharp-elbowed high school friends, Kya and Fuse, who formerly vied for her attention. The girls try to set aside their mutual distrust and team up to solve their friend’s killing, partly to exonerate themselves but mostly because they don’t trust the police to understand how deeply Paris’s life mattered. “Spin” has jolts and misdirection. It has duplicitous bloggers, avaricious music executives and sadistic fans in white masks. But what’s even more impressive is the subtle stuff you almost don’t notice because Giles wears his intellect so lightly: the masterly knowledge of hip-hop and R&B; the command of technology’s uses and abuses; the discerning ear for the way high schoolers talk, both to one another and to grown-ups. Giles understands the complex force field between generations. He knows that when parents and grandparents say they “expect more” from teenagers, it’s often because they haven’t bothered to figure out who the teenagers actually are. A two-time nominee for an Edgar (as in Allan Poe) award, Giles is also a terrific plotter. Yes, there’s a character who so obviously might be the murderer that he/she can’t possibly be the murderer. But evaluating suspects is part of the ritual and the fun, and everyone here feels palpably real. At one point, someone compares Kya and Fuse to Veronica Mars. He may not know what a compliment that is. “Spin” champions the resourcefulness of teenagers and pities the grown-ups — villainous or just clueless — who underestimate them. An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of the protagonist of “The Waning Age.” She is Natalia Peña, not Natalie.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Enter Spring Training With a Bitter Taste and High Expectations,"TAMPA, Fla. — Nearly an hour before Yankees Manager Aaron Boone sat down for his first news conference of spring training on Wednesday, a sports book released its early odds for the 2019 World Series champion. Granted, the baseball world is still waiting on free agents such as Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and Craig Kimbrel to be signed, but as teams are currently constructed, the Yankees were listed as the favorites to win the 2019 World Series — ahead of their division rivals and defending champion Boston Red Sox. Still, the glowing potential of the 2019 season hasn’t entirely washed away the pain of how 2018 ended, with Boone and many of his players watching as those very Red Sox, who eliminated the Yankees in the American League divisional round, went on to win it all. “I’ve always been a fan of the game and watched the postseason,” said Boone, a former player and television broadcaster. “This year was a little more difficult. I made a point to watch even the World Series and watch the Red Sox celebrate. I don’t know if I was torturing myself or not.” A significant page will turn on Thursday morning, when Boone will address the Yankees’ pitchers and catchers (position players are not officially expected in camp until Monday). Boone said that, while he expected to mostly speak from the heart, he had a few messages to convey. The team’s sky-high expectations will be among them. It helps, in Boone’s mind, that the Yankees’ roster has only gotten deeper after winning 100 games last season in his first year as a manager. Although the Yankees whiffed on signing Patrick Corbin, the top free agent starting pitcher, they dumped the struggling right-hander Sonny Gray and brought back the veterans C.C. Sabathia ($8 million for one year) and J.A. Happ ($34 million for two years), while trading for the oft-injured but talented James Paxton. Luis Severino, who said he lost 15 pounds by eating healthier this winter after an up-and-down 2018, will most likely start opening day for the Yankees. “It’s obviously a better team,” starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka said through an interpreter. Beyond the rotation, the Yankees retained Zack Britton ($39 million over three years) and signed Adam Ottavino ($27 million over three years) to pair with Aroldis Chapman, Dellin Betances and Chad Green in what is likely to be the best bullpen in baseball. “In every season, even in the best of seasons — I don’t know exactly what the numbers are — but you’re going to need about 30, 40 or up to 50 guys that make serious contributions to a club,” Boone said. “We feel like we’re in the pretty good position to have guys come in and step up.” The infield may be more fluid than before because shortstop Didi Gregorius is recovering from Tommy John surgery, and is not expected to return until this summer. Troy Tulowitzki, 34, a former all-star shortstop whom the Yankees acquired in January, will get the first crack at filling in for Gregorius, but he, too, has injury concerns — returning from two heel surgeries that forced him to miss all of the 2018 season. Boone said he would be cautious with Tulowitzki’s spring training schedule “and even early in the season.” Should Tulowitzki struggle, Boone said he would slide Gleyber Torres from second base to shortstop, and use DJ LeMahieu, another newcomer, at second base. If not, LeMahieu will bounce around the infield, even providing backup for Miguel Andujar at third base. At first base, Luke Voit leads the competition for the starting job over Greg Bird, who struggled with injuries and hitting last season, while Voit ended the season on a hitting tear. Then there is the potential for growth from players who underperformed last season, such as catcher Gary Sanchez, who is coming off his worst season in the majors and had an operation on his non-throwing shoulder in the off-season. And even amid all that depth, the roster still includes obvious weak spots. The Yankees will go slow with Sabathia, who is 38 and entering his final major-league season, since his off-season training was slowed by knee and heart surgeries. Boone said Sabathia’s first bullpen session would not take place for a couple more weeks. Another reason to avoid any rush: Sabathia still must serve a five-game suspension for throwing at Jesus Sucre of the Tampa Bay Rays last September. Of all the announcements Boone made on Wednesday, the least surprising one involved Jacoby Ellsbury. Boone said Ellsbury, who has two years and more than $42 million left on his contract, and who has not played since the end of the 2017 season because of injuries, would not join the Yankees in Tampa until next month because of an issue with the plantar fascia in one of his feet. But Ellsbury was never likely to figure significantly into a packed outfield. The Yankees have Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Hicks and Brett Gardner as the primary options in the outfield. It all adds up to, on paper at least, the trappings of a contending team. But a long road lies ahead. “It’s early February,” Boone said. “So in a lot of ways, the talk about it is cheap. We have tremendous expectations and we rightfully have those expectations but we’ve got to go out and do it.” INSIDE PITCH Luis Severino declined to address his pending arbitration hearing with the Yankees nor a report that the sides had held preliminary discussions over a contract extension. Severino, who will turn 25 next week, is eligible for salary arbitration in 2019 for the first time in his career, and will not be a free agent until after the 2022 season. He filed for a 2019 salary of $5.25 million with the Yankees countering at $4.4 million.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Fan Selling Gehrig Items to Pay His Red Sox-Loving Grandkids’ College Costs,"WOODBRIDGE, Conn. — Among the family and wedding photos in Bob and Jill Ellis’s living room are black-and-white shots of Lou Gehrig, the Yankees’ legendary first baseman who died in 1941 at age 37. No, Gehrig was not a member of the family, said Mr. Ellis, 76, “but there’s always been something of a family connection.” Elsewhere in the house, in Woodbridge, Conn., just outside New Haven, there is a photo in the bathroom of Gehrig clowning with his Yankees teammate Babe Ruth and a painting in the dining room that Gehrig was given during a 1931 trip to Japan. These, and many other of Gehrig’s personal items, have been in the family since Gehrig’s mother died in 1954 and willed them to Ms. Ellis’s parents, who were her friends and neighbors in Westchester County and Connecticut in the 1940s and 1950s, said Mr. Ellis, a retired IBM manager. Now the items are part of an online auction being held by Heritage Auctions, with bidding lasting through this weekend. The Gehrig mementos include one of his game caps and baseballs autographed by the likes of Hall of Famers Ruth and Ty Cobb, as well as many personal documents and dozens of original photos, including the earliest known shots of Gehrig as a child. “This is part of Lou Gehrig’s history and it’s been sitting for decades in attics and closets,” Mr. Ellis said. “A lot of the stuff is personal and really tells his story.” The online auction provides a rare opportunity for the general public to see some of these items. “It gives you that extra glimpse into the personal life of Gehrig and his family that you wouldn’t have been able to see otherwise,” said Rob Rosen, vice president of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions. Previous viewings were limited to a handful of people in the area when Mr. Ellis would occasionally pull the items out of an old 500-pound safe in his basement and show them at the local Kiwanis Club or a school, or when he invited a few older fans to his house for a drink. He always offered the baseball hat for a try-on and photo opportunity, he said, because, “That was such a one-of-a-kind cap, and this was a way that they could sort of touch Lou Gehrig.” The hat still has its shape, along with Gehrig’s name stitched into its leather brim. Auction officials are predicting it could bring upward of $200,000. The entire collection could yield more than $400,000, Mr. Rosen said. Gehrig items have drawn large sums in the past, including a jersey he wore that sold for $870,000 at auction, and his rookie contract with the Yankees in 1924, which sold for $480,000, Mr. Rosen said. Mr. Ellis lives midway between Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, in Boston, near the theoretical border that divides Red Sox Nation from rivals in Yankees territory, where geographic baseball loyalties are mixed. Mr. Ellis is a Yankees fan, but his son and daughter root for the Red Sox. “If they had been die-hard Yankee fans, I’d have more reason to keep the collection,” he said. Instead, despite their Red Sox loyalty, he will give money from the auction to his grandchildren who are heading off to college. And so these Red Sox fans will benefit from proceeds received from selling an old Christmas card Ruth sent Gehrig, in which Ruth uses bats to spell out “Merry Christmas” on the field as Santa looks from the edge of the Yankees dugout. The college fund will also be enriched by a signed registration slip for the 1926 Peerless coupe Gehrig bought shortly after joining the Yankees. The collection also includes a 1933 letter from Gehrig to National City Bank of New Rochelle, listing his financial holdings and itemizing the stocks he was amassing while compiling his career home run total of 493 and his .340 lifetime batting average over 17 years with the Yankees. Playing in 2,130 consecutive games helped earn Gehrig the nickname the Iron Horse. Gehrig retired in 1939 and, stricken with a terminal disease, he stood before fans at Yankee Stadium on July 4 of that year during an appreciation day and declared himself the “luckiest man on the face of the earth.” It is one of the more poignant moments in baseball history and was immortalized in the 1942 film “The Pride of the Yankees” with Gary Cooper. Two years later, Gehrig died, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neuromuscular disorder that came to be known as “Lou Gehrig’s disease.” Gehrig grew up poor in Upper Manhattan and lived and played in New York nearly his entire life. “He was a New Yorker through and through, from his accent to his public schooling,” said Jonathan Eig, who wrote the 2005 Gehrig biography “Luckiest Man.” “Between the time he spent in New York, and his talent, he may be the greatest New York athlete of all time.” Since Gehrig was a relatively private man who died young, left few survivors and never wrote a memoir, any additional artifacts are considered valuable contributions to his legacy, Mr. Eig said. Gehrig played baseball for Columbia University when games were played on campus between the stately buildings in the Morningside Heights neighborhood in Manhattan in the early 1920s. He joined the Yankees in 1923, the same year the first Yankee Stadium opened. He and Ruth became the home run-hitting heroes of New York. He bought a house in New Rochelle, just north of New York City, for himself and his working-class German-born parents, Heinrich and Christina Gehrig. A small pendant in the Ellises’ collection attests to Gehrig’s membership in the New Rochelle Elks Lodge. When he married in 1933, he and his wife, Eleanor, bought a house nearby at 9 Meadow Lane, a Queen Anne-style home with four bedrooms. The house has changed little over the years and is currently up for sale, for $589,000. One problem is that the open houses often draw more Gehrig fans than serious buyers, said Glorianne Mattesi, a real estate agent who is showing the house. “For some people, it’s a bonus that it was his house,” she said. “For others, the draw is just the charm of a vintage home with high ceilings and a lot of space.” A well-known aspect of Gehrig’s personal life was that he was a mama’s boy, and that his overprotective mother never took to Eleanor. Among the items that Mr. Ellis did not put up for sale are Christina Gehrig’s birth certificate and her will, as well as legal briefs in the lawsuits between her and Eleanor over Lou Gehrig’s life insurance policy after his death. As for the trove that he is selling off, he said: “It all helps tell Lou Gehrig’s story and I’m glad the public is getting to see it.”",The New York Times
2019,"Yankees Secure Aaron Hicks With 7-Year, $70 Million Deal","TAMPA, Fla. — In the past two weeks, the Yankees have kept their word about locking up their current collection of young talent before they reach free agency: first with a contract extension for the staff ace Luis Severino and then, on Monday, signing a new deal with center fielder Aaron Hicks. The deal, which is for seven years and $70 million, is the largest contract extension for the Yankees (not including re-signing free-agent players) since Derek Jeter’s 10-year, $189 million deal in 2001. “It was a fair deal for both sides,” Hicks said at a news conference before Monday’s spring training game here in Tampa. “This is an organization I want to stay with. I want to be on this team. It has a great future.” [Read more: The Yankees Have a Tantalizing Young Core. Can They Keep It Intact?] Hicks, 29, was scheduled to make $6 million in 2019, his final year before free agency. With his new deal, he will make $8 million this season and then see a raise to nearly $10 million a year for the next six. The deal also includes a $12.5 million team option or a $1 million buyout for the 2026 season. When the Yankees acquired Hicks from the Minnesota Twins in a 2015 trade, he was an unrefined talent. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman praised Hicks on Monday for being receptive to information and coaching from the Yankees, while Hicks himself credited better training and nutrition for his improvement. With a more selective approach at the plate, the switch-hitting Hicks produced the best seasons of his career the past two years. He had career highs with 27 home runs and 79 runs batted in last season despite playing only 137 games — which was another career high, as he has been plagued by injuries. Some advanced metrics rated Hicks the sixth best center fielder in baseball the past two seasons, during which he hit .255 with an .838 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He also patrolled the outfield with one of the best arms in the sport. “Aaron Hicks is maybe the most underrated player in the game,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said over the weekend. “He is such a valuable player, playing a premium position. As good as our guys control the strike zone, he is probably the poster child for it. And the ability to hit with power, and the speed he brings. He is really a complete player.” As a basis for Hicks’s deal, the Yankees looked at the contracts of two other center fielders: A.J. Pollock ($55 million over four years, signed in January) of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Lorenzo Cain ($80 million over five years, signed before the 2018 season) of the Milwaukee Brewers. Hicks would have reached free agency one year younger than Pollock and two years younger than Cain. While the Yankees did not need to sign Hicks before this season, Cashman said the team had weighed the benefits of receiving a slight discount for making a long-term commitment now. But the decision still was not an easy one. “The story is yet to be written,” Cashman said. “I talked to Aaron, ‘I’m betting on you.’ And he’s betting on himself at the same time. I believe there’s more gas in his tank.” As the Yankees have reconstructed their roster over the past few years, they have shed older players and built around younger ones who are now becoming candidates for long-term deals. Cashman said another reason for the lack of extensions before this year was the Yankees’ desire to get under the luxury tax threshold, which they did last year for the first time since 2003, to reset their penalty accumulation. Their 2019 payroll, as things stand now, will be over the luxury tax threshold of $206 million. Since the end of the last season, the Yankees have added $250 million in payroll commitments through free agency (including the re-signings of J.A. Happ, C.C. Sabathia, Brett Gardner and Zack Britton) and contract extensions. “We’re hopeful when the dust settles,” Cashman said, “that there’s a big payoff — not just financially to the players and us getting security by locking in the people that we believe in — but ultimately the most important aspect is the win column.” More deal-making could be coming. The Yankees have also discussed a contract extension with the reliever Dellin Betances, who is entering his final season before free agency. “Whenever you have the opportunity to sign guys like that, it helps out the team,” Hicks said of the recent contract extensions. “It makes everybody a little more comfortable.”",The New York Times
2019,"Year Before Killing, Saudi Prince Told Aide He Would Use ‘a Bullet’ on Jamal Khashoggi","WASHINGTON — Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia told a top aide in a conversation in 2017 that he would use “a bullet” on Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed in October, if Mr. Khashoggi did not return to the kingdom and end his criticism of the Saudi government, according to current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of intelligence reports. The conversation, intercepted by American intelligence agencies, is the most detailed evidence to date that the crown prince considered killing Mr. Khashoggi long before a team of Saudi operatives strangled him inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and dismembered his body using a bone saw. Mr. Khashoggi’s murder prompted weeks of outrage around the world and among both parties in Washington, where senior lawmakers called for an investigation into who was responsible. The Saudi government has denied that the young crown prince played any role in the killing, and President Trump has publicly shown little interest in trying to get the facts about who was responsible. Prince Mohammed, the next in line to the Saudi throne behind his ailing father, King Salman, has become the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia and a close ally of the Trump White House — especially Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. The conversation appears to have been recently transcribed and analyzed as part of an effort by intelligence agencies to find proof of who was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death. The National Security Agency and other American spy agencies are now sifting through years of the crown prince’s voice and text communications that the N.S.A. routinely intercepted and stored, much as the agency has long done for other top foreign officials, including close allies of the United States. For the past several months, the National Security Agency has circulated intelligence reports to other spy agencies, the White House and close foreign allies about the crown prince’s communications. The reports were described by several current and former officials. Weeks after the killing, the C.I.A. finished its first assessment about the operation, concluding that Prince Mohammed had ordered it. The conversation between Prince Mohammed and the aide, Turki Aldakhil, took place in September 2017, as officials in the kingdom were growing increasingly alarmed about Mr. Khashoggi’s criticisms of the Saudi government. That same month, Mr. Khashoggi began writing opinion columns for The Washington Post, and top Saudi officials discussed ways to lure him back to Saudi Arabia. In the conversation, Prince Mohammed said that if Mr. Khashoggi could not be enticed back to Saudi Arabia, then he should be returned by force. If neither of those methods worked, the crown prince said, then he would go after Mr. Khashoggi “with a bullet,” according to the officials familiar with one of the intelligence reports, which was produced in early December. American intelligence analysts concluded that Prince Mohammed might not have meant the phrase literally — in other words, he did not necessarily mean to have Mr. Khashoggi shot — but more likely he used the phrase as a metaphor to emphasize that he had every intention of killing the journalist if he did not return to Saudi Arabia. At the time of the conversation with Mr. Aldakhil, Prince Mohammed was in the midst of consolidating power in the kingdom. Just months earlier, his father elevated him to second in line to the throne after Prince Mohammed plotted the ouster of his predecessor, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. In late 2017, Prince Mohammed ordered hundreds of influential businessmen and Saudi royals — some who had been considered contenders to the throne — locked up at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where they were interrogated. Days before the conversation with Mr. Aldakhil, according to the same intelligence report, Prince Mohammed complained to another aide — Saud al-Qahtani — that Mr. Khashoggi had grown too influential. Prince Mohammed said that Mr. Khashoggi’s articles and Twitter posts were tarnishing the crown prince’s image as a forward-thinking reformer, and the criticism was more cutting because it was coming from a journalist who had once been seen as supportive of his agenda. When Mr. al-Qahtani said that any move against Mr. Khashoggi was risky and could create an international uproar, his boss scolded him: Saudi Arabia should not care about international reaction to how it handles its own citizens, the crown prince told Mr. al-Qahtani. Prince Mohammed also told Mr. al-Qahtani, according to an official who has read the report, that he “did not like half-measures — he never liked them and did not believe in them.” Days after this conversation and the one about the bullet, Mr. Khashoggi wrote his first column for The Washington Post: “Saudi Arabia Wasn’t Always This Repressive. Now It’s Unbearable.” It was a withering attack on Prince Mohammed’s crackdown inside the kingdom. “I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,” Mr. Khashoggi wrote. “To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.” Spokesmen for the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. declined to comment. In a statement, Mr. Aldakhil said, “These allegations are categorically false. They appear to be a continuation of various efforts by different parties to connect His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to this horrific crime. These efforts will prove futile.” On Thursday evening, a Saudi official issued a statement saying: “We again deny any involvement on the part of the crown prince in the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is moving forward with its investigation and has already indicted a number of officials linked to the crime. We are focused on uncovering the full truth and ensuring complete accountability.” In December, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Mohammed exchanged numerous messages with Mr. al-Qahtani in the hours before and after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, citing the C.I.A.’s assessment of the Saudi operation. The Journal report did not give details about the messages, and officials have said that American spy agencies in many cases are able to capture only the date and time of messages — so-called metadata — not their content. The Journal also reported that Prince Mohammed spoke with associates in August 2017 about luring Mr. Khashoggi from the United States to a third country if officials were unable to get him to Saudi Arabia. American intelligence agencies have identified Mr. al-Qahtani as the ringleader of the operation that killed Mr. Khashoggi, and last year, he was put on a list of Saudi officials sanctioned by the United States for their role in the journalist’s death. Mr. al-Qahtani is viewed in the kingdom as a brutal enforcer of the crown prince’s agenda and has used an army of online trolls to harass Saudi dissidents on social media. After Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, the kingdom announced that Mr. al-Qahtani had been removed from his position as an adviser to the royal court. Saudi Arabia has since begun criminal proceedings against 11 individuals involved in the operation. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of them. The kingdom has not released the names of the people on trial, and it is unclear whether Mr. al-Qahtani is among them. Mr. Aldakhil, the other aide to the crown prince caught in the intercepts, until recently was the general manager of the Saudi-owned television network Al Arabiya. He is an influential media figure in the kingdom and a prominent adviser to the crown prince. During the September 2017 conversation, according to intelligence reports, Mr. Aldakhil spoke to Prince Mohammed about luring Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia with the possibility of a job at Al Arabiya. The crown prince was skeptical that Mr. Khashoggi would accept the offer. Last month, Mr. Aldakhil left his post at the network. Saudi news sites have reported that he is expected to be named the next Saudi ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. American officials said there is no evidence that Mr. Aldakhil had knowledge of a specific plan to capture or kill Mr. Khashoggi, and his name has never been among the suspects in the killing. In the weeks after Mr. Khashoggi’s death, classified evidence piled up that senior Saudi royals approved the Khashoggi operation, even as American officials insisted that there was no “smoking gun” directly tying the crown prince to it. The narrative from the Saudi royal court changed repeatedly, and the Saudi government has been determined to insulate the powerful crown prince from blame. Most recently, Saudi officials have said that the operation was a kidnapping gone awry — that the team had been sent to Istanbul to forcibly bring Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia but made the decision to kill him after he refused to cooperate. Saudi officials have said that Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the operation. In the latest indication that the international uproar over Mr. Khashoggi’s killing will continue, a United Nations investigator released a preliminary report on Thursday that concluded that Mr. Khashoggi “was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the State of Saudi Arabia.” Late last year, Mr. Trump tried to blunt the outrage by issuing a statement saying that it was possible that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, but the facts might never be known. What was more important, the president indicated, was that the kingdom had pledged hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in the United States, including $110 billion in arms purchased from Lockheed Martin, Boeing and other defense firms. Defense analysts say that the actual amount that the Saudi government spends is likely to be far lower. With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives, lawmakers are hoping for a sustained push for answers about who was behind Mr. Khashoggi’s death. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is planning to introduce legislation calling for the director of national intelligence to produce a report to Congress identifying which Saudi officials helped plan the operation, according to two Democratic congressional aides. In early December, Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, told reporters, “We are doing everything we can to go down every rabbit hole to find what’s there,” adding, “We are leaving no stone unturned.” “I am quite satisfied we will find more evidence of what happened,” Mr. Mattis said. “I just don’t know what it’s going to be or who is going to be implicated.”",The New York Times
2019,Yearbook Pages at Northam’s Medical School Recorded Both Memories and Prejudices,"NORFOLK, Va. — The inoffensive images show photographs of aspiring doctors in white lab coats tending to patients, or lounging on the beach in swimsuits, or posing with family members in their Sunday best. But as one flips through the yearbooks at Eastern Virginia Medical School, shocking images pop up, too. Ku Klux Klan attire on one page. Confederate outfits on another. When reports emerged that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia had a racist photograph on his page in the 1984 yearbook, it not only sent his political career into a tailspin, it also cast a negative light on a tradition at the elite school that turned ugly. [Read how Northam is determined to stay in office.] For years, each graduating student was given half a page in the yearbook to leave behind memories. Some inserted poetry. Others left reminiscences. There were photos submitted by the graduates, some heartwarming and others jarring in their insensitivity. In 1984 alone, besides the picture on Mr. Northam’s page of a man in blackface posing next to someone in a K.K.K. robe, there were at least two other images of blackface in other parts of the yearbook. There was also a picture of a man wearing a sombrero and a woman in Japanese attire at what seemed to be a costume party. One photo featured a professor holding a mug that read: “We can’t get fired! Slaves have to be sold.” And a male student grabbed a female mannequin’s breast in one picture with the caption, “I try never to divulge my true feelings while examining my patients!” The tradition carried on with little fanfare until 2014, when Dr. Richard V. Homan, two years after becoming the medical school’s president, learned that there were photos of students wearing Confederate outfits and flags in the 2013 yearbook. Concerned that the images could offend and portray the school in a negative light, he ended the publication of yearbooks. At a news conference on Tuesday, Dr. Homan apologized for the offensive images of the past and described an investigation he ordered into the campus culture that may have led to their publication. “We want this to be more than just a review of what happened 30 years ago,” said Dr. Homan, who is white, and also the provost and dean of the medical school. “We want to know what’s happening today and what we can do to make things better.” Black students from Mr. Northam’s era recalled a divided campus in which they and their white classmates sat in class together but largely socialized apart. “The problem is that people who put offensive things on their yearbook page, they weren’t cognizant of the people they were offending,” said Dr. David Randolph Sr., 59, an oncologist in Richmond, Va., who is black and who graduated from the medical school in 1983. “They had no concern for the people whose feelings that they were hurting.” Some white students said that nothing seemed out of the ordinary when their white classmates wore blackface. It was typical at costume parties or at talent shows, said Dr. William Elwood, a retired family physician who is white and who graduated in 1984, the same year as Mr. Northam. Dr. Elwood worked on the yearbook that year, laying out pages, he said. For their personal pages, students would submit their own photos to the staff, he said. The designers would lay them out on the page, he said, and mark where each photo was to be placed. The photos were then put into an envelope, which was attached to the page where they belonged and sent to the press to be printed. Mr. Northam, after initially saying that he was in the offensive photograph on his page, has since said he was not and that he had not seen the photo before. Mr. Elwood said he did not recall laying out Mr. Northam’s page. But he did recall the yearbook including a picture of three men dressed in wigs, dresses and blackface, pretending to be The Supremes, he said. It did not offend him and he did not think twice about whether the photo should have been in the yearbook, he said. “It was done as part of a dress up, being somebody you’re not,” Dr. Elwood, 68, said. “It was not done as some kind of racial thing.” The use of blackface, he said, came down to context and the prevailing attitudes of the time. “I hate that people take something that happened 35 years ago and put 2019 values on,” he said. “Values and politics and perceptions have changed since then.” Dr. Aaron J. Pile, 66, a black obstetrician-gynecologist practicing in the St. Louis area, said he considered blackface offensive even 30 years ago. He said he did not receive any offensive photos when he was a yearbook editor in 1983, and if he had, he would not have permitted their publication. The students were given free editorial rein over the yearbook, without staff supervision, because “the yearbook was for us,” Dr. Pile said. “It wasn’t for the teachers; it wasn’t for the faculty.” That freedom, however, may have also resulted in some of the offensive content that ended up in the yearbooks, said Dr. Harvey Rawls, 60, a white classmate of Mr. Northam’s. “The practice of letting students run a yearbook unsupervised should have just been shut down,” he said. Even as their beliefs on racism may have differed from their white classmates, Dr. Pile and Dr. Randolph said the school’s administrators created a welcoming environment. And they appreciated the school’s mission to encourage doctors to work in primary care, helping underserved communities. The only time Dr. Randolph felt directly targeted because of his race in medical school, he said, was when he was doing a hospital rotation. The chairman of the department, who was white, called him into his office after about six weeks and told him that he thought he was going to fail, Dr. Randolph said. He found that strange, he said, because he thought he was performing well and the chairman had never met him. While the chairman told him he could go ahead and quit, Dr. Randolph asked if he could instead work directly under the supervision of the chairman to show that he did good work. He did, and by the end of the rotation, Dr. Randolph said, the chairman had written him a glowing recommendation. “He made a decision that I was a poor student; I was going to fail based on my race,” Dr. Randolph said. “I showed him.” Dr. Randolph enjoyed academic success, but white students generally had different cultural and social interests and would have gatherings that black students often knew nothing of, he said. It felt as though black students were invisible to their white classmates, he said. There also was an economic divide: Many of the black students were the first in their families to go to college, let alone medical school, and they did not have the same resources as their white counterparts, he said. The gap between black and white, Dr. Randolph said, was why he felt that white classmates probably would not have blinked at the offensive image on Mr. Northam’s yearbook page. “That was the norm,” he said. “That’s what people did.”",The New York Times
2019,Yellowstone’s Steamboat Geyser Is Gushing at a Record Pace,"Trilobites It’s the talk of the national park these days, erupting a record 32 times last year and keeping up its showstopping pace this winter. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. — Late last year, Jeff Carter happened upon Steamboat Geyser, the tallest active geyser in the world, just before it erupted. “It was so much louder, and higher and stronger than anything I had seen, almost frightening,” he said. “People around us were so emotional, just cheering and roaring,” Mr. Carter said. “This old fellow who had it on his bucket list was so verklempt when the geyser erupted, it was neat.” All but dormant for years, Steamboat is erupting fairly frequently these days and more people like Mr. Carter are getting to witness it. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] While Old Faithful is a global icon of punctual eruption — it usually erupts every 90 minutes or so — it is the exception among geothermal features. Most of Yellowstone National Park’s 1,000 or so geysers are far more irregular and unpredictable. Many geysers, like Steamboat, are quiet and then suddenly rouse. Steamboat sometimes jets water to heights of 300 to 400 feet — far higher than Old Faithful’s top height of 185 feet — for anywhere from a few minutes to about an hour. After the jet of water in its eruption, Steamboat — in Norris Geyser Basin, the park’s hottest — goes into a ferocious, churning steam phase that can last for two days. On a recent visit early this month, Steamboat was shooting clouds of white steam in huge volumes, sounding like a jet engine or a giant foam steamer for a latte. There were only very occasional eruptions until last March when Steamboat blasted off. It has been erupting every week or two since. It set an all time record with 32 eruptions in 2018, besting its total of 29 set in 1964. It has continued that pace of eruptions in 2019 and last erupted on Feb. 1. Ear Spring Geyser in the park’s Upper Geyser Basin also recently woke. On Sept. 15, the bubbling, ear-shaped spring erupted, throwing up coins, a cinder block, a baby pacifier and other objects that had been tossed into it over the decades. It was only its fourth eruption in the last 60 years. Giant Geyser in the park has also been unusually active. And new vents and fissures have formed in some of the park’s geothermal areas. What has stirred these grand geysers out of their years of slumber? It’s hard to say precisely. “These geysers are incredibly dynamic,” said Michael Poland, a federal geophysicist who studies the massive caldera for the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. “Over time their conduit systems expand and contract as minerals precipitate in them and close them up, and the pressure builds and reams them out again.” Add to that large annual swings in the amount of snow and rain, which changes the level of the below ground reservoirs, and a constant jiggling of the landscape. “We have an average of 1,500 locatable earthquakes every year,” said Jeff Hungerford, a park geologist. “That acts as an agitator to the system and allows some of these geysers to keep open.” One thing the changes don’t mean is that the magma-filled supervolcano under the park is going to blow. Caldera activity is constantly monitored, and there would be years if not decades of warning signs before a major eruption would occur. The vast array of the park’s geysers and other geothermal features — some 10,000 mud pots, hot springs and fumaroles, the largest cluster in the world — are driven by Yellowstone’s location above the caldera. As water on the surface seeps below ground, it hits the magma and comes to a boil, which forces the superheated water and steam upward through a labyrinthine network of fissures, fractures and other plumbing. The Geyser Observation and Study Association, colloquially known as the geyser gazers, is a group that spends hours watching simmering geysers and recording their every sputter, pop and blast and posting the information online. And now that Steamboat is in a lively phase, it’s the talk of the park. Mr. Carter remembers what happened a few years ago, before this new spurt of activity. In early September of 2014, he saw rangers rushing to something. “There’s a saying here that if you see rangers running, follow them because they are running away from something dangerous or toward something really great,” Mr. Carter said. One of them shouted “Steamboat is going off!” “So I grabbed my coat. But my wife said, ‘If you miss your daughter’s volleyball game for a geyser eruption you will never live it down.’” Mr. Carter, who owns a motel in West Yellowstone, glumly took his seat and missed what he feared might have been his only chance to see Steamboat erupt. Fortunately, he did get another opportunity. “I’ve seen a lot of the big geysers go off in Yellowstone,” he said, “but the eruption of Steamboat really exceeded my expectations.”",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Yes, Tax the Rich. But Do It Right.","Steven Rattner responds to readers who have doubts about his plan to raise revenue from the uber wealthy. Mr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for a steep increase in the tax rate of America’s top earners to help level income inequality and raise revenue for the deficit. But in his Op-Ed “A Better Way to Tax the Rich,” Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer and Wall Street executive, says there are “more sensible” ways for the wealthy to contribute, “in particular, by increasing the tax rate on capital gains and dividends and closing loopholes.” Readers responded, many challenging Mr. Rattner’s suggestions and offering alternatives. We asked him to follow up with some of them. A selection of those comments, along with his responses, are below, edited for length and clarity. — Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak, senior editorial assistants. Steven Rattner: There’s some truth to that! As I indicated in the opening paragraph of the Op-Ed, I believe that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done the country a service by pointing out that the wealthy need to pay more. Just the other day, Jamie Dimon, the superb chairman and chief executive officer of JP Morgan Chase, said he would be willing to pay higher taxes, as long as the “dollars are going where they can be most effective.” Steven Rattner: I have no problem increasing taxes on the rich and I have no problem doing that as a combination of increasing taxes on ordinary income above $10 million and raising capital gains tax rates to the current 37 percent rate on ordinary income. I’ve been in the working world for more than 40 years, in tax regimes where my marginal rate on earned income was as high as 50 percent and as low as 28 percent (which puts the current 37 percent somewhere near the middle). Contrary to the argument of supply-siders that high marginal rates discourage work, I’ve never believed that my work ethic varied as the marginal tax rate went up or down. That said, I would agree that there is some tax rate above which individuals either work less or try harder to avoid taxes. It seems to me that a combined 82.7 percent marginal rate for those of us who live in high tax states like New York is a bridge too far. In addition, it would put us well above the highest tax rate of any developed country. Steven Rattner: That’s a fair point. A couple of thoughts in response. First, my proposal would not affect retirees who depend on pension plans, either the corporate type or the individually directed type. Neither pays capital gains or dividend taxes; when the benefits come out, they are taxed as ordinary income. My proposal would affect retirees who hold investments directly and recognize capital gains and (or) dividends. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect; I would note that most capital gains taxes are paid by the wealthy. The top 1 percent accounted for 69 percent of reported long-term capital gains in 2018; the top 0.1 percent (average income over $10 million) accounted for over half. Lastly, taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income would mean that individuals would pay taxes based on their income level; thus those of more modest means would pay less than the current 37 percent top rate and potentially less than the 23.8 percent capital gains and dividend rate now in effect. Steven Rattner: I would reiterate that under my proposal, the capital gains and dividend rate would vary based on income, just as the rate on wage income varies. So retirees with lower incomes would pay less than the wealthy do and possibly even less than they currently pay. Steven Rattner: This is a constructive suggestion, and I’d be happy to see a revamped capital gains and dividend policy provide for an exemption for the first $10,000 or possibly even more for Americans with incomes below some reasonable threshold. Steven Rattner: As I noted, by taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, we would effectively be making them progressive; a taxpayer’s rate on this form of income would be the same as what he paid on his wage income. Steven Rattner: Unfortunately, it’s impossible to address every aspect of the tax code in the space allotted. I certainly agree that the deduction on state and local taxes was a smack by the Republicans at the blue states. But we shouldn’t kid ourselves about the near-term likelihood of this deduction being restored. First, the Democrats would have to retake the Senate, which obviously cannot happen before 2020 at the earliest and even then, has a less than 50/50 chance of occurring. Democrats would also need the White House, which could well happen in 2020 but is obviously not guaranteed. If all the ducks lined up as I just described, I would imagine that restoring the state and local taxes deduction would be near the top of the “to do” list. Steven Rattner: I agree with the general concept that it is time to rethink how we finance Social Security. It was originally designed as an insurance program, in which the maximum amount of tax payable and the maximum benefits were linked. However, the Social Security Trust Fund has been underfunded since 2010 and is currently projected to be exhausted by 2034. We could lift the cap entirely, as you suggest, but in that case, we would want to be judicious about raising the top marginal rate, for the reasons I discussed above. In the end, it’s more or less the same dollars, whether we raise them by lifting the Social Security cap or raising the top marginal rate on ordinary income. Steven Rattner: Agree in part and disagree in part. I agree that Reagan’s tax legislation lowered the top rate excessively (to 28 percent from the previous 50 percent). What was even worse was that Reagan’s embrace of supply side dogma was heavily responsible for the shift in sentiment toward the idea that large federal budget deficits are not a problem. Even after President Clinton balanced the budget near the end of his time in office, President George W. Bush passed irresponsible tax cuts that brought back large deficits. Vice President Dick Cheney was famously reported to have said in an Oval Office meeting, “Deficits don’t matter. Reagan proved that.” Then, using similar justification, the Trump Administration added more tax cuts and spending increases that exploded the deficit, as I previously noted. Where I disagree is that Reagan did some things that were constructive. His push for deregulation, while sometimes excessively favoring business interests, was important to reviving the economy. And the bipartisan Tax Reform Act of 1986 simplified the code and eliminated a lot of loopholes and tax avoidance schemes. Steven Rattner: First, with respect to estate taxes, I agree that reforms are badly needed. The 2017 tax reform legislation amazingly increased the size of the exemption for each individual from $5.6 million to $11.2 million ($22.4 million for married couples). That should never have happened. In addition, careful thought should be given to the current policy that assets held at death are not subject to capital gains tax. That means heirs can receive, potentially, billions in appreciated stock or real estate assets and then sell them without paying any capital gains taxes on the profits. Second, I am sympathetic to the view that taxing corporations at 21 percent while the top rate for individuals is 37 percent is simply not just. But unfortunately, we live in a global world and our competitors — other countries — have been lowering their corporate rates to attract more business. My proposal would, in effect, make wealthy Americans who own stocks pay more to offset the cuts that we made in the corporate rate. Third, I’m not an expert on the tax status of nonprofits but I’m certainly open to learning more about this. On a related front, we should also have a discussion about the deduction for charitable contributions. This has the same effect as if the government had a matching plan for charitable contributions. I’m as much in favor of charity as the next guy but I’m not sure why the government should be in the business of providing subsidies of this sort.

2019,"Yes, There Was Duct Tape: The Harrowing Journeys of Migrants Across the Border","Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox. For weeks, President Trump has been criticized for exaggerating the brutality experienced by migrant women on the border as he makes his case for a wall. A Rose Garden address in January was only one of the times when Mr. Trump has made the claim: “Women are tied up. They’re bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can’t even breathe. They’re put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks.” If the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on America’s southern border, then he was indeed exaggerating. News organizations and immigrant advocate groups were quick to express skepticism. Trafficking experts told the news media they had not heard of such an episode. But there is some truth to the president’s descriptions of the threat of sexual assault and of women who have been duct-taped and bound. Undocumented women have been duct-taped and tied up before, during and after their migration to the United States, The Times discovered while reporting this story. Maybe not frequently, but it has happened. “Because I didn’t want to let them, they tied my feet together and my hands behind my back,” a 45-year-old Honduran woman told us in an interview. She said she was raped after her smugglers forced her into prostitution shortly after she illegally crossed the border in Texas. The woman, who now lives in Austin and who asked to be identified by her first name, Lucy, was held captive in a makeshift brothel in the South Texas city of McAllen. Human smuggling has grown more and more violent, as border security tightens and as the smuggling of people and drugs becomes costlier and riskier. In this particular kind of border crossing, the smugglers are paid thousands of dollars by the migrants, but the relationship resembles not seller and buyer but prisoner and warden. The smugglers are called coyotes, and the migrants are called pollos, or chickens, and these terms very much reflect the dehumanized nature of a migrant’s journey through the borderlands. Clients are sometimes forced to take off their shoes or strip to their underwear to prevent them from fleeing. The coyotes control when and what the migrants eat, and where they sleep. They decide when their debt can be considered paid. In one trailer home in Carrizo Springs, Tex., smugglers raped a Salvadoran woman and tortured two men — covering the men’s hands with plastic bags, putting their hands on a stool and pounding their fingers with a hammer — all because their relatives failed to pay the fees. And the smugglers are not the only culprits. In 2000, a Border Patrol agent in Arizona, Dennis M. Johnson, was charged with sexual assault and kidnapping after he forced a 21-year-old migrant from El Salvador to disrobe and perform oral sex on him while she was handcuffed with her hands behind her back. In 2014 near McAllen, three Honduran migrants — a woman, her daughter and her daughter’s 14-year-old friend — crossed the Rio Grande and came across a uniformed Border Patrol agent. The agent, Esteban Manzanares, bound them with plastic police restraints, put silver duct-tape on their mouths and kidnapped them, driving them around in the back of his Border Patrol truck. “I thought he was going to harm us, because from the moment that he duct-taped our mouths, I felt that that was not normal anymore,” said the woman, 40, who asked to be identified by her initials, M.G. Mr. Manzanares tried to kill M.G. and her daughter, and then handcuffed the 14-year-old girl to a tree, her mouth still taped. He finished his shift, returned to the tree for the girl, drove her to his apartment and tied her to a bunk-bed, where he repeatedly sexually assaulted her. Her ordeal ended only many hours later, when law enforcement agents closed in on the apartment, and Mr. Manzanares, facing imminent capture, took his own life. — MANNY FERNANDEZ, reporting from McAllen, Tex. Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently deployed along the border. Each week they’ll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it. Do you have questions about life on the border? Or feedback about this newsletter? Email us at: crossingtheborder@nytimes.com. It’s hard to find one number that encapsulates the myths versus the realities of living in a border city. This one comes pretty close. It starts with a question about crime. How many murders occurred last year in the South Texas border city of McAllen, the center of the busiest Border Patrol sector and the release point for thousands of asylum seekers from Central America? Zero. That’s right — McAllen had zero homicides in 2018, down from seven in 2017, three in 2016 and two in 2015. How did it happen? There is cartel-fueled drug violence directly across the border in parts of Mexico, but it largely fails to spillover into McAllen. Undocumented immigrants and drugs are smuggled through McAllen, but the city is largely a crossing point for that flow of people and drugs, not a destination point. Last year’s zero homicides were part of an overall low-crime pattern in the city, which has a population of 142,000. In 1991, about 2,150 cars were stolen in McAllen. Last year, there were 55. “Right now we have the lowest crime rate in McAllen in a 34-year period,” said the city’s chief of police, Victor Rodriguez. “The crisis is not at the border. The crisis is at the destination points. That’s what gets lost all the time.” — MANNY FERNANDEZ, reporting from McAllen, Tex. A woman in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody gave birth to a stillborn baby. The episode was one of several to thrust the issue of caring for migrants in United States custody — especially the youngest — back into the spotlight this week. Here’s how to go deeper into the conversation. • House Democrats this week issued subpoenas to three Cabinet officials, escalating a battle against the Trump administration’s policy last yearof separating migrant children from their families. The subpoenas came hours after a House committee sharply questioned an official with the Department of Health and Human Services who oversaw the policy’s implementation. Read more here. • One issue was this report, from January, that thousands more children might have been separated from their parents at the border last year than the administration initially reported. • According to a Justice Department report released just ahead of the hearing, the federal government received more than 4,500 allegations of sexual abuse against immigrant children who were being held at government-funded detention facilities over a recent four-year period. Read more about the report here. • The attorney general of California released findings of a state audit of immigrant detention centers. It found detainees faced barriers to medical treatment.

2019,Yet Another Election for Spain Reveals Deeper Strains,"News Analysis MADRID — A center-left government has fallen. The two-party system has collapsed. The far-right is on the rise. At first glance, Spain seems a lot like other parts of Europe these days. And it is. But the decision on Friday by Spain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to call for an early general election in April — the country’s third since late 2015 — is also an echo of deeper, particularly Spanish dynamics at play. A secessionist drive in the prosperous northern region of Catalonia has challenged both the country’s territorial integrity and the core arrangements of the 1978 Constitution for Spain, one of Western Europe’s youngest democracies. The result is the rise of a new nationalism across Spain, which in many ways has yet to fully reconcile the divisions left by the darkest chapters of its recent past, including dictatorship and civil war. Spain’s most volatile fault lines lay just beneath the political surface, turning what might otherwise be just another election into a reminder of unfinished business and the potentially wrenching tasks still ahead. Catalonia is first among them. All roads in Spanish politics seem to lead there. The collapse of Mr. Sánchez’s Socialist government, the rise of a new far-right party called Vox, and the struggles of the center-right Popular Party are partly a function of the Catalan push for an independent state. But even if some of the roots of its current instability are unique, Spain has also proved hardly immune to the spread of populism and nationalism sweeping much of Europe. “What we have in common with the rest of European countries is polarization,” said José Ignacio Torreblanca, the head of the Madrid office of the European Council for Foreign Relations, a political research group. “What is specific about Spain,” Mr. Torreblanca said, “is the Catalan issue.” Mr. Sánchez’s decision on Friday to call for a snap election on April 28 came two days after his minority Socialist government suffered a major defeat in Parliament, when Catalan lawmakers voted with his right-wing opposition to reject his budget plan. That effectively neutered a government that was all but impotent in any case; Mr. Sánchez’s Socialist party held less than a quarter of the seats in Parliament. The frail minority required Mr. Sánchez to seek the support of small regional parties — including Catalan nationalists. They proved useful in helping him unseat his center-right predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, last June, and to pass some legislation. But the Catalans also continued to hold the stability of the government — and the country — hostage to their grievances that Spain siphons off their wealth and that their region’s unique language and culture entitle it to separate. The Catalans abandoned Mr. Sánchez once it became clear he was only interested in piecemeal concessions to Catalonia, instead of allowing them a referendum on secession. The timing of the budget vote on Wednesday did not help, coming as it did just a day after the start of a landmark trial of 12 former Catalan leaders on charges of sedition and rebellion before the Supreme Court in Madrid. The crisis this week was the latest chapter of a Catalan story that hit a crescendo in October 2017, when separatist leaders organized an independence referendum that was declared unconstitutional by Spanish courts. Spain’s Constitution, written three years after the death of the former dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, already gives considerable autonomy to Catalonia. But it is not enough to placate hard-liners, who wanted Catalans to vote on whether to secede entirely. Such a vote has little support among Spaniards in most of the rest of the country. The impasse reflects how Spain’s relatively young democracy has yet to conclusively address several constitutional issues that, in the eyes of some Spaniards, were never entirely resolved after Franco’s death, said Oriol Bartomeus, a politics professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. “Now a new generation, who do not have an emotional attachment to that agreement, or were just children at that time, are raising their hands and saying that the agreement was not good,” Mr. Bartomeus said. “And there is an attempt to rethink it from the left — and a reaction to that from the right.” Catalonia’s unsanctioned referendum provoked Mr. Rajoy, the prime minister at the time, to suspend the Catalan regional parliament. He imposed direct rule from Madrid — deepening Catalan grievances, while also reawakening a long-dormant Spanish nationalism. The result is a far more polarized political environment that is likely to influence the April national election. In regional elections in December, the far-right Vox party emerged holding the balance of power in the parliament of the southern region of Andalusia. Vox’s support was partly fueled by rising illegal migration, but also by anger over Catalonia, Mr. Torreblanca said. “Vox is a party that is typically anti-immigration, but it’s not immigration that is putting wind in their sails,” said Mr. Torreblanca. “What has pushed Vox is the feeling that Rajoy was not hard enough on the Catalan issue.” In a speech on Friday, Mr. Sánchez highlighted the virtues of his social policies, which include raising the minimum wage by more than a fifth, and introducing plans to raise pension payments — but it may not be enough to return him to office. If the national election follows contours similar to the Andalusian poll, Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists may emerge as the largest party in Parliament, but remain outnumbered by the conservative Popular Party, the center-right Ciudadanos and Vox. That would mean one less center-left leader at the table of European politics, at a time when Social Democratic governments are already increasingly rare. The trial of the 12 separatist Catalan leaders is likely to keep the Catalan issue front and center of the campaign. And it will be “something that is going to push right-wing parties,” said Ignacio Molina, a senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute, a Madrid-based research group. But unlike in Italy, where far-right euroskeptics help run a populist coalition government, whatever coalition emerges in Spain is likely to be pro-Europe. The Popular Party, Ciudadanos and the Socialists are all broadly in favor of European integration. The danger instead is that a weak and distracted Spanish government, however willing to engage constructively in European affairs, may find itself consumed by domestic disputes. With Italy and Poland now ruled by euroskeptics, and Britain set to leave the bloc altogether, “you need a big country in the south, like Spain, to help decide the future of European integration,” Mr. Molina said. “But that’s going to be much more difficult unless you have a new government that is strong.” As Spain’s economy improved and its unemployment levels fell, the country had been expected to emerge from years of economic crisis and political introspection to become a key player in the reforms of the European currency and European Union migration policy. “But if you have a weak government,” Mr. Molina said, “it’s much more difficult for Spain to shape decisions or implement them.”",The New York Times
2019,"You Call That Meat? Not So Fast, Cattle Ranchers Say","SAN FRANCISCO — The cattle ranchers and farm bureaus of America are not going to give up their hold on the word meat without a fight. In recent weeks, beef and farming industry groups have persuaded legislators in more than a dozen states to introduce laws that would make it illegal to use the word meat to describe burgers and sausages that are created from plant-based ingredients or are grown in labs. Just this week, new meat-labeling bills were introduced in Arizona and Arkansas. These meat alternatives may look and taste and even bleed like meat, but cattle ranchers want to make sure that the new competition can’t use the meat label. “The word meat, to me, should mean a product from a live animal,” said Jim Dinklage, a rancher and the president of the Independent Cattlemen of Nebraska, who has testified in support of meat-labeling legislation in his state. The push for state labeling laws is a reflection of how quickly start-ups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which produce burgers from plant-based ingredients, have grown to challenge the traditional meat industry. Sales of plant-based meat substitutes increased 22 percent to $1.5 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. Other start-ups are getting closer to being able to create chicken nuggets and sausage from actual meat cells grown in a lab. Even though it is not yet commercially viable, traditional meat producers are worried the lab-grown meat could eventually become a low-cost alternative with little regulatory oversight. “About a year and a half ago, this wasn’t on my radar whatsoever,” said Mark Dopp, the head of regulatory affairs at the North American Meat Association. “All of a sudden, this is getting closer. This is likely to happen in the near future, and we need to have a regulatory system in place to deal with it.” Meat producers say they don’t want to lose control of labeling like the dairy industry, which, for now at least, has lost its battle to keep almond and soy producers from using the word milk on their beverages. Egg and even mayonnaise producers have faced similar fights. “Almonds don’t produce milk,” said Bill Pigott, a Republican state representative in Mississippi who wrote the legislation there. He owns a farm that has produced both dairy and beef. But his worries have gone beyond almond and soy liquid’s being labeled milk. “The fake, lab-produced meat is a little bit more of a science fiction-type deal that concerns me more,” Mr. Pigott said. He introduced his bill in January after the local association of cattle ranchers contacted him. It passed in the state’s House and is waiting for debate in the State Senate. The various legislative efforts are likely to face tough challenges — and not just from vegetarians. A bill in Virginia was voted down after lawmakers received a letter from the National Grocers Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Plant Based Foods Association that defended increasingly popular products. It said requiring “new and unfamiliar packaging would only confuse shoppers and frustrate retailers at a time when demand for such options is at an all-time high,” growing at 23 percent a year. The most restrictive proposal, in Washington State, would make it a crime to sell lab-grown meat and would bar state funds from being used for research in the area because some lawmakers say not enough is known about it to consider it safe. The bill has not yet come up for a vote. Surprising coalitions are forming around the future of lab-grown meat. The North American Meat Association has said it wants lab-grown meat to be referred to as meat to ensure that new products are not able to shirk any of the regulations applied to traditional meat. And most large meat companies have stayed out of the debate. Some of them, including Tyson and Cargill, have made investments in lab-grown-meat start-ups. In Nebraska, a meat-labeling bill was written by Carol Blood, a Democratic state senator from suburban Omaha. Despite her last name, Ms. Blood has been a vegan for years. She said she had decided to pursue her bill after overhearing two women in her local Fresh Thyme supermarket expressing confusion about whether a package of Beyond Meat burgers contained animal flesh. “I don’t care that it says burger — I care that it says it’s meat,” Ms. Blood said. “I have this thing that sticks in my craw when people are trying to be deceitful.” Beyond Meat is not, in fact, produced with any meat. It gets its trademark bloody look from beet juice. “We provide the consumer with meat made from plants, and believe that it is reasonable for the consumer and for us to refer to our products as plant-based meats,” the chief executive of Beyond Meat, Ethan Brown, said in an email. Last year, Missouri passed the first law that barred companies from “misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry.” That law has been challenged in court by the company Tofurky, which specializes in tofu and other soy-based foods, as well as the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. Sarah Sorscher, who works on regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there was little evidence that consumers were confused by the labeling of alternative meat companies. “We think the issue of whether they use a term like meat is a proxy for this bigger issue, which is that the meat industry is concerned about competition from these products,” Ms. Sorscher said. “The bills don’t seem to be directed at solving a problem in the marketplace. It is about fighting off competition.” Beyond Meat has received assurances from the authorities in Missouri that its labels make it clear that the product is not meat and will not run afoul of the new law. The Good Food Institute, which represents both plant-based meat companies and cell-based-meat start-ups, has scrambled to get employees and lobbyists to state capitals where laws are being considered. Jessica Almy, who is the policy director for the organization, said she believed that most of the state laws and proposals would be rendered moot if and when the Agriculture Department weighed in on labeling for lab-grown meat, which it promised to do last year. Still, she argues that the state-mandated labels could create more confusion for consumers. “There is no truthful way to refer to it without using meat terms,” Ms. Almy said. Mr. Dinklage, the Nebraska rancher, said he was also interested in providing clarity to consumers. He also wants to protect a livelihood that is growing harder all the time. “Just think what it actually costs eventually in a lab as compared to running a ranching operation,” he said. “It would be a lot cheaper and that puts me out of business.”",The New York Times
2019,You Flushed the Toilet. They Made Some Bricks.,"Trilobites Converting biosolids into building materials could keep a lot of leftovers of the waste process out of landfills, and provide other environmental benefits, too. It may be unpleasant to contemplate the ultimate fate of all the material from your own body that you flush down the pipes. But it’s time we talk about biosolids — the disinfected leftovers from the water treatment process. This sandy material contains nutrient-rich organic content that’s good for agriculture. But it also makes nice bricks, according to Abbas Mohajerani, a civil engineer at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University in Australia. He’s talking about the kind we use for building. “Biosolids bricks look the same, smell the same and have similar physical and mechanical properties as normal fired clay bricks,” he said. And as long as it’s done locally, he thinks that recycling stockpiles of leftover biosolids into bricks could save land and energy, and reduce carbon emissions. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Worldwide, humans produce vast quantities of biosolids. In a single day, New York City alone makes 1200 tons, or about 50 truckloads. And the amount of biosolids is growing as populations expand around the planet. The old solution was to dump them into the sea or a landfill. But more treatment plants and stricter regulations are prompting people to find clever ways to recycle the dried sludge. About 50 to 70 percent of it is now used, mostly to boost soil quality or fertilize crops. But the rest remains unused or stockpiled. In the United States, it’s estimated that nearly a third of the 7 to 8 million tons of biosolids produced each year still end up in landfills. As organic particles in the waste decompose, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide escape and can contribute to global warming. And then there are bricks. The world makes trillions of them each year. The soil it takes to make them is enough to fill 1,000 holes, each as big as a soccer field and nearly as deep as The Empire State Building is tall. And it takes a lot of energy, too. Other researchers have tried mixing bricks with biosolids and other waste products. Dr. Mohajerani had experimented already with cigarette butts. So turning waste into a building material didn’t seem so far-fetched. Over the course of half a decade, he and a team of researchers collected biosolids from two wastewater treatment plants in Melbourne and mixed them with soil to make hybrid bricks of varying proportions. They fired them for 10 hours, at nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and cooled them, then compared them in tests to normal bricks. The team’s findings, published earlier this month in the journal Buildings, ranked the biosolid bricks similar in quality to those currently on the market. And the researchers proposed that incorporating just 15 percent biosolids into all the bricks made around the world each year would eliminate all of our leftovers. Depending on the amount of biosolids used, how they were treated and how long they sat around, the biosolid bricks were safe, durable and in some ways energy efficient. Because organic material burns up when placed in a furnace, biosolid bricks require as little as half the energy to fire as normal bricks do (depending on how much organic material is in the bricks). The burned organic material also leaves behind spaces in the biosolid bricks, making them lighter, more porous and filled with gas. And because gases are poor thermal conductors, heat passes through biosolid bricks more slowly. That makes them better insulators, which could result in savings on heating and cooling costs, Dr. Mohajerani said. But the trade-off is strength. Although biosolid bricks met industry requirements, they were typically not as sturdy as regular bricks. In a related analysis of the potential production process, the research team determined that making bricks with biosolids would be better for the environment overall, even though biosolid bricks require more water and could produce other forms of pollution. To limit the carbon footprint and ensure sustainability, brick production ideally would take place close to treatment plants and biosolids stockpiles, said Dr. Mohajerani. “Otherwise, I don’t think it is likely on a large scale in the near future.” Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

2019,You Want to Buy Art. Is It About Love or Money?,"Wealth Matters The value of a Picasso or a Ferrari typically rises in a strong economy, as do shares in a consumer staple like Procter & Gamble. But when the economy sours, those shares may be easier than the other possessions to shed. As wealthy collectors pull back on extravagances, investors could get stuck holding an asset they might have to unload at a loss. In 2012, when the market was roaring for passion assets — those in which you put money where your heart is — I wrote a series of columns on why people invested in things like vineyards, racehorses and sports teams. This time, I will look at five nontraditional asset classes that are popular with wealthy investors and with an eye on what to expect in a market downturn. Art is the first of five valuable but illiquid assets I plan to examine in the coming weeks. The others are cars, collectibles like wine and jewelry, private equity and real estate. Collecting fine art is as much about beauty and desirability as it about the investment value. Given how strong the art market has been over the past few years, many collectors may not be prepared if the economy slows and the appetite for art cools. Roy Sebag, a hedge fund analyst turned entrepreneur, has a collection that includes a drawing by Pablo Picasso and works by 17th-century Dutch masters. He said he took an objective view of his collection’s value: looking at both the art’s intrinsic value — how an artist’s work has appreciated — and its social currency. “It’s subjective,” but it still allows for analysis on historical pricing, said Mr. Sebag, founder of Goldmoney, a site for buying and selling precious metals, and co-founder of Mené, a jewelry line. “It isn’t a coincidence that Picasso is viewed by every high-net-worth individual as an asset they want to own.” There are supposedly 5,000 works by Picasso, he said, a stock large enough to build a network of interested parties. By his analysis, avoiding emerging artists and buying works of a well-known artist like Picasso, despite having to pay millions of dollars to do so, is like buying a hedge against recession. “We know trends change quickly,” he said. Such beliefs could be tested in the next few years. In 2018, works by the 100 top-selling artists, as measured by the market research firm Artprice, rose 4.3 percent in value, but the art market as a whole lost 1.9 percent. The company explained that buyers were becoming more demanding. “While happy to pay big money for rare and high-quality works with irreproachable provenance, they often ‘pass’ on other works,” its report said. In 2008, the art market was not immune to huge swings in value. Sales of postwar and contemporary art fell by more than two-thirds from 2008 to 2009, according to data collected by Athena Art Finance, which lends against art portfolios. It took until 2012 for sales to surpass pre-recession levels. To guard against seeing the value of an art collection plummet, dealers advise prudence and, not surprisingly, connoisseurship. If there is a lesson to be drawn from the recession, it is that buyers become more discerning in both the artists they favor and the price they will pay, said B. J. Topol, co-president of Topol Childs Art Advisory, which works on behalf of wealthy clients. “There’s a reshuffling in a recession,” she said. “The trendy artist of the time, people aren’t looking at him. People want to make sure they’re buying a known commodity and not taking risk.” Ms. Topol said she saw signs of a slowdown in the art market at the Art Basel international art fair in Miami Beach in December. Art wasn’t being snapped up in the first few minutes. Instead, buyers had a chance to digest what they were seeing and negotiate on price. Regardless of the climate, she advises not to buy on trends, yet she stops short of the adage to buy what you love. That could be financially disastrous. “If you combine your passion with an informed decision,” she said, “you’ll have something you love every day and maybe it goes up one day.” Other collectors amass idiosyncratic collections whose value is greater together than apart. Peeling off several pieces in a downturn could depress the value of the collection as a whole, said Jean Pigozzi, a venture capitalist and art collector. “I’m not at all like all the other hedge fund collectors,” said Mr. Pigozzi, who has amassed a significant collection of contemporary African art. “I’ve never collected thinking what I collect would be a good investment.” He said most of his pieces were not worth more than $100,000. Compare that with a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, among the best-selling contemporary artists today. Mr. Pigozzi paid $1,000 for an artwork by Basquiat in 1982 and sold it last year for $3.2 million. What he has is a unique collection that is often included in museum shows and sought after by auction houses. In its totality, it offers a window into sub-Saharan art of the past 30 years. But Mr. Pigozzi knows selling it would be difficult without breaking it apart. Instead, he hopes to create a museum for it. Approaching art as a pure investment can be difficult, because values of an artist’s work can change substantially in ways not associated with typical capital markets investing. The value of works by Wifredo Lam, for instance, has doubled or even tripled in the last decade because of a reappraisal of his place in art history, said Isabelle Bscher, the third-generation owner of Galerie Gmurzynska, which has represented artists including Yves Klein, Joan Miró and Picasso. Lam, who died in 1982, was Cuban by birth and grouped with other Latin American artists at auctions, which drew a specific collector. But he was later seen as a modern artist, because he was a friend of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and other midcentury artists. As his artworks moved to more popular auctions, their value has doubled or tripled in a decade, Ms. Bscher said. A similar shift happened with Picasso about 15 years ago, she said. Collectors did not want to buy his work created after 1965, when the artist was in his 80s and seen as past his prime. At the time, the artworks were inexpensive, but they have since risen in value. Her advice: “If you buy the period of an artist that is not in fashion, you can make a great investment.” There are of course plenty of collectors with enough wealth to not really care about the short-term hit in value that the work on their walls may take. Hilary Geary Ross, an art collector and the wife of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, said she had always loved the work of René Magritte, the Belgian surrealist, and began buying his work when she and Mr. Ross married in 2004. She has 36 pieces by Magritte, worth in excess of $100 million. They include famous works like “La Clairvoyance.” The billionaire couple have rarely sold any of their works, but Mrs. Ross said they did take advantage of the 2008 downturn to buy paintings. “People come to us with them, because they know we like them,” she said. In distressed markets, social concerns may keep some people from working with auction houses. They can try private sales — as happened with the Ross’s acquisitions in 2008 — to sell something quietly. But Ms. Topol said that even then, discerning collectors were going to drive a hard bargain. If that happens, she said, dealers and auction houses can step in to help. But her advice echoes that of others: Don’t sell art in a downturn unless other sources of liquidity have dried up. Mr. Sebag said that the art he owned had increased in value far more than other investments he had made, but that he would sell it only if he ceased to enjoy it. “I think art is something you purchase without an exit strategy,” Mr. Sebag said. “My idea of liquidity is in other investments.” Having those other buckets to draw from is important — otherwise, you could be forced to sell a prized work for less than you would want to when the economy sours.",The New York Times
2019,YouTube Bans Comments on Videos of Young Children in Bid to Block Predators,"SAN FRANCISCO — YouTube will disable comments on most videos that include children 13 and younger after coming under fire for failing to keep pedophiles from posting suggestive remarks on such videos, the company said on Thursday. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a blog post that over the next few months, it would suspend comments on videos of young minors — those 13 and under — and older teenagers that may risk “attracting predatory behavior.” The move is a response to the latest content-related crisis to confront YouTube: a video documenting how pedophiles have used comments on videos of children to guide other predators. After the video highlighting the practice went viral, several companies whose advertisements had appeared in the videos at issue said they would boycott YouTube. In general, the videos did not violate YouTube’s standards and showed mostly innocent behavior like young girls doing gymnastics or playing Twister. But the comments posted below the videos became overrun with suggestive remarks directed at the children. YouTube said last week that it had disabled comments on tens of millions of videos featuring children under 13. The company said it planned to alter its algorithm over the next several months to create a blanket policy. “Recently, there have been some deeply concerning incidents regarding child safety on YouTube,” Susan Wojcicki, company’s chief executive, wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the move. “Nothing is more important to us than ensuring the safety of young people on the platform.” The company said it would make an exception for a small number of channels on the site that feature content considered to be at less risk for attracting pedophiles, such as toy-review videos; the channels will be required to actively moderate comments. YouTube said it would use a new machine-learning system to identify and remove predators’ comments. The company, which has said it removes hundreds of millions of comments from videos every quarter for violating its rules, estimated that the new approach would double the number of comments flagged for removal. YouTube has struggled to keep up with pedophiles’ sometimes subtle methods for leaving suggestive remarks on videos of children. Rather than making flagrantly sexual statements, commenters have posted time stamps directing others to moments in videos that can appear compromising when paused, like a girl’s backside or bare legs. In some instances, the commenters in question simply posted strings of sexually suggestive emojis.",The New York Times
2019,YouTube Unleashed a Conspiracy Theory Boom. Can It Be Contained?,"The Shift Last month, the YouTube star Shane Dawson uploaded his new project: a 104-minute documentary, “Conspiracy Theories With Shane Dawson.” In the video, set to a spooky instrumental soundtrack, Mr. Dawson unspooled a series of far-fetched hypotheses. Among them: that iPhones secretly record their owners’ every utterance; that popular children’s TV shows contain subliminal messages urging children to commit suicide; that the recent string of deadly wildfires in California was set on purpose, either by homeowners looking to collect insurance money or by the military using a type of high-powered laser called a “directed energy weapon.” None of this was fact-based, of course, and some of the theories seemed more like jokey urban legends than serious accusations. Still, his fans ate it up. The video has gotten more than 30 million views, a hit even by Mr. Dawson’s standards. A follow-up has drawn more than 20 million views and started a public feud with Chuck E. Cheese’s, the restaurant chain, which was forced to deny claims that it recycles customers’ uneaten pizza slices into new pizzas. Mr. Dawson’s conspiracy series arrived at a particularly awkward moment for YouTube, which has been reckoning with the vast troves of misinformation and extreme content on its platform. In late January, the company announced that it was changing its recommendations algorithm to reduce the spread of “borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.” It cited, as examples, “videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.” Mr. Dawson, whose real name is Shane Lee Yaw, has more than 20 million subscribers and a devoted teenage fan base. He has built his lucrative career by, among other talents, understanding what kinds of content plays well on YouTube. For years, that meant conspiracy theories — lots and lots of them, all delivered with the same wide-eyed credulity. In a 2016 video, he wondered aloud if the first Apollo moon landing was staged by NASA. (“It’s a theory,” he said, “but, I mean, all the evidence is not looking good.”) In 2017, he discussed the false theory that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a hoax. (“I know it’s crazy,” he said, “but just look at some of these videos.”) And last year, he devoted a segment of a video to flat-earth theory, which he concluded “kind of makes sense.” In fairness, Mr. Dawson is a far cry from partisan cranks like Alex Jones, the Infowars founder, who was barred by YouTube and other social networks last year for hate speech. Most of Mr. Dawson’s videos have nothing to do with conspiracies, and many are harmless entertainment. But the popularity of Mr. Dawson’s conspiracy theories illuminates the challenge YouTube faces in cleaning up misinformation. On Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, the biggest influencers largely got famous somewhere else (politics, TV, sports) and have other vectors of accountability. But YouTube’s stars are primarily homegrown, and many feel — not entirely unreasonably — that after years of encouraging them to build their audiences with viral stunts and baseless rumor-mongering, the platform is now changing the rules on them. Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson’s videos contain precisely the type of viral misinformation that YouTube now says it wants to limit. And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform’s biggest stars? A representative for Mr. Dawson did not respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said: “We recently announced that we’ve started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways. This is a gradual change and will get more and more accurate over time.” Part of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook — which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm — is that the definition of “harmful” misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act. Take, for example, Mr. Jones’s assertion that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax perpetrated by gun control advocates. That theory, first dismissed as outrageous and loony, took on new gravity after Mr. Jones’s supporters began harassing the grieving parents of victims. Or take Pizzagate, a right-wing conspiracy theory that alleged that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were secretly running a child-sex ring. The theory, which was spread in a variety of videos on YouTube and other platforms, might have remained an internet oddity. But it became a menace when a believer showed up at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle, vowing to save the children he believed were locked in the basement. To its credit, YouTube has taken some minor steps to curb misinformation. Last year, it began appending Wikipedia blurbs to videos espousing certain conspiracy theories, and changed the way it handles search results for breaking news stories so that reliable sources are given priority over opportunistic partisans. And last summer, it was among the many social networks to bar Mr. Jones and Infowars. In a multipart Twitter thread this month, Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube software engineer, called the company’s decision to change its recommendation algorithm a “historic victory.” Mr. Chaslot noted that this algorithm — which was once trained to maximize the amount of time users spend on the site — often targeted vulnerable users by steering them toward other conspiracy theory videos it predicts they will watch. The change “will save thousands from falling into such rabbit holes,” he wrote. In an interview last week, Mr. Chaslot was more circumspect, saying YouTube’s move may have amounted to a “P.R. stunt.” Because the change will affect only which videos YouTube recommends — conspiracy theories will still show up in search results, and they will still be freely available to people who subscribe to the channels of popular conspiracy theorists — he called it a positive but insufficient step. “It will address only a tiny fraction of conspiracy theories,” he said. Last year, Mr. Chaslot built a website, AlgoTransparency.org, to give outsiders a glimpse of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms at work. The site draws from a list of more than 1,000 popular YouTube channels, and calculates which videos are most often recommended to people who watch those channels’ videos. On many days, conspiracy theories and viral hoaxes top the list. One recent day, the most frequently recommended video was “This Man Saw Something at Area 51 That Left Him Totally Speechless!,” which was recommended to viewers of 138 channels. The second most recommended video, which linked a series of recent natural disasters to apocalyptic prophecies from the Book of Revelation, was recommended to viewers of 126 of those top channels. In our conversation, Mr. Chaslot suggested one possible solution to YouTube’s misinformation epidemic: new regulation. Lawmakers, he said, could amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the law that prevents platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for content posted by their users. The law now shields internet platforms from liability for all user-generated content they host, as well as the algorithmic recommendations they make. A revised law could cover only the content and leave platforms on the hook for their recommendations. “Right now, they just don’t have incentive to do the right thing,” Mr. Chaslot said. “But if you pass legislation that says that after recommending something 1,000 times, the platform is liable for this content, I guarantee the problem will be solved very fast.” But even new laws governing algorithmic recommendations wouldn’t reverse the influence of YouTube celebrities like Mr. Dawson. After all, many of his millions of views come from his fans, who subscribe to his channel and seek out his videos proactively. YouTube’s first challenge will be defining which of these videos constitute “harmful” misinformation, and which are innocent entertainment meant for an audience that is largely in on the joke. But there is a thornier problem here. Many young people have absorbed a YouTube-centric worldview, including rejecting mainstream information sources in favor of platform-native creators bearing “secret histories” and faux-authoritative explanations. When those creators propagate hoaxes and conspiracy theories as part of a financially motivated growth strategy, it seeps in with some percentage of their audience. And sometimes — in ways no algorithm could predict — it leads viewers to a much darker place. It’s possible that YouTube can still beat back the flood of conspiracy theories coursing through its servers. But doing it will require acknowledging how deep these problems run and realizing that any successful effort may look less like a simple algorithm tweak, and more like deprogramming a generation.",The New York Times
2019,Young People Left Behind in China’s Snowbound Rust Belt,"lens Ronghui Chen’s photographs of young people in Northeastern China capture a loneliness he recognized in his own trek from village to city. As a sub-zero blizzard raged outside, Ronghui Chen pushed open a glass window to let in a gust of cold air. He was in Yichun, a faded boomtown in northeastern China, where in December, 2016 he began photographing young people whose isolation he recognized in his own life. “This kind of heating puts people into the most lethargic state, depriving them of the ability to reflect,” he later said in a phone interview. At the same time, he also finds it frightening to become emotionally hardened like ice underfoot in the northeastern regions that made up China’s Rust Belt. “I feel that many people, like the land itself, are making themselves freeze.” Over three successive winters, he worked on “Freezing Lands,” a collection of large-format photographs that explores contrasts. The cold conveyed the desolation of towns and cities whose populations are shrinking as people leave the region for education and work in bustling cities, just as Mr. Chen had done himself. The young residents spent their winters in warm and brightly painted interiors, uncertain about the future. “Like so many other young Chinese, I left my hometown in search of opportunity in the city,” Mr. Chen wrote in a statement about his photography. “And like so many other young Chinese, this has left me with an unstable sense of self. Now that I’ve left, I feel out of place in both city and countryside.” Many migrant workers are not recognized as permanent residents in the cities they move to, nor can they receive the same social benefits or government subsidies. But even for those who have remained, or returned after studying or working in bigger cities, the question of whether to leave or stay is never far from mind. Between 2000 and 2010, the population has fallen in about 180 cities, according to a 2016 study, as many residents searched for work elsewhere. In northeastern townships and cities that once housed bustling factories, power plants, and mining and logging operations, natural resources are depleting, the gross domestic product is dropping and business prospects are all but disappearing. Mr. Chen is perhaps best known for his photographs of so-called Christmas factories, where migrant workers made Christmas stockings, snowflakes and plastic reindeer in workshops filled with red glitter all year long. Their grim daily labor was a surreal clash with the holiday cheer they manufactured. One portrait in the collection earned Mr. Chen a second-place World Press Photo Award in 2015. The recognition came with the prize of a large-format camera, signaling a turning point in Mr. Chen’s practice. “Freezing Land” is his second project shot in large format. “As a journalist, you aspire to capture images quickly, leaving the thinking to a digital camera,” he said. In contrast, the slow-moving technique of large-format photography allows him to pay closer attention to his subject and to capture a sense of uncertainty. The considered technique required by large-format photography matched his approach to the project, which began as a photojournalistic assignment but veered into more personal territory. On his first day in the snowstorm, he turned to Kuaishou, a short-video app particularly popular in the region, to find young people to photograph. Some were personable and witty entertainers who made their living through live-streaming; others searched for drinking companions after returning home from university. “Most of the people I photographed could be called outsiders, but they’re also the same as everyone,” Mr. Chen said. “The internet narrowed the distance from person to person, but true intimacy has also vanished.” He spent three winters visiting the Northeast a week or two at a time, expanding the project to five cities: Yichun, Longjing, Fularji, Fushun and Shuangyashan. Departing from pure documentary photography, Mr. Chen focused on what stood out to him and touched his feelings, rather than making an objective account. Through photographing the young people, Mr. Chen recognized facets of his own story: the conflict of leaving home for an unfamiliar city, the isolation of belonging to neither place. “Even though this place is very remote to me, my loneliness is not so different from theirs,” he said. “When huge social changes impact you personally, there is a clear helplessness that results.” Originally from a temperate village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Mr. Chen saw photography in the punishing weather as a test of endurance. The large-format camera could feel like a ball of fire to the touch, and there was also the lugging of equipment on slippery ice. But Mr. Chen said it was crucial for him to walk in the shoes of his subjects, to see the difficulty of life in the cold. When he first arrived, he was struck by the strong glare on the snow that piled in thick layers outside his window. His eyes stung, blurring his vision. But the closer he looked, the more he saw his own story reflected. “Snow is very beautiful, but it can conceal a lot of things,” he said. Follow @nytimesphoto and @NYtmay on Twitter.

2019,Your Favorite Dog Breed Did Not Win Westminster. Here’s Why.,"There are some dogs that make the crowd at the 143rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show go wild: golden retrievers, Labradors, dachshunds and bulldogs. But they almost never win best in show. “If you had a popularity contest, we would win,” said Christine Miele, the Eastern vice president of the Golden Retriever Club of America. “We have everything in the world going for us except Westminster, but I think we’re O.K. with that.” The top five most popular breeds in terms of ownership in 2017 were, in order, Labradors, German shepherds, golden retrievers, French bulldogs and bulldogs, according to the American Kennel Club. But no Labrador, golden retriever or French bulldog has ever won best in show. German shepherds won in 2017 and 1987. And long ago, bulldogs won here, too — in 1913 and 1955. Since then, they have suffered a dry spell that has lasted for centuries (in dog years) and continued on Tuesday when a wire fox terrier named King claimed the title. “When the bulldog comes out, everybody always cheers,” said Llely Toledo, who was competing at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan on Monday with April, a 2-year-old bulldog. “They’re competitive for their class, but it’s hard because the other breeds really stand out, too.” Other popular breeds, like dachshunds, also tend to fare poorly here each year. Carlos Puig, a longtime dachshund handler whose 7-year-old longhaired dachshund, Burns, won best hound on Monday, attributed that in part to the breed’s tiny stature. “In a ring like this, they have to be as flashy and fancy as some of the fancier hounds — like Afghans or greyhounds — but its hard because they’re the shortest and smallest in their group,” said Mr. Puig, 57. “They kind of get lost because of their size.” Burns is the top-winning longhaired dachshund in history, with 26 best in show titles, Mr. Puig said. But he has never won the Westminster Dog Show. Walter Jones, a vice president of the Dachshund Club of America, said that no dachshund had ever won best in show at Westminster. “I think one of the reasons some breeds don’t make it to the end is that they just aren’t the glamour breeds who are so flashy in the group,” he said. “Dachshunds compete against many larger breeds in the hound group that are simply more impressive.” For a dog to win best in show, he or she first has to win best in breed and then win best in group, as Burns did on Monday night when he was judged best hound. On Tuesday, all the winners of best in group then competed against one another for best in show. “It’s a hard win,” Ms. Miele said. “It won’t be a golden retriever. It’s not going to happen.” For some breeds, their popularity and their losing streak may go hand in hand. Ms. Miele said there are so many golden retrievers in America that it is hard for any one of them to establish dominance on the dog show circuit. “Judges are not seeing the same golden in the state of Washington as they are in New York or Connecticut,” she said. “They’re seeing very different dogs and very different styles of dogs.” And because the breed’s gene pool is so large, there are many slightly different ways for a golden retriever to look: Some have coats that are long and flowing, others less so; some have fur that is a deep golden, while others are more cream-colored. That can make it complicated to establish a breed standard, which is used by dog show judges. “We don’t have one sense of, ‘This is the perfect golden retriever,’” she said. “We have, ‘This is one wonderful golden retriever and this is another wonderful golden retriever.’ We have many candidates that fit our breed standard.” Part of it may have to do with the judges as well. Of the small number of people in the country who are qualified to serve as best in show judges, none are golden retriever breeders, Ms. Miele said. Experts in other breeds expressed similar concerns. Patricia Ropp, the vice president of the Bulldog Club of America and a licensed bulldog judge, said in an email that she did not think judges were “prejudiced to certain breeds.” But she said that they “have different breed backgrounds and experiences that can affect the outcome.” At Madison Square Garden, the dachshund handlers agreed. “This show is all about getting lucky with your judge lineup,” said Madeline Peterson, whose 2-year-old wire-haired dachshund, Winston, drew a wave of cheers from the crowd on Monday. If the judges don’t have experience with dachshunds, she said, they can be overshadowed by their long-legged competition. “You know,” she said, “they’re just little dogs in a big-dog group.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Your Grandchildren Are Already in Debt,"It’s irresponsible to pretend that America can add splashy new social programs without finding a way to pay for them. Mr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Medicare for All. The Green New Deal. Free college tuition. With each new entrant into the Democratic presidential sweepstakes comes a fresh cascade of ambitious social programs to entice and excite would-be supporters. The list of “payfors,” to use a bit of Washington jargon, grows more slowly. They’ll pay for this how, again? Tax the rich, tax the rich — or take cover behind a convenient bit of progressive dogma: Don’t worry about the fiscal impact because America’s rising budget deficits and debt levels don’t much matter. That’s a scary drift of thought, and it should set off alarm bells for all Americans. Vast increases in debt will ultimately compromise Washington’s ability to maintain its current array of spending programs, let alone add new ones, and threaten our standard of living. A short history: While Republicans once were the party of fiscal responsibility, President Ronald Reagan threw that out the window by embracing enormous tax cuts justified by a fiction: the idea that the resulting growth would more than pay for them. More than a decade later, President Bill Clinton nursed the budget back into surplus, only to have President George W. Bush force through his own tax cuts. His vice president, Dick Cheney, once reportedly said, “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter.” That attitude, plus the puncturing of the dot-com bubble, two wars and a financial crisis, brought us our first $1 trillion gap in 2009. But by 2015, President Barack Obama had whittled the deficit down to $439 billion. Then came President Trump, with his vast tax cuts along with a bipartisan move to abandon spending restraint with the fiscal 2018 budget. The resulting legislation added $400 billion to the deficit, according to an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Budget, and the consequence is a deficit for the current fiscal year of nearly $900 billion. On present course and speed, the United States is on track to experience the highest deficits in its history, reaching more than $2 trillion a year by 2029. Those annual gaps are projected to bring America’s total debt to nearly $33 trillion by that date, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. That’s double today’s level and more than the size of our economy, a peacetime record. One concern often raised by deficit hawks is that so much borrowing by the government could force interest rates higher, making it harder for businesses to borrow and reducing the amount of capital available to the private sector. In the worst case scenario, they fear that credit markets could partially or completely shut down, putting a hard brake on the economy. While that’s not impossible, my principal fear is that all this irresponsible borrowing amounts to intergenerational theft. America is simultaneously indulging in two deficit-busting desires: for lower taxes and for robust government programs. Eventually, the interest on all the debt will force the governments of future generations to reverse those fiscally imprudent policies in order to pay for today’s profligacy. It’s like a couple in their 40s deciding to borrow money to sustain a lavish lifestyle and then leaving the debts for their kids to pay off after they’re gone. But that’s not all. The generally accepted measure of America’s national debt doesn’t include obligations for future retirement and health care benefits. In a perfect world, those programs would function like insurance; each generation’s annual premiums would pay for support received during its golden years. That principle was abandoned long ago. Based on the current demographics of the American population, we would need to set aside $49 trillion to make the Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds truly solvent. Meanwhile, progressives argue that certain kinds of spending are, in reality, investments that will bring large dividends in the future. With interest rates still near historic lows, they contend that the returns from borrowing for these investments would greatly exceed interest costs. While that’s true, deciding what is an investment and what is just an expense with no potential return would inevitably become a political debate. Democrats and Republicans might quickly agree about investing in building roads and bridges but what about spending on education? Should that be considered an investment? What about work force training or research and development? I fear that in the end, many spending programs would be classified as investments simply to make the budget deficit appear smaller. Regardless, taxes need to go up, starting with unwinding the Trump tax cuts for individuals, which favored the rich. Next, we should take a tougher look at corporate taxation. Reducing the corporate tax rate to maintain our global competitiveness made sense, but it didn’t need to go all the way from 35 percent to 21 percent. Then there are potential new sources of tax revenue. I’ve expressed support, for example, for eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and dividends. Let’s also reform overly generous estate tax provisions. While I’m all for putting most of the burden on the rich, we need to be mindful of realistic boundaries to ensure that tax avoidance or even expatriation don’t start to rise. On the spending side, unfortunately, taking a hard look at the entitlements programs is essential. I’m not suggesting eviscerating them, but ideas like modestly raising the retirement age or scaling benefits based on need should be explored. Even implementing all these adjustments won’t prudently provide room for expansive new social programs. Adopting those would require still tougher choices about raising taxes and trimming spending. If we care about our kids and the country we are leaving them, Americans will make these tough decisions instead of continuing to duck them.

2019,Your Quick Oscars Recap,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Did you watch the Oscars last night? If you did, you might still be trying to process all that was packed into the hostless, compact telecast from Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre. And if you skipped the spectacle, you missed the source of a thousand reaction gifs: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s crackling performance of “Shallow.” The piece, from “A Star Is Born,” also won best original song. Either way, here’s what else you need to know to credibly participate in today’s water cooler discussions. “Green Book” won best picture, but a lot of people weren’t happy about it. The movie came into the Academy Awards facing backlash on several fronts. First, critics — including The New York Times’s Wesley Morris in a great essay exploring the topic — said that the movie fell into the trap of racial reconciliation fantasy and cliché, glossing over painful history in favor of a feel-good narrative. The family of its subject, the pianist Don Shirley, publicly condemned the film. And there were other controversies surrounding various people involved with the film. After it took the top honor, Spike Lee — whose “BlacKkKlansman” was also nominated and whose groundbreaking film “Do the Right Thing” was famously snubbed by the Academy — likened the win to a blown call by a referee at a basketball game. Spike Lee finally took home a competitive Academy Award, though. Dressed in a purple suit and wearing rings that paid tribute to “Do the Right Thing,” Mr. Lee gave a passionate, overtly political speech. Here’s the full text. How did the no-host thing go? By most accounts, it went fine. The show moved along at a steady clip after an opening performance by Queen, lately fronted by Adam Lambert. Then, Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler gave a funny, brief “not” opening monologue, since they were, as they repeatedly pointed out, not hosting the show. “Black Panther” and black women made history. Hannah Beachler and Ruth E. Carter won Oscars for production design and costume design, respectively. They were the first African-American women to win in those categories. Who else won the major categories? You can check The Times’s list of winners here, but it’s worth noting that Glenn Close, now the most nominated actor without a statuette, did not win for best actress. That, instead, went to Olivia Colman of “The Favourite,” who seemed genuinely shocked and pleased. (We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,You’ll Want to Put This Chile-Garlic Oil on Everything,"A good Appetite This easy-to-make oil adds spice and crunch to lemony chicken cutlets. Melissa Clark can’t get enough of it. I collect chile condiments the way my grandmother collected miniature porcelain baskets of flowers, all lined up in perpetual bloom on every flat surface of her living room. Open my fridge, and you’ll see a similar display: this one, of jars and bottles vying to be smeared over avocado toast, roast chicken or buttered, jammy eggs. Like my grandmother and her myriad posies, I value the differences in each condiment, the various types of chiles, the size of the flakes or smoothness of the purée, whether they’re preserved with oil or vinegar or brine. Some brands have sugar, garlic and spices; some are plainer and more minimalist. A current cult favorite, Chile Crunch, combines garlic, red-pepper flakes and oil, cooked slowly together until the garlic turns crisp and a little nutty in flavor, and the chile gets toasted and earthy. I went through most of my first jar in a civilized manner, dashing it on cooked proteins or crostini. But there were times I ate it nearly straight from a spoon, on top of a dab of cottage cheese to mitigate the mouth-searing heat. It wouldn’t have occurred to me to make one myself if I hadn’t seen a recipe in David Tamarkin’s excellent new cookbook, “Cook90” (Little, Brown and Company, 2018). Mr. Tamarkin, the digital director of Epicurious, might be as addicted to chile condiments as I am. He recommends drizzling the easy-to-make oil (which was developed by Rhoda Boone, the video food director for Bon Appétit and Epicurious) on hummus, braised greens or plain yogurt with chickpeas strewn on top. In my recipe, I use the oil as a pungent sauce for thinly sliced chicken cutlets. Given the depth of its flavor, chile-garlic oil is a perfect way to enliven white meat, which tends toward bland. The cutlets get a quick sauté with capers and thinly sliced lemon wedges, both of which caramelize slightly in the pan, before being anointed with the heady chile mix. It’s spicy but not burn-your-tongue hot. Or if you’re not sure about your guests’ heat tolerance, serve the oil on the side. (As a bonus, those who really love chile have more in easy reach.) Then store the leftover oil in the fridge, where it will crown your condiment collection like so many porcelain flowers on a grandmother’s coffee table. There are some things you just can’t get enough of. Recipe: Lemon Chicken With Garlic-Chile Oil Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,You’ve Got Something on Your Teeth,"Models, musicians and normals are adhering tiny jewels known as tooth gems to their teeth. What could go wrong? When Bianca Garcia and Alaia Kleiner, two 20-somethings living in Chicago, went to a friend’s birthday party a few months ago, they were greeted by a line of about 15 women clamoring for one thing: tooth gems. “People were having, like, their entire mouth covered,” Ms. Garcia said. Tooth gems are exactly what they sound like: tiny jewels, usually just a few millimeters in size, applied to the tooth with an adhesive. The gems are temporary — there’s no drilling involved — but permanent issues can arise if they are not installed properly. The trend popped up in the ’90s, but it has made a comeback in recent years with a number of celebrity fans. On the model circuit, women like Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber have been spotted with their teeth adorned with jewels, and they’ve become a signature look for Adwoa Aboah. Drake joined the list of musicians to sport tooth gems after he showed off a sparkling pink diamond gem on Instagram last January. And just a month ago, Ariana Grande flashed her own pair of gems to fans on Twitter. Ms. Garcia and Ms. Kleiner, both 23, each wanted tooth gems, but they were a bit put off by the cost of having one professionally placed. The installation can cost hundreds of dollars depending on the materials used. Instead of shelling out that kind of cash, they purchased a cheap kit online and adhered the gems themselves. They were comfortable enough blinging out one another, but putting gems on acquaintances at the party was a different story. Their materials weren’t particularly high quality — Ms. Garcia described the stones they were using as “normal nail kit gems,” like you’d find at a beauty supply or craft store. The adhesive was also questionable. “I honestly couldn’t even tell you what the glue was,” Ms. Garcia said. “We told our friends, ‘I mean we honestly don’t really know what we’re doing.’” No one seemed to have a problem with it. Once her friends started posting their photos of their gems online, Ms. Garcia’s direct messages were flooded with requests. It was then that she and Ms. Kleiner started to get serious. They researched more thoroughly and visited Ms. Kleiner’s dentist to buy tools and learn about sanitary measures. Eventually, they upgraded from their starter kit gems to Swarovski crystals. Their business grew and the two women began hosting pop-ups. They said they were approached by brands like Nike and Red Bull Music to work at sponsored events in the city. More than “100 people have been walking around Chicago with something on their tooth from us,” Ms. Kleiner said. Still, the women continued to have doubts. “We were like, ‘Do we need a license?’” Ms. Kleiner said, noting that neither of them had a dental background. “‘For all we know, we could be doing something totally bad.’” Eventually, the concerns prompted Ms. Garcia to get out of the game. Susie Juray, the founder of a Los Angeles-based tooth gem retailer called Tooth Kandy, has seen some mishaps from D.I.Y. attempts firsthand. She said one woman drove all the way from San Francisco begging for her help after an inexpensive procedure left the woman’s tooth severely discolored. “Somebody used a very cheap bond — probably a bond that wasn’t even supposed to be put on the inside of a mouth — and it started to brown,” Ms. Juray said. She rushed the woman to a dentist to remove the material. “Some of it did come off. Some of it didn’t, and so there was damage to her tooth,” she said. Ms. Garcia has also seen some dangerous applications. “I went on YouTube and I saw this 10-year-old, I’m not even kidding, put a freaking tooth gem on their tooth with Gorilla glue,” she said. Molly Bennett, the owner of Identity Body Piercing in Chicago, said that tooth gems fall into a “gray area” between the cosmetics and tattoo-and-piercing industries. Many people consider their installation to be a cosmetic procedure because it doesn’t involve drilling holes into the tooth. (According to a spokesperson, the American Dental Association doesn’t currently have a policy on tooth gems or jewelry.) Regardless, Ms. Bennett, who said her client Rolodex includes Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves and Noah Cyrus, doesn’t believe that’s excuse for skimping on training and safety. Ms. Bennett’s father is a dentist and made sure she had plenty of practice before she began offering the service in her shop. She goes through additional measures to protect herself and her clients, building in an age requirement (18 and up) and only using nontoxic gems and dental-grade materials from a medical supplier. Her customers are also required to sign separate insurance and release forms, which include a monthlong guarantee for any incidentals. Services from the Beverly Hills-based dentist Dr. Anjali Rajpal (nickname: the “Diamond Dentist”) come at a higher price, but her clients are willing to pay a premium for peace of mind. Dr. Rajpal’s services range anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per tooth, depending on the type and number of jewels. Dr. Rajpal says that she wasn’t trained to apply tooth gems in dental school, “but because it’s on teeth, I feel like it’s much better handled by someone like me that knows what they’re doing.” Ms. Juray of Tooth Kandy hopes some regulations will be set to help clean up the industry. Until then, she offers a certification process for potential employees, also known as “tooth fairies.” For $3,500, they get a one-on-one training session that includes company guidelines, safety protocol, marketing tips and a complete tooth gem starter kit. So far, Ms. Juray said, more than 150 tooth fairies have received the company’s certification. She urges tooth gem seekers to do their research. “These are your teeth that we’re going to be working on,” Ms. Juray said, noting that clients get what they pay for. “There’s Gucci clients, and there’s Walmart clients. It is what it is. We’re the Gucci at this point.”",The New York Times
2019,Zion Williamson Is Injured as No. 1 Duke Falls to North Carolina,"The final score of one of the most anticipated college basketball games of the season quickly turned into an afterthought on Wednesday night when the star Duke freshman Zion Williamson left the game with a bizarre injury within a minute of the opening tip-off. Williamson, who is widely expected to be the top pick in the N.B.A. draft later this year, appeared to twist his left foot as his sneaker fell apart — with the sole literally breaking off at the seam — while he made a move near the free-throw line. Falling backward, Williamson reached for his right knee after falling to the court. He walked off the court and briefly tried a new pair of sneakers on the bench, but then left the court for the locker room and did not return. After the final whistle, Duke announced that Williamson had sustained a sprained knee. “We’re very concerned about Zion,” Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “It’s a mild knee sprain. We will know about length of time tomorrow. It’s stable.” Nike, which outfits Duke’s teams and provided Williamson’s shoes, said in a statement: “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.” No. 8 North Carolina (21-5), nine-point underdogs before the game at the Blue Devils’ Cameron Indoor Stadium, went on to defeat No. 1 Duke (23-3), 88-72, in a game that was hardly close, particularly once the second half began. The Tar Heels’ senior Luke Maye amassed 30 points and 15 rebounds while being conspicuously not guarded by Williamson, the consensus best player in college basketball. “When the big fellow goes out of the game, it changes a lot of stuff for them,” North Carolina Coach Roy Williams said. Former President Barack Obama and the film director Spike Lee were among those taking in the first matchup this season between the two Atlantic Coast Conference heavyweights known for their fierce rivalry; students had camped out for days to attend, and fans paid thousands of dollars for tickets. The injury to Williamson might be of particular interest to Lee, a well-known fan of the Knicks, one of the several N.B.A. teams that have been hoping to end up with the first pick in the draft so they can select Williamson. Duke still has two other freshmen who are likely to be selected with lottery picks in the draft, R.J. Barrett and Cam Reddish; Barrett led the Blue Devils with 33 points and 13 rebounds, while Reddish added 27 points. But Williamson, who is listed at 6 feet 7 inches and 285 pounds but has the speed of a guard, has been the presumptive player of the year and the prime reason for Duke’s top ranking, and he has captured the sport’s imagination with his immaculate dunks and seemingly impossible defensive efforts. Duke’s next game is on Saturday at Syracuse (18-8), one of three teams to beat Duke this season. (The Orange were dealing with a crisis of their own on Thursday morning after their longtime coach, Jim Boeheim, struck and killed a man with his car on the way home from a game Wednesday night. The police said it appeared to be an accident.) North Carolina will host No. 16 Florida State (20-5). An earlier version of this article misstated Zion Williamson’s listed height and weight. He is listed at 6-foot-7, not 6-9, and 285 pounds, not 280.",The New York Times
2019,"Zion Williamson Will Be Fine, but His Teammates Might Not Be","On College Basketball When Zion Williamson of Duke went down with a severed shoe and a sprained knee 30 seconds into Wednesday night’s showdown with North Carolina, it was bad news for plenty involved. Williamson now has to deal with an injury. Duke had to play its archrival without its best player and duly lost, 88-72. Nike faced questions about its product’s apparent failure. But ESPN, broadcasting the contest as part of its multibillion-dollar deal with the Atlantic Coast Conference, did just fine. The game’s biggest star was injured for nearly 99 percent of the game, yet on Thursday, the network reported that the rivalry had produced its highest-ever ratings for a weeknight college basketball game. The episode crystallized the economic limitations that N.C.A.A. amateurism and N.B.A. rules impose on Williamson, a preternatural talent, and the unique ways that they limit the income of a unique player. If the N.B.A. did not bar high schoolers from heading straight to the league — a rule that may disappear in a few years — then Williamson could already have been playing for, say, the Atlanta Hawks and making several million dollars on his rookie contract. If N.C.A.A. rules did not prevent players from signing endorsements, Williamson could already have been receiving millions from Nike. However, barring an outright catastrophe, Williamson, the likely top draft pick, will be getting paid, soon and well, and at a time when his economic productivity is even higher than it is today. His specialness, though, obscures what some suggest is the greatest injustice of college sports’ policy of amateurism. In contrast to Williamson and a few other superstars, most players in college basketball are denied the right to cash in during what is very likely their moment of peak economic value. “The top guys are worth a lot — on the order of millions a year,” said Daniel Rascher, a sports economist who has studied the economic value of college athletes. “But the seven, eight, nine guys,” he added, referring to the players further down the depth chart, “are going to be several hundred thousand a year in terms of the incremental revenue they bring to the school.” Take Duke’s Jordan Goldwire. He was a midrated recruit out of high school, and his options besides Duke included midmajor programs such as Eastern Kentucky, Coastal Carolina and Nevada-Las Vegas. He is probably not bound for N.B.A. riches. This season, he has not played at all in three A.C.C. games and has averaged fewer than seven minutes in those he has played in. He played eight minutes against the Tar Heels on Wednesday. But that actually made him an essential contributor to a two-hour broadcast worth a lot of money to Duke, the A.C.C. and ESPN. “If you look at the N.B.A., the guys who don’t play very much still get paid a lot,” Rascher said. Or forget about Duke and think of the players at whichever team makes the N.C.A.A. tournament out of the Big South or the Patriot League. Part of that billion-dollar event’s charm comes from the quirky matchups — and the potential for exciting upsets — when such teams face juggernauts like Duke and Kansas in the early rounds. Players on those teams, too, are producing a real financial return for the N.C.A.A., for its member colleges and for CBS and Turner Sports, even though their abilities will never be remotely so lucrative again. Yet they are prohibited from taking more than a relatively small, prescribed share of that value. Moreover, all of these players, too, are risking futures in professional basketball — more of them than you might think. While fewer than 5 percent of Division I men’s basketball players are drafted into the N.B.A., the N.C.A.A. said last year, around half go on to play pro basketball in some form, such as in foreign leagues. From teams in the five top conferences, the N.C.A.A. added, more than three-quarters of players go on to be paid to play. The college sports establishment’s common rebuttal to these lines of thinking is that not paying the players beyond scholarships and related costs is actually crucial to the popularity of their sports. Last year, in a federal lawsuit challenging the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on compensation from an antitrust perspective, Mike Aresco, a former sports television executive who is now commissioner of the American Athletic Conference, testified that college players’ amateur status was a feature of their sports’ appeal, not a bug. “It resonated with fans because it wasn’t professionalized at all,” he said, according to a court transcript, while serving as a witness for several conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. “And it was presented and framed as college students, as college sports.” Among other things, this distinction differentiated college basketball and college football from minor league sports, Aresco said. “And that was very important,” he added, “because minor leagues had never been popular.” He said: “People view college sports separately. And we always maintained that separation.” Rascher was a witness for the plaintiffs in that case, in which a decision is expected any day. His reply to arguments like Aresco’s was to point to the experiment of sorts that took place a few years ago, when the N.C.A.A. permitted colleges to offer athletes funds that included the so-called full cost of attendance. After players began to be “paid” slightly more than they had previously been, college sports’ popularity was not measurably affected. Williamson’s injury in the marquee game of the regular season, particularly so early in the contest, appeared to be a devastating blow to Duke, which entered as a 9-point favorite yet never led once. Being magnanimous, Roy Williams, North Carolina’s colorful coach, acknowledged as much afterward. “Be honest,” he said. “When the big fella goes out of the game, it changes a lot of stuff for them.” Judging from the final score, Williams was right. But be honest: If you looked only at the bottom line, you would not even know that the big fella was gone.",The New York Times
2019,Zion Williamson and Ja Morant Lead College Basketball’s Dunking Renaissance,"Fans tuning in to Saturday’s marquee matchup between Duke and Virginia waited less than two minutes before getting what they came for. On an early Virginia possession, Duke’s Zion Williamson, the impossible freshman who moves with a guard’s agility while weighing 280 pounds, recovered a loose ball and hammered down a two-handed dunk with Old Testament fury. Williamson is expected to be the top pick in this year’s N.B.A. draft and has been this season’s signature player — a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slams that a rare missed dunk last week against Boston College became a highlight in its own right. The only other player who has come close to capturing the collective imagination as Williamson is Murray State’s Ja Morant, a 6-foot-3 sophomore who has played his way from virtual anonymity to likely top-five draft position on a diet of Jordan-esque leaping, flying slams. That Williamson and Morant are this season’s college basketball folk heroes is in one sense entirely logical. Dunks are popular, they dunk well, therefore they are popular. Yet in the context of recent history and current basketball trends, they are outliers as stars because they are relatively poor shooters from long distance. Neither player can efficiently utilize the 3-pointer, which has cemented itself as the most treasured tool in the modern offensive game. Williamson has made less than 30 percent of the 47 3-pointers he has attempted. Morant is at 32.7 percent, below the Division I average of 34.3 percent. Williamson’s attitude toward the 3-pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shots, but by his sensational block of De’Andre Hunter’s ill-fated attempt late in Saturday’s game, an 81-71 Duke victory. Their proficiency in dunking over long-distance shooting signals how special they are, of course, but also might herald a market correction in which basketball’s most reliable shot is back in. In recent seasons, the defining players — the ones who made the biggest impacts and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist — have overwhelmingly been sharpshooters. Think of Oklahoma’s Trae Young and Buddy Hield, Kansas’ Frank Mason III, Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell, Purdue’s Caleb Swanigan and even Duke’s infamous Grayson Allen. The last 7-footer to be named player of the year, Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky, was not a high-volume shooter of 3s, but he made 41.6 percent of his attempts in his Wooden Award-winning season. Villanova won a title at the buzzer when Kris Jenkins hit a 3. Yet this year’s watch list for the Wooden Award includes Williamson and Morant along with other poor-shooting yet exciting non-big men like Duke’s R.J. Barrett and Tennessee’s Grant Williams. Marquette’s Markus Howard has received comparatively little attention as this year’s exemplary high-volume, high-accuracy distance shooter. The ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said dunks were emerging as more crucial to offenses because so-called midrange shots — 2-point attempts that are not from close in near the basket — have been so devalued by analytics. Get to the rim. Get fouled. Or take a 3. Those are the modern basketball credos. Bilas said it was possible that, after several years in which the 3-pointer has predominated in top offenses, coaches have improved at devising defenses to stymie perimeter shooting — in that way placing a premium on wing players who excel at close range. But mainly Williamson and Morant stand out because they are standouts. “We’re seeing more dunks because there are more spectacular athletes out there,” he said. “A lot of guys can dunk, but he dunks on the way up,” he added of Williamson. “His head is literally at or over the rim every time.” Recent seasons’ emphasis on the 3 was easy to understand if you looked to the N.B.A.’s discovery of the 3-pointer’s efficiency. The Golden State Warriors emerged as a dynasty thanks in part to their high-volume 3-point shooting, and even they have been surpassed by teams like the Houston Rockets who attempt 3s at record numbers while confining their other shots to the restricted area under the basket. Meanwhile, the trey picked up a cachet that had previously been reserved only for the jam. Players who sank one from deep mimicked bow-and-arrow shots toward their benches, igniting their teammates; Stephen Curry, Hield and Young became the players youngsters aspired to play like. And to be sure, 3-pointers have not gone away. This season they account for nearly a third of the points scored in Division I, according to KenPom.com, the highest ever and part of a steady upward trajectory. Teams are making 34.3 percent of attempts, which is just a few fractions of a percent off the past couple years’ heights. What have positively plummeted are, as Bilas suggested, midrange attempts. According to Ken Pomeroy, KenPom.com’s proprietor, midrange shots — defined essentially as 2-point attempts beyond a couple feet from the basket — account for barely a quarter of total field goal attempts this season. That figure was 33 percent as recently as the 2012-13 season. “The 15- to 20-footers are becoming extinct,” Pomeroy said in an interview. With players setting up farther from the basket, the dunk opportunity has opened perhaps more than ever before. And into that breach have stepped an uncommonly talented crop of dunkers. “This is the best dunking college basketball has seen in a while,” said Chuck Millan, a dunk coach involved not only with high schoolers but with the N.B.A.’s dunk contest, which will be staged Saturday night. Millan highlighted lesser known players with sensational abilities, including Connecticut’s Kwintin Williams, Florida Gulf Coast’s Troy Baxter and Arkansas-Little Rock’s Rayjon Tucker — “a freak of nature,” as Millan put it. As for Williamson and Morant, Millan said that, as with chocolate and vanilla, a comparison comes down to personal preference — although he may ultimately fall on Team Zion. “With Ja, it’s the dunks in traffic, because he’s little, and the body contact he takes,” Millan said. “Zion, being 6-8, 280, seeing him be just so agile and almost ballerina-like, being such a huge dude — it’s more impressive.”",The New York Times
2019,Zion Williamson’s Injury Has Some Saying He Should Quit Duke,"A freakish injury to Duke’s Zion Williamson, college basketball’s best and most prominent player, only seconds into a game on Wednesday night has instantaneously renewed a debate about the contradictions of the sport’s economic foundation, shining a harsh new light on the N.C.A.A.’s policy of amateurism and the influence of billion-dollar shoe companies. It also raised an important question: Should Williamson ever suit up for another college game? Fans were asking the question. An N.B.A. player was, too, even before Duke announced that Williamson had sprained his right knee in the fall. “It’s a legitimate question,” said Ramogi Huma, the founder and president of the College Athletes Players Association, an advocate for players’ rights. In the first minute of top-ranked Duke’s game against its archrival, eighth-ranked North Carolina, Williamson, a 6-foot-7, 285-pound forward whose game is a blend of quickness and power, pivoted with the ball near the free-throw line. As he planted a foot to reverse direction, his left sneaker collapsed and tore apart from the sheer torque of the move. Williamson fell backward in a split, grabbing his right knee. He walked off the court, and did not return. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said afterward that Williamson had sustained a knee injury, but that the joint was “stable.” Pending further testing, the general sense is that Williamson — and Duke, and Nike, which made the shoe — had avoided the worst. Williamson, widely considered the nation’s best college player, is expected to be available to Duke in time for its conference tournament or the N.C.A.A. tournament, which begins in a month. That is, should Williamson elect to return. Huma cited the example of a top football player who found himself with a more serious injury a few years ago; that player elected to end his college career prematurely, to limit the risk to his professional payday. “To continue to risk his future in an unjust system that doesn’t allow him to be compensated just doesn’t make sense,” Huma said. The math behind the argument against Williamson’s returning is simple. Per N.C.A.A. rules, Duke is not compensating Williamson, an 18-year-old freshman, beyond a scholarship and the related costs of studying at, and playing for, the university. That is how the college sports economy works, even as Duke; its conference, the Atlantic Coast Conference; television networks; and, of course, Nike, the apparel company that sponsors Duke and made the shoe that so spectacularly ripped apart, reap billions of dollars from the efforts and talents of preprofessional athletes like Williamson. As a private university, Duke does not release details of its apparel deals. The university recently extended its current agreement through 2027. North Carolina, 12 miles away, receives about $10 million a year from Nike. Texas, Michigan and Ohio State, which have more prominent football programs than Duke and North Carolina, have Nike deals worth closer to $17 million annually. Tickets to Wednesday night’s game, at Duke, were being offered for more than $2,000 on the secondary market. Williamson, so far, has earned nothing. Partly for this reason, everyone agrees that he is planning to enter this year’s N.B.A. draft, the first for which he is eligible. He is widely expected to be the No. 1 overall pick and receive a starting contract that would net him tens of millions of dollars. Even before that — but only after his college career is over — the telegenic Williamson, known since high school for his thunderous dunks, will be free to sign million-dollar endorsement deals. The only thing that could halt these inevitabilities would be a serious injury that substantially lowered his draft value. While there is insurance for this kind of event, it rarely pays out and most likely could never account for the loss of value of Williamson’s future professional contracts. So the argument goes: Why chance it by returning to Duke at all? Even if Williamson has a simple sprain of his medial collateral ligament — a minor injury that in a perfect world might not sideline him for more than a week or two — the risk of returning to a team that does not pay him is borne solely by Williamson. Donovan Mitchell, who played for two years at Louisville before the Utah Jazz selected him in the 2017 N.B.A. draft, suggested as much in a tweet after Williamson was hurt on Wednesday night, writing, “Again let’s remember all the money that went into this game … and these players get none of it … and now Zion gets hurt … something has to change @NCAA.” There are, however, also reasons for Williamson to return to try to help the Blue Devils win their sixth national championship. He may feel loyalty to his teammates, who include several other freshmen likely bound for the N.B.A. this year, or to his coaches. Many young basketball players grow up watching the N.C.A.A. tournament and dream of playing in it themselves; a star turn in March and April would enhance Williamson’s formidable marketability, even if it could do little to raise his draft stock. Still, even college administrators said he should at least consider skipping it. “Every time there’s something like this, there needs to be continual exploration and dialogue about what, if anything, should be done to make it different,” said Dan Beebe, a consultant and former commissioner of the Big 12 Conference. “Do we provide more resources because of all the money coming in and others who are benefiting from it — including coaches, athletic directors, commissioners?” Beebe added. “But then you get into really complex questions that need to be asked about how far do you go with that?” In football, a more injury-prone sport, there have been recent examples of players skipping season-ending bowl games before they enter the N.F.L. draft. In October, Ohio State defensive lineman Nick Bosa, a junior, had surgery after a core muscle injury. While there was no timetable for his return, he announced then that he would withdraw from college to focus on recovering and training for the draft. The questions surrounding Williamson’s options are related to those that an N.C.A.A. commission addressed last season after federal prosecutors revealed extensive corruption in college basketball recruiting. Some of the remedies the commission proposed could eliminate future situations like Williamson’s. For instance, it lobbied the N.B.A. and its players’ union to eliminate the current rule requiring players to be a year removed from high school before playing in the league. The league already plans to create the opportunity for elite players to earn $125,000 salaries in its developmental league rather than attend college. But the commission did not address what many say is the fundamental issue: the gap between the money that players like Williamson generate for universities, leagues, apparel companies and others, and those players’ inability to be compensated. In that light, what might be most shocking about Williamson’s current situation is that something like it did not happen sooner. On Wednesday, hours before the Duke-North Carolina game, Huma was on the phone with a staff member for a Washington state senator who is sponsoring a bill that would permit athletes to be paid and to retain agents. “I literally gave the example: What if Zion Williamson got hurt?” Huma said. “I guarantee you,” he added, “if Duke were free to offer Zion Williamson money for him to play, they would jump at the chance.” An earlier version of this article misstated the listed height and weight of Zion Williamson. He is 6-foot-7 and 285 pounds, not 6-foot-9 and 280 pounds.",The New York Times

2019,اختفاء أميرة. شريط فيديو يقدم أدلة مقلقة.,BEIRUT — بيروت – لم تغادر الأميرة المعروفة باسم الشيخة لطيفة دبي، الإمارة المتألقة التي يحكمها والدها، منذ 18 سنة. وقد رُفضت طلباتها بالسفر والدراسة في مكانٍ آخر، كما أُخذ جواز سفرها منها، ومُنعت من الذهاب إلى منازل أصدقائها، وُمنعوا هم أيضًا من زيارة قصرها. بعمر الثانية والثلاثين، لم تكن الشيخة لطيفة بنت محمد آل مكتوم تذهب إلى أي مكان من دون سائق يراقبها. وقالت في فيديو سجلته سرًا العام الماضي: “ما من عدالة هنا، ولا سيما إذا كنت امرأة، فيمكن التخلص من حياتك”. تلقّى أصدقاؤها في الخارج بدهشةٍ كبيرة رسالةً منها على تطبيق “واتساب” في آذار/مارس الماضي تعلن فيها أنها “غادرت دبي للأبد”. وردّ أحد أصدقائها وهو الأمريكي كريس كولويل، الذي يمارس رياضة القفز بالمظلات، على رسالتها قائلًا: “يساورني شعور مزعج جدًا. هل هذا حقيقي؟”، وأضاف: “أين أنت؟”. فأجابت الأميرة: “أنا حرة. وسآتي لأراك قريبًا”. ثم أضافت رمزًا تعبيريًا بشكل قلب. ودام هروبها، الذي خططت له على مدى عدة سنوات بمساعدة مدربة كابويرا فنلندية ورجل يقول إنه جاسوس فرنسي سابق، أقل من أسبوع. وفي غضون بضعة أيام من الإبحار في المحيط الهندي على متن يخت الرجل الفرنسي، حيث كانت الشيخة متجهة إلى الهند ثم إلى الولايات المتحدة، انقطع الاتصال بها. ولم يرَها أحدٌ منذ ذلك الحين، باستثناء بعض الصور التي نشرتها عائلتها في كانون الأول/ديسمبر والتي تُفيد أنها تعيش بأمان في المنزل بعد نجاتها مما وصفته عائتلها بعملية اختطاف. ولكن بفضل الفيديو الذي صورته الشيخة قبل الهروب، شقّ وجهها وصوتها طريقهما إلى جميع أنحاء العالم، وجذب الفيديو أكثر من مليونَي مشاهدة على موقع “يوتيوب”، ما حفّز تغطيةً صحفيةً متعطشة وشوّه صورة دبي كعاصمة عالمية للبهرجة والتجارة مثل رسم غرافيتي على الجدار. وعلى غرار الشابات اللواتي هربن من نظامٍ تقييدي في السعودية، حرصت الشيخة لطيفة ألا ينسى أحد كم أنّ حريات النساء محدودة في مجتمعات الشرق الأوسط الأكثر محافظة، أو كم قد تكون كلفة تخطي حاكم دبي باهظة. ويمكن أن تتحول دبي بسرعةٍ، بما تتضمنه من مراكز تسوق ضخمة وأماكن فن الطبخ الراقي وناطحات السحاب المذهلة، من ساحةٍ دولية إلى دولة بوليسية قمعية. وقد لفتت انتباه عناوين الصحف في الغرب لاحتجازها الأجانب بسبب إمساكهم أيادي بعضهم في الأماكن العامة وشرب الكحول من دون ترخيص. وفي العام الماضي، أُدينت دبي على نطاقٍ واسع بسبب احتجازها الأكاديمي البريطاني ماثيو هيدجز، بعد اتهامه بأنه جاسوس بريطاني. كما قامت السلطات في السنوات الأخيرة بتشديد قمع المعارضة الداخلية. وقالت الباحثة في منظمة “هيومن رايتس ووتش” هبة زيادين: “لا يهم إذا كنت مواطنًا إماراتيًا عاديًا أو عضوًا من العائلة المالكة أو مغتربًا من بلد حليف مثل المملكة المتحدة، إن كنت تلحق الأذى بتلك الصورة المصممة بعناية فستواجه العواقب”. وصورت الشيخة لطيفة فيديو مدته 39 دقيقةً كاملة، تحدثت فيه بطلاقةٍ باللغة الإنكليزية وبصوتٍ هادئٍ وقوي عن حياتها ووصفتها بالمليئة بالامتيازات المقيدة والآمال المكبوحة. وأعربت عن أملها في أن يتغير ذلك إذا استطاعت الحصول على اللجوء السياسي في الولايات المتحدة. وقالت: “لا أعرف كيف سأشعر إذا استيقظت في الصباح وأنا أفكر أنه يمكنني أن أفعل ما أريده اليوم. سيكون شعورًا جديدًا ومختلفًا. سيكون الأمر رائعًا”. وخوفًا على حياتها إذا أُلقيَ القبض عليها، قالت إنها تسجل الفيديو في حال فشلت في الهروب. وأضافت: “لن يعيدوني حيةً. لن يحصل هذا. فإذا لم أنجُ حيةً، على الأقل هناك هذا الفيديو”. واجهت الشيخة لطيفة بادئ الأمر هذه القيود الصارمة بعد فشل محاولة شقيقتها الفرار قبل سنوات. فعندما كان عمرها 14 سنةً، هربت شقيقتها الكبرى شمسة من رجال أمن عائلتها في خلال رحلةٍ إلى إنكلترا، حيث يملك والدهما، الشيخ محمد بن راشد آل مكتوم، حاكم دبي ورئيس وزراء الإمارات العربية المتحدة، عقارًا كبيرًا وإسطبلًا بارزًا لسباق الأحصنة الأصيلة، “جودلفين”. وذكررت التقارير الإخبارية في ذلك الوقت أن الموظفين الإماراتيين تعقبوا شمسة في نهاية المطاف إلى شارعٍ في مدينة كامبردج وأجبروها على ركوب السيارة. وعندما بدأ محقق من مقر الشرطة البريطانية “سكوتلاند يارد” بالتحقيق في قضيتها كعملية خطف، رفض السلطات في دبي السماح له بإجراء مقابلةٍ معها. ووصلت القضية إلى طريقٍ مسدود عندها. وقالت الشيخة لطيفة إن شمسة، وهي الشقيقة الوحيدة المقربة منها من بين 30 أخًا وأختًا، قد خُدّرت منذ ذلك الحين. وأضافت: “إن ذلك يشبه المشي مع قفص يتبعها”. ارتعبت لطيفة من معاملة شمسة، وقالت إنها حاولت الهروب عبر الحدود إلى سلطنة عُمان. وتمت إعادتها على الفور تقريبًا، وقالت إنها احتجزت في الحبس الإنفرادي لأكثر من ثلاث سنوات. يسمح قانون العائلة الإماراتي بمعاقبة النساء في حال العصيان. وقالت إنها كثيرًا ما كانت تُسحب من الفراش لتُضرب. كما حُرمت من الرعاية الطبية ولم تُعطَ فرشاة أسنان حتى الأشهر القليلة الأخيرة. وحتى بعد إطلاق سراحها في سن التاسعة عشر، حددت قيود عائلتها حياتها بقدر ما حددتها ثروتها. وقالت السيدة الفنلندية تينا جاوياين، التي بدأت عام 2010 تدرب الشيخة لطيفة على الكابويرا، وهو فن قتالي أفريقي-برازيلي، إن الشيخة كانت تعيش في قصر خلف جدرانٍ عالية. ويتألف القصر من 40 غرفةً موزعة على أربعة أجنحةٍ وكل غرفة مخصصة لإمرأة من الأقارب كانت تعيش هناك. كان هناك حوالى 100 خادمةٍ ومجمع رياضي مع حوض سباحة ومنتجع. وأينما ذهبت الشيخة تتبعها خادمة فلبينية. ولكن حياة الشيخة كانت حياة رفاهية إجبارية ومقيدة. كان باستطاعتها إنفاق أموالها فقط على الهوايات والرياضات مثل ركوب الخيل والغوص تحت الماء أو على دعوة أصدقائها إلى الغذاء أو إلى جلسةٍ لتدريم الأظافر. وقال أصدقاؤها إنه لم يُسمح لها بدراسة الطب مثلما أرادت. كذلك لم يكن مسموح لها السفر، حتى إلى إمارة أبوظبي المجاورة وهي إحدى الدول-المدن السبع التي تشكل دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة. كانت الشيخة تلح على أصدقائها ليصفوا لها كل رحلة يقومون بها، وقالت ستيفانيا مارتينينغو، وهي صديقتها ومدربتها على القفز بالمظلات، “كأنها كانت تسافر معي”. كما مُنعت من زيارة أي أماكن غير عامة، حتى منازل أصدقائها. كانت من هواة القفز بالمظلات، فقزت ذات مرةٍ بالمظلة سرًا إلى جزء غير موافق عليه من المدينة لتمارس رياضة التجديف لمدة 20 دقيقةً مع السيد كولويل. وعندما كان يركب أصدقاؤها معها في سيارة “المرسيدس” السوداء التي تشبه الصندوق والتي غالبًا ما كانت تنقلها أينما ذهبت، كانت تضع سماعات الرأس وتجلس بصمتٍ، رافضةً أن تقول أي كلمة أمام السائق. شكلت رياضة القفز بالمظلات مصدرها الرئيسي للتسلية. قالت السيدة مارتينينغو، إنه عند القفر في السماء “تشعر أنك متساوٍ مع الجميع. لا تتحدث، تطير فقط. أعتقد أن الشيخة كانت تستمتع بالحرية في السماء”. وللوهلة الأولى، لم تكن الشيخة تبدو فاحشة الثراء أو حزينة جدًا. كانت تعرّف عن نفسها بـاسم لطيفة، فيظن الناس في الكثير من الأحيان أنها إمراة محلية. وتحت العباءة التي تغطي الجسم بكامله والتي كانت ترتديها في الأماكن العامة، كانت عادةً تلبس قميصًا قصير الأكمام وسروالًا رياضيًا. وكانت ترفض الظهور في معظم الصور. وكانت تسمع بدلًا من أن تتكلم. وقال أصدقاؤها إنها لم تشتكِ أبدًا من وضعها. لم تتحدث أبدًا عن عائلتها. في حين كان فاحشو الثراء في دبي يتباهون بحياتهم على موقع “إنستغرام”، بالكاد كان يمكن إيجادها على محرك البحث “غوغل”. كانت تحلم أن تتحكم بحياتها. تحدثت عن إنشاء فريقٍ إماراتي للقفز بالمظلات، على أمل أن يسمح لها والدها بالسفر للمشاركة في المنافسات الدولية. هي نباتية وأصبحت شغوفة بالصحة وإزالة السموم من الجسم، فخططت للاستثمار في مركزٍ لليوغا والعصير في أوروبا مع السيدة مارتينينغو. وعندما سألتها السيدة مارتينينغو كيف ستساعد في إدارة المركز من دون أن تسافر، أجابتها: “لدي شعور بأن الأمور قد تتغير”. لم يعرف أحد تقريبًا أنها كانت تخطط للهروب منذ عدة سنوات إلا في وقتٍ لاحق. تواصلت أولًا مع هيرفي جوبير، الذي يصفه موقعه الإلكتروني بأنه ضابط سابق في الاستخبارات الفرنسية و”ليس رجلًا عاديًا”، فقد تمكن من الهروب من دبي في قاربٍ مطاطي صغير متنكرًا بزي امرأة. ثم تواصلت مع السيدة جاوياين. في مرحلةٍ ما، تدربتا على الغوص والسباحة للوصول إلى سلطنة عُمان عبر سكوتر تحت الماء. قالت السيدة جاوياين إن الشيخة لطيفة كانت تريد مساعدة النساء الأخريات العالقات في أوضاعٍ مماثلة، وأرادت إخراج شمسة. وإذا لزم الأمر، فكرت أنه يمكنها أن تعمل كمدربة على القفز بالمظلات. وقالت للسيدة جاوياين: “أنا مستعدة أنا أُعدّ البرغر أو أن أفعل أي شيء طالما أنا حرة”. وقبل بضعة أيام من مغادرتهما، تسلّلتا من مركزٍ تجاري لتسجيل الفيديو في شقة السيدة جاوياين. وقالت: “أشعر بإيجابية حيال المستقبل. أشعر أنها بداية مغامرة. بداية تحكمي بحياتي وحريتي وحريتي في الاختيار”. وأضافت: “أنا أتطلع إلى ذلك”. وفي صباح يوم الهروب، أوصل السائق الشيخة لطيفة لتناول وجبة الفطور مع السيدة جاوياين في مطعم، مثلما كانت تفعل عادةً. ووفقًا للسيدة جاوياين، ركبتا سيارتها وتوجهتا إلى سلطنة عُمان حيث ركبتا في طوافةٍ قابلة للنفخ ثم دراجة مائية وصولًا إلى يخت السيد هيرفي جوبير. وفي صورة السيلفي التي التقطتاها في السيارة، تظهر الشيخة لطيفة مبتهجةً ومبتسمةً ابتسامةً عريضة وراء نظارات شمسية عاكسة. قالت جاوياين ممازحةً: “نحن مثل ثيلما ولويز”، مشيرةً إلى فيلم أمريكي من عام 1991. أجابت الشيخة لطيفة معترضةً: “لا تقولي ذلك. إن نهاية هذا الفيلم حزينة”. وبينما كانوا يبحرون نحو الهند في مساء يوم 4 آذار/مارس، كانت الفتاتان تتحضران للنوم في الطابق السفلي من اليخت عندما سمعتا أصواتًا مرتفعة. فحبستا نفسيهما في المرحاض، ولكنه امتلأ بالدخان. فكان الحل الوحيد الخروج منه. وعلى سطح اليخت، قام رجال مسلحون، وهم هنود وإماراتيون بحسب السيدة جاوياين، بدفع السيد جوبير والسيدة جاوياين وطاقم السفينة الفليبيني على الأرض وقيّدوهم وضربوهم. وقالوا للسيدة جاوياين أن تلفظ أنفاسها الأخيرة. ورأت السيدة جاوياين الشيخة لطيفة على الأرض مقيدةً، ولكنها تركل وتصرخ أنها تريد الحصول على اللجوء السياسي في الهند. وبعد وقتٍ قصير، صعد رجل يتحدث اللغة العربية على متن اليخت. وقالت السيدة جاوياين إنه أوضح أنه جاء ليعيد الشيخة. وتتذكر السيدة جاوياين ما قالته الشيخة: “أطلق علي النار هنا. لا تعيدني إلى هناك”. ثم اختفت. ولم يتطرق والدها الشيخ محمد إلى مكان وجودها حتى كانون الأول/ديسمبر، عندما كانت هيئة الإذاعة البريطانية “بي بي سي” على وشك أن تعرض وثائقيًا عن الموضوع. وأصدر مكتبه بيانًا أفاد فيه أن الشيخة بأمانٍ في دبي، وهي تحتفل بعيد ميلادها الثالث والثلاثين مع عائلتها “في جو من الخصوصية والسلام”. (قالت السيدة جاوياين أن الشيخة لم تختَر إمضاء عيد ميلادها مع عائلتها منذ سنوات). واتهم البيان السيد جوبير الذي وصفه بـ”المجرم المدان”، باختطاف الشيخة مقابل الحصول على فدية بقيمة 100 مليون دولار. ولم يردّ الشيخ محمد على طلب أُرسل إلى مكتبه لإجراء مقابلةٍ معه. ولم تردّ السفارة الإماراتية في واشنطن على طلبٍ للتعليق. أصبحت الأمور أكثر غرابةً منذ ذلك الحين. ففي ليلة عيد الميلاد، نشرت دبي الصور العامة الأولى للشيخة لطيفة منذ اختفائها. وظهرت في الصور تجلس مع ماري روبنسون، الرئيسة السابقة لإيرلندا ومفوض الأمم المتحدة السامي السابق لحقوق الإنسان، التي أكدت أنها التقت بالشيخة بناءً على طلب عائلتها. وقالت السيدة روبنسون إن الشيخة لطيفة بأمان مع عائلتها، لكنها تتلقى رعايةً نفسية، واصفةً إياها بـ”الشابة المضطربة” التي تعاني من “حالة صحية خطيرة”. وأضافت السيدة روبنسون: “هذه مسألة عائلية الآن”. وفوجئ المدافعون عن الشيخة بأن مدافِعة محترمة عن حقوق الإنسان قد تبنت على ما يبدو الرواية الرسمية لدبي. واستبعدوا أن يكون لدى الشيخة مرضًا نفسيًا، باستثناء أي حالة مرضية قد تكون أصيبت بها بسبب السجن أو التخدير. قالت السيدة مارتينينغو: “أنا متأكدة 100% أنها لا تحتاج إلى رعايةٍ نفسية. ربما الآن بعد كل ما تعرضت إليه، ولكن ليس قبل ذلك. كيف يمكنك أن تعتقد أن شخصًا سُجن لمدة تسعة أشهرٍ لا يبدو مضطربًا؟”. وأقلق أصدقاء الشيخة لطيفة ظهورها في الصور مشوشة قليلًا وعيناها تتفاديان الكاميرا. ومع تزايد الاهتمام الناقد لللسيدة روبنسون، أصدرت بيانًا قالت فيه إنها أجرت تقييمها “بحسن نية وبقدر استطاعتي”، مضيفةً أن الشيخة “بدت ضعيفةً بوضوح”. وبحلول منتصف شهر كانون الثاني/يناير، ترك محامٍ كان يعمل مع نشطاء قضية الشيخة من دون تفسير. كما قال الكثير من أصدقائها الذين لا يزالون في دبي إنهم خائفون للغاية من التحدث، في حين توقف السيد جوبير فجأةً عن الرد على طلبات لإجراء مقابلة معه في هذا المقال. ولم يكن يساور الشيخة لطيفة شكًا كبيرًا إزاء ما سيحل بها. فقالت في الفيديو: “إذا كنتم تشاهدون هذا الفيديو فهذا أمر غير جيد. إما أنا ميتة أو في وضعٍ سيء جداً جداً جداً”.,The New York Times
2019,‘60 Minutes’ Veteran Is Named the Show’s New Boss,"There’s a new boss at “60 Minutes.” The signature newsmagazine, which has held down a Sunday night slot for CBS since 1968, named Bill Owens as its executive producer. Mr. Owens served as the longtime No. 2 to Jeff Fager, who ran the program from 2004 until he was fired in September after having sent a threatening text message to a CBS reporter who was asking about allegations of harassment against him for a segment that ran on “CBS Evening News.” Since Mr. Fager’s ouster, Mr. Owens has been the interim executive producer of “60 Minutes.” In its announcement, CBS said Mr. Owens would report directly to Susan Zirinsky, the incoming president and senior executive producer of CBS News. That was a telling inclusion. Outside lawyers who conducted a monthslong investigation of sexual harassment at the network last year reported that the separation of the “60 Minutes” staff from the rest of the news division meant that the show was unable to prevent inappropriate conduct by some of its top executives. The investigation started in August with the purpose of examining allegations involving Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of the CBS Corporation, as well as the workplace environment at CBS News and “cultural issues at all levels of CBS.” Mr. Moonves was ousted in September, and the company’s board determined that he had been fired for cause after the investigators’ report was filed in December. Another prominent CBS employee, Charlie Rose, a co-anchor of “CBS This Morning” and a correspondent on “60 Minutes,” was fired in 2017 after multiple accusations of sexual harassment were made against him. (Mr. Moonves and Mr. Rose have denied the allegations against them.) In a statement, Ms. Zirinsky praised Mr. Owens, a popular figure among the “60 Minutes” rank and file who got his first experience at CBS as a summer intern in 1988. “Bill Owens is steeped in the storytelling style audiences have come to expect from ‘60 Minutes,’” Ms. Zirinsky said. “We are fortunate to be able to put such a talented veteran in charge of this iconic program.” Mr. Owens joined “60 Minutes” in 2003, working with the correspondent Scott Pelley to cover Hurricane Katrina and the genocide in Sudan. After a stint at “CBS Evening News,” he rejoined the newsmagazine in 2007 as a senior broadcast producer. In 2008 he was named executive editor. “To be named the executive producer of ‘60 Minutes’ is an inspiring responsibility and a privilege,” Mr. Owens said in a news release. “I am honored to work alongside the best journalists in the business who cover the most important stories from around the world. I promise that will never change.” Mr. Owens is the third executive producer of the newsmagazine in its more than 50-year history. The show has maintained high ratings throughout its time on the air, and remains among the top 10 most-viewed television programs. Its founder was Don Hewitt, a journalistic legend who led the show for 36 years. But, as The New York Times reported in December, investigators who examined the corporate culture at the network revealed that CBS continued to pay a settlement to a woman who claimed that he had sexually assaulted her on repeated occasions and destroyed her career. The settlement, reached in the 1990s, was amended multiple times, including last year. In total, CBS agreed to pay the former employee more than $5 million. Ms. Zirinsky, the first woman to lead CBS News, met with “60 Minutes” employees to tell them of the appointment of Mr. Owens on Wednesday afternoon. Shortly afterward, she sent an email to the staff that said, in part, “We are in a new era. As an organization, and as an industry, we are forever changed.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘A Light for Me in the Darkness’: For Migrant Detainees, a Bond Forged by Letter","Achiri Nelson Geh, a young activist deeply involved in the independence movement in southern Cameroon, knew he had to flee: Police officers had killed his brother, and they were looking for him. Making his way by plane, boat, bus and foot to Mexico, he surrendered to United States authorities at the border in the hope of winning asylum. But his new life wasn’t what he expected. He has spent the 21 months since then inside three federal immigration detention centers, imprisoned until he can collect $50,000 for a bond, while his asylum case winds through the appeals court. One day this past summer, though, a lifeline arrived: Not $50,000, but a letter from Anne-Marie Debbané, a professor of geography at San Diego State University, near the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he was housed for the first 20 months. “I am terribly sorry for what you are going through both in Cameroon and here,” she wrote. “I applaud you for your bravery, courage and determination in standing up for justice and freedom.” Mr. Geh, now 29, was elated to hear from someone, even someone he had never met. “Thank you for your letters,” he wrote. “It gives me courage.” Here began an old-fashioned correspondence that bloomed into a friendship, part of an unusual epistolary campaign initiated by San Diego State professors and others in suburban San Diego. Last week, the university library made public the digital archive of hundreds of letters from detainees, throwing open a window into the fragile lives of migrants from more than 20 countries living, some of them for years, inside a nondescript private prison. The debate over how to receive immigrants in a country that both depends on their labor and criminalizes them as intruders has emerged as the signature flash point of the Trump administration, which has swept a growing number of undocumented immigrants like Mr. Geh into detention at places like Otay Mesa and vowed to secure the border against future illegal crossings. But as Washington battles over the president’s plan for a border wall and how to handle an influx of new migrant families arriving from Central America, the letters exchanged in San Diego have made an international political drama intensely personal. “In the U.S. our tendency is to really dehumanize migrants,” said Kate Swanson, another geography professor at San Diego State. “We put them in these concrete boxes. This helps them become visible.” Detainees began writing letters, many using stubby golf pencils purchased for 6 cents from the commissary. They pleaded for help while telling their stories of rape, murder and torture in their home countries, and of separation from their children at the border. Volunteers responded with shock and empathy, sending Christmas cards, poems, pictures and updates about their own families. They also sent small amounts of money to the detainees’ accounts for purchases of such things as extra food and drinks, toothbrushes and sneakers. For those awaiting imminent deportation, “all we could offer was commissary and moral support in the meantime — like the cup of coffee on the deck of a big ship that’s going to sink,” said Joanna Brooks, an associate vice president at the university who initiated the campaign, which has grown to 200 volunteers. Otay Mesa, operated by a private prison corporation under a contract with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, opened in its current building southeast of San Diego in 2015. Of the 930 immigrants in ICE custody as of this week, 796 are men. But fewer than half of the detainees have criminal convictions, according to the latest records kept by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse of Syracuse University. Most are simply awaiting the outcome of deportation or asylum proceedings. Of those with criminal records, drunken driving and illegal entry into the country are the most common offenses, the analysis shows. “We are not who President Trump thinks we are,” wrote Luis, a 19-year-old gay man from El Salvador. “What I want is to create conscience of who we are as migrants. We are not a danger to society.” The letters, written in halting English and flowing Spanish, told stories of how people had wound up in a place so far from home. Mostly, they expressed longing to know that someone knew they were there. “Whenever you reply my letters, it is a light for me in the darkness,” said an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who goes by the initial K in the archive. “It is true it makes me cry because your letter showed care and love as a human.” As much as the communication has helped ease the loneliness for the detainees, it has deeply affected the lives of the letter writers as well. For Professor Debbané, whose academic specialty is post-apartheid South Africa, the letters to Mr. Geh led to in-person visits and prison calls; they talked about colonialism in Africa, and shared books and articles. “We are there for one another, and I believe that we appeared in each other’s lives at just the right moment,” she said of Mr. Geh, who was taken out of Otay Mesa by ICE on his 29th birthday and is now at a detention center in Alabama. “I have all of her letters with me,” he said in an interview. “I read them every day.” The letter-writing project began when the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer. Professor Brooks gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house; together, they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at Otay Mesa who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in Tijuana. The volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees’ responses. When the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back July 11, Jennifer Gonzalez, a lawyer in the group, said: “We were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories. I had this intense sense that each one of those letters didn’t just represent a real person, but they represented a family who missed this person, their community, down to their ancestors.” Within six weeks, the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts. The group estimates it has spent more than $10,000 since July. “There are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary,” wrote Ulises, who came to the United States to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in Honduras. “We are people from different countries, India, China, Pakistan, Cuba, Jamaica, Vietnam, etc. There are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we don’t speak the same language, but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other.” Terrie Vorono, a volunteer in the group, thanked him for his letter and offered a connection: As the mother of a gay son, she is an advocate for gay rights. “We know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in the United States,” she wrote to him. The letter writers have not found universal support. Rosanna Benink, who has hosted volunteers at her house every Monday, said one of her friends wondered why she bothered. “She said to me, ‘Well, they shouldn’t be here in the first place, so what did they expect?’” Ms. Benink said. She said she tried to explain that these were “true asylum seekers,” but ran into more apathy. “You get that reaction and it blows me away,” she said. The volunteers asked the detainees to describe their living conditions at the prison, and the letters revealed common complaints: spoiled food, itchy soap, harsh treatment, lack of access to legal counsel. An advocacy group formed by the letter writers, Detainee Allies, published a separate report based on the findings from the letters. “Things here become more and more unbearable,” a 50-year-old woman from Guatemala wrote on Dec. 3. “They make the temperature intensely cold, our bones hurt. The meal schedule is irregular and the food is not healthy. An officer said that it was food for dogs.” The detainee named Luis, who had come via the migrant caravan and has since been granted asylum, wrote that for personal hygiene, “we are only given soap and shampoo, but the soap and shampoo they give us makes us itch.” To avoid it, he said, detainees must buy a better brand from the commissary. Amanda Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for CoreCivic, the company that operates Otay Mesa, said officials at the detention center had been responsive to the needs of detainees, correcting problems when they came to light. She said facility managers monitored the temperatures and the food. “Meals in CoreCivic facilities meet or exceed nutritional standards, which are set by our government partners,” she said. As the months have passed, some of the detainees have left — either winning the right to live in the United States or, more often, sent back to their home countries. Professor Swanson has found herself thinking often about one of the men she wrote to Juan, who had come to the United States to avoid death threats from MS-13 gang members in Honduras. She had written to him about her son and husband, and sent Honduran soccer scores. But he was deported after three months, and the letters stopped. Professor Swanson said she was sure he was dead. But it wasn’t so. Reached in Honduras last week, Juan said he was safe and planning to leave again for Mexico to find work; he wouldn’t try to return to the United States, but he did have one lasting memory from the experience: Professor Swanson’s letters. “I felt like I had family,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘A Match Into a Can of Gasoline’: Measles Outbreak Now an Emergency in Washington State,"SEATTLE — Measles, declared eliminated as a major public health threat in the United States almost 20 years ago, has re-emerged this winter in the Pacific Northwest and other states where parents have relatively broad leeway over whether to vaccinate their children. Seventy-nine cases of measles have been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the start of this year. Fifty cases of the highly contagious disease were in Washington State. An outbreak of measles has also occurred in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, where 64 confirmed cases of measles were reported, mostly late last year. That outbreak began, the C.D.C. said, when a child who had not had a measles vaccination caught the virus on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease was occurring. But no place has been hit harder since January than Clark County, Wash., a fast-growing corner of the metropolitan area near Portland, Ore. Clark County health officials declared a medical emergency last month, and say they have seen 49 cases — most of them in children under the age of 10. Clark County has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Washington State. About 78 percent of the kindergarten through high school population is vaccinated, according to state figures. Along with other cities mainly in the West — including Seattle, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Houston — Portland is considered a hot spot for families that opt not to vaccinate for medical, philosophical or religious reasons. For measles, epidemiologists generally consider the threshold for preventing public measles outbreaks to be a vaccination rate of 93 percent or higher. “If you have a population that is unvaccinated, it’s like throwing a match into a can of gasoline,” said Dr. Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director. “Measles is exquisitely contagious and immunization rates have been dropping.” Measles can cause permanent neurological damage, deafness and in relatively rare cases, death. All states allow parents to exempt children from vaccination for medical reasons, and most also allow for a religious exemption, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But 17 states, including Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Texas, have gone further, allowing parents to keep their children from being vaccinated for unspecified personal or philosophical reasons. Some may be connected to a broader anti-vaccination movement, including concerns that vaccines lead to autism, an idea that has been widely debunked. “I’m very worried that these measles epidemics are becoming a new normal,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He said that misinformation had been spread about vaccines, and that state lawmakers in some cases have allowed those claims to drive their decisions about legislation. “The enablers are state legislators in those states, that have allowed themselves to be played,” he said. Dr. Melnick, the Clark County official, said he had heard recently from doctors that parents have been showing up in greater numbers seeking vaccinations since the outbreak emerged. A plan is also underway, he said, for a mass clinic to give free shots. “We’ve already had a child hospitalized; I hope it doesn’t take a death or a real serious complication like encephalitis for people to change their minds,” about vaccination, he said. In 2018, 17 measles outbreaks were reported, mostly in pockets around the nation. In 2017, 75 cases were reported in Minnesota, in a Somali-American community with low vaccination coverage. In 2015, 147 cases across multiple states were tied to an amusement park in California, which an infected person was said to have visited, according to the C.D.C. In Washington State’s Legislature, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to reverse the state’s rule allowing philosophical or personal exemptions to vaccination. A bill, filed in the midst of the measles outbreak, has yet to be voted on.",The New York Times
2019,‘A Stain on the City’: 63 People’s Convictions Tossed in Chicago Police Scandal,"In 2012, a Chicago police sergeant and an officer were arrested in an undercover operation for stealing $5,200 from a person carrying what they thought was cash for drug dealers. The officers eventually entered plea deals, but the arrests led to scrutiny of the tactics they and their team had used while making drug arrests at the Ida B. Wells housing complex on Chicago’s South Side for years. This week, 14 men with drug convictions related to those cases were exonerated — four of them on Wednesday and 10 on Monday. With those exonerations, 63 men and women have had their cases vacated because of the involvement of Sgt. Ronald Watts and Officer Kallatt Mohammed, lawyers for the 14 men said. “It is a stain on the city,” said Joshua Tepfer, a lawyer with the University of Chicago Law School’s Exoneration Project, which has represented 47 of the 63 people exonerated. “One thing that goes without saying is the reason they were covered up is they were viewed as a disposable people who live in the housing projects,” he said. “Nobody cared. Nobody believed them.” Robert Foley, a spokesman for the Cook County state’s attorney, said on Tuesday in an email that the State’s Attorney’s Office would continue to review the matters on a case-by-case basis. The arrests of Sergeant Watts and Officer Mohammed came after F.B.I. and Chicago Police Department investigators recruited an informant to tell the two law enforcement officers that the informant was carrying the $5,200 for a drug trafficker, a statement from the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois said at the time of their arrest in 2012. The two officers took the money, and then paid the informant $400 “for allowing them to steal the drug proceeds” in 2011, the statement said. “Who always takes care of you?” Sergeant Watts told the informant, according to the statement. After their arrests, Sergeant Watts and Officer Mohammed were charged with theft of government funds. Officer Mohammed entered a plea agreement in 2012 and was sentenced to 18 months, and Sergeant Watts pleaded guilty in 2013 and was sentenced to 22 months, according to Joseph Fitzpatrick, an assistant United States attorney for the Northern District. A lawyer for former Sergeant Watts and representatives for the Civilian Office of Police Accountability were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday; the Chicago Police Department and a lawyer for former Officer Mohammed declined to comment. But people who had been arrested by Sergeant Watts and Officer Mohammed took note. They petitioned to vacate the convictions that had resulted from Sergeant Watts and his team’s arrests years before. “A lot of those convictions then fell by the wayside,” said James A. Graham, a lawyer who represented Officer Mohammed at the time he took the plea deal. The Exoneration Project and another Chicago-area lawyer, Joel Flaxman, worked to vet cases of convicted men and women who said they were innocent of the charges imposed on them by members of the team led by Sergeant Watts and who had filed misconduct complaints against the officers. Once vetted, their cases are turned over to Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. In November 2017, the State’s Attorney’s Office said it filed the first of its motions to vacate the convictions of people based on concerns regarding allegations of misconduct of the arresting officers, including Sergeant Watts. In subsequent statements on exonerations, Kimberly M. Foxx, the state’s attorney, linked additional exonerations to “the misconduct” of the officers. “We found a pattern of misconduct by Watts and other officers in these cases, which caused our office to lose confidence in the initial arrests and validity of these convictions,” Ms. Foxx said last year. “May the defendants, who we now believe were victims, find a path forward in healing and justice.” Leonard Gipson, whose convictions were among the first vacated in 2017, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had spent time incarcerated in 2003 and in 2007 after being charged with delivering crack and heroin. “The biggest impact was it took a lot of time away from my kids growing up,” he said, speaking of his children, who are now 18 and 16. “I missed out on so much time in their life. And I don’t think it is really possible to make up that time.” On Monday and Wednesday, Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. of Cook County, during a hearing in Chicago, granted further motions and vacated the convictions of the 10 men. Two of the four were in court on Wednesday, said Mr. Flaxman, who represented the four in court. “The floodgates opened of people coming out of the woodwork and saying, ‘Hey, it happened to us,’” Mr. Flaxman said. It is not clear how many more convictions will be challenged. Some people sought exonerations after their sentences had been served, while others are still in prison, Mr. Tepfer said. About 15 police officers who had worked on Sergeant Watts’s team were put on desk duty, but the Chicago Police Department declined to comment on Wednesday. “There is a ton to unpack,” he said. “We are going to be doing this for years.”",The New York Times
2019,‘A Tuba to Cuba’ Review: A New Orleans Jazz Band Makes a Caribbean Connection,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. High on music and hot with the thrill of discovery, “A Tuba to Cuba” swarms with shiny happy people. Directed by T.G. Herrington and Danny Clinch, this joyous, wide-ranging account of a New Orleans jazz band’s 2015 visit to Cuba is crammed with fascinating facts and toe-tickling tunes. Its myriad voices, humble despite their extreme musical gifts, guide a journey to forge new connections and untangle the music’s Afro-Caribbean roots. Everyone has a story to tell, a tradition to illuminate or a musical style to lay claim to, and the filmmakers weave these diverse threads into a colorful blanket of sights, sounds and spirituality. A mini urban opera emerges from the percussive rhythms of street life, and complex beats spring from the simple slap of a hand on a wooden seat. The movie exudes such an abundance of pleasure, talent and fellowship that we barely notice the poverty that backgrounds many of its scenes. Instead, it seems more logical to ponder why a neighborhood with its own conga organization isn’t on top of everyone’s house-hunting list. Intimate and easy, Ben Jaffe’s narration grounds the film’s ambitions in his parents’ 1961 founding of the historic New Orleans jazz venue Preservation Hall, whose name his band bears. Serene beneath a riot of ginger ringlets, Jaffe is an evangelist for the music’s ability to bridge colors and cultures. (His parents fostered the hall’s success at a time when it was still illegal for blacks and whites to socialize together.) Politics are never mentioned, but, in these depressingly divisive times, any movie this devoted to inclusiveness is well worth seeking out.

2019,"‘A Woman, Just Not That Woman’: How Sexism Plays Out on the Trail","In the words of her detractors during the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton was abrasive and shrill. She was aloof. She was unlikable. It’s not a coincidence that some of these adjectives are now bubbling up in discussions of Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as they campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Few Americans acknowledge they would hesitate to vote for a woman for president — but they don’t have to, according to researchers and experts on politics and women and extensive research on double standards in campaigns. Reluctance to support female candidates is apparent in the language that voters frequently use to describe men and women running for office; in the qualities that voters say they seek; and in the perceived flaws that voters say they are willing or unwilling to overlook in candidates. [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] The influence and impact of these stereotypes and double standards are about to play out in uncharted territory: a presidential race featuring six women running for the Democratic nomination, all vying to compete against President Trump, who has a history of making sexist comments. “For 20 years, we’ve heard participants in our focus groups say they would vote for a woman, just not that woman,” said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in politics. “That promise will be put to the test in some cases, because folks may not be able to hide their bias behind that excuse when there’s multiple women on the debate stage.” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is the latest woman to join the 2020 field, kicking off her campaign on Sunday. In the run-up to her announcement, she faced headlines about her well-known reputation in the Senate as a difficult boss. Whether she is held to a different standard than men remains to be seen: Male politicians pressure and berate staff members too, and, like Ms. Klobuchar’s Senate office, President Trump has had high employee turnover. How much sexism ultimately influences votes is a matter of debate. In general elections, partisanship beats everything else, said Kathleen Dolan, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, whose research shows that most voters stick with their party’s candidate regardless of gender. But there has been little comparable research on primaries, where partisanship isn’t in the equation. And the Democrats will have a wide-open presidential primary in 2020 with multiple leading female candidates. What is not a matter of debate is the array of ways that sexism can manifest on the campaign trail, affecting not only how voters perceive candidates but how candidates present themselves to voters. The very first question of Ms. Gillibrand’s campaign was about her likability. “A lot of people see you as pretty likable,” a reporter told her. Did she consider that a “selling point”? Ms. Warren’s evaluation arrived with similar speed, in a Politico article that asked how she could “avoid a Clinton redux — written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground.” One of the most amorphous qualities candidates are judged on, likability is also deeply influenced by gender bias, researchers say. Voters look for it in men, too — consider the “who would you rather have a beer with” question in campaigns — but only in women, research shows, do they consider it nonnegotiable. “We know that voters will not support a woman that they do not like, even if they believe that she is qualified,” Ms. Hunter said. “But they will vote for a man that they do not like if they believe he is qualified.” In 2016, for instance, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump had poor favorability ratings; among voters who said they viewed both candidates negatively, Mr. Trump won by roughly 20 percentage points. Women also tend to be viewed as unlikable based on their ambition. Harvard researchers found in 2010 that voters regarded “power-seeking” women with contempt and anger, but saw power-seeking men as stronger and more competent. There is often some implication of unscrupulousness in descriptions of female candidates as “ambitious” — an adjective that could apply to any person running for president but is rarely used to disparage men. Within 24 hours of Ms. Harris’s campaign kickoff, some critics were bringing up her onetime relationship with a powerful California politician, Willie Brown — a common tactic faced by women that sexualizes them and reduces their successes to a relationship with a man. And if a narrative of unlikability takes hold, it can influence voters without their even realizing it. “I actually heard so often that people didn’t like her and she was unlikable that I started to think, ‘I don’t know if I really like her so much,’” Heather Pasqualino Weirich, a Democrat from Phoenixville, Pa., said of Mrs. Clinton, whom she later supported. “I realized I had no reason why I didn’t like her.” The qualities voters tend to expect from politicians — like strength, toughness and valor — are popularly associated with masculinity. This often means that from the moment a man steps onto the campaign trail, he benefits from a basic assumption that he is qualified to run, while a woman “has to work twice as hard to show that she’s qualified,” Ms. Hunter said. “People just start off assuming that you care about the soft issues, you care about hearth and home, and that you can’t know anything about finance or military,” said former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. For many years, female candidates tried to adopt the characteristics voters wanted to see — to act, stereotypically speaking, like men. This worked for some but also brought pitfalls. For one thing, it did not challenge the premise that masculinity is better suited for leadership. It also opened women up to a familiar double standard: A man who speaks authoritatively might be confident or opinionated, while a woman who does the same is arrogant or lecturing. Most pressingly, it created a backlash among some voters who saw women acting “like men” and deemed them inauthentic. Nichole M. Bauer, an assistant professor of political communication at Louisiana State University, found that when women played up stereotypically masculine qualities, voters — regardless of party — rated them better in terms of leadership ability, but voters in the opposing party rated them significantly lower in terms of likability. There was no similar backlash to male candidates who defied gender stereotypes. Dr. Bauer said that in all her research, she had found no way for women to win the support of voters in the opposing party. It’s a basic psychological phenomenon, she said: If a Republican starts out disliking a Democratic woman, or vice versa, “they’ll use gender stereotypes about women to maintain that perceived negative relationship” no matter what the woman does. Perhaps the most obvious way female candidates are judged differently is on their appearance: not only how “attractive” they are and how they dress, researchers say, but also their facial expressions, their body language and their voice. Accused in 2015 of “shouting” about gun violence, Mrs. Clinton responded: “First of all, I’m not shouting. It’s just when women talk, some people think we’re shouting.” Women are conscious that small elements of how they present themselves are subject to scrutiny. Representative Madeleine Dean — one of four Democratic women elected to the House last year from Pennsylvania, whose congressional delegation was previously all-male — said an aide would stand in the back of the room during her campaign events, holding up a cardboard sign with a smiley face to remind her to shift the serious expression she naturally wore while listening to voters. She was also coached, “though I did not take his coaching, not to cross my arms in front of myself because then you look mad,” Ms. Dean said. These sorts of criticisms were common in the 2016 campaign, not only against Mrs. Clinton but also against Carly Fiorina, who ran in the Republican primary. “Look at that face,” Mr. Trump said at one point, openly mocking Ms. Fiorina’s appearance. “Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?” (Mr. Trump subsequently claimed he had been talking about her persona. Ms. Fiorina, who did not respond to interview requests for this article, said at the time, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.”) Because these judgments are so superficial, and their gendered nature so obvious, they draw substantial backlash. But that doesn’t mean they stop. “The women who run are still going to be, I think, more scrutinized about their appearance,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “I would love to think that they won’t get the kind of comments that Hillary Clinton got about, ‘Why is she yelling at me?’ ‘Why doesn’t she smile more?’ I’d love to think that that’s all gone now, but I don’t believe that to be true.” History influences what voters see as normal. And for 230 years in the United States, presidential leadership has been male. For many decades, this was a self-sustaining cycle: Female candidates were outside the norm, so they didn’t win, so they remained outside the norm. But the history of women’s representation at other levels of government shows that the norm can shift. “When we take a look at states that have had female governors, when voters see women succeed in executive office, it opens the door for more women in that role because it does literally change the face of leadership,” Ms. Hunter, of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, said. Precisely because women running for president have lacked models for how to do it, what they are left with, Ms. Walsh said, is “very prescribed: ‘Wear a little suit, talk about your résumé but don’t talk about your personal life, don’t talk about your kids because then people are going to ask who’s taking care of your kids.’” In 2018, of course, many female candidates ran unabashedly as themselves, bucking the public images and political messages that women traditionally adhered to in campaigns. Some of them appeared with their young children; others proudly showed off their tattoos; and many talked in personal terms about discrimination and harassment as well as a range of policy issues. The presence of six women in the 2020 race, Ms. Walsh argued, is “going to give women who run for office at every level more leeway, and a path to navigate that may be not quite so narrow.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Aim, I Say, at the City of Washington!’ Russia Revives Cold War Playbook","MOSCOW — Even given the rotten state of diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States, having a famous St. Petersburg cathedral choir sing a ballad to nuking America might seem like an odd choice. That weekend performance on Defending the Fatherland Day was just one element in a series of references to nuclear attacks that made it appear on Tuesday that Moscow was dusting off its old MAD playbook — Cold War shorthand for Mutual Assured Destruction. The new assertiveness about the Kremlin’s nuclear capacities seems to be related to President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned the placement of such weapons in Europe. The widely circulated concert video coincided with a broadcast news report by Dmitri Kiselyev, the Kremlin’s top propagandist, during prime time on Sunday night, detailing what mainland targets Russia would put in its nuclear sights should the United States deploy new missiles in Europe. “For now, we’re not threatening anyone, but if such a deployment takes place, our response will be instant,” Mr. Kiselyev said on the program, “Vesti Nedeli,” against a diagram showing Russian submarines skulking into position off the east and west coasts of the United States. If the segment evoked memories of the Cuban missile crisis, it seemed that Mr. Kiselyev might literally have been working from a memo drawn up in a bygone era. Two American military bases he mentioned among the five targets — Fort Ritchie and Fort McClellan — closed many years ago. President Vladimir V. Putin got the whole thing started with his state of the nation speech last week, when he said that should the United States deploy new missiles in Europe, Russia could respond with a whole quiver of high-tech weapons. “Russia will be forced to create and deploy weapons that can be used not only in the areas we are directly threatened from, but also in areas that contain decision-making centers for the missile systems threatening us,” he said. He was a little coy about specifying the decision-making centers. After the speech, however, Mr. Putin hosted a background briefing with news media editors, in which, according to Russian reports, the president said that if the United States moved missiles into Poland, Russia would deploy submarines off American shores. Mr. Kiselyev, already famous for saying some years ago that Russia could reduce the United States to “nuclear dust,” ran with that threat. Some Putin supporters applauded the sentiment. On a talk show immediately following the news program, one commentator said there was no need to rely on weapons like tanks since the response would be nuclear. Critics, however, were scathing, suggesting that Russia was saber rattling from a position of weakness. Just moments before, the same news program reported that some 200,000 Russian children attend schools with only outhouses for toilets, one commentator noted on Twitter, asking what exactly was worth defending with nuclear-tipped missiles. Another commentator wondered how Russians would react if CNN broadcast a program detailing American plans to strike Moscow and St. Petersburg with nuclear weapons. In the ensuing outcry, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, echoed his boss’s coyness by noting that the president himself had not singled out any target by name. Over all, several factors motivated the belligerent rhetoric, analysts said, in addition to the United States’ withdrawal from the I.N.F. Treaty. Threatening Washington, they noted, was an old method of improving relations. Just as new rules for interaction were forged out of the Cuban missile crisis, so too could a renewed sense of threat help entente, which has not worked out as swimmingly as the Kremlin envisaged under President Trump. “They still want to be on equal footing with the United States — that is why they want to create this crisis,” said Ivan I. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg who specializes in Russian-American relations. Submarines off the American coast “will keep Russia important for the United States, and that is important to the Russian leadership.” Then there is the domestic impact, where a high threat level can generate a certain amount of support for the Kremlin and its measures to quash civil liberties, analysts said. In other words, if you are going to label your critics “foreign agents,” you need to identify the enemy for whom they slave. Which brings us back to the atomic song in the cathedral on Feb. 23. In commemoration of Defenders of the Fatherland Day — informally known as Man’s Day, speaking of throwbacks — a choir singing at St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg performed a rendition of a circa-1980 song, “On a Submarine, or a Serviceman’s Pay.” The gist of the song, considered caustic at the time it was written, was that in exchange for three rubles any Russian submariner would be happy to annihilate the United States. The opening stanza goes: On a submarine with an atomic motor And with a dozen bombs of a hundred megatons Crossed the Atlantic and I call on the gunner: “Aim, I say, at the city of Washington!” The social media chorus responded with accusations of poor taste, at best, and thinly veiled hostility, at worst. If protesters with Pussy Riot were jailed for years over a protest song they performed in a Moscow cathedral, where were all the believers who should have been equally offended by a song endorsing Armageddon, mused one critic on social media. The St. Petersburg Concert Choir issued a statement saying that its critics could not take a joke. The choir did not need to limit itself to liturgical works, the statement said, or to rewrite lyrics for political correctness. Given the climate, however, analysts suggested it was a poor choice, particularly since there was nothing light about the booming rendition. “It was a joke, but a bad joke exactly because of the current propaganda,” said Mr. Kurilla, the historian.",The New York Times
2019,‘Alita: Battle Angel’ Leads a Weak Box Office,"How do you judge the performance of a very expensive cyborg? On one hand, Fox’s “Alita: Battle Angel,” an effects-laden, dystopian, sci-fi action movie with a bionic heroine, easily topped this weekend’s domestic box office. It exceeded most analysts’ expectations by bringing in about $27.8 million in the lead-up to Presidents’ Day. On the other hand, that amount is modest next to the roughly $170 million it took make the movie, produced in part by James Cameron and based on a manga series by Yukito Kishiro. A digitally augmented Rosa Salazar leads a cast that also includes Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali. While it was Robert Rodriguez — best known for the “Sin City” and the “Spy Kids” movies — who directed the film, Cameron’s name has been used heavily in the movie’s marketing, echoing the way Peter Jackson’s was employed to push another expensive sci-fi movie, “Mortal Engines,” in December. (Jackson was a writer and producer of that film, but it was directed by Christian Rivers.) “Mortal Engines” was one of the biggest flops of 2018, opening to about $7.5 million domestically against a budget of around $100 million. Fox had initially planned to release “Alita: Battle Angel” in December, when it would have gone up against a tangle of holiday crowd-pleasers. The studio’s decision to push the release to February seems to have helped Cameron to avoid, at least, a “Mortal Engines”-like disaster. [Read our critic’s review of “Alita: Battle Angel.”] Second place at the box office was Warner Bros.’s “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.” This sequel about toy-brick people, voiced by Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks, brought in about $21.2 million during its second weekend in theaters according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. (If there’s a lesson to take from the top two movies, it’s that audiences gravitate toward the not-quite-human.) Warner Bros. also took third place with “Isn’t it Romantic,” a comedy that opened about $14.2 million in ticket sales this weekend. The movie, both a romantic comedy and a commentary on romantic comedies, stars Rebel Wilson and Liam Hemsworth. Meta commentary is also at play in the other newcomer to crack the top five, Universal’s “Happy Death Day 2U,” which made around $9.8 million in its first weekend, landing in fifth place. It is a self-parodying sequel to the 2017 slasher “Happy Death Day.” Overall, this weekend failed to invigorate what has so far been a lackluster year at the box office. That Presidents’ Day weekend of last year saw the release of the record-shattering “Black Panther” only adds urgency to the question of when things will pick up.",The New York Times
2019,‘Alita: Battle Angel’ Review: Do Female Cyborgs Dream of Breasts?,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At one point in “Alita: Battle Angel” — another dystopian fantasy that reminds you of just how visionary the original “Blade Runner” was — the cyborg heroine gets a new body. It’s a streamlined shoulder-to-foot job, one that makes her look like a sex doll with a chrome-plated musculoskeletal system. Her new physique turns out to be an innovative weapon and comes with articulated parts, a wasp waist and what looks like a discreet chastity panel for the groin. It also has larger breasts than the old model, a change that in a snort-out-loud line is pinned on Alita’s own ideas about how she should look. If only someone here were joking or had an idea about the construction of femininity. Why does Alita (Rosa Salazar), who has a human brain, even have breasts? Why does any cyborg that isn’t a sex bot or a wet nurse? Genre convention only partly explains the onscreen look of this character, originally created by Yukito Kishiro in his manga series. Kishiro sexes up his cyborg, an amnesiac who in the first comic retains one protuberant breast when the rest of her body is destroyed. This brings to mind Jessica Rabbit, the bodacious femme fatale in “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” who purrs “I’m just drawn that way” — yeah, but by whom, for whom and why? “Alita” is the latest from James Cameron, though he takes only some of the blame. He helped produce the movie and shares script credit with Laeta Kalogridis (they collaborated on “Avatar”); he was going to direct it himself but handed it off to Robert Rodriguez (“Sin City”). The presence of other “Avatar” veterans — the senior visual effects supervisor, animation supervisor and so on — raised expectations that “Alita” would at least look good, different or inspired. But too much of its overall design feels borrowed, by turns evoking the monochromatic clutter of “District 9,” the vertical favelas of “Ready Player One” and the randomly milling, anonymous hordes of whatever. A pileup of clichés in service to technological whiz-bangery, “Alita” is one more story of the not quite human brought to life with hubris and bleeding-edge science. It takes place in the 23rd century after a global cataclysm called the Fall. The movie’s story, inspirations and allusions (Hitchcock!), though, more rightly announce it as a 20th-century artifact, one that begins when Alita’s head and shoulders are found and refurbished by a paternalistic doctor, Ido (an atypically uneasy Christoph Waltz). Theirs is a post-apocalyptic meet-cute that morphs from yet another riff on Frankenstein’s monster into a sitcom-y father-and-daughter duet, plus brawling and exposition. The story proceeds by fits and starts with a narrative line — Alita’s journey of self-awareness — that is embellished with a dreary old-fashioned romance and regularly interrupted by chaotic action scenes. Some of this crash-boom stuff takes place during a game called Motorball, one of those survivalist contests that have been a genre staple since at least the 1975 film “Death Race 2000.” The contestants have something to do with Vector (a wasted Mahershala Ali), a regulation villain who takes fashion cues from “The Matrix.” This being a very small world, he lives with Ido’s ex, Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who when not selling her soul lounges in garters and stockings. Everything here tends to remind you of something else, including Alita, who was created with performance capture. This involves monitoring and recording a performer’s movements using sensors attached to her face and body, information that becomes the foundation for a character that’s digitally fleshed out. Cameron used a version of this technology to greater effect in “Avatar,” a reminder that whatever his limitations as a filmmaker — he’s a great visual storyteller who’s invariably easier on the eyes than ears — he is a technological wiz. Salazar’s performance, alas, is consistently bland, but then she was drawn and directed that way, like Jessica Rabbit. It’s easy to imagine that both Salazar and Rodriguez would have fared better if her face had been left alone rather than rendered into a stylized manga cartoon, complete with a heart shape and eyes even bigger than Emma Stone’s. It’s vaguely diverting to stare at Alita’s face, at least at first, to ponder its shape, texture and pale color, and the way that her brow furrows when she’s being emphatic. Mostly, though, what’s interesting about it is that it lacks the conviction, the spark, which turns truly wonderful animated creations — Disney’s Pinocchio, Hayao Miyazaki’s Ponyo — into characters you laugh with and weep for. This is a matter of style, inspiration and imagination, or their absence. There’s so little at stake in “Alita: Battle Angel” that it blurs into uninvolving spasms of visual and aural noise as it lurches to the cliffhanger ending, a setup for promised sequels. If you stick around for the end credits, you will read that “the making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of work hours.” In other words, piracy threatens the American movie industry, even if a chunk of the jobs here seem to have originated outside the United States. It’s still a worthy wag of the finger, although it’s difficult not to wish that more of those hours had been spent telling a really good story instead of tweaking tech and shiny breasts.

2019,‘Anastasia’ Musical to Close on Broadway on March 31,"The stage adaptation of “Anastasia” will end its Broadway run on March 31, the producers said Tuesday. The musical, powered by the popularity of the animated 1997 film, is about a Russian girl who may or may not be the daughter of a czar. The show began performances on Broadway in March of 2017; at the time of its closing it will have played 808 regular and 34 preview performances. The show was capitalized for up to $15 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; it has not recouped its capitalization costs. The show has an unusually ambitious touring schedule, especially for a musical that was not a huge success on Broadway, where it was greeted with several negative reviews. It is now on tour in the United States and running in Madrid and Stuttgart, Germany; there are runs planned in Holland, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Australia and Brazil. The stage adaptation features music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, whose Oscar-nominated song for the film, “Journey to the Past,” is also featured in the musical. The show has a book by Terrence McNally and is directed by Darko Tresnjak; it had a pre-Broadway production at Hartford Stage, where Mr. Tresnjak is the artistic director. The musical’s weekly grosses, which peaked last Christmas at $1.3 million for a nine-performance week, have dropped to problematic levels — last week the show brought in $508,700 over eight performances, according to figures from the Broadway League. The musical is produced by Stage Entertainment, Bill Taylor, Tom Kirdahy, Hunter Arnold and Dan Hinde.",The New York Times
2019,‘Angela’s Diaries’ Review: A Tender Journey Through Memory,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. From the mid-1970s until 2013, Angela Ricci Lucchi and Yervant Gianikian, partners in life and art, forged an analytical cinematic mode in which they critiqued Western practices of war, colonialism, objectification and more. Their work is better known in the art and academic realms than in mainstream cinematic ones. Lucchi died in 2018, and Gianikian assembled this film as a memorial. While the movie could hardly be called mainstream, it’s more conventional than the usual Lucchi-Gianikian work because it’s a singular personal musing rather than a painstakingly researched assemblage. Its contents are as the title advertises. A camera above a table shows one of Lucchi’s open diaries. Gianikian says, on the soundtrack, “I’ll read from Angela’s diary,” then announces the date of the entry. He reads, and the film cuts to home-video footage from the period discussed, sometimes the exact day, sometimes a little before or after. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] The daily life of these peripatetic artists often looks cozy — bourgeois even. There are a lot of boozy dinners with colleagues and comrades that are indistinguishable in most respects from boozy dinners with well-behaved adults who aren’t artists. Footage they shot on a 1996 trip to Sarajevo is considerably more tense and affecting. The couple’s guides, speaking English, navigate a car through the city, ruined by the ethnic wars of the ’90s. The sight of modern apartment buildings that were reduced to hollow husks in the long siege is chilling. The guides point out snipers’ perches, and when the visitors venture outside the cars, they have to tread carefully to avoid land mines. A drive to a new border of Bosnia and Croatia ends on an eerie, mysterious, tragic note. There, the filmmakers are greeted by a couple of pylons partially blocking the way forward, one or two parked cars and an atmosphere of stillness topped with confusion and dread. Nothing to do but turn around. Back home in Milan, after celebrating a retrospective of their work, Lucchi settles into nonfilm projects, creating a scrolling watercolor painting concerning her experiences in Russia and with Russian literature. The pleasures of home and hearth are conveyed in sequences featuring homemade wine and showing Lucchi cultivating her vegetable and fruit garden. She also recounts more harrowing events, including an accident in which Gianikian was severely burned. As this movie tells it, Lucchi’s life was her work, and her work was an inextricable collaboration with Gianikian. The diaries yield, in this presentation, no uncomfortable intimacies or expressions of doubt regarding any projects. “Angela’s Diaries” asks of the viewer a kind of patience that may only reside in those already conversant with the couple’s contributions, but its tenderness and straightforwardness are immediately admirable.

2019,‘Apollo 11’ Review: The 1969 Moon Mission Still Has the Power to Thrill,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The documentary “Apollo 11,” directed and edited by Todd Douglas Miller, is entirely awe-inspiring. Which is something of a surprise. As world events of the 20th century go, Apollo 11, the NASA mission of 1969 that put two men on the moon, has been thoroughly documented. It’s also been fictionally dissected, most recently by Damien Chazelle, whose 2018 film, “First Man,” is a portrait of Neil Armstrong, the mission’s commander and, yes, the first man to walk on the moon. In addition to chronicling that triumph, that film examines Armstrong’s emotional reticence. Miller’s documentary indirectly points out why such a quality is valued in astronauts. Beginning with the shots of a crawler-transporter hauling the Saturn V rocket to the Cape Canaveral launch pad, and Walter Cronkite’s newscast oratory providing the only overt narrative setup the movie will avail itself of, “Apollo 11” dispassionately lays out just how many things needed to go exactly right for this mission to be accomplished. And as many of the things that could possibly go wrong, the movie also implies that it’s only giving you the tip of the iceberg in that respect. The film consists primarily of newly discovered archival footage, some of which has never been seen before in a film. But Miller doesn’t rely entirely on it. He uses simple but effective white-on-black graphics, graphic animations and, occasionally, footage set up in split-screen to highlight particularly harrowing maneuvers, to convey the complications of the actions the Apollo 11 crew had to so precisely execute. The impact is nearly mind-boggling. On the return-to-earth leg of the journey the crew cuts loose a little more, listening to a weightless cassette player from which emits the folk-country tune “Mother Country” by John Stewart. Recordings from Houston’s mission control track key moments, including the heart rates of Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at crucial junctures during the eight-day mission. At launch, according to the flight surgeon’s report, Armstrong’s heart rate is up to 110 beats per minute. Collins’s is at 99, while Aldrin, cool as a cucumber, has a rate of 88. “First Man” reminded viewers of the complex physical and emotional challenges that come from work as an astronaut. And “Apollo 11” further demonstrates that hardly anyone but an aerospace engineer and a voluminous support team can get close to doing the math required for this endeavor. For all that, “Apollo 11” is not entirely devoid of romance. Although we know how the mission turns out, the movie generates and maintains suspense. And it rekindles a crazy sense of wonder at, among other things, what one can do practically with trigonometry.

2019,"‘Austerity, That’s What I Know’: The Making of a Young U.K. Socialist","Britain’s Big Squeeze Alex McIntyre, 19, was brought up in a Britain being reshaped by government cuts. He gave up on capitalism after a year in college. Alex McIntyre hanging out with a friend in his flat in Brighton, England. Mr. McIntyre is part of a group of young Wetherspoons employees who are fighting for better working conditions and fairer pay.CreditCreditMary Turner for The New York Times BRIGHTON, England — Alex McIntyre was raised on budget cuts. The youth center where he went after school was shuttered when he was 10. When he was 11, his mother’s housing benefit was shaved away, a casualty of the Welfare Reform Act. By the time the streetlight in his cul-de-sac began blinking off at midnight a few years later, these events had knitted together into a single story, about a government policy that had defined his childhood. “Austerity, that’s what I know, that’s my life,” said Mr. McIntyre. “I’ve never known an England that was a different way.” [What is austerity? Here’s a guide to Britain’s budget squeeze.] Now 19 and old enough to vote, Mr. McIntyre is making up for lost time. Over the last six months, he was drawn into the center of the Momentum movement, an ideological marketplace buzzing with rebranded socialism and trade unionism. His parents may have gotten their news from The Sun and The Daily Mail, but he listens to reports on the “crisis of capitalism” from Novara Media, a left-wing independent media group. Over Christmas he started reading Marx. Mr. McIntyre is the first in his family to attend college, part of a vast cohort of young Britons that was meant to embody upward social mobility. It is a paradox that so many in this bulge, like their counterparts in the United States, are giving up on free-market capitalism, convinced it cannot provide their families with a decent life. The general election of 2017 exposed the starkest generation gap in the recent history of British politics. Young voters broke dramatically for the Labour Party, whose socialist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to rebuild the welfare state and redistribute wealth. Hardened against the centrists of their parents’ generation, they have tugged the party to the left, opening up rifts that are now fracturing Labour. The young also saw their views on exiting the European Union — three-quarters of them voted to remain — bulldozed by Leavers their grandparents’ age. Mr. McIntyre is still angry that he was too young, by a year, to vote in that 2016 referendum. He is pale and lanky, discreetly tattooed, caustically funny and so well mannered that he would rather miss his train than cut into a line. (“Being British can be limiting,” he observed.) He is not representative of a generation. But his grievance is generational: that the state has taken away benefits his parents and grandparents enjoyed, like low-cost housing and free education. “We’re not blind to it. We’re not stupid, you know,” Mr. McIntyre said. “The reason we’re opposing what’s going on is what we’ve been dealt.” Britons who came of age in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 will, in many cases, be worse off than their parents. Born on the wrong side of skyrocketing property values, 30-year-olds are only half as likely to own homes as baby boomers were at the same age. A third are expected to rent for their whole lives. Unlike previous generations, they are expected to foot the bill for an expensive education. The average graduate now owes the government more than 50,800 pounds, or $64,000, a debt to be paid back gradually upon securing a well-paid job, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The portion of Britons attending college has climbed to 49 percent, the highest level ever, but they will graduate into a historic spell of wage stagnation. Robert Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, recalled Margaret Thatcher’s thesis about homeownership: By allowing low-income Britons to buy the state housing they rented, she could make them into stakeholders in market capitalism, enlarging the Tory Party. With his students, realizing in their 20s that they are not likely ever to own a home, that process has been thrown into reverse. “All the risk has been shifted onto them,” he said. “They know this is not the situation their parents and grandparents were in. You’ve got a generation since the crisis with lower mobility and lower security. It makes them less convinced that the market delivers good outcomes.” It was a big deal for Alex McIntyre to make it to college. He comes from a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Welwyn Garden City, north of London, one where life expectancy trails the national average. He grew up in a state-subsidized rental property and attended a school ranked “Requires Improvement” by the state educational inspection agency. His sister had her first child at 16. Social mobility was a mantra for the Conservative Party during those years. David Cameron promised this in 2010, as he announced the tripling of university tuition fees. Higher fees, he argued, would open up new spots and create better opportunities by encouraging market competition, something closer to the American system. “We have made our choice,” Mr. Cameron said. “A choice in favor of social mobility, in favor of a fairer society. Of a country where you can escape — truly escape — the circumstances of your birth.” [What is austerity in the U.K.? Read more about it here.] Mr. McIntyre was a test case for this experiment. He was identified as gifted and enrolled in a charity program, the Social Mobility Foundation. He was sent to stay at Cambridge University, where he ate in a wood-paneled dining hall, served by waiters, an experience he described as “hilarious.” He thrilled his mother by saying he wanted to become a doctor. But once he arrived at the University of Brighton, that confidence collapsed. Rents in Brighton rose faster than anywhere else in England last year, according to Hamptons International, a rental agent. The room he found, at the top of a musty, water-stained stairway, cost more than his government maintenance loan could cover. When he added up his tuition and maintenance loans, the amount he will repay the government once he is in a secure job, it came to 46,500 pounds, or roughly $61,000. His anxiety was so intense that he tried to get an appointment for medication. “It’s that feeling of having absolutely nothing which I don’t want to even go near,” he said. The panic eased when he found a job as a kitchen assistant at a J.D. Wetherspoon pub. Wetherspoons is Britain’s ubiquitous low-cost restaurant chain, like Applebee’s, but with pints of ale. Its founder, a bluff self-made millionaire named Tim Martin, is an American-style celebrity entrepreneur who counts Walmart’s Sam Walton among his heroes. Mr. McIntyre worked the fryer, lowering hash browns and sausages in a metal basket into a spitting tub of hot oil, so that his hands were speckled with pinprick burns. He liked the Wetherspoons clientele, including the ones who lined up, shakily, for pints at 8 a.m. “Forgotten people,” he called them. But he seethed over the pay and working conditions. Five days a week he worked midnight-to-8 a.m. shifts, which left him shaky and ill. Was this adult life, this relentless precariousness? His co-workers did not offer much comfort: A lot of them already had university degrees. “Other people can’t pay their rent, and I’m a paycheck away from not being able to pay my rent,” he said. He was in this frame of mind when he was approached quietly by a co-worker, who asked him, a little mysteriously, “We’re fed up. Are you fed up?” A few months later, Mr. McIntyre strode out on to North Street for his first walkout, accompanied by their union rep from the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, demanding a minimum wage of £10 an hour. The strikers looked nothing like the coal miners of the 1980s printed on Britain’s collective memory; they were sons and daughters of the middle class, wearing wallet chains and leopard skin pants and Doc Martens. “You are already trending, No. 6 on Twitter,” whooped the union rep. “Solidarity from Plovdiv, Bulgaria!” someone shouted. Afterward, Mr. McIntyre was so exhilarated that he barely slept. “I’m sitting here with a cup of coffee, thinking, ‘What just happened?’ ” he said a little later. “This is not the end. It is the first step in something big.” He had passed into the world of the young left that has coalesced in Brighton, a bohemian university town. It is a world of anticapitalist workshops, anarchist retreats, “red gyms” and rent strikes, and it is embodied by Mr. Corbyn, 69, a grandfatherly socialist who was dismissed as an anachronism during the centrist era of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. Mr. McIntyre said he encountered new ideas every day now, like food on a cafeteria shelf. He met Callum Cant, a tall, thin, erudite doctoral student who has organized a Marx reading group for employees at Wetherspoons and edits Notes from Below, an online journal on “self-emancipation of the working class from capitalism and the state.” Mr. Cant, 24, who comes from a wealthy village in Hampshire, arrived at college in 2014 and was swept into protests against austerity and tuition hikes. He never drifted back to the path his parents expected of him, toward a job in London finance or journalism. “I get teased about coming from a private school among comrades,” he said. “But I got a look at what their lives were like. They weren’t happy. They weren’t fulfilled.” Now, he is one of the group of hipster leftists who broadcast over Novara Media. One of them, the 26-year-old Ash Sarkar, thrilled left-wing Twitter in a televised debate this summer by eye-rolling Piers Morgan, one of Britain’s most famous journalists, who had mistaken her for a garden-variety Labour activist. “I’m a communist, you idiot!” she told him, throwing him a withering look reserved for the young who disdain the old. “I’m literally a communist!” (Novara now charges £15 for T-shirts with this quote.) One of its planks is “Fully Automated Luxury Communism,” the notion of a “post-work society” in which labor is largely automated and workers live off a “massively increased minimum wage.” Mr. McIntyre wasn’t certain where he stood on Marx, but he did feel at home with the trade union guys. A future was taking shape in Mr. McIntyre’s mind, complete with new friends and new ideas — the thing, in other words, that college had been supposed to provide. He wasn’t sure, anymore, about going into medicine. He called his mother one day to give her this news. “I thought I wanted to be a scientist, but I love politics,” he said later. “There are amazing opportunities with the bakers’ union.” He was, he acknowledged, of two minds, having invested so many years in preparing for college. “I’ve accrued half the debt, it would be quite dumb of me to completely abandon what I’ve worked years for,” he said. “On the other hand, my passion for what I do at uni has dwindled.” She listened to him quietly and hung up the phone, he said. A single mother, she had worked two or three jobs the whole time he was growing up and still takes in ironing for extra cash. His applications to college had been thrilling for her, and she went through the choices with him, one by one. “She wants me to have a better future,” he said. “For her, that is going to university, getting a degree, earning loads of money.” The next day she called to tell him to stay in school. He said he would. At home for the holidays, he was warned not to discuss politics with his Thatcherite grandparents, and tiptoed around the subject. No one in his life has brought up the bitter, divisive strikes of the 1970s and ’80s, which soured public opinion against the labor movement. “Either they are left-wing or they aren’t political at all,” he said. “That’s young people. That’s us.” Mr. McIntyre has begun to count the months until he will graduate and throw himself into full-time activism. Before Christmas he was invited by the bakers’ union president, Ian Hodson, to speak to students in the left-wing stronghold of Liverpool. He drank pints of beer with veteran organizers, men with meaty forearms who spoke to him in a Lancashire twang about Maggie Thatcher and the Peasants’ Revolt. On his way home he stopped by a picket of shipbuilders at Liverpool’s docks, his first old-school industrial picket line. He was bleary, after nightclubbing with the bakers’ union president until 3 the night before, and wheeling a carry-on bag behind him. Then he saw what he had been looking for: the gray hulk of the Cammell Laird plant, and two dozen workers warming their hands over a fire in a steel barrel. They were picketing over layoffs, and complained that they had been replaced by Romanians. A half-finished icebreaker loomed at the pier, its deck crawling with tiny figures. “This is Franny, he built the Titanic,” joked one of the men, and offered Mr. McIntyre a bacon sandwich. “It’s so inspiring,” Mr. McIntyre said. “It gives me goose bumps.” He picked up a union banner and walked out to the roadway to hold it for a few minutes, trying to make eye contact with the drivers. Cargo trucks were barreling by and drenching his feet in plumes of water. A few of them saw him. A van marked “compressed air” honked. A street sweeper honked. So did a flatbed truck loaded with wooden pallets. Mr. McIntyre grinned. He was at home. “I love it,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Berlin, I Love You’ Review: Many Stories, Not Much Feeling","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The once-divided nature of Berlin isn’t given much consideration in “Berlin, I Love You,” the fifth film in the Cities of Love anthology series. The city itself doesn’t get a whole lot of consideration, either. There are a couple of stories — one starring Keira Knightley and Helen Mirren, in which Knightley’s character works at a refugee shelter; another starring Alexander Black and Carol Schuler, in which a migrant who’s committed a crime hides out in a brothel — that address contemporary concerns of the city. But most of this movie, which is almost entirely in English, is taken up with tone-deaf humanist tales. Luke Wilson plays a big-budget Hollywood filmmaker whose Sense of Childlike Wonder is revived by a puppet theater run by, you guessed it, a winsome and beautiful woman (Dianna Agron). A miscast Diego Luna plays a trans woman who is both hit on and insulted by a teenage boy who insists that any kiss they share would be a same-sex encounter. Most excruciating is the vignette showing Mickey Rourke, in a hotel bar, crudely hitting on a woman. He’s old enough to be her father, and later speculates that he may indeed be her father. In the movie’s frame story, one character mimes while wearing angel wings clearly inspired by Wim Wenders’s “Wings of Desire,” a Berlin movie infinitely preferable to this one.

2019,‘Birds of Passage’ Review: An Epic Narco Tale That Will Open Your Eyes,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In modern movie terminology, “epic” usually just means long, crowded and grandiose. “Birds of Passage,” Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra’s follow-up to their astonishing, hallucinatory, Oscar-nominated “Embrace of the Serpent,” earns the label in a more honest and rigorous manner. Parts of the story are narrated by a blind singer — a literally Homeric figure — and the story itself upholds Ezra Pound’s definition of the epic as “a poem containing history.” It’s about how the world changes, about how individual actions and the forces of fate work in concert to bring glory and ruin to a hero and his family. The history in question, divided into five chapters, involves the Colombian drug trade from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but the film defies narco-drama clichés and superficial period atmosphere. Set among the Wayuu of northern Colombia (an Indigenous population whose language and customs survived the Spanish conquest and the rise of the modern nation-state), it also resists the temptations of exoticism and hazy magic realism. Even as you may be reminded of other sweeping chronicles of fortunes made and souls undone by ambition and greed — “Giant,” “The Godfather,” even “Breaking Bad” — your perception of the world is likely to be permanently altered. The experience made me think of some of my favorite movies (I’ll add Visconti’s “La Terra Trema” to the list), but it’s also like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Not only because of the cultural and geographic milieu, which may be as unfamiliar to many Colombians as it will be to most North American viewers. The landscape the Wayuu inhabit, on a peninsula jutting into the Caribbean, includes patches of desert and lush, green hillsides. Mostly ranchers and farmers, the Wayuu conduct trade and manage potential conflict through a system based on ritualized exchange and communication. A family’s honor is bound up with its word, and certain members, designated “messengers of the word” are treated with special deference. “Don’t shoot the messenger” is close to a sacred principle. Over the years, that and other, equally venerable rules will be broken, a slow unwinding of the old ways that escalates into full-scale slaughter and chaos. It all begins innocuously enough, with the courtship of Zaida (Natalia Reyes) — whose coming-of-age ceremony starts the film in a swirl of color, music and celebration — by a young man named Raphayet (Jose Acosta). He is a bit of a prodigal son figure, returning home after seeing some of the non-Wayuu world. Zaida’s mother, Úrsula (Carmiña Martínez), the matriarch of their clan, regards him with frank suspicion. Raphayet has spent time among the alijuna (as the Wayuu refer to Spanish-speaking Colombians), and she wonders if he has been corrupted by their ways. She turns out to be right, but it’s also true that Zaida’s suitor is an enterprising and attractive prospect. In a hurry to acquire the livestock and jewelry that Úrsula demands as the price of her daughter’s hand, Raphayet and his alijuna partner, Moisés a.k.a. Moncho (Jhon Narváez), start trafficking in marijuana. The opportunity arises by accident, a moment of serendipity and a portent of future trouble. Moncho and Raphayet, who have been hauling sacks of coffee beans in a battered truck, meet some American Peace Corps volunteers looking for weed. They know another gringo with access to planes and an airstrip, and Raphayet persuades Aníbal (Juan Martínez), Úrsula’s cousin and a patriarch in his own right, to devote some of his fields and manpower to the new cash crop. What could go wrong? Everything, of course. In Gallego and Guerra’s hands, a tale of shady deals, double-crosses and miscalculations becomes a domestic tragedy and a cultural apocalypse. As the money flows in, so do the guns, and the old codes of honor and reciprocity are corroded by acquisitiveness and vanity. Raphayet, Zaida and their two children move into a grand stucco villa that comes to symbolize both their worldly success and its grotesque absurdity. The house sits in the middle of a barren stretch of land, looking desolate and abandoned even when it’s newly built and full of people. The opulent, sterile rooms are visited by some of the birds alluded to in the film’s title, omens of change and catastrophe. “Birds of Passage,” while clearly the result of long and careful research into the Wayuu, doesn’t feel like an ethnographic document. Instead of stepping back to explain the beliefs and practices of its main characters, it plunges you into the reality of their lives, trusting that both their humanity and their distinctiveness will be apparent, that they are no more inherently mysterious — or inherently noble — than anyone else. This unassuming empathy — the refusal of the filmmakers to stamp their subjects with otherness — makes the losses the characters endure all the more devastating. The ease and charisma of the performers, trained and nonprofessional actors alike, heighten the emotional impact. Acosta, as handsome and dashing as Douglas Fairbanks, also has a sadness about him, and a diffidence that suggests a man unsure of his own powers. Though their marriage is at the center of the narrative, Zaida and Raphayet are not quite the protagonists of their own lives. The authentically tragic figure here, the one who secures the film’s epic scale and timeless gravity, is Úrsula, whom Carmiña Martínez plays with heartbreaking authority. Regal in her bearing and steadfast in her commitment to being right, she resembles a queen in an ancient Greek play, a woman whose actions are at once grounded in clear ethical principles and utterly catastrophic in their consequences. Not that Úrsula is entirely to blame for the violence that consumes nearly everyone around her. There are plenty of individual lapses that accelerate the destruction. Moncho is impulsive; Raphayet can be passive; a boy named Leonidas (Greider Meza) drifts toward wanton criminality, untethered from the discipline of tradition. Behind these actions are the half-invisible, lethally powerful forces of alijuna expediency and Yankee appetite. The history this poem contains is not only the history of the Wayuu.

2019,‘Bonsai Are Like Our Children’: Couple Pleads for Return of Stolen Trees,"TOKYO — For decades, a prized, 400-year-old Japanese bonsai tree has been shaped, watered and cared for with all of the precision needed for a priceless piece of art. In the wrong hands, it could die within a week. The tree, a 33-inch-tall Shimpaku, was among seven trees stolen from the garden of Seiji Iimura, 54, the fifth-generation owner of a bonsai shop in the city of Kawaguchi, near Tokyo, in January. All together, the stolen trees were worth more than 10 million yen, or about $90,000. Keeping bonsai trees requires a potent mixture of dedication and skill, commonly creating a deep emotional connection for their owners. Mr. Iimura had looked after the Shimpaku meticulously for 25 years. In interviews, Mr. Iimura and his wife begged the thieves to return the trees, and to make sure to water them in the meantime. “Bonsai are like our children,” said Fuyumi Iimura, Mr. Iimura’s wife. “They are our children who have been living for 400 years. I now feel like our limbs were taken away, and miss them every day.” The police have been unable to track down the thieves. Mr. Iimura said his large, 3,000-pot garden had been open — the couple never considered the possibility that someone might steal one — but they have since installed several cameras. They’ll soon construct a fence, and are considering adding a siren. Keeping a bonsai tree is as much an art as making a painting of one, with owners using wiring and pruning to shape the trees, often over several decades, into miniature versions of those found outdoors. They have a similar appeal as doll houses or model cars, shrinking something towering and magnificent so it can fit into a home or garden. Long associated with Japan, the tradition of caring for the trees started in China around the year 1000 and has spread to dedicated owners across the globe. Several previous theft victims have mourned their stolen trees in a similar way to the Iimuras, portraying it as a familial loss. “It’s not the money, these plants were like children to me,” Suzanne Berv, of Great Neck, N.Y., told The New York Times in 1978 after eight of her bonsai trees were taken. “It’s almost like somebody kidnapped one of your kids,” Fred Miyahara told KPBS, a public radio station in San Diego, in 2013, when a tree he had cared for was stolen. “To have them stolen is kind of like having your babies stolen,” Richard Fenn, a retiree in Tauranga, told The New Zealand Herald in 2017, when his collection fell victim to thieves. “They can take my shirts or my car, but to have these stolen is quite heartbreaking.” The tree that was stolen from Mr. Iimura was not for sale, he said, as it was “priceless.” Yuji Tamura, an editor for the Japan Bonsai Association, said the tree had once received an award at a conference and was “regarded as excellent.” “It takes a lot of work to create a beautiful bonsai,” he said. “The trees haven’t lived in pots for 400 or 500 years. Such old trees as Shimpaku or Ezo spruce are taken from mountains, and are taken care of for decades to become beautiful bonsai.” While the trees can be sold for hefty sums on the black market, Mr. Iimura said he hoped international news coverage would make it more difficult for the thieves to sell the trees. “All we want is the bonsai to be returned,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Boomerang’ Returns, as a BET Comedy","When “Boomerang” came out in 1992 it was both an anomaly and a bit of a relief. The movie, Reginald Hudlin’s follow-up to his hit comedy “House Party,” arrived in an era defined by social realist films like “Boyz N the Hood” (1991), “New Jack City (1991)” and “Juice” (1992). These taut, violent dramas couldn’t have felt more removed from the black elite advertising world of “Boomerang” and its inhabitants: the smooth-talking, tuxedo-wearing executive Marcus Graham (Eddie Murphy); his friends, Gerard (David Alan Grier) and Tyler (Martin Lawrence); and his colleagues and love interests, Jacqueline (Robin Givens) and Angela (Halle Berry). Many mainstream critics panned the film (The New York Times said that it appeared to be set in a “strangely retrograde Fantasyland”). But for many of us who came into adulthood with “Boomerang” (it debuted the summer before my first year of college), it made the fantastical feel within our reach. Jacqueline, the hyper-ambitious, glamorous workaholic, and Angela, the graceful, down-to-earth artist, felt like women we were in the process of becoming, or could be. Rewatching the film now, those characters are too restrictive, the script is too heterosexist and Marcus’s workplace sexual antics are out of step with the current push to increase gender equality in the boardroom and the bedroom. And yet, I still find myself charmed by the beauty and charisma of its ensemble. In a similar spirit of reverence and revision, Lena Waithe, the Emmy-winning writer and actor (“Master of None”), is producing a 10-episode TV comedy sequel, debuting Tuesday on BET. Also titled “Boomerang,” the series follows Marcus and Angela’s daughter Simone (Tetona Jackson) and Jacqueline’s son Bryson (Tequan Richmond) as they carve out spaces for themselves professionally within their parents’ world of advertising and in the larger social landscape of Atlanta. Berry joined Waithe, who was only 8 when “Boomerang” came out in 1992, as an executive producer. Unlike the movie, the series has both a male and female lead, while also offering more nuanced stories about religion, mental illness and sexuality. In this way, the new “Boomerang” is more in line with modern black millennial comedies like “Insecure” or “Atlanta,” but with Waithe’s experimental aesthetic familiar to fans of “Master of None” and her Showtime drama “The Chi.” In a phone interview, Waithe, who wrote the pilot with the showrunner Ben Cory Jones (“Underground,” “Insecure”), talked about the 1990s as a particularly inspiring age of African-American comedy, her instinct to protect the legacy of “Boomerang” and her desire to revel in the heterogeneity of black identity. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why did you decide to put your own stamp on this really canonical movie from the 1990s? I heard through the grapevine that Paramount and BET greenlit 10 half-hour episodes, with no writers attached. I couldn’t think of anything more basic or simple than that. So I tried to be the opposite and I said to myself, “Why not do something fresh and interesting?” Is that when Halle Berry got involved? That’s when the stars aligned. I was already thinking about “Boomerang” when I went to the GLADD [Media] Awards and Halle Berry presented me with an award for the “Thanksgiving” episode [of “Masters of None”; Waithe also won an Emmy for writing that episode]. So we talked backstage about them making it into a TV show. I told her “I’m thinking about raising my hand to make sure this doesn’t get messed up,” and I asked if she would be down to executive produce to make sure it was legit. She said, “Yeah, I’d love to work with you.” When we jumped on the phone later, she told me “Don’t try to remake what we did. You can’t do that. That was a miracle. You guys have to create a new miracle.” So how did you go about doing that? The only thing I could think of to not rehash it was to go with their children. I kept thinking about Marcus and Angela as they walk into the sunset at the end of the movie to that great [Babyface and] Toni Braxton song, “Give You My Heart,” and I was like “What happens to them?” They get married, have a kid, live the American Dream so to speak. And then I was like, “Who was that kid? Who does that kid grow up to be?” I started to go deeper into what it means to be young and black and all that goes with that. And I also thought of Jacqueline’s kid, but we don’t know who the father is because she was a rolling stone. The thing about those characters, Jacqueline and Angela but specifically Marcus, is that all the things that make them iconic also make them not such great parents. Marcus Graham is a narcissist. Jacqueline was kind of crazy. Angela was this girl chasing rainbows. Rather than idolize the characters, why not look at them through a realistic lens, so to speak? Then I realized my characters would be 26 years old — that’s how long ago the movie came out. You are kind of distancing yourself from your parents at 26 and trying to figure out who you are, and also rejecting everything that your parents told you that you are, that you would be. But by the time you get to the second episode, you also realize that these are just young black people trying to figure out their lives, which is really what we wanted to go for. So even if you’ve never seen the movie, you can appreciate the show and see the subtle nuances through which we pay tribute to the original. But we are also trying to create our own lane. How did you differentiate your show from the other TV comedies on now that also focus on black millennials, like “Atlanta,” “Dear White People” and “Insecure”? I think the movie was smart to have characters from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Marcus is making good money, but Tyler isn’t. They are homies and represent different kinds of black men. The same for Angela; her apartment is hippie, but we imagine that Jacqueline’s place is probably cold, quiet and empty. So I really want to draw from those characters, create interesting ones around their children, and show variations of black identity. I was very much informed by “Atlanta.” I think a lot of us are. And “Master of None,” where we also will go into dark places. The “Thanksgiving” episode definitely goes in and out of that, but also is comedic. But your version of Atlanta feels so different than Donald Glover’s. I can’t ignore the fact that Simone grew up with a little bit of money in her pocket. We’re not going into the neighborhood Earn and Paper Boi go into. But Simone’s friend Tia [Lala Milan] did not [have money] and she’s someone who’s going to have to hustle. And then there’s Crystal [Brittany Inge], who is also from a working class family and resents Simone a little in terms of how things are given to her. But at the end of the day, they’re all black women and are all facing the same issues. My favorite character is Ari [Leland Martin], who is fluid and sometimes dates girls, sometimes deals with guys. And we don’t force the issue — there are no PSAs happening. He’s just a guy who’s masculine and also not afraid to take risks, in terms of his fashion and lifestyle. Some people will say, “That’s not my version of Atlanta.” That’s fair, everybody has a different experience of their city. But Atlanta is , so fresh and so vibrant, and while filming there, I saw young black people making their own way. They’re not asking permission. So we really tried to capture the young, black, professional version of Atlanta, and be respectful of that. What aspects unique to their generation were you trying to show? As a 34-year-old, I’m not that much older than a 26-year-old. But they still grew up with pressures that I didn’t have to deal with — have a stranger attack a choice that you make, or judge you if they saw something you said on Twitter. They also feel like their lives are in even more in danger. Police have always been brutal to African-Americans, but I think it’s even more blatant for this generation. It’s a fear they have when they walk out their door every day. But also a determination that says, “Let me see the world before I die.” That’s more present in this generation, even more so than mine. It’s stressful to be young and black. Any cameos? Are we going to see Halle or Robin? I won’t say “No.” But I don’t [want viewers to] look for that. If you are, I didn’t do my job well.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Clara’s Ghost’ Review: A Family of Performers, a Night of Hysteria","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Clara’s Ghost” introduces its main character in a moment when she is desperate, discombobulated and on a mad mission to retrieve a lost shoe. Clara’s anxiety is curious rather than contagious, at once funny and sad and a little unnerving. Her disconcerting presence provides the first signal of the elusive and intriguing film to follow. Clara’s loopy voice is soothing and her face looks familiar, as if she were a beloved character actress with a thousand credits to her name. This is not the case. Clara Reynolds isn’t a professional performer. Neither is the woman who plays her, Paula Niedert Elliott — though like her character, she is married to a comedian (Chris Elliott of “Cabin Boy”) and their two children are actresses. With her real-life family as her co-stars, and her daughter Bridey Elliott as the film’s writer and director, Paula steals the spotlight in a story that reflects, warps and magnifies the thorny dynamics of showbiz households. Clara is the long-suffering wife of Ted (Chris), a comedian whose career has floundered. They have two daughters, Julie (Abby Elliott) and Riley (Bridey), who are each struggling to establish adult careers after child stardom. As the whole family convenes on their dog’s birthday, Clara is relegated to become the butt of her loved ones’ jokes. Disoriented and disempowered, she begins to have visions of a wild woman (Isidora Goreshter) who offers an escape from the role Clara plays in her family of professional clowns. Clara suspects that her raving visitor is a ghost, especially since she only appears to Clara — but this specter is warmer than the egomaniacal Reynolds family, and Clara does not resist divine intervention. Clara’s private, phantasmal liberation signals the influence of the John Cassavetes film “Opening Night,” but Bridey’s images do not aspire to the sensuousness of that inspiration. The Reynolds’ house may be haunted, but it does not look foreboding — in fact, it’s hard to think of any shot that is memorable in any way. Over time, this visual slackness proves to be a sinuous strength. It prevents the film from indicating its intentions, which would remove the mystery from the tense relationships it depicts. As is perhaps appropriate, given the comic occupations of the Reynolds (and the Elliott) family, this unusual, unsettling and terrific little film presents itself not as a domestic opera, but as a family comedy.

2019,‘Climax’ Review: A Party That Assaults the Senses and Scrambles the Brain,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In Gaspar Noé’s “Climax,” the end credits come at the beginning, the opening titles arrive in the middle, and from time to time other words interrupt the action. “Death is an extraordinary experience,” declares one such text, printed upside down in both the center of the screen and the subtitles below. Another proclaims (right side up) that “this is a French film, and proud of it.” What does that mean? Is it just the obvious fact that the characters in “Climax,” members of a dance troupe whose night of partying goes terribly awry, mostly speak French? Or that they gyrate, flirt, drink and fight in front of a giant tricolor flag? Is this a French movie because of its aggressive sexual candor? Because of the smoking? Because there’s a song by Air on the soundtrack? Because of the last-minute intervention of the state? Possibly all of the above — and also, I suspect, by virtue of Noé’s commitment to an idea of cinema at once visceral and analytical, sensual and cerebral. He is an extremist with a philosophical streak whose movies combine an aesthetic of shock with an almost geeky formalism. He confronts the viewer with graphic sexual violence (“Irréversible”), 3-D pornography (“Love”) and what feels like death itself (“Enter the Void”) in a way that at once overwhelms thought and encourages reflection. “Climax,” with its hallucinatory, often horrific images, its relentless, bass-heavy music and its vertiginous camera movements, assaults the senses and scrambles the brain. But even though the techniques are immersive — plunging you into a disorienting reality that mirrors the drug-fueled frenzy you are witnessing — the effect is also curiously distancing. You are being assaulted with an idea, bombarded by a series of theoretical propositions about sexual ethics, social behavior and the nature of cinematic representation. These are not, in themselves, all that interesting. Noé may be a better technician than a thinker. And like most parties that go on too long and spin out of control, this one gets boring after a while. But the director’s skill and energy keep it exciting — if not entirely pleasant — at least until the serious violence starts. [Gaspar Noé makes his peace with not being hated.] The dancers, finished with rehearsals and about to embark on a tour of America, gather for music and drinks in a cavernous room on a winter night. We know it will end badly — the first image we’ve seen is of a desperate, bleeding woman crawling through the snow in daylight — and that the group came together in a spirit of eager creativity. On an old color television (the story takes place in the mid-90s), we watch snippets of the audition interviews that brought them to this fateful evening. The set is flanked by VHS tapes that offer clues about what is to come. The titles include “Suspiria” (the Dario Argento original, not the more recent remake), “Querelle” and “Possession,” films maudits whose ranks “Climax” aspires to join. It has its moments, most of them in the first half, when the emphasis is on movement rather than mayhem. There are two extended group dance sequences, one filmed almost entirely from above, that are enthralling for their discovery of the strangeness and beauty of human bodies. At rest, the people, a mix of races, sizes and sexualities, are somewhat more ordinary. They gossip, squabble and banter. The men brag about the sex they’ve had or want to have. The women do that, too, though in less explicit terms. The audience manages to figure out who is who, and struggles to remember the names, as if we had crashed the party. Selva (Sofia Boutella) is the one with the dyed-blond bob who might be the main character. David (Romain Guillermic) is the guy putting the moves on her. Daddy (Kiddy Smile) is the D.J. Emmanuelle (Claude Gajan Maull) is the mother of the little kid. There are snacks and sangria, which turns out to be laced with LSD. As the drug takes effect, the conversation devolves into screams, moans and accusations. The action erupts into shoving and shouting matches, and then escalates into beatings, child endangerment and self-mutilation, and finally into suicide, incest, rape and murder. The camera hurtles down corridors, flips over and spins around, a frenetic kineticism that increases the intensity and then drains it away. The climax, so to speak, is a murky swirl of limbs under hazy red light, a finish that demonstrates the limits of Noé’s immersive method. You had to be there. Thank goodness you weren’t.

2019,‘Cold Pursuit’ Review: Liam Neeson Is a Killer Snowplow Driver,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The wintertime Liam Neeson sad-dad action thriller for 2019, “Cold Pursuit,” is just like most of the previous specimens and also completely different. This time, instead of rescuing a daughter, as he did in “Taken” — the bellwether of this beloved or at least unavoidable subgenre — Neeson is avenging a son. His character, Nels Coxman, is not a globe-trotting assassin with a highly specialized set of skills, but rather a humble Colorado snowplow driver. For an amateur, Nels is awfully good at killing, and he takes to it with a grim determination that could easily be mistaken for enthusiasm. Neeson’s recent revelation, in a newspaper interview, that he once came close to acting out his own racist revenge fantasies might spoil some of the fun. For his part, the director, Hans Petter Moland, is clearly having a blast. Why else would he have bothered to remake his film “In Order of Disappearance,” (2016) in which Stellan Skarsgard played a Norwegian snowplow driver named Nils Dickman? (The screenwriter on this version is Frank Baldwin.) Nels’s methodical, bloody extraction of payback is, as usual in this kind of story, righteous, sadistic and wildly disproportionate. On top of the bodies he dispatches himself, there are dozens of casualties in a war he unwittingly sparks between rival gangs of drug dealers. After members of one of these outfits inject Nels’s son, Kyle (Micheal Richardson, Neeson’s oldest son), with a fatal overdose of heroin, Nels works his way up the org chart, picking off guys with colorful underworld nicknames like Limbo and Shiv. At the top of the odious heap is Viking (Tom Bateman), a smug and vicious helicopter parent who forces his young son to drink green smoothies instead of the sugary cereals that are every American child’s birthright. Viking is a perfect ideological Rorschach blot of a villain: You could read him either as a preening liberal elitist or as a coldblooded Ayn Rand techno-capitalist, depending on what you hate most. Or maybe you think that’s a distinction without a difference. Whatever works. The mano-a-mano mad-dad duel between Nels and Viking — spiced with hints of class and generational conflict — gets complicated when a third angry father is added to the mix. That would be White Bull (Tom Jackson), head of a Native American crime family. A truce between his people and Viking’s falls apart when Viking assumes that White Bull’s people, rather than Nels, has been killing off his minions. White Bull goes after Viking’s kid, and a patriarchal free-for-all ensues. Pity the minions. Moland pursues the mayhem with a degree of lowdown wit and a troll’s eye on the potential sensitivities of the audience. Each time a man dies, he is memorialized with a tasteful death notice on a black screen, with his real name as well as his underworld alias, and a glyph suggesting which maker he has been sent off to meet. There are a lot of crucifixes and totemic eagles, with an occasional Star of David, Om sign and peace symbol thrown in for good measure. It’s like one of those “Coexist” bumper stickers, and also kind of the opposite. This is the part of the review in which I note that “Cold Pursuit” traffics in a bunch of dubious stereotypes and some questionable sexual politics. This will make some of you mad at the movie, some at me. White Bull’s band of Indians — who were Serbs in the Norwegian original and would be Mexican or Colombian in most Hollywood exercises of this kind — are half-noble, half-comical savages, mocked and honored in turn, as they were in the old westerns. Just for fun, Nels has a brother, Brock (William Forsythe), whose gold-digging Asian wife (Elizabeth Thai), a former massage parlor worker, is basically a walking ethnic joke. The other women in the movie fare only slightly better, except for Laura Dern, who plays Nels’s wife and gets out as quickly as she can. Emmy Rossum as a ski-town cop is supposed to remind us of Frances McDormand in “Fargo,” but bases her successful police work on the sexual manipulation of some poor sap in Denver. She is encouraged in this by her patrol partner (John Doman), who otherwise embodies what happens to a white man when he gives in to the imperatives of political correctness. Perhaps you think the same about me. I don’t really care. And please don’t get me wrong. I’m not accusing “Cold Pursuit” of being casually sexist or accidentally racist. On the contrary: Its misogyny and racism strike me as perfectly deliberate, if also mostly disingenuous. That is, the movie works very hard to provoke a reaction like the one in the previous two paragraphs to justify the inevitable counter-reaction. Why make everything political? Lighten up, snowflake! It’s just a movie. And enjoying it can feel like an act of rebellion. Which I totally get. I have kids and grievances of my own and blah blah blah. I can’t deny that the glum, resentful, not-giving-a-damn masculine vibe of “Cold Pursuit” has its appeal, as does Moland’s blunt knack for efficient screen violence. As for the star, Neeson has whittled his winter persona down to a haggard nub of weary anger, purging any inkling of gentleness, melancholy or self-awareness. The deadpan extremity of his performance is almost funny, except that in light of what we know now about Neeson’s past, it’s not funny at all. The thirst for revenge, in movies as in life, almost necessarily involves the dehumanization of its target. And if the movie itself is best taken as a joke, it’s a very bad dad joke.

2019,‘Crippling’ Attacks Force Doctors Without Borders to Close Ebola Centers in Congo,"Two attacks on Ebola treatment centers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have forced the international aid group Doctors Without Borders to close the facilities, it said on Thursday, warning that the outbreak was not under control. In the first attack, on Sunday night, unidentified assailants threw stones at a treatment center in Katwa, in northeastern Congo, and set fire to the structure. They destroyed much of the building, equipment and patient wards, and the brother of a patient died, though the circumstances were unclear. Doctors Without Borders said that its staff members were safe and that patients had been transferred to other facilities, but it called the attack a debilitating blow to efforts to contain the outbreak, which has killed 553 people so far. It is the second-worst Ebola epidemic in history, after the crisis that left 11,310 people dead in West Africa from 2014 through mid-2016. “This attack has crippled our ability to respond to what is now the epicenter of the outbreak,” Emmanuel Massart, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Katwa, said in a statement on Tuesday. Three days later there was another attack in the night, this time in the nearby city of Butembo. The attackers tried to set fire to the building, and the next day bullet holes were visible on the wall, said Dr. Michael Yao, the incident manger for the World Health Organization. Patients and medical staff were reported safe by the aid group, including 15 confirmed to have Ebola. Officials said they did not know what motivated the attacks. “It looks like an organized group that wants to target treatment centers,” Dr. Yao said. He said the loss of the centers was especially damaging because they were part of an alert system for suspected cases and offered experimental treatments that had shown success. But officials acknowledged that they had struggled to gain the trust of many Congolese. At first, Dr. Yao said, there was community resistance because it was the region’s first experience with the disease, which carries a stigma. And although health workers slowly built trust with local people, many patients arrived in treatment centers too late — an often deadly delay because of Ebola’s 21-day incubation period. “When somebody comes late to a treatment center they have less chance to survive,” he said, calling it a “vicious cycle” that creates a negative public perception. In the eyes of many people, he said, treatment facilities began to look like “a kind of center where people come to die.” Adding to the resistance is a climate of intense distrust toward outsiders, born in part from the long-running conflicts in the region and the divisive campaigns leading up to an election last month, when some politicians spread false rumors about the virus’s origins. There are more than 100 armed groups involved in near-constant conflict in eastern Congo, and militias and security forces alike are accused of brutalizing civilians. That has left many unsure whom to trust. The violence has frustrated efforts to eliminate the outbreak, and the W.H.O. warned that it could result in the spread of Ebola in the region. Whitney Elmer, deputy country director for the aid group Mercy Corps, said that there had been several waves of distrust and violence before, and that health workers needed to collaborate better with community groups and leaders. “Community engagement takes time,” she said. “There’s a lot of fear and there’s a lot of misconceptions, and in a 21-day period you’re talking about life and death.” The workers are trying to address the resistance by speaking with community leaders and offering the testimony of Ebola survivors, who now number more than 300, Dr. Yao said. The W.H.O. said it was expanding housing and treatment for the patients forced to move. The agency has recorded 814 confirmed infections and 65 probable cases, and determined that risks remain “very high” for the outbreak to spread nationally or across the border into Uganda, Rwanda or South Sudan. With international groups, Congo quelled an Ebola outbreak last year, and aid workers said the success of that campaign was cause for hope in the current crisis. But for now, Ms. Elmer said, the loss of the two centers was “absolutely crippling in the area where it’s the biggest hot spot right now.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Dangerous Territory’ for Democrats as Republicans Seize Venezuela Moment in Miami,"MIAMI — For 60 years, the lifeblood of Miami’s idiosyncratic politics has been Cuba, the communist government’s countless sins denounced in street protests, dissected on the spirited Spanish-language airwaves and condemned at campaign rallies under the unifying cry of “Viva Cuba Libre!” But the focus of this city’s freedom-loving fervor has recently moved further south. Venezuela, not Cuba, now dominates Miami’s political conversation. A television anchor not long ago ended a somber segment with a promise to keep praying for the troubled South American country. Venezuelans in the city have gathered for demonstrations to coincide with protests back home. Even the Miami-Dade County Commission, a local body with no control over foreign policy, voted unanimously to recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. The shift has been coming on gradually for years, but it has accelerated in recent weeks as Venezuela has sunk further into crisis and its leftist president, Nicolás Maduro, has clung defiantly to power. The showdown in Caracas is reshaping Latino politics in South Florida, home to the highest concentration of Venezuelans in the United States. The change is not a mere demographic curiosity. In Florida, where major elections have repeatedly been decided by tiny margins, an inflection point around Venezuela’s leadership could help define a generation of Venezuelan-American voters, who number in the tens of thousands in this state. President Trump is pushing Mr. Maduro to step aside, and if he succeeds, Democrats fear it could transform Venezuelan-Americans into loyal Republicans, much like Cuban-Americans. “This could be Bay of Pigs 2.0,” said Liz Alarcón, a Venezuelan-American Democrat, referring to the C.I.A.-backed invasion of Cuba in 1961 that failed to overthrow Fidel Castro. The raid turned into a disaster, in part because President John F. Kennedy’s government did not provide sufficient air support to the Cuban exiles who made up the bulk of the invading force — and Florida’s Cuban community turned against both Mr. Kennedy and the Democratic Party. “It is very dangerous territory for Democrats,” State Senator Annette Taddeo of Miami, a Colombian-American and a Democrat, said of her party’s handling of the Venezuela issue. “Republicans are very smart about working on the margins. They know that a state like Florida is usually decided by 1 percent or less, so all they need are enough of the Venezuelans, enough of the Colombians, enough of the Puerto Ricans.” The influx of Puerto Ricans to the Orlando and Miami areas after Hurricane Maria in 2017 prompted some political analysts to make grand predictions about how the new arrivals would turn Florida blue in the midterms. Those forecasts overestimated the rate at which Puerto Ricans actually voted, and underestimated how successful Republicans would be in campaigning to them. Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist, predicted that Venezuela policy — especially if the crisis continues to drag on — could become a key Florida question for presidential candidates in the 2020 election, as Puerto Rico was in the 2018 midterms. “Foreign policy has always been deeply intertwined in the Florida political landscape and the outcome of elections,” said Mr. Ulvert, who is Nicaraguan-American and married to a Venezuelan. In South Florida, protesters have publicly shamed former members of the Venezuelan government in restaurants and angrily chanted outside Goldman Sachs when the bank purchased deeply discounted Venezuelan bonds, extending a financial lifeline to Mr. Maduro’s administration. When Mr. Trump announced last month he was recognizing Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim leader, thousands of Venezuelans gathered in a park outside Miami to voice their support. Ms. Alarcón, 30, said her fellow Democrats have been slow to react to Republican overtures not only to Venezuelans but also to other Democratic-leaning Latinos who fled authoritarian governments. They were especially alarmed when three liberal members of Congress — Representatives Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Ro Khanna of California and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — recently criticized the White House’s recognition of Mr. Guaidó and threats of more sanctions against Mr. Maduro. “A U.S.-backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face,” Ms. Omar wrote on Twitter, invoking a history of ill-received United States intervention against left-wing governments in Latin America during the Cold War years. But many Venezuelan exiles are exasperated to see Democrats opposed to intervening in the alarming humanitarian crisis in their country because of the lingering politics of the past. “This is not a coup!” Joanna Hausmann, a Venezuelan-American comedian in New York, declared in a video she filmed to explain the situation. “What tends to happen with Venezuelans is people have no idea why we’re here,” she said in an interview. Those who have fled the country, she said, are “running from dictatorship, from lack of food.” Ms. Hausmann, 29, whose uncle, a journalist, is under house arrest back home, said she was attacked on social media as a “right-winger” for agreeing with Mr. Trump on Venezuela policy, though she disagrees with him on most everything else. “I’m very disappointed in my liberal brethren,” she said. “Everything is distilled into, ‘Oh, Trump, and the history of coups in Latin America.’ It’s a completely different situation with a 25-year history.” The potential problem for Democrats is that a few dissenting voices from the left challenging Mr. Trump’s increasingly popular policy on Venezuela might be louder than the rest of the party, said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Miami, a Cuban-American Republican. “Just like when we’ve had instances on the immigration issue where a small group of Republicans will say things and that becomes the Republican narrative on immigration, Democrats now have a similar — and serious — problem,” he said in an interview. More top Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have thrown their support behind Mr. Guaidó over the past few days. Mr. Trump has said he is open to all options on Venezuela, including military ones. No Miami politicians, Republican or Democrat, favor armed conflict, but they have espoused bipartisan support for the president’s other statements so far. In a rare moment of unity, Mr. Diaz-Balart and four Democratic lawmakers from Miami and Orlando have introduced bills to restrict arm sales to Mr. Maduro’s government, grant Venezuelan immigrants temporary protected status, and provide the country with humanitarian aid. “This is very American, to support democracy,” said Representative Donna Shalala, a Democrat. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American Republican who has played a central role in crafting the Trump administration’s policy, said in an interview that critics from outside Florida who look at the issue through an old ideological prism often have an uninformed view of Venezuela: “Their history on this issue is maybe a week old.” He compared Miami’s ties to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital that is just a three-hour plane ride away, to inseparable cities along the southwest border. “The closest sort of analogy would be with border towns in Mexico, who are deeply dependent on cross-border trade,” Mr. Rubio said. He recalled attending a family friend’s wedding in the Venezuelan city of Valencia when he was younger. “You can’t live in Miami without knowing people in Venezuela.” Ernesto Ackerman, 69, a Venezuelan-American activist who came to the United States in 1989, long before Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, President Hugo Chávez, came into power, described the arrival of subsequent “tides” of Venezuelan immigrants. “If the problem gets solved,” said Mr. Ackerman, a Republican, “a lot of people are going to go back.” Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers insist that they back Venezuela action on principle, not as an electoral ploy. Yet Democrats saw politics at play this month when Vice President Mike Pence delivered a Venezuela policy speech in Doral — a Miami suburb known as Doralzuela — and did not invite Democratic members of Congress. Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump mentioned Venezuela in his State of the Union address and immediately pivoted to a campaign line that seemed to liken Venezuela’s socialist government to liberals in the United States. “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,” he said. During last year’s midterm elections, Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor, frequently deployed the word “socialist” against Mr. Gillum, his opponent. The jab, dismissed by Democrats as ridiculous, appeared to stick: Mr. DeSantis won. So did Rick Scott, a Republican who was elected to the Senate after working hard to court Venezuelans, Puerto Ricans and other Latinos who typically vote for Democrats. Florida’s Venezuelan community has a smattering of activists who are the heads of various organizations but no obvious leader — a reflection of an immigrant group still getting established, still up for grabs politically and still glued to the news from home, usually via Twitter posts or forwarded audio files on WhatsApp. “I’ve been sleeping maybe three hours a night,” said Yusnaiberth Detraux, 44, who described spending hours online scouring for information “until my eyes hurt.” Ms. Detraux, who left Venezuela 12 years ago and became a United States citizen last year, said she had lost hope until Mr. Guaidó came along, and the United States and its allies in the Western Hemisphere and Europe rallied behind him. Though she leans Republican, Ms. Detraux had not liked Mr. Trump at first. Then he delivered on his promised hard line on Venezuela. “Thank God we have this president,” she said. “At least he’s listened to us. Unfortunately, the previous administration did not.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Dear Ex’ Review: Heartbreaking and Heartwarming Family Dysfunction,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. As the 13-year-old Chengxi (Joseph Huang) relates his circumstances in the Netflix original “Dear Ex,” his doodles animate the screen, obscuring and enhancing the live-action imagery beneath. The film’s twee qualities shouldn’t be taken for fatuousness, however. It is a remarkably affecting and cogent picture. Following the death of his father (Spark Chen), Chengxi finds himself caught between his mother, Sanlian (Hsieh Ying-hsuan), and Jay (Roy Chiu), a man for whom his father left his family. Chengxi has been written out of his late father’s insurance policy, and all of the money will now go to Jay — as soon as Sanlian signs off on it. Chengxi copes with the resulting fight by moving in with Jay (to the displeasure of both adults), drawn to the man’s mercurial nature and relationship with his father. As the film goes on, the story fractures, traveling back and forth in time as the three characters struggle to reach a point of conciliation. The stereotypes that Sanlian and Jay seem to embody — shrew and rogue — peel away, leaving only the tenderness and the sense of betrayal both of them still feel toward the man they loved. Roles switch and shift, as do the characters’ feelings for one another. At points, the film threatens to tip over into melodrama, but the directors Mag Hsu and Hsu Chih-yen always right the ship, balancing oversaturated flashbacks with a nuanced portrait of love that endures both trials and time.

2019,"‘Death to America’ Means ‘Death to Trump,’ Iran’s Supreme Leader Says","TEHRAN — When Iran uses the slogan “Death to America,” the country’s supreme leader said on Friday, it is specifically wishing death on President Trump and two of his senior officials. “ ‘Death to America’ means death to Trump and John Bolton and Pompeo,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, referring to John R. Bolton, the president’s national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. “It means death to American leaders, who happen to be these people at this time,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei has reflected on the phrase repeatedly as Iran prepares to commemorate the 40th anniversary of its Islamic revolution, and engages in an increasingly bitter standoff with the Trump administration. The United States has withdrawn from a nuclear accord with Iran, reimposed economic sanctions on the country, and stepped up measures designed to pressure and perhaps to change its leadership. “Death to America” would remain part of Iran’s official discourse, Ayatollah Khamenei’s website, Khamenei.ir, quoted him as saying on Monday, until the United States changed its “evil and mean” ways. Mr. Pompeo has led efforts to increase pressure on Iran, and recently met with an opposition figure, Masih Alinejad. In 2017, before his appointment to the Trump administration, Mr. Bolton spoke to an armed Iranian opposition group and predicted that the Islamic republic would collapse. President Hassan Rouhani said last week that the republic was facing its worst economic situation in its 40 years. In the weeks preceding the anniversary, Iranian clerics, politicians and commanders have been renewing their rhetorical attacks against the United States. The country’s leaders have also been showing off new missiles. On Thursday, state television displayed what it said was a new missile called Dezful with a range of 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles. It also showed an underground missile base and a commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who boasted about the capacities of Iran’s missile defense program. Ayatollah Khamenei has also lashed out against the European Union, which remains supportive of the nuclear deal and last week registered a payments vehicle called the Instrument for Supporting Trade Exchanges, meant to bypass United States sanctions against Iran. The Iranian authorities have accused Europe of setting unacceptable conditions for using the mechanism. “These days there is talk about Europeans and their offers. My advice is not to trust them, just like with the Americans,” Ayatollah Khamenei said Friday at a meeting with senior Army Air Force officers. “I’m not saying cut ties with Europe; it is about trust,” he added. Ayatollah Khamenei has also announced that 50,000 prisoners will be pardoned in coming days as part of the anniversary. Those facing charges of rape, armed robbery, acid attack and many categories of smuggling will not be eligible for the pardons; nor will those charged with embezzlement, money laundering, “security-related charges with a prison term of more than a year” or “distortion of the country’s economy.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Donnybrook’ Review: Fighting for Survival in the Heartland,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Donnybrook” is a movie about, among other things, bare-knuckle fighting, but it’s the viewers who will feel beaten down. And it won’t take very long, either, as it seems almost every encounter in this lugubrious, headache-inducing drama involves violence. Even the announcement of the title, its stark black letters slammed against a blood-red background, feels like an assault. This is a movie that makes its points with a piledriver, the coarseness extending to characters’ names. At the center is Jarhead Earl (Jamie Bell), a desperate veteran with two children and a drug-addicted wife. (Back story — any story, really — is so minimal we’re forced to make a great many inferences on our own.) Hoping for a fresh start, Earl plans to enter the Donnybrook (the word derives from Dublin’s infamously rowdy Donnybrook Fair), an illicit cage fight whose $100,000 prize would finance his wife’s recovery and his family’s future. A gun-store robbery (how else will he find the fight’s entry fee?) kicks off Earl’s, and the film’s, odyssey of brutality. Its main engine is a terrifying meth dealer named Chainsaw Angus (Frank Grillo), a slab of psychosis whose seemingly longtime beef with Earl is never made quite clear. To amuse himself while tracking Earl and managing his methheads, Angus maintains a revoltingly abusive, possibly incestuous relationship with his deeply damaged sister, Delia (Margaret Qualley). You could feel sorry for her were her behavior not at times as disgusting as his. Based on Frank Bill’s 2013 novel of the same name (whose paperback cover says it all), “Donnybrook,” set in Indiana and filmed in Ohio, is a one-dimensional wallow in rural Midwestern miserabilism. Ear-shredding to listen to (the soundtrack, between chunks of a comically portentous score, is mostly thrash metal) and soul-destroying to watch, the movie trembles with tragedy. Yet because almost everyone and everything — dialogue, image, setting — is presented in such broad, symbolic strokes, we feel absolutely nothing. A vivid peony of blood on white kitchen tiles leaps from the movie’s downbeat palette (the cinematography, by David Ungaro, is often quite striking), yet the body it came from inspires no feeling. There’s more emotional resonance in a Punch and Judy show. Filled with poverty, futility and angry white men, “Donnybrook” has feet of lead and not much of a brain. “You still tweakin’ from killin’ those Muslim babies?” Delia taunts Earl with the pointless cruelty of the chronically stupid. In the press notes, the director, Tim Sutton (whose previous feature, “Dark Night” (2017), was about a mass shooting), calls this film “an American folk tale” and claims “It’s important to try and capture the pulse of society.” Maybe Sutton does have something valuable to say about economic deprivation and lack of opportunity. But with “Donnybrook” — especially the climactic fight scene, complete with a redneck rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” — he risks instead the appearance of condescension to the very demographic he seeks to represent. Either way, the movie wears you down. At one point, we watch Delia sit motionless in a car, her mouth wrapped around a gun barrel, for what feels like five minutes. I didn’t see a single muscle move, and thought the film had broken down. And then I wished that it had.

2019,"‘Eat the Devil’ Review: Sex Dolls, Wormholes and a Stand for Nihilism","On the laboratory floor, a humanoid figure flickers to life. Her name is Mia, and when her artificial intelligence is fully operational, she will be a supremely realistic sex doll, ready for mass production. To get up to speed, she watches hours upon hours of porn. Up in the sky, Redtube Flight 728 slips through a wormhole, which the captain explains to the passengers is part of the new normal. “They’re pretty common now that the patriots at Amazon are using them to bend the fabric of the universe to improve delivery times,” he says. Soon a vehemently campy flight attendant named George begins to suspect that there’s a sex ghost on board. “What the frick is a sex ghost?” his equally dimwitted colleague Tammy asks, reasonably enough. But also: What’s all this online hysteria about a virus caused by furries? (That’s the subculture of people who dress in animal costumes.) Can it really be traced to a plane that’s gone missing, and are George and Tammy on that plane? That’s not even close to all there is to keep track of in Nadja Leonhard-Hooper and Dan Nuxoll’s “Eat the Devil,” the gleefully but fatally overloaded satire from One Year Lease Theater Company at the Tank. A sci-fi, apocalypse, time-travel, airplane-disaster movie riff, it’s a careening sendup of an out-of-control American culture mesmerized by screens. There are characters based on famous right-wingers (the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the political commentator Tomi Lahren, the televangelists Jim and Lori Bakker) piled alongside fictional social outliers: an incel named Ethin Sell, and an out-and-proud furry called Goatse — who, for the record, believes he is “the reincarnated soul of a goat from a 13th-century Russian folktale.” All of them commune with their public through cameras, and Nick Flint’s production makes impressive use of plentiful video. (Some of it is shot live, which occasioned some technical glitches at the performance I saw.) This is the rare stage production that credits not only a video designer (Scott Fetterman) but also cinematographers (Adam Dietrich and Bella Graves). There’s a drone here, too — its name is Alexa Bezos — and it is maybe not such a great idea to have it fly over the spectators’ heads. By far the best, most focused parts of the show happen back at the lab, where Kelindah Schuster makes a wondrously sympathetic Mia, and Lexie Braverman lends a vital warmth and ease to her creator, Penny. Rory Spillane is a comic standout as Charles, her awkward young colleague (and is equally fine as Ethin the incel). But at 100 minutes, this fervent experiment drags — because it’s too convoluted, and because the single philosophical stand it seems to take is for nihilism. It strafes everything in its sights. As the Bakkers prepare their viewers for the dark times they insist are ahead, they hawk a survival kit stocked with many thousands of calories. “It’s a 30-day fiesta bucket,” Lori says. “Eat the Devil” is a kind of fiesta bucket, too — jam-packed to overflowing, but its calories are mostly empty.",The New York Times
2019,‘Everybody Knows’ Review: Penélope Cruz’s Homecoming Turns Frantic,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At the beginning of Asghar Farhadi’s “Everybody Knows,” everybody is getting ready for a big wedding in a small town in Spain. Most of the guests don’t have far to travel, but Laura (Penélope Cruz) has come from Argentina with her two children. It’s a big deal. Laura — whose husband, Alejandro (Ricardo Darín), wasn’t able to make the trip — hasn’t been home in years. She and the kids arrive with a flurry of abrazos and exclamations, and the viewer is plunged into the warmth and chaos of it all. It takes a few scenes to figure out who is who in the family. If this movie were the old-fashioned novel it sometimes resembles, there would be a family tree printed on the endpapers. But like a peripheral guest at the party, you look and listen and learn what you need to, an exercise that disciplines your attention for the intricate story you suspect is coming. The kinship chart falls into place before your eyes. The bride and groom are Ana (Inma Cuesta), Laura’s sister, and Joan (Roger Casamajor), a nice guy from somewhere else. Other relatives run the hotel where the festivities are taking place. Not everyone is kin, though. Bea (Bárbara Lennie) and Paco live on a nearby wine-producing estate, tending vineyards that used to belong to Laura and her family. There is also some history between Laura and Paco, who is played by Javier Bardem, Cruz’s real-life husband. Their two characters used to be lovers, which might raise a newcomer’s eyebrows but is one of the things that, well, everybody knows. This is one of those movies in which the title is said aloud by a character — more than once. (On the other hand, the titular Leonard Cohen song remains unsung.) Mr. Farhadi’s intention is to investigate the way secrets bind and divide the people who share them. The plot turns several times on mistaken assumptions about what is and isn’t common knowledge, and on the disruptive, destructive power of unspoken grudges and half-buried memories. At first, “Everybody Knows” unfolds in a hectic, half-comic vein, with hints of melodrama, mischief and misbehavior. You know something will go wrong, and you surmise it might involve Laura’s 16-year-old daughter, Irene (Carla Campra), who is impulsive and, like many teenagers, a bit of a boundary-tester. She flirts, she drinks, she sneaks up to the top of the church tower and moves the hands on the clock — and then, all of a sudden, she’s gone. A pile of clippings relating to an earlier kidnapping in the region is left on her bed, and a ransom demand is texted to both Laura and Bea’s phones. Farhadi’s choreography of the shift from rowdy celebration to frantic desperation is the most effective part of the movie, and he keeps the suspense going on several fronts. Everybody wants to know what happened — and what will happen — to Irene, but the answer to that question requires the unraveling of other, earlier mysteries having to do with sex, money and honor. One of the director’s earlier movies is called “The Past” — his others include “A Separation” and “The Salesman,” both foreign-language Oscar winners — and the non-pastness of the past remains for him both a central theme and a structural principle. It’s not only that people’s long-ago actions have a way of catching up with them, but that the invisible or unacknowledged consequences of those actions haunt the present like ghosts. What makes “Everybody Knows” so intensely watchable is the urge to see what shape those specters will take when they finally appear. Farhadi is an excellent screenwriter and an impressive handler of actors, but the film nonetheless adds up to less than the sum of its parts. The high emotional temperature of the performances can’t quite disguise the mechanical nature of the story — it’s at once over-plotted and flimsy, a welter of reversals and revelations that don’t so much resolve as collapse. Until that happens, there is much pleasure and interest to be gotten from Cruz, Bardem and Darín, and from their less well-known but no less skilled colleagues. But the movie, which wants to be devastating, is merely satisfying.

2019,‘Everyone Danced in France’: A Baroque Bourrée Comes to BAM,"“A week ago I was dancing a bourrée,” the conductor William Christie said over the phone from Paris, where his baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, is based. “A group of us sang a little song around the fire, and we all danced.” This impromptu dance erupted at the inauguration of a 17th-century fireplace in a house in the Loire that’s part of a complex where the Fondation Les Arts Florissants now resides. But it could almost describe a moment in the program his ensemble is bringing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week under the title “Rameau, Maître à Danser.” These works, too, were written to celebrate happy events — in one case, the birth of a king — and involved singing and dancing, in equal measure. The French court loved to dance, a passion that can be traced to Louis XIV, an avid dancer and a supporter of the creation of the Royal Academy of Dance, where the basic positions and movements of ballet were first codified. “Everyone danced in France,” the Baroque dance specialist Catherine Turocy said in a phone interview from her home in Dallas. “The singers danced, the dancers sang, and everyone played instruments. In that sense it was more like today’s musical theater.” All the 17th- and 18th-century French opera forms included dance, from the solemn tragédie lyrique to the lighter opera-ballets, the loose genre to which the works of “Rameau, Maître à Danser” belong. “Daphnis et Eglé” and “La Naissance d’Osiris” were composed for the court of Louis XV, to be performed at the palace of Fontainebleau, where the royal family (and much of the aristocracy) retired each fall in to enjoy the hunt. The two operas were performed in successive seasons — 1753 and 1754 — and seldom since, which is why Mr. Christie decided to revive them in 2014, on the 250th anniversary of the composer’s death. (The Brooklyn Academy’s production is the show’s American premiere.) Each about 45 minutes long, neither of the two works would have taxed the attention of the aristocratic audience with complicated plots or deep subjects. “The plots are essentially nonexistent,” Mr. Christie said. “It’s just exquisitely beautiful music, tender and melancholy, and fabulous for dancing.” There is just a whisper of a plot or, more accurately, a dramatic situation. In “Daphnis et Églé” (1753), a shepherd and a shepherdess approach the Temple of Friendship, only to be turned away, because, as Cupid points out to them, they are actually in love. In “Osiris,” shepherds and shepherdesses (notice a theme) await the birth of the god Osiris. (The piece, called a “ballet allégorique,” was meant to echo the birth of the future Louis XVI.) “It was my idea to make the two works into one story,” the director, Sophie Daneman explained from London, where she lives. “I thought, gosh, they’re very similar: They’re both incredibly pastoral, and in that sense, very human.” While the musical values of the Arts Florissants ensemble are faithful to what is known of the historical style, the dancing, like the staging, is more fluid. “There are elements and suggestions of period style,” Mr. Christie said, “but this has nothing to do with pure period staging.” Ms. Daneman noted that Mr. Christie “doesn’t have a strong philosophy on whether something should be ‘authentic.’ He’s more interested in authenticity of spirit.” In this spirit, the dances are not meant to replicate Baroque styles, though they do make reference to their vocabulary of small jumps, elegant footwork and decorative wrists. Originally choreographed by Françoise Denieau, who died in 2015, the dances are being restaged for this run by her assistant, Gilles Poirier. “For the most part,” Mr. Poirier said from Paris, Ms. Denieau “wanted to use a slightly later style of dance, closer to Noverre,” the ballet master who taught Marie Antoinette and Antoine Bournonville, the father of the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. She even included a moment that is closer to something like contemporary dance, using expansive and stylized gestures that Noverre could not have imagined. “Françoise wanted that part to be in a style that was more undefined,” Mr. Poirier said, “neither classical nor contemporary” as a way to evoke timelessness. In Ms. Daneman’s reimagined staging, the dancers and singers occupy the same world, taking turns at the center of the action. There are times when the dancers and singers interact, communicating through shared glances or touch. Mr. Christie conducts the ensemble of period instruments from the back of the stage, close to the singers and dancers. At one point, a musician becomes part of the action: A French bagpipe player slowly traverses the stage, surrounded by the entire cast. This leads into the final number, a contredanse, the French version of English country dancing. The dancers and singers form concentric circles, executing simple steps, weaving in and out. As in Mr. Christie’s celebratory bourrée by the fireside, everybody dances. Everybody sings. An earlier version of this article misstated who studied dance with Jean-Georges Noverre. He taught Antoine Bournonville, not August Bournonville, Antoine’s son.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Everyone Here Knows Trump Hates Brown People’,"Instead of fanning fear, the president should listen to people on both sides of the border. Opinion Columnist EL PASO — I have a suggestion for President Trump. Instead of fanning fear during your visit to this city on Monday night, stroll across the Paso del Norte Bridge into Ciudad Júarez. Join the 70,000 people crossing four bridges who daily form the human tissue linking the United States and Mexico. They work, they study, they eat, they shop, all part of what Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, calls “one region, one culture.” I crossed the bridge. Things slow down, as they do when you move from the developed to the developing world. Secondhand clothes for sale hang on simple brightly painted homes, the poorest made of pallets and corrugated iron roofs. Júarez, home to many of the foreign-owned assembly plants known as “maquiladoras,” has a violent history and big social problems, but in the dusty streets and cafes serving steaming bowls of tripe-and-bean soup I discerned no tension. “It’s simple,” Julián Cardona, a photographer, told me. “Everyone here knows Trump hates brown people. We call him ‘Trompudo,’ or ‘big mouth.’” From that mouth seeps the sinister specter of an “invasion.” Thousands of active-duty troops are dispatched to the border. Concertina wire spreads. The government shutdown that ended on Jan. 25 could be followed soon by Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build his wall. Presidential powers include the power to manufacture a threat where none exists. “From my vantage point in El Paso there is no crisis,” Margo, the mayor, told me. “You look south and you can’t tell where El Paso merges into Júarez.” Bridges, in other words, trump walls. At one of the shelters run by the nonprofit Annunciation House, I met Iris Galindo Maldonado, an undocumented 43-year-old woman from Guerrero State, in southwestern Mexico, who entered the United States on Jan. 15 with her 10-year-old daughter to request asylum. Her husband was killed seven years ago by drug dealers angered by his refusal to cooperate with them. She said they have threatened her in turn for refusing to help them smuggle cocaine. “I’ve already lived,” she told me. “I hope the American authorities support me for my daughter, so she’s not in danger, she’s not menaced, and gets educated. I told her, even if we stay one week, two weeks, however long it is, use the opportunity to learn English. She’s already in school, and I pray to God a lot.” Galindo, aged 43, has been processed by ICE, fitted with an ankle bracelet, and let go to face a long wait in American limbo, along with several hundred thousand others, before her day in immigration court. She has no family in the United States. “Trump calls us killers, delinquents and drug dealers,” she told me. “In fact that is exactly what we are fleeing from!” Annunciation House took her in. Ruben Garcia, the director of the organization, says he is finding beds these days for more than 2,000 people a week. If nothing else, Trump’s rhetoric and policy swerves have helped feed chaos. “For Trump, to be a refugee is to be a murderer and a rapist,” Garcia told me. “This is what he ran on. He has a can of paint filled with a certain ideology and paints everything with it. To supporters of the wall, I ask: Is it time to take down the Statue of Liberty?” Representative Veronica Escobar, the successor to Beto O’Rourke, now a possible Democratic presidential candidate, took me down to the spot, near a stretch of existing wall, where border agents detained an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, in December. He later died in United States custody. The spot is over the Rio Grande, in the United States, but just short of the wall, raising the question of the barrier’s usefulness. That is a question the president has refused to address with any seriousness. His wall is much less about security than macho symbolism — “a monument to bigotry,” in Escobar’s words. I got talking to an agent who stopped us as we stepped south of the wall. He said agents in that area detained “300 bodies a day.” He said the “bodies” were jumping the line. He said by the time their cases came before an immigration judge, “the bodies are somewhere else so they get to stay.” So, he concluded, “we really have no authority to enforce the law.” Bodies, I noted, is a term generally used for dead people. Would it not be better to call them people or human beings, as this is what they are? The agent said he didn’t mean that they are dead, but that “bodies” was the favored term. I was subsequently advised not to read too much into this “law enforcement vernacular.” Border agents are under a lot of pressure. Their gestures of humanity — a birthday cake, a soccer ball — tend to go unrecorded. Still, if you talk about bodies you are liable to see bodies: that is to say, people stripped of their humanity, their agonizing choices, their humble ambitions and their hopes. It is then easier to treat them with callous harshness, to forget what we Americans are and where we came from. When I walked back across the bridge, a United States passport control officer pored over my passport for several minutes: the Iranian visa, the Iraqi visa, the Chinese visa, the Indian visa. She asked what I do, whether I’d crossed the bridge before, why I’d entered Mexico. She was hostile. “This guy’s from The New York Times,” she said, turning to the agent next to her. “What should I do with him?” He looked me over. “Let him go,” he said. I thanked her for the warm welcome home. “Just doing my job,” she said. Trump’s rhetoric is not innocuous. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘Executing Babies’: Here Are the Facts Behind Trump’s Misleading Abortion Tweet,"Infants are rarely born alive after abortion procedures, and if they are, doctors do not kill them. The latest battle in the nation’s continuing war over abortion involves a federal bill called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Senate Democrats this week blocked the bill from reaching a vote, and President Trump responded with an angry tweet. The bill would require doctors to use all means available to save the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. They must, it says, “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child” as they would for “any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” Senator Ben Sasse, the Nebraska Republican who is the author of the bill, had called it an “infanticide ban.” Opponents said that the bill was aimed at discouraging doctors from performing legal abortions and that it was unnecessary because a similar law already exists, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002. It hardly ever happens, according to Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. He performs abortions and is a spokesman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, where he leads a committee on health care for underserved women. A healthy fetus becomes viable — potentially able to survive outside the womb — at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions in the United States in 2015 were performed in or after the 21st week of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Less than 1 percent of all abortions are done after 24 weeks, and many are performed because the fetus has a fatal condition or the pregnant woman’s life or health is at severe risk. If an abortion is performed at 20 weeks or later, a drug may be injected to stop the fetal heartbeat before the fetus comes out of the womb, Dr. Grossman said. In other cases, suction devices and other instruments end the fetus’s life before it is removed, he said. Dr. Grossman said there were painful situations in which the fetus might be at the edge of viability and labor must be induced to save the mother’s life. For instance, a condition called pre-eclampsia, involving high blood pressure and other problems, can kill both mother and fetus, and in most cases the only treatment is to deliver the baby. If it seems unlikely that the baby will survive, the family may choose to provide just comfort care — wrapping and cuddling the baby — and allow the child to die naturally without extreme attempts at resuscitation. The bill would force doctors to resuscitate such an infant, even if the parents did not want those measures, said Dr. Jennifer Conti, an obstetrician gynecologist who is a fellow of Physicians for Reproductive Health, an advocacy group. Doctors who violated the law would be subject to criminal penalties, as would anyone who saw the violation and failed to report it, she said. Dr. Grossman said that medically, every case was different. “There isn’t a bright line,” he said. “No one could say we would always do this at one gestational age, and do something else at another gestational age. It depends on whether the fetus is already compromised.” Dr. Conti, a clinical assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University, who also performs abortions, said a patient recently had an abortion at 23 weeks because the fetus had severe abnormalities that were considered incompatible with life. The woman chose not to have the injection to stop the fetal heartbeat, preferring that her fetus die a natural death. The death occurred during the procedure, before the fetus left the womb, Dr. Conti said. Had it not, she added, comfort care would have been provided.

2019,‘Extra’ Host A.J. Calloway Suspended Following Sexual Assault Allegations,"A.J. Calloway, a host on the entertainment news show “Extra,” was suspended by Warner Bros. on Saturday amid a growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct. In June, The Hollywood Reporter published the account of Sil Lai Abrams, a writer and domestic violence awareness activist, who said Mr. Calloway had groped her breast and exposed himself to her in his car in 2006. She said he tried to force her head onto his lap and later masturbated after placing her hand on his lap. Then in January, The Daily Beast published the accounts of two unnamed women who said that Mr. Calloway had also sexually assaulted them. One of the women said Mr. Calloway had lain on top of her after a party at his home and repeatedly tried to open her blouse and pull down her skirt. She said he tried to place her hand on him while he masturbated. On Saturday, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Mr. Calloway had been suspended as it was preparing to publish more allegations against him. “In light of additional allegations brought to our attention, we are expanding our ongoing inquiries, and Mr. Calloway has been suspended pending further review,” Warner Bros. said in a statement. Mr. Calloway could not be reached for comment Saturday. His lawyer, Lisa E. Davis, said in an email that the “unsubstantiated allegations are patently false.” “He vehemently denies ever having assaulted anyone and looks forward to clearing his name,” Ms. Davis said. Mr. Calloway has been with “Extra” since 2005, and has focused on interviewing celebrities around New York City. He had gained fame as the host of the BET music video show “106 & Park,” where he began his television career. Warner Bros. said that when it first became aware of the sexual misconduct allegations, it had investigated whether “there had been any misconduct by Mr. Calloway on ‘Extra’ and whether any employee of the show had been the victim of any such misconduct.” The company said that as of Saturday, it had not found evidence of workplace misconduct by Mr. Calloway. It was unclear how Warner Bros. had expanded its inquiries. Ms. Abrams said in an interview on Saturday that the company’s response was insufficient, and that it appeared to focus on Mr. Calloway’s actions in the workplace, instead of his conduct outside of it. “It shouldn’t take multiple accusations of women going on the record for a company to launch an investigation into the actions of one of their employees,” Ms. Abrams said. She said the company should have acted sooner, especially after her account was published in June. Mr. Calloway was arrested after the police investigated Ms. Abrams’s 2006 allegation, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which said the case was later dismissed on “procedural grounds.” One of the latest accusers also filed a complaint with the West Orange Police Department in New Jersey, according to The Daily Beast. James P. Abbott, the chief of the department, said Saturday that it had received a complaint of aggravated sexual assault on Dec. 24, but he declined to answer further questions about what he called an “ongoing investigation.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Fairview’ Will Return to the New York Stage,"After a successful run at the 73-seat Soho Rep theater last summer, Jackie Sibblies Drury’s acclaimed play “Fairview” will return to challenge audiences in a bigger space this June. The play, which both chief theater critics for The New York Times named among the year’s top 10 productions, will be remounted at Theater for a New Audience’s Polonsky Shakespeare Center, in Brooklyn, from June 2 to June 30. The return engagement marks the second time that the Polonsky’s 299-seat main stage has hosted a play that originated at Soho Rep, following “An Octoroon,” Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s formally inventive comedy about race and American history, which ran at the Polonsky in 2015. On its face, “Fairview” is about an extended black family preparing for an important dinner. The tone starts off light and the plot stays within the confines of a family comedy. But as the play progresses, the mood shifts and the assumptions it invites are turned on their heads. “You begin watching by feeling mildly amused, then uneasy, then annoyed, then unsettled,” Ben Brantley wrote in his review for the Times. “And then abruptly you’re free-falling down a rabbit hole, and there’s no safe landing in sight.” “Fairview,” which was directed by Sarah Benson, Soho Rep’s artistic director, was extended three times there. The play moved to Berkeley Repertory Theater, which co-commissioned it, in October. Casting for the new production has not been announced. But the play’s much-discussed staging will be retained and adapted for the Polonsky, according to a publicist for the show. Ms. Drury’s new play, “Marys Seacole,” begins previews at Lincoln Center Theater on Feb. 9.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Fighting With My Family’ Review: They Body Slam You, Your Mum and Dad. Lovingly.","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The brood in “Fighting With My Family” is a rambunctious crowd. There’s mum and dad Knight, and a handful of adult kids (one’s doing time). Professional wrestlers all, they grapple with one another in and out of the ring while running a gym in Norwich, England. They know how to put on a good show, how to turn the mat into a stage with thumps and grunts, stomps and smashes. The family that smacks down together stays together, or at least that’s the idea in this charmer about love and choreographed war. The writer-director Stephen Merchant plunges into the domestic fray straightway, opening with a peek at the Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson, living the dream on the Knights’ television. Johnson is one of the movie’s producers as well as one of the story’s leading talismans, the embodiment of the Knight family ideal. A poster of him from his title glory days hangs in the bedroom of the family’s daughter, Paige (Florence Pugh), who’s been wrestling since she was a young teenager. Alongside her older brother Zak (Jack Lowden), Paige is carrying on a tradition begun by her parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), who found salvation both in each other and inside the ring. Like all genre movies, sports stories tend to cling to a familiar template, one involving struggle, tears, heart, soul and triumph — cue the cheering crowd. “Fighting With My Family” isn’t much different, which is extremely and shrewdly on point for a movie about professional wrestlers with bigger-than-life personalities and flamboyant stage names who, in a circumscribed space, deliver precisely coordinated, rule-bound narratives of victory, agony and defeat. Like genre cinema, professional wrestling strikes a balance between convention and innovation, between what the crowd knows (expects) and the surprises, the little deviations from the usual script, that can drive it to its feet. Much of the movie turns on a sibling rivalry that upends and nearly rends the family when Paige, selected at an audition for World Wrestling Entertainment, is shipped off to a Florida boot camp. (W.W.E. Studios helped make the movie.) While Paige — a Goth girl with a heavy curtain of jet-black hair — struggles to fit into the competition, where the tanned and the blond rule, often in bikinis, Zak licks his wounds at home, trying and generally failing to deal with disappointment. As Merchant toggles between Zak in Norwich and Paige in Florida, he settles into a familiar struggle between authenticity and artificiality, a seemingly odd divide on which to hang a tale of professional wrestlers. If it works, it’s partly because of the easy allure of authenticity narratives, even the most contrived. Paige considers the other female competitors suspiciously, unwittingly condescending to them because she doesn’t view them as real wrestlers. For Paige, her authenticity is a given, even if her professional persona — which changes along with her wrestling name — is a construct. Merchant gently plays with this idea, mostly to fill in the story as she progresses from obliviousness to self-knowledge and the inevitable third-act clinch. (The genesis of the movie is an entertaining, more open-ended Channel 4 television documentary about the Knights, “The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family.”) Merchant is probably best known for the original British version of “The Office,” which he helped create. He doesn’t do much with the camera in “Fighting With My Family,” which has a filmmaking style that’s best described as functional. But he has a terrific cast (including Vince Vaughn as a coach), pinpoint timing and a gift for visual japes and physical comedy, for arranging bodies in funny formations and for underlining everyday absurdity. Merchant also has a sense of flow. Even when the jokes are as blunt as the bowling ball that Ricky delivers to another wrestler’s groin — they’re testing out a dubious routine — they just slide into the story, becoming part of its textured realism Like its amiable, irresistible ménage, “Fighting With My Family” softens its rougher edges with humor. It’s often broadly funny but never mean or patronizing; it takes the Knights, their eccentricities and quixotic aspirations seriously, but not enough to squelch the fun. At times, particularly when the family is in its element at its gym (a.k.a. World Association of Wrestling, a.k.a. W.A.W.), which does double-time as a refuge for young neighborhood strays, the movie evokes the working-class milieu familiar from British filmmakers like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. Merchant doesn’t seem keen to score political points, but he nevertheless quietly delivers some truths amid the laughter and hurt.

2019,"‘Friendly Fire’ Killing of Detective: 42 Shots, 7 Officers, 11 Seconds","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The call came in just after dark on Tuesday — a masked man with a gun was robbing a T-Mobile store in Queens, holding two employees in a back room. Within minutes, the first police officers arrived, and two officers and a sergeant ran inside, officials said. More officers pulled up outside, and still more. The man in the store advanced quickly toward the officers inside, pistol raised. They retreated out of the store. Then everything went wrong. Seven officers opened fire toward the store — a total of 42 shots within 11 seconds, the police said. “It goes from zero to 60,” said Chief Terence Monahan, the Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed officer. When the barrage of gunfire ended, two men lay bleeding on the sidewalk outside the store. Neither was the robber. They were brother officers, struck in a crossfire of police bullets. One of them, a veteran detective, Brian Simonsen, died from his wounds. A sergeant was hit nearby — “I’m shot,” he said into his radio. “Perp’s still in location.” The man in the store was wounded and quickly arrested. In a final, terrible twist, the gun he had carried turned out to be fake, the police said. Lethal in appearance, but harmless. [Citing the detective’s death, Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled a political trip to New Hampshire. ] Those 11 seconds of blind confusion will be parsed in the days and weeks ahead, as the police do an internal investigation to learn how such a chain of events could occur and how a recurrence could someday be prevented. Detective Simonsen, 42, a 19-year veteran, was fatally shot in the chest, the police commissioner said. He was the first New York City police officer to be killed in the line of duty since July 2017. The sergeant who was struck, Matthew Gorman, 34, underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to his hip and was expected to recover. The robbery suspect was identified as Christopher Ransom, 27, of Brooklyn, who has history of prior arrests for minor crimes and whom the police were seeking in connection with a cellphone store robbery in January. He was shot eight times, the police said, and was in stable condition at New York Hospital Queens. He was charged with murder and robbery. New details released on Wednesday gave some shape to the confusing initial accounts of the chaotic event. Details of fatal police shootings in New York City can be slow to emerge in the initial 24 hours, in part because police investigators do not typically interview the officers who have discharged their weapons right away for legal reasons related to the Fifth Amendment. Instead, investigators begin by gathering the accounts of officers who were present but did not open fire. The police in the area heard the call from a dispatcher shortly after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, relating a bystander’s account of a man with a gun in the T-Mobile store forcing two employees into a back room. A parade of officers responded on their own radios to say they were en route: “Show me going,” they said, according to a recording of the radio dispatches on Broadcastify. The dispatcher responded with the standard police directive to drive safely: “Arrive alive,” and added, “No sirens, guys.” Detective Simonsen and his boss, Sergeant Gorman, were among the first to reach the store, both in plain clothes, along with some uniformed officers. Sergeant Gorman and two uniformed officers entered the store at about 6:12 p.m., Deputy Chief Kevin Maloney of the Force Investigation Division, which investigates all police shootings, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Mr. Ransom emerged from a back room and raised the imitation pistol, walking toward them, Chief Maloney said. The three officers retreated outside, and Mr. Ransom walked to the store’s front door. He made motions as if he were firing the gun at the officers outside the store. Seven officers opened fire. Detective Simonsen fired twice, and Sergeant Gorman, 11 times, the police said. Five other officers fired 29 shots among them. “Shots fired! Shots fired!” an officer shouts, his voice cracking, according to the recording of radio traffic. Dozens of gunshots ring out in the background. “We don’t know at this point who shot who,” Chief Monahan said. Detective Simonsen, who was struck once in the chest, was not wearing a bulletproof vest. He and Sergeant Gorman had been staking out a house nearby as part of a robbery investigation when they responded to the call, law enforcement officials said. “It’s not uncommon for detectives to go out without a vest, especially when they don’t anticipate an apprehension or don’t have a planned apprehension,” said Michael Palladino, the president of the Detective’s Endowment Association. “You don’t expect to get involved to that degree.” The police have viewed footage from the body cameras worn by five of the officers at the shooting, as well as surveillance video from cameras in and around the store, Deputy Chief Maloney said. Officers rushed Detective Simonsen to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in a squad car. “The trauma staff did their best to try to save him,” Commissioner James P. O’Neill said from the hospital on Tuesday night. “We thank them for that. They were unable to do so, however.” A passing civilian drove Sergeant Gorman to the same hospital. Mr. Ransom went to bizarre lengths in recent years to gain special access to the Brooklyn criminal courthouse. In 2013, he was charged with forging a letter from Kingsborough Community College to obtain an internship at the court, a criminal complaint said. He was later caught in a judge’s chambers, where he did not have permission to be. An order of protection forbade him from approaching two judges in the building — an order he violated later that same year, court records show. Mr. Ransom had always had a fascination with law enforcement, friends said. He had wanted to be a police officer since he was a boy, said one friend, Frank Rios. “But he couldn’t,” Mr. Rios said, “on account of being autistic.” Mr. Ransom’s Facebook account contained several pictures of himself dressed like a police officer or an F.B.I. agent. In 2016, Mr. Ransom was arrested after using a fake badge and uniform to try to enter the 77th Precinct station house. And in a Facebook video, someone filmed Mr. Ransom, shirtless and wearing a red cape, approaching a police station house and greeting officers, thanking them for their service. He said he was a superhero. “I just want to save people’s lives,” he said. Detective Simonsen was a deeply familiar face in the 102nd Precinct. He spent his entire career there. He knew the neighbors and local businesses. He was a regular at the bodega near the precinct, where he chatted with employees and insisted on paying for his daily bottle of water. Described by a family member as “a classic guy’s guy,” Detective Simonsen loved sports — especially New York ones — and was known as the life of the party in his large, but tight-knit community in Riverhead in Long Island. “I can genuinely say he was the nicest, kindest person I’ve ever met in my entire life,” Terry Legrady, a neighbor and former patrol partner, said. Detective Simonsen represented his colleagues as a union delegate. For that reason, he should not even have been at work on Tuesday evening: Mr. Palladino said the detective had attended a delegate meeting that morning, which excused him from his shift. He showed up anyway, eager to work on a robbery pattern with his sergeant. “This was a guy who loved that community. This was his life. He loved the 102nd Precinct,” Chief Monahan said. “He loved the people of that community. He loved the cops of that community.” As part of the departmental review, the tactics used in the shooting will be examined. The positioning of two groups of officers on opposing sides of the store entrance will almost certainly be looked at with a critical eye. “You want to avoid that crossfire situation,” Chief Monahan said. It remains unclear whose bullet killed Detective Simonsen. The officers involved in the incident are said to be distraught. “They’re all going through a lot of emotional distress,” said Chief Monahan. “This is the worst thing you could go through as a Police Department.”",The New York Times

2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8: Here’s What We Know,"Game of Thrones This article contains spoilers for Seasons 1-7 of “Game of Thrones.” It’s been 541 days since “Game of Thrones” last aired a new episode. That was the cataclysmic Season 7 finale, which both demonstrated the annihilative power of a zombie ice dragon and finally paired the two most attractive people in the story, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington), not long after revealing that they are apparently aunt and nephew. (Other things happened, too.) Our long “Thrones”-less night will end April 14, when the eighth and final season of HBO’s biggest ever hit finally kicks off.

All are welcome! And while we’re here, here’s a brief rundown of everything we know about Season 8 so far: Monumentalism has always been a key component of a show that began with a giant sword beheading a deserter and most recently saw a zombie dragon destroying a leviathan Wall. But this season will be even bigger, with six nearly feature length episodes and some of the largest, most complex sequences ever filmed for television. The final clash between the heroes and the undead White Walkers, in particular, took many weeks to film, including 55 nights of outdoor shooting. That episode was overseen by the veteran “Thrones” director Miguel Sapochnik, whose previous episodes like “Hardhome” and “Battle of the Bastards” featured some of the show’s most dazzling action scenes. But the new one “makes the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park,” Peter Dinklage told Entertainment Weekly. And that’s presumably before the show even gets to the final clash to determine who actually wins this whole, you know, game of thrones. [Ahead of season 8 of “Game of Thrones,” relive it all with our ultimate watching guide, including episode recaps and deep plot dives.] Some of the more enjoyable scenes of the occasionally lackluster Season 7 came when the far-flung characters we’ve been watching for years finally met, or were reunited. Jon and Daenerys, of course, but also Cersei and Daenerys. Jaime and Daenerys. Arya and Sansa. The Clegane boys. As one might expect, battles between the living and the dead inspire new partnerships. A teaser scene released by HBO shows Sansa offering the Stark stronghold, Winterfell, to Daenerys, although Sansa doesn’t seem particularly thrilled about it. According to EW, the season premiere opens at Winterfell and calls back to the show’s pilot, with Daenerys and her army arriving at the castle much as King Robert’s procession did in the beginning. Eagle-eyed fans also noticed Jaime Lannister, last seen finally leaving his toxic sister, Cersei, sporting the armor of the North (Stark country) in a photo released by HBO. Casey Bloys, HBO’s programming president, has said that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators of “Game of Thrones,” have ended the show in a way that is both dramatically and emotionally satisfying. But what else would he say? More interesting were remarks last year from Sophie Turner, who plays the Stark daughter Sansa. In an interview with IGN, she said that the ending would probably divide viewers. “I think a lot of fans will be disappointed and a lot of fans will be over the moon,” she said. This jibes with what George R.R. Martin, the godhead of the “Thrones” universe, has suggested, which is that the end of the saga will be bittersweet. “I don’t know that I, as a writer, really believe in the conventional, clichéd happy ending, where everything is resolved and the good guy wins and the bad guy loses,” Martin said at a book fair in 2016. “We very seldom see that in real life or in history, and I don’t find it as emotionally satisfying myself as what I like to call the bittersweet ending.” Fan theories abound about, well, everything involved in this show. And a fringe-y but persistent one holds that the show’s ur-bad guy, the undead Night King, will be the one who ultimately sits on the Iron Throne. That seems less “bittersweet” than “nutty and unlikely.” But so did plenty of other things that eventually transpired on “Game of Thrones,” so who knows? Well, this part of the story will end. But given the show’s extraordinary — and extraordinarily profitable — success, we’ve most likely only just begun exploring the “Thrones” universe. This summer, HBO will begin shooting a prequel pilot written by Jane Goldman and Martin, set thousands of years before the events of “Game of Thrones” and starring Naomi Watts, among others. HBO has yet to confirm that the pilot will be turned into another series. But AT&T didn’t buy HBO’s parent company, Time Warner, only to let one of its most valuable pieces of intellectual property go dormant. Martin and Goldman’s concept was one of several prequel pilots HBO developed, and the network hasn’t ruled out moving forward on one or more of the others. “It’s an incredibly rich world that George has created,” Bloys told Deadline recently. “So, I think we’d be crazy not to take a shot.” So while winter is finally here, this game will be on, in some form, for the foreseeable future.",The New York Times
2019,‘Gay Muslim’ Comic Strip Vanishes After Indonesia Calls It Pornographic,"HONG KONG — An Instagram account featuring a comic strip with gay Muslim characters disappeared on Wednesday, days after Indonesian officials threatened to block the entire social media platform in the country because of an uproar over the comic’s content. The episode is the latest flash point in a slow-burning battle over morality and civil rights in Indonesia, a Muslim-majority nation. Even as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the country assert themselves, others support an ascendant Islamic movement that has embraced some homophobic policies and portrayed L.G.B.T. people as a threat to national harmony. The Instagram account, @Alpantuni, first appeared in January with the tagline “Gay Muslim comics for people who are able to think.” Its Indonesian-language comics addressed gay identity and religious bigotry, and depicted men with their shirts off and in bed together, though never fully nude. The account prompted a flurry of criticism on social media in the country, with some accusing the artist of pornography or blasphemy. “God created humans as man and woman, a couple, and there is no third sex,” Muhyiddin Junaidi, a representative of the Council of Ulemas, a quasi-governmental body of Muslim scholars, said in a telephone interview. “For us, being L.G.B.T. is a psychological illness that needs to be cured, and this comic is promoting it,” he added. “That will ruin the people’s faith in the long term.” Indonesia’s Information Ministry sent Instagram a letter on Feb. 2 asking the company to remove the account, arguing that it violated an Indonesian law on distributing pornography, said Ferdinandus Setu, a ministry spokesman. He said the ministry had also threatened to shut Instagram down in Indonesia if it did not comply with the request. Mr. Setu said that the post was removed early on Wednesday and that Instagram had taken down an account with a nearly identical name a few weeks earlier, at the ministry’s request. But Instagram said on Wednesday that it had decided not remove the @Alpantuni account, which had nearly 6,000 followers, after determining that it had not violated the company’s “community guidelines.” “There are a number of other reasons why an account may no longer be accessible, including, for example, if the account holder deleted the account, deactivated the account or changed the account user name,” said Ching Yee Wong, the company’s head of Asia-Pacific communications. Instagram did not respond to a question about whether it had previously taken down accounts with similar names, and the owner of the @Alpantuni account could not be reached for comment. There was speculation that the account might be based in nearby Malaysia. Among other suggestions, Instagram’s community guidelines instruct users to refrain from posting nudity and to “always follow the law.” The company said on Wednesday that people should report Instagram content that violates the guidelines or “makes them feel uncomfortable.” News of the ministry’s letter to Instagram was first reported in English on Tuesday by Coconuts Jakarta, a branch of a news outlet that covers parts of Southeast Asia. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has an ethnically diverse population of 260 million people, about 90 percent of them Muslim. A longstanding — if grudging — tolerance for homosexuality in the country began to erode in 2016, when the authorities, under pressure from right-wing Islamic groups, began arresting gay men in record numbers. In 2017, two men accused of having sex with each other in Aceh, a semiautonomous Indonesian province that has imposed a strict version of Shariah law, were sentenced to 85 lashes in public. And last year, a town in West Sumatra Province passed a law criminalizing what it called “immoral acts” between same sex-couples and prohibited residents from cross-dressing. The recent spike in such legislation may reflect a growing recognition by some Indonesian politicians that they can win popular support by appealing to hard-line Islamic sentiment. The country is preparing for a presidential election in April, and some fear a return of the sectarian intolerance that marred the last such vote in 2014. As of Wednesday afternoon, the @Alpantuni site was dormant, but other Instagram users were reposting its comics. Some characters in the comics are criticized by others as “stupid,” “uncivilized” and “godless” for being gay. The Coconuts report said that the comments on the strip’s Instagram account were “overwhelmingly hateful (and a pretty accurate reflection of the L.G.B.T. haters depicted in the comic itself).” One critic wrote, “If you want to be a Muslim, don’t be gay.” “It’s your right to be godless, but do not be both Muslim and gay,” wrote another. “That is just greedy.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Giant Little Ones’ Review: The Turmoil of Teenage Sexuality,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The most significant turning point in the coming-of-age drama “Giant Little Ones” comes in the privacy of night, when only sounds provide a clue about the sex happening beneath the blankets. Like the film itself, the moment grants dignity to a familiar youthful curiosity. The boys in this shrouded bedroom are high school best friends, Franky and Ballas. Ballas (Darren Mann) is the bolder of the two — a little more handsome, a little more crass and allegedly a lot more sexually experienced. Though Ballas is an ace of heterosexual braggadocio, on the night of Franky’s birthday, he performs oral sex on Franky in the dark. Franky speaks, and Ballas runs away. This act of experimentation has momentous impact. In the cold light of day, Franky (Josh Wiggins) and Ballas turn on each other. Ballas spreads the rumor that Franky initiated their encounter, and Franky is left to fend for himself. “Giant Little Ones” features strong performances, particularly from Kyle MacLachlan as Franky’s openly gay father. The writer and director, Keith Behrman, attractively lights and films his characters, who speak in refreshingly unadorned dialogue. But when the plot fixates on suburban angst, Behrman risks staleness with well-worn tropes like the closeted jock or the homophobic school bully. The film’s saving grace turns out to be the range of experiences that Franky and Ballas are allowed to explore. As they provoke each other, they also carry out ardent relationships with girls, and they each have friends and family members who are gay or who experiment with gender. Where many coming-of-age films build their stories around the discovery of a fixed selfhood, “Giant Little Ones” succeeds when it chooses to treat youthful identity as open to shift with accumulated experience.

2019,‘Greta’ Review: Isabelle Huppert as Sweet Surrogate Mom Turned Psycho Stalker,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. If you see a suspicious package or activity on the train or the platform, please tell a police officer or an M.T.A. employee. What New York subway rider doesn’t know that? A young woman named Frances McCullen — a recent transplant from Boston, as if that’s an excuse — who finds an expensive-looking handbag on the Lexington Avenue local and pays dearly for ignoring mass transit protocol. “Greta,” the movie about what happens to Frankie (as she’s called), can stand as a cautionary tale for straphangers. If you see something, say something. Having seen it, I will say that “Greta,” directed by the always-estimable Neil Jordan (“The Crying Game,” “Michael Collins,” “The End of the Affair”), is a mixed bag, a skillfully executed psychological thriller with not quite enough in the way of psychology or thrills to be as disturbing or diverting as it should be. And maybe not enough Isabelle Huppert, either, though she is the major and almost sufficient reason to bother with the film in the first place. Huppert plays Greta Hideg, the owner of that purse and a bunch more like it, accessories that she uses to lure young women like Frankie to her house in Brooklyn. Frankie (Chloë Grace Moretz), whose mother has recently died and who is semi-estranged from her father (Colm Feore), finds in the older woman a mirror for her own loneliness. Greta has lost a husband and a dog, and misses her daughter, who she says is off in Paris studying music. Greta’s empty nest is filled with Chopin and Liszt and strange noises from behind the piano, and she and Frankie strike up what seems to be a warm intergenerational friendship. Frankie’s roommate, Erica (Maika Monroe, supplying a superfluous but satisfying jolt of bratty energy), thinks it’s a little weird, and of course she turns out to be right. The lady has a cupboard full of identical handbags! Then she goes full stalker, flooding Frankie’s phone with texts and voice mail messages and showing up at the restaurant where Frankie works. Frankie is probably too young to have seen “Fatal Attraction,” “Single White Female” or the other madwoman-in-the-city movies of the ’80s and ’90s. “Greta” updates the genre (people have smartphones now) without improving on it much, though the maniac-mommy twist is an interesting wrinkle, adding a sinister fairy-tale element to the modern setting. (It’s hard to hear the title without thinking of Hansel and Gretel, and Greta is distinctly witchy.) But the plot moves a little too quickly from intriguing ambiguity to straight-up terror, without giving Moretz and Huppert enough time to explore the kinks in the characters’ relationship or the temperamental contrast between them. Moretz is soft-featured and forthright, her face a blunt register of Frankie’s feelings. Huppert is all angles and shadows, and Greta is a mystery wrapped in an enigma bundled up in a neatly tied package of pure crazy. The script, written by Jordan and Ray Wright, makes a small effort to explain Greta’s mania, or at least to fill in her background — a hapless detective played by Stephen Rea is deployed for that purpose — but understanding what makes her tick is not even remotely the point of the movie. The point, and the fun, is the wild mischief of Huppert’s performance, which grows lighter and more joyful as Greta’s behavior slides from menacing to murderous. Jordan contrives to make Huppert’s mere presence in the frame almost absurdly frightening, and Huppert compounds the fright with elegant comedy, so that while the movie is impossible to take seriously, it’s also hard to resist, like an unattended bag on the subway that’s just begging you to look inside.

2019,‘Happy Death Day 2U’ Review: Living Is Easy. Dying Again and Again Is Hard.,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Happy Death Day,” a 2017 slasher variation on the classic time-loop comedy “Groundhog Day,” a prickly but engaging college student, Tree Gelbman, had to solve her own murder in order to stop reliving the day it happened. Once that was done, the minimally witty movie implied that she’d live in a less dodgy fashion than that which got her killed, over and over again, in the first place. The cosmic conditions that created this fix were not explained in that picture. But, boy, are they ever in the sequel “Happy Death Day 2U,” written and directed by Christopher Landon, who directed the original film and penned several films from the “Paranormal Activity” franchise. Turns out a student experiment in the quantum physics lab is responsible for shifting realities, and Tree soon finds herself catapulted back to her death day. Under different conditions this time, one of them happy: In this dimension, her beloved mom is still alive. But she is still going to die every day. While the first film worked a relatively simple “solve the mystery and save your life” challenge, here Tree uses her predicament as a grand self-help course, not unlike Bill Murray’s character in “Groundhog Day” and his piano lessons. Jessica Rothe as Tree is still an appealing presence. But the film is overstuffed with unfunny self-parodying gore slapstick, half-felt sentimentality and semi-meta sci-fi — characters mention “Inception” and “Back to the Future,” just to let you know that they know that we know. It ends as neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. This, despite the preponderance of herrings thrown about during its running time.

2019,"Opinion | ‘He Is a Racist, He Is a Con Man, and He Is a Cheat’","Nixon was bad, but nothing compared to Michael Cohen’s portrayal of “gangster” Trump. Opinion Columnist More than 45 years ago, as a 14-year-old farm kid in Oregon, I watched on a flickering black-and-white television as Richard Nixon’s former White House counsel, John Dean, testified about presidential misconduct in the Watergate scandal — and the second-most-corrupt administration in American history began to crumble. Now, watching Michael Cohen testify before Congress, I sense a similar historic temblor, only this time it may be the No. 1-most-corrupt administration that is beginning to teeter. Cohen’s testimony was staggering because of the cumulative sum of alleged misconduct, because of the overall portrait it provided of Donald Trump as a “mobster.” “I know what Mr. Trump is,” Cohen said, summing up what he learned working at Trump’s side for a decade. “He is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat.” The range of Trump cons that Cohen outlined was extraordinary, from rigging an auction for the sale of a Trump portrait, to apparent bank fraud, to apparent perjury, to secret hush money payoffs to women, to apparent advance knowledge of a WikiLeaks dump of Democratic emails. There was even a tantalizing suggestion of other criminal conduct that the Justice Department’s Southern District of New York is investigating that we may know nothing about. Watergate started with a “third-rate burglary” that Nixon apparently had no advance knowledge of. But the investigation into the burglary led to revelations of a cover-up, of obstruction of justice, of mind-boggling abuses of power. One difference is that Trump’s illegal behavior seems to be more broad-ranging than Nixon’s. Trump may have been so cavalier because he never expected this office or this scrutiny. I wish the hearing hadn’t taken place precisely during Trump’s summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, because of the risk of undermining nuclear diplomacy, but the irony is that according to Cohen, those Trump-Kim negotiations are a historical fluke. “He had no desire or intention to lead this nation — only to market himself and to build his wealth and power,” Cohen said. “Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ‘greatest infomercial in political history.’ He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election.” What was almost as dispiriting as the range of misconduct alleged was the behavior of Republicans on the committee. They seemed less interested in ferreting out the truth than in covering it up; all they wanted to do was protect Trump and discredit Cohen. It was three hours into the hearing before a Republican even asked Cohen a question about Trump. The Republicans argued that we should not believe Cohen because he is a proven liar. But if a proven liar should not be believed, why do these same Republicans believe Trump? After all, Trump has made 8,718 false or misleading statements since taking office, according to The Washington Post’s count. Cohen said that he had no knowledge of any sex video obtained by Russia as leverage over Trump, and added that he didn’t have proof of collusion with Russia, only “suspicions.” But he described a kind of kompromat: “Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it” and then “made clear to me” that “he wanted me to lie” to Congress. Cohen shot down some of the rumors going around. He said he has no knowledge of Trump having a love child or paying for an abortion, and Trump would ""never"" physically harm Melania. But the sum total of his testimony was devastating; decades from now, historians will continue to analyze it. On his first day testifying to the Senate Watergate committee back in June 1973, John Dean said: “To one who was in the White House and became somewhat familiar with its interworkings, the Watergate matter was an inevitable outgrowth of a climate” in which expediency trumped law. It was in part Watergate that drew me toward journalism, and in 35 years reporting for The New York Times, I’ve known and covered many American presidents and foreign leaders. The American leaders sometimes tried to bamboozle or spin us reporters, but they were tethered to truth and to American values and were fundamentally different from some banana republic leaders who were simply gangsters. Until now. I hope Democrats aren’t gleeful. This is a sad moment in American history, for Nixon walks again. Squared. And I hope the Republicans listened when Cohen told one of his G.O.P. interrogators: “I did the same thing you are doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.” He added: “People who follow Mr. Trump blindly will suffer the same consequences I’m suffering.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,"‘He May Not Even Be a Free Person,’ Elizabeth Warren Says of Trump in 2020","CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Countless Democratic leaders have urged the party not to spend the 2020 campaign tangling with President Trump over tweets and taunts. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made a novel argument on Sunday for ignoring the president: He could soon be in jail. Addressing a crowd of several hundred at the Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Ms. Warren said it was up to Democrats to decide whether they would spend every day parrying “a racist tweet, a hateful tweet, something really dark and ugly” from the president. She said the party should ask: “Are we going to let him use those to divide us?” “By the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president,” Ms. Warren said. “In fact, he may not even be a free person.” Prodded by reporters to explain the remark a few hours later in Iowa City, Ms. Warren said she was simply noting the proliferation of inquiries into the president. “It’s no longer just the Mueller investigation,” Ms. Warren said. “They’re everywhere and these are serious investigations, so we’ll see what happens.” In addition to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 election, there are continuing investigations spearheaded by federal prosecutors in New York and by the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing related to the 2016 campaign and Russia, and there is no indication that the president himself could be indicted or incarcerated before the 2020 election. Ms. Warren’s remark was an unusually blunt jab at Mr. Trump, from a candidate who has largely declined to spar personally with the president since her entry into the 2020 race. Mr. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed Ms. Warren, often in personal terms and with racist slurs, for having in the past identified herself as having Native American ancestry. Ms. Warren recently apologized to the Cherokee Nation for having done so. On Saturday, Mr. Trump appeared to invoke the Trail of Tears, the infamously cruel forced relocation of Native Americans in the early 19th century that caused thousands of deaths, when he mocked Ms. Warren on Twitter: “See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz.” Ms. Warren did not refer explicitly to the Twitter post on Sunday. [For those who need a refresher, here is a brief history of the Trail of Tears.] Aside from the imprisonment crack, Ms. Warren spent little time in Iowa discussing Mr. Trump’s legal issues and caustic persona. She played down talk of impeachment and stressed to reporters that she was focused on “structural” problems that “were broken long before Donald Trump got here.” She was not the only Democrat to suggest obliquely in Iowa this weekend that Mr. Trump might meet a swift downfall of some kind. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, in his first trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate, suggested in passing on Saturday that if he won the Democratic nomination, he was not certain he would face Mr. Trump in the general election. “Should I be our nominee and Trump also be the nominee — I’m not sure if he will be — but if he is the nominee, you will see the toughest, strongest person standing against him,” Mr. Booker said. “Whatever he wants to throw at me, bring it.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘He Was Only 14’: A Sad Birthday Remembrance for a Boy, Slain With His Mother","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The group of teenagers huddled in a cold wind on East 185th Street in the Bronx on Monday, carrying with them the same items they had planned the day before to bring: shiny balloons saying “It’s Your Birthday” and “Feliz Cumpleaños,” and a chocolate cake. They were prepared to commemorate their friend Alanche Del Orbe’s 15th birthday, and decided to still do so, even amid the shocking and tragic news: Fewer than 20 hours earlier, Alanche had been found dead in his home, four stories above where the teenagers gathered. “He was only 14, he was only a little kid,” said an anguished friend, Randy Marquez, 15. The police report of his death suggested an unthinkable horror. Alanche was found with severe head trauma, most likely beaten. His mother, Marisol Ortiz, 51, was found the same way. After a family member reportedly found them and called 911 at 3:38 p.m. on Sunday, emergency medical personnel pronounced them both dead at the scene. A neighbor upstairs, Eskarliny Santiago, 20, heard the reaction when the bodies were found. “It was a scream, really loud, like when you’re getting hit,” she said. Police officials said that a man who was a person of interest and wanted for questioning in the case, Hector Cruz, was struck and killed by a train early Sunday at the Hartsdale Metro-North Railroad station in Westchester. The sparse and grisly details released by the police stood in jarring contrast to the color photos of Alanche that his friends taped onto the building’s exterior. In one, he mugs in a fake mustache while wearing his jacket from his high school, the Academy for Language and Technology. In another, he strikes a pose in dress clothes. In another, he hikes through a verdant forest with a backpack. “He was just a happy kid, he liked to joke and make everybody laugh,” Zaimari Trinidad, 15, said. “It’s so hard what happened to him.” As the friends spoke, two police officers escorted a pair of tearful women into the apartment; the women identified themselves as family members but declined to comment. The building superintendent, Jose Feliciano, 69, said Alanche and his mother had moved from the Dominican Republic around four years ago. He called them “good people” with whom he never had an issue. One of Alanche’s closest friends, Diannibel Cedano, 15, said he had confided to her last week that there was trouble over a new man whom his mother began seeing. She recalled that he had told her as he accompanied her home in a cab; he was making sure she arrived safe before walking to his own home. “His mom got a boyfriend and he had to leave to his sister’s house,” Diannibel said. “It’s sad because he felt his mother never cared about him.” Police officials would not confirm multiple news media reports that they were looking for the mother’s boyfriend, who was said to be an ex-convict. Outside the building’s front door, the regiments of red and white votive candles grew as 10 “Happy Birthday” balloons clattered in the stiff wind. Friends remembered Alanche as a baseball nut whose hero was Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge. He dreamed of being just like him one day. They recalled his love of playing baseball, through a group called Grand Slam Foundation, or simpler everyday things like riding his bicycle, dancing and eating Dominican food. He always liked to joke and make sure everyone around him had a good time, they said. Bianell De La Cruz, a teacher at the Academy for Language and Technology, said he immediately dropped everything when a student emailed him the news, rushing to the birthday party turned memorial with a school shirt for the students to sign in tribute. He said Alanche won a school award last year for student improvement. “He was a good student, a good kid; we’re all going to miss him,” he said. Another friend, Randy Marquez, said he had looked forward to telling Alanche on Monday that for his birthday his buddies were taking him to a Yankees game this spring. “It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” he said, staring at the candles blowing out. “Not at all.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Here to Ruin Your Daily Commute:’ A Plague of Potholes Jolts the Midwest,"Decades of neglect and underfunding, combined with the brutality of winters, have left roads resembling the surface of the moon. For those who live in snow-prone regions, driving in the winter can feel like an exercise in futility: Unsuspecting, and then it appears, a crater in the asphalt, just waiting to blow out a tire. You try to swerve, brace for impact, and then: Kathunk. But commuters of America, take heart: Indianapolis has it worse. Much, much worse. The capital of Indiana (whose state motto is, ironically, “the crossroads of America”) has essentially become one large pothole, compliments of wild temperature swings this winter. The metropolis is so pockmarked by decaying asphalt that local officials have said that more than $730 million is required to repair over 8,100 miles of streets — nearly six times the city’s current budget for transportation infrastructure. Decades of neglect and underfunding, combined with the brutality of Midwestern winters, have left the city’s roads resembling the surface of the moon. To assist motorists, the city last year posted an “Indy pothole viewer” map online, which currently shows 4,388 open potholes, marked by a swarm of angry red dots. In Des Moines, the city fills about 7,000 potholes a year. And in Chicago, which recently emerged from a brutal few days of subzero temperatures and where snow is forecast for five out of the next seven days, the city received just shy of 4,400 pothole complaints from residents in January. With little relief and plenty of new craters on the horizon, residents in Indianapolis have taken it upon themselves — and taken to social media — to vent, warn and meme. (That said, we invite you to share the biggest, baddest bane of your fender, regardless of where you live.) On a Reddit thread tagged with the headline “The pot hole problem, and how to solve it,” residents suggested legalizing and taxing marijuana to pay for road repair and more mass transit. And then there’s Quinn Daily, a young man who turned his frustration into civic participation of questionable legality. In a YouTube video titled “Dear Indianapolis,” Mr. Daily used a can of red spray paint to outline potholes at a particularly treacherous intersection, doing his “best to help drivers avoid hitting the holes and breaking their car like I have.” (Spoiler alert: “Literally too many holes for me even to paint,” he says.) The Instagram hashtag #indypotholes is a seemingly bottomless well of mirth (and, ahem, schadenfreude) for a city plagued by crumbling roads. Chris Bucher, a local photographer, turned the pits and cracks into action-flick landscapes. Not to be outdone, his fellow Instagrammers had their own, if less artistic, fun with pothole memes: Meanwhile, others have experimented with precious cargo: In the Facebook group Indiana Pothole Haters Club, users lament the sorry state of the state’s roads while hoping to “Make Infrastructure Great Again.” But perhaps the award for social media savvy goes to a Twitter parody account that tries to set the record (if not the street) straight by letting people see things from the point of view of those beleaguered, naturally occurring phenomena themselves: the @PotholesOfIndy. For the past year, the self-described “pothole advocates” have been doling out a steady stream of taunts and mockery. “Here to ruin your daily commute,” the account warns. “Think twice before you think about reporting us. Nobody likes a pothole NARC.” In December, @PotholesOfIndy waded into the upcoming mayoral race by, um, endorsing the city’s incumbent mayor, Joe Hogsett, who has tried with limited success to vanquish the pothole menace. “No community has benefitted more from Mayor Joe Hogsett’s policies than us potholes here in Indianapolis,” declared the account in a statement. “We started out as a minor bump in the road but now we have total control of the city.” The endorsement concluded with an offer to assist the mayor’s campaign, “whether it be by causing car damage” to his political opponents, “swallowing school buses whole, or endangering the general public on their daily commute.” (The mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.) The account is the handiwork of two men who said in an interview that they were spurred by their shared outrage at the state of their city’s streets, not to mention weekslong delays in repairs. Fed up with what they called a history of municipal mismanagement, they were surprised by the account’s popularity with residents, who over the past year have tweeted instances of car damage and road havoc, including a large sinkhole that formed in July. “It’s uniting the city behind our frustrations with the potholes,” said one of the men, who asked to not be identified to retain the anonymity of the account. “We’ve joked we’re bought and paid for by big tire.” To be fair, cities across the country and the globe (here’s looking at you, Rome) are suffering from pothole infestations, and social media provides a glimpse, at once gritty and beautiful, of all the asphalt melodrama. There’s Potholes of Philadelphia, which lavishes a reflective touch upon the city’s watery pits. Potholes of Detroit, however, is decidedly less artful in its depictions of the former industrial powerhouse’s perilous craters, conveniently accompanied by specific intersections. “What a shame,” is a familiar comment on the account’s posts. Down south, the potholes of New Orleans and Atlanta have each merited their own Instagram accounts, though their silence of late might suggest a lack of dedication to the social media cause, rather than a significant public works victory. Still, it’s not for lack of trying. “Atlanta potholes beware,” @potholes_of_atl warns. “We’re coming for you.”",The New York Times
2019,‘He’s Not There Yet’: Embattled Governor Seeks Forgiveness From Black Virginians,"RICHMOND, Va. — He prayed with black leaders, invoked his deep respect for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and insisted that the blackface he once wore was not indicative of the type of person he is today. He discussed increasing funding for at-risk youth programs and affordable housing, and scheduled the first of what may be several visits to historically black universities. In the nearly two weeks since his governorship was upended by revelations that he had a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia has scrambled to rebuild his image among black Virginians. It is an effort that has hit a few bumps and may or may not be successful at winning over a constituency that heavily backed him during his campaign. “Right now, the ball’s in his court,” said Delegate Lamont Bagby, the chairman of the state’s legislative black caucus. Mr. Northam has been mocked for the revelation that he was only now reading “Roots” by Alex Haley and “The Case for Reparations” by Ta-Nehisi Coates. His comments that the first Africans brought to Virginia 400 years ago were “indentured servants” did nothing to help his case. And one of the first major pieces of legislation that lawmakers passed after the blackface controversy was a tax bill — now headed to the governor’s desk for his signature — that was strongly criticized by black legislators for providing few benefits to poor Virginians. “That was a missed opportunity,” said Delegate Lashrecse Aird, a black lawmaker from the Petersburg area. Mr. Northam faced increased pressure to step down after he admitted that he had darkened his face to dance like Michael Jackson in a contest in the early 1980s. Some of the political pressure has since shifted toward the two other Democrats next in line to replace him: the lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, who has been accused by two women of sexual assault; and the attorney general, Mark Herring, who acknowledged that he had worn blackface for a costume around the same time as Mr. Northam had. The next official would be Kirk Cox, the Republican speaker of the House. “You can see out of the blocks it has been difficult for him,” Mr. Cox said of the governor. Leading any effort at racial reconciliation would be a challenge for the governor, Mr. Cox said pointedly, “while he’s in office.” [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] As reality sets in that the governor has no intention of resigning, many of those who have expressed fury at him are now focused on how the scandal might prompt policy changes for black communities. There is anything but business as usual in the capital. “Normally in a year in which something like this had not happened, we’d all turn and focus on getting elected,” said Delegate Jay Jones, a Norfolk Democrat. “But everyone sees there’s more at stake now.” The A.C.L.U. of Virginia sent the governor a letter asking that he push for a constitutional amendment to allow convicted felons the right to vote, an issue that disproportionately affects black residents. A coalition of black elected officials and civic leaders has released seven pages of demands, asking the governor to increase funding for historically black colleges and universities in the state, create an office of equity and inclusion, and create a fund to support minority-owned businesses. “There’s one of two options: Resign or adhere to our demands,” said Wes Bellamy, a city councilman in Charlottesville and a member of the coalition, Virginia Black Politicos. If Mr. Northam does not meet their demands, he added, “We’ll continue to make his life hell. There will be protests everywhere he goes. There will be very little cooperation from people who look like us. There’s going to be a stain, not only on himself but on the party.” Three days after the scandal broke, Mr. Northam called Charles Steele Jr., the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization once led by Dr. King. “I’m not like that,” Mr. Steele recalled the governor telling him toward the beginning of their conversation. The organization had called for Mr. Northam to resign, but the governor sought to discuss what had happened and get advice on how he might engage in racial reconciliation. Mr. Steele and Bernard Lafayette Jr., a civil rights activist who was close to Dr. King, met with Mr. Northam at his mansion for about an hour. The men discussed Dr. King and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet premier, as examples of how great leaders bring about change, Mr. Steele said. The governor said he would think about taking training through the organization, but did not make any commitments, Mr. Steele said. “It’s on his plate now,” he said. “We cooked the food, we delivered it, and we left it on his table.” Before the controversy, many black leaders saw hope in Mr. Northam. His predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, under whom he served as lieutenant governor, made some strides in connecting with black communities. As a candidate, Mr. Northam condemned the violence in Charlottesville in 2017, when white supremacists staged a violent march against efforts to remove Confederate statues. Mr. Northam said then that he favored removal of the statues, but later hedged, saying that decision should be left up to local communities. “Ralph is a personal friend,” said Mr. Bellamy, the Charlottesville councilman. “That’s part of why this hurts so much.” Although Mr. Bellamy had been among those calling for Mr. Northam’s resignation, he said he believed the governor wanted to do the right thing. “He has to allow the folks most affected by this to lead this work,” he said. “He’s shown he’s not there yet.” The governor has had a series of one-on-one meetings with members of the black legislative caucus, as well as black mayors and community advocates around Virginia. He has also quietly talked with the many African-American state employees who work in the same Capitol Square tower where his office is. In a letter to members of the Legislature’s budget conference sent Thursday morning, Mr. Northam asked them to prioritize funding for the most at-risk school children and for affordable housing. “In order for every Virginian to thrive, we must invest in their success — and that requires a greater focus on issues of equity,” he wrote. His advisers stressed that he will not embark on any sort of an “apology tour,” as some news media outlets have reported. But they said he was considering building on his reading list by scheduling meetings with scholars on race, history and Virginia. Mr. Northam is scheduled to attend a social justice event at Virginia Union University next Thursday, though it was unclear whether he would speak. On Wednesday night, Mr. Northam was to host a Black History Month dinner. But he postponed the gathering until later in the month because, aides said, he wanted to turn it from a formal gathering into more of a dialogue. Last Friday, Mr. Northam met with John W. Boyd Jr., the president of the National Black Farmers Association, who runs a farm 90 miles southwest of Richmond. The two men prayed, and Mr. Boyd said he offered advice, telling the governor to talk publicly about the matter and also to reach out to black organizations to hear about their needs. He raised some areas the governor could work on, including affordable housing, education and the relationship between black farmers and banks. But Mr. Boyd said he mainly saw the meeting as a way to show the governor he forgave him. “I believe it’s a bad time in America for race,” he said. “You’ve never seen it so divided. Somewhere along the line, somebody has to say, ‘Let’s try some unity.’” A picture with an earlier version of this article was published in error. The image showed the Rev.

2019,‘High Flying Bird’ Is Rich With Historical References. Here’s a Closer Look.,"Steven Soderbergh’s electrifying new film “High Flying Bird,” which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players’ personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.) The film’s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), is also replete with references to the game’s history — not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There’s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide. As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment. The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called “Black Fives” by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance — or, as they were better known, the Rens — were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead. [Read the Times review of “High Flying Bird” by A.O. Scott.] Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game. As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in “High Flying Bird”: “There’s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.” Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball’s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.) Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was “no comparison,” he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball. Yes — in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of “High Flying Bird,” the sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland) tells a client, “Last time this happened, folks was broke left and right!” That “last time” was the 2011 lockout, which lasted five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players. A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day. Much screen time in “High Flying Bird” is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film’s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a “lockout street ball event in Las Vegas,” presumably inspired by the “lockout league” in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun. (Profits from ticket sales were donated to charity). Dozens of players filled the pay gap by picking up spots on teams in Europe and Japan. As The Times’s Howard Beck noted at the time, however, “a vast majority of them are rookies, middling veterans and fringe players.” As New York magazine and others have noted, the character Myra (Sonja Sohn) strongly resembles Michele Roberts, who became the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association in 2014. The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already “forcefully questioned the league’s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.” Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. “My past,” she told players while making her case for the job, “is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.” In the film’s first scene, Ray gives a client a mysterious package, calling it “the Bible.” It contains the book “The Revolt of the Black Athlete” by the sports sociologist and civil rights advocate Dr. Harry Edwards, who also appears briefly in Ray’s office near the end of the film. Edwards first came to national prominence for organizing the Olympic Project for Human Rights, whose members Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines for raising their gloved fists while receiving medals at the 1968 Olympics. Edwards has spent the ensuing years teaching, writing, consulting and leading protests. “Revolt,” published in 1969, argued that racism is as prevalent in sports as in any other section of society. “The sports world is not a rose flourishing in the middle of a wasteland,” he writes. “It is part and parcel of that wasteland, reeking of the same racism that corrupts other areas of our society.” “High Flying Bird” is bookended by recordings of two folk-rock classics, both performed by Richie Havens as part of his opening set at Woodstock. The title track, Havens’s recording of a folk song written by Billy Edd Wheeler, was praised by the musicologist Richie Unterberger for its “arresting minor-keyed melody and brooding lyrics, contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer’s earthbound misery.” It isn’t hard to connect those lyrics to Ray’s notion that his clients should free themselves from the earthbound constraints of the sports industry and bring the game back to its roots. “Handsome Johnny,” which Havens wrote with the Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., closes the film, telling the story of a young man who marches off to a series of wars. Given the movie’s themes, the song’s refrain is appropriate: “It’s a long hard road, hey, before we’ll be free.”",The New York Times
2019,‘High Flying Bird’ Review: A Thrilling Dunk on Capitalism,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. On a basketball court, “give me the rock” means “pass the ball.” In “High Flying Bird,” an exhilarating and argumentative caper concerning a sports agent, his N.B.A.-rookie client and other interested parties, the phrase takes on a slightly different connotation — something akin to “the workers should seize control of the means of production.” Notwithstanding the presence of three real-life professional ballers (Reggie Jackson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Donovan Mitchell) giving straight-to-camera testimony about life in the league, this isn’t a sports movie in any conventional sense. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Tarell Alvin McCraney, it uses the charisma of athletes and the competitive energy of the game they play to catalyze a feisty, twisty fable of labor and capital in the 21st century. McCraney, a formidable playwright (his “Choir Boy” is currently on Broadway) and an Oscar winner for “Moonlight,” has composed a densely layered, intellectually demanding agitprop drama that draws on rabble-rousing theatrical traditions (Clifford Odets, Dario Fo) while fixing its gaze squarely on the injustices and absurdities of the present. Soderbergh, shooting almost entirely with an iPhone, conducts a brisk tour of the streets and suites of money-mad Manhattan, with excursions to Philadelphia and the South Bronx. It’s very much worth digging into the political economy of the movie, but more important, at the outset, is to pay tribute to its craft and ingenuity. McCraney’s script is quite simply an extraordinary piece of writing, idiomatic and poetic in its cadences and pleasingly serpentine in its structure. The challenge for Soderbergh and the more-than-game cast is to turn the artful verbiage into persuasive human speech and the plot machinery into a plausible slice of organic reality. Which it is, helping down the medicine of topicality with the sugar of pop-culture cleverness in the most delightful way. The slightly distended frames and peculiar angles of the pocket-size camera — and the way Soderbergh, serving as the director of photography under his usual pseudonym, Peter Andrews, makes it twirl, glide and shimmy — create an atmosphere of buoyancy and immediacy. The actors take it from there, above all André Holland, an executive producer of the film and the third member of its central creative team. Holland (a vital part of both “Moonlight” and “The Knick,” Soderbergh’s Cinemax series) plays Ray Burke, an agent who finds himself in a tight professional and ethical spot. The team owners have locked out the players (as happened in the N.B.A. back in 2011), and the money that keeps everybody afloat is quickly drying up. In the first scene, Ray is lecturing his client Erick Scott (Melvin Gregg), a recent No. 1 draft pick whose professional debut has been postponed, about financial responsibility and personal discipline. It’s a big-brotherly scolding and a pep talk, but also the beginnings of a ruthless critique of the way the system works, exploiting naïve and ambitious young men like Erick even as it promises them fame and fortune. That idea — that in spite of high salaries and endorsement deals, athletes are fundamentally workers, generating profits for the owning class — is refined and complicated as Ray pinballs from one meeting to the next. He checks in at the office with his boss (Zachary Quinto), engages in energetic screwball banter with his erstwhile assistant, Samantha (Zazie Beetz) and argues dialectics and family-leave policy with Myra (Sonja Sohn), the head of the player’s association. Other encounters — with a no-nonsense sports mom (Jeryl Prescott), the owner of Erick’s team (Kyle MacLachlan) and Ray’s old friend Spence (Bill Duke), who runs a youth basketball program — follow the same didactic, disputatious pattern. There’s a fair amount of soliloquizing and rhetorical grandstanding, which is also true of Shakespeare, hip-hop and church. If you like any of those, you might enjoy this too. In the course of all the back-and-forthing, a scheme emerges that strikes Ray as wonderfully simple and potentially revolutionary. What if the players, paralyzed by the intransigence of their employers, could eliminate those middlemen and take control of the fruits of their own talents? It’s a question that resonates beyond the court, the locker room and the broadcast booth, into the worlds of art and entertainment. The racial aspects of the power dynamic that governs organized sports is so obvious that it almost goes without saying. Whenever anyone does say it — when, that is, somebody invokes slavery as a metaphor for current circumstances — Spence demands the recitation of a short prayer: “I love the lord and all his black people.” If there is resignation in those words, there is defiance too. “High Flying Bird” swoops and cuts through the contradictions of modern culture with the fleet momentum of a power forward destroying a flat-footed defense on his way to the hoop. You don’t quite understand what just happened until the next thing is already happening. The intellectual virtuosity on display is somehow both ostentatious and casual. The performances — Holland’s in particular, full of sadness, guile and audacity — feel the same way. Not everything works. A back story having to do with Ray’s cousin, a basketball prodigy who met a tragic end, feels like the kind of baggage more suited to the stage than the screen. At moments the busyness of the plot overshadows the wit of the performances. But the occasional raggedness of the movie only enhances the credibility of its ambitions. Like Ray Burke, it’s in a big hurry and has a lot on its mind. And it leaves you with a lot to think about, in addition to race, class and basketball: what it means to love your work, and why it matters to be paid for it; how utopian visions and tactical calculations work together to create the possibility of change; why we take fun so seriously. It ends not with a big game or a high-stakes showdown but with a protest anthem — by Richie Havens, who also performed the song that gives the film its name — and a recommendation for further reading. Which I am not about to spoil. An earlier version of this article misidentified Richie Havens’s relationship to the song “High Flying Bird.” He performed the song, he did not write it. The song was written by Billy Edd Wheeler. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Had Strong Opinions About Appalachians. Now, Appalachians Return the Favor.","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. J.D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy,” the surprise best seller published in 2016, is a frisky memoir with a bit of conservative moralizing dangling off, like the price tag on Minnie Pearl’s hat. Nearly everyone likes the memoir sections. (His portrait of his grandmother, a “pistol-packing lunatic,” is indelible.) The moralizing has been divisive. A new anthology, “Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’” edited by Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll, presents the most sustained pushback to Vance’s book (soon to be a Ron Howard movie) thus far. It’s a volley of intellectual buckshot from high up alongside the hollow. Vance’s book tells the story of his chaotic childhood in Ohio, where part of his extended family migrated from Kentucky’s Appalachian region. Some of his brawling, working-class kin are alcoholics, and some are abusers; nearly all are feisty beyond measure. The book is about how young J.D. survived his mother’s drug addiction and a long series of hapless stepfathers and went on, against steep odds, to serve in the Marines and graduate from Yale Law School. It’s a plain-spoken, feel-good, up-from-one’s-bootstraps story. It would have gotten away clean if Vance hadn’t, on his way up, pushed Appalachians back down. He calls Appalachians lazy (“many folks talk about working more than they actually work”). He complains about white “welfare queens.” He’s against curbs on predatory payday lending practices. He harkens back to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s controversial “culture of poverty” themes. This kind of criticism, for many Appalachians, verges on the personal. When Vance spoke on a panel at the 2018 Appalachian Studies Association conference, a group called Y’ALL (Young Appalachian Leaders and Learners) staged a protest, turning their chairs away from him, booing and singing Florence Reece’s anthem “Which Side Are You On?” To be fair to Vance, he finds some positive things to say about Appalachians. And he writes that government has a role to play, if a smaller one than some might wish, in helping a population battered by plant closings, geographical disadvantage, environmental despoiling and centuries of the most rapacious capitalism imaginable. To hear the writers in “Appalachian Reckoning” tell it, the problems with “Hillbilly Elegy” start with its subtitle: “A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.” Those last three words are a lot to swallow. They illustrate Vance’s habit of pivoting from personal experience into the broadest of generalizations. His is a book in which the words “I” and “we” are slippery indeed. As Dwight B. Billings, a professor emeritus of sociology and Appalachian studies at the University of Kentucky, puts it in this new anthology, “It is one thing to write a personal memoir extolling the wisdom of one’s personal choices but quite something else — something extraordinarily audacious — to presume to write the ‘memoir’ of a culture.” Billings quotes a Democrat from Ohio, Betsy Rader, who wrote: “Vance’s sweeping stereotypes are shark bait for conservative policymakers. They feed into the mythology that the undeserving poor make bad choices and are to blame for their own poverty, so taxpayer money should not be wasted in programs to help lift people out of poverty.” In her perceptive essay, Lisa R. Pruitt, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, boils down Vance’s advice this way: “‘ Hillbillies’ just need to pull themselves together, keep their families intact, go to church, work a little harder and stop blaming the government for their woes.” Pruitt compares Vance’s memoir to those by Barack Obama and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. What if Obama, she asks, had condemned “those he worked among as a community organizer in Chicago, even while basking in his own success as the obvious fruits of his own labor.” She continues, “Or imagine Sonia Sotomayor, in her best-selling memoir ‘My Beloved World,’ taking complete credit for her class migration from the Bronx’s Puerto Rican American community to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, all while saying the Latinx youth and young adults left behind simply lacked the grit and discipline to achieve similarly lofty goals.” For every essay in “Appalachian Reckoning” that’s provocative, another is unreadable. The academic language in some of these pieces — “wider discursive contexts,” “capitalist realist ontology,” “fashion a carceral landscape” — makes it seem as if their authors were walking around on stilts. You may find Vance’s policy positions to be rubbish, but at least they are clearly articulated rubbish. There are a few pro-Vance pieces in “Appalachian Reckoning.” And not everything here is a polemic. The volume includes poems, photographs, memoirs and a comic piece or two. I’m not entirely sure why it’s in this book, but Jeremy B. Jones’s love song to Ernest T. Bass, the fictional character on “The Andy Griffith Show” who was addicted to throwing rocks, is a pleasure. A few of these writers try to one-up Vance on the atrocity meter. High points in this regard go to Michael E. Maloney, a Cincinnati-based community organizer, who writes: “My grandfather killed a man who tried to rob his sawmill. My father killed one man in a West Virginia coal mine for making a disrespectful remark, another for drawing a gun on him, and another who had murdered my uncle Dewey.” That’s a lot of Appalachian reckoning. The book to read, if you’re interested in the history of the exploitation of Appalachia, is Steven Stoll’s “Ramp Hollow: The Ordeal of Appalachia” (2017). We can gawk at mountain people all we like. But, Stoll writes, “Seeing without history is like visiting a city after a devastating hurricane and declaring that the people there have always lived in ruins.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Holiday’ Review: Sun and Fun on the Turkish Riviera, Then a Lot Less Fun","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Sascha, the young protagonist of “Holiday,” co-written and directed by Isabella Eklof (who also co-wrote the striking 2018 Swedish film “Border”), has no back story. She materializes at an airport, rides on a bus and is soon at the house of Michael (Lai Yde), an older man who welcomes her to “the family.” Michael’s work as a minor drug lord on the Turkish Riviera provides a sybaritic but inelegant lifestyle, one punctuated with threat and then actual violence. At an ice-cream parlor, Sascha (Victoria Carmen Sonne) meets the younger, more laid-back Thomas (Thijs Romer), a boatman who tells her that if she were an ice cream, she would be strawberry cheesecake. She corrects him: “Strawberry champagne.” She’s Danish, she tells him; he’s Dutch, he tells her. Between her flirtations with Thomas, she watches as Michael and his friends menace a beachgoer. She gets into a motor scooter mishap. At one point, she and the younger folk repair to the TV room while Michael kicks the crap out of an employee. Then one afternoon Michael brutally rapes Sascha, in the middle of the living room, in an explicit single take. Eklof subsequently inverts revenge conventions in a way that dares the audience to call it perverse. She has cited the cinematic extremist Ulrich Seidl (“Paradise: Love,” “Import/Export”) as an influence: As with that filmmaker, it’s hard to tell whether she intends to communicate something genuine about the human condition, or just shovel hostility at her audience. Because Eklof’s approach is formally very clean, showing some genuine, intriguing detachment, I’m apt to prefer it to Seidl’s work. But not by much.

2019,"‘Homosexual Community’ Controls City Council, One Member Says. He’s Resisting Calls to Resign.","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As a New York State senator, Rubén Díaz Sr. once sued to stop a high school for gay and transgender students from opening. Several years later, in 2011, Mr. Díaz held a rally to oppose same-sex marriage while his gay granddaughter held a counter rally across the street. Times have changed. Mr. Díaz, a Pentecostal minister, has not. Mr. Díaz, a Bronx Democrat now on the City Council, said last week in a Spanish-language radio interview that his colleagues first shunned him because the Council was “controlled by the homosexual community.” His remarks were immediately greeted with calls for him to resign, or, at the very least, apologize. Those calling for an apology included Mr. Díaz’s son, Rubén Díaz Jr., the Bronx borough president and a leading mayoral candidate in 2021; he said on Twitter that his father’s remarks were “antagonistic, quarrelsome and wholly unnecessary.” He said in an interview on Monday that he has spoken to his father to ask him to apologize, but his father has refused. “I can understand why folks are calling for him to resign. I can understand the hurt,” Mr. Díaz said in an interview. The elder Mr. Díaz, who often wears a cowboy hat in public, has a reputation for a shoot-from-the-hip style that rarely accounts for diplomacy. In 1994, he was rebuked by his fellow members of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a police oversight body, for denouncing the Gay Games, which were held in New York, saying that the participants were likely “infected with AIDS,” and that the event could lead children “to conclude that if there are so many gay and lesbian athletes then there is nothing wrong, nor any risks involved.” Then, as now, Mr. Díaz was unapologetic, denying accusations that he was homophobic. “What’s homophobic about saying that the gay community controls the nyc city council?” Mr. Díaz wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “I’m giving them credit for the power and influence they have.” He did express remorse to those disappointed in his refusal to resign, saying that only his district’s constituents had the power to force him out, on Election Day. “I am the victim here,” the councilman said in an interview in his district office. “And I will not apologize, with all due respect, because I did not do anything wrong. They have proven me right.” “The only people who can demand my resignation are the people of my district and even that has to wait until November,” he added. “Before that, they can ask for all the resignations in the world, but there will be no resignation.” The City Council is already exploring disciplinary action against him: The Committee on Standards and Ethics, at the behest of several Council members who have complained, will open an investigation. If Mr. Díaz is found guilty of “disorderly conduct,” which could include violating “policies against discrimination and harassment,” Mr. Díaz could be reprimanded, censured, fined or expelled from the City Council by a two-thirds vote of its members. The Council speaker, Corey Johnson, who is gay and H.I.V. positive, used his personal Twitter account to note that he shared the “anger and pain” of Mr. Díaz’s colleagues about “deeply offensive comments” about the gay community. “We are currently reviewing all potential disciplinary scenarios,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement. “Nothing is off the table.” By Monday, Mr. Johnson, who is exploring a run for mayor, said his position had evolved, and he called for Mr. Díaz to resign. “My personal viewpoint is that he should resign. It’s unacceptable. It’s Trumpian,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Díaz’s remarks. “There’s no level of contrition. There’s no level of understanding of how hurtful this is. He has doubled down with his level of rhetoric.” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo did not call for Mr. Díaz to resign, but characterized his remarks as “outrageous” and “disrespectful.” Mayor Bill de Blasio said of Mr. Diaz, “Unless he apologizes, he should leave.” Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, did not directly call for a resignation, but suggested that Mr. Díaz be stripped of the chairmanship of the Council’s For-Hire Vehicles Committee, a critical role given the recent discussion over the impact of ride-hail services. Mr. Stringer also endorsed Amanda Farias, the director of a nonprofit, who came in second to Mr. Diaz in the Democratic primary in 2017, and has announced that she will run for the seat again in 2021. Other calls for his resignation, especially over social media, have spread quickly. David Kilmnick, president and chief executive of the New York LGBT Network, was among those demanding that Mr. Díaz step down. Far from being a compliment, Mr. Díaz’s remarks, first reported by NY1, are a “way to trigger people’s biases and instill fear,” he said. Robert Feldman, Mr. Díaz’s personal lawyer since the 1980s, said that his client is not homophobic. “He’s a very religious Pentecostal minister. That’s his faith,” said Mr. Feldman, who is gay and married. Mr. Feldman noted that Mr. Díaz has two brothers who are gay, and that he believes that Mr. Díaz is able to compartmentalize his faith and his personal interactions with gay people. “He sees us as powerful and competent,” Mr. Feldman said. In the interview at his district office, Mr. Díaz did refer to the power of the gay and lesbian community, but in a less complimentary way. “The L.G.B.T. community demands that Reverend Díaz resigns!” he said. “Look at how they start demanding and everybody starts roaring. Even my friends are abandoning me. I wish I could have that power, but I don’t.” He said that his stances against abortion and same-sex marriage have “created an antagonism toward me.” “My freedom of religion is being taken away,” he said. “So when they talk about tolerance, what exactly are they talking about?” Mr. Díaz’s son, when asked if his father should be expelled from the City Council, said that he had “no influence here.” “If it was up to me, he would have apologized already,” the son said. “I was raised that all actions have consequences.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Hotel by the River’ Review: A Poet Makes Amends, Fumblingly","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The South Korean director Hong Sang-soo is one of the most prolific directors in world cinema; he had two features at last year’s New York Film Festival alone. He’s also one of the most repetitive. And for those who know his movies, the experience of watching a new one — this month’s is “Hotel by the River” — is a bit like marking off a checklist. What kind of artist — acclaimed by the world but egotistical and perhaps secretly hapless — will the protagonist be? Here, Ki Joo-bong plays a poet named Younghwan, and one of the character’s sons is a filmmaker. How will the artist embarrass himself with women? Younghwan, who is staying at a hotel on the Han River for free, meets two female guests — Sanghee (Kim Min-hee) and Yeonju (Song Seon-mi) — on the snowy grounds. Introducing himself as, yes, the poet they’ve heard of, he keeps awkwardly telling them how beautiful they are. How long before heavy drinking brings out boorish male behavior? More than an hour of screen time, in this case, but the dynamic is set up early: Younghwan has summoned his two sons, Kyungsoo (Kwon Haehyo) and Byungsoo (Yu Junsang), to the hotel. He walked out on their mother and hasn’t seen either of them in years. He confesses to having death on his mind. To his admirers, Hong plays with theme and variation in the way that Eric Rohmer did, revealing subtleties of behavior. To his skeptics — a mild word in this context, since almost all of Hong’s films are wry enough to pass the time pleasantly — he explores his ideas in ways that have felt increasingly tossed off (opening text in “Hotel by the River” notes that the film was shot in about two weeks), and his micro-obsessions have given way to predictability. Each film is a standard cocktail of soju-fueled fumbling, calculated ambiguities and Hong mucking around with a zoom lens. The director seems to take a dig at that reputation midway through “Hotel by the River,” when Yeonju describes Byung-soo, the filmmaker, as “hardly a real auteur. He just seems very diligent.” But one advantage of being so repetitive is that you can catch regular viewers off-guard by breaking form. “Hotel by the River” is — surprisingly, from the standpoint of a skeptic — one of Hong’s most unexpectedly poignant works, self-reflexive in a way that feels searching rather than rote. Sanghee is getting over a breakup with a married man (the actress who plays her, Kim Min-hee, has been Hong’s muse of late onscreen and off), who has dumped her in a way that perhaps parallels Younghwan’s abandonment of his own wife. The gender-generation contrast gives “Hotel by the River” a pleasing, astringent symmetry, even if the film, shot in chilly black-and-white that makes this one of Hong’s most visually arresting movies, doesn’t quite overcome the slightness that characterizes even the director’s best work. It’s a film for fans of Hong, Rohmer and maybe Ingmar Bergman. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘How to Hide an Empire’ Shines Light on America’s Expansionist Side,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The word “empire” has a distinct place in the American lexicon: readily applicable to other countries but rarely, if ever, to the United States itself. Even in the spring of 2003, when American forces were occupying Iraq and Afghanistan and government officials were writing torture memos, the defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld seemed almost offended when a reporter asked whether the United States was engaged in anything like “empire-building.” “We’re not imperialistic,” Rumsfeld insisted. “We never have been. I can’t imagine why you’d even ask the question.” The tone of aggrieved incredulity may have been laid on a little thick, but Rumsfeld’s sentiment neatly aligned with how many Americans prefer to see their country — as a republic that was born from revolution and necessarily hostile to imperial rule. This self-image is “consoling, but it’s also costly,” Daniel Immerwahr writes in “How to Hide an Empire.” “At various times, the inhabitants of the U.S. Empire have been shot, shelled, starved, interned, dispossessed, tortured and experimented on. What they haven’t been, by and large, is seen.” Even today, barely half of mainland Americans know that Puerto Ricans are fellow citizens. Critics of American foreign policy have long accused the country of imperialism in a general sense — of meddling and bullying, starting wars and inciting coups — but Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, wants to draw attention to actual territory, to those islands and archipelagos too often sidelined in the national imagination. For decades, scholars have researched American colonialism in places like the Philippines and Puerto Rico; Immerwahr builds on their work to encourage a shift in the typical “mainland” perspective of American history, showing that “territorial empire” hasn’t been just an aberration but an inextricable part of the country’s fabric, woven throughout. To call this standout book a corrective would make it sound earnest and dutiful, when in fact it is wry, readable and often astonishing. Immerwahr knows that the material he presents is serious, laden with exploitation and violence, but he also knows how to tell a story, highlighting the often absurd space that opened up between expansionist ambitions and ingenuous self-regard. He divides the history into three phases. The first was the 19th-century period of westward expansion, including President Andrew Jackson’s forcible expulsion of Native Americans from their land. By the middle of the century the second phase was also beginning, as the United States started to notice enticing bits of territory outside the continent, including small islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific. These places were rocky, barren and devoid of people; what they offered was plenty of nitrogen-rich bird droppings, the better to remedy the “soil exhaustion” of a rapidly industrializing United States. The Guano Islands Act of 1856 decreed that whenever an American citizen found guano on an uninhabited, unclaimed island, “such island, rock or key may, at the discretion of the president, be considered as appertaining to the United States.” “It was an obscure word, ‘appertaining,’” Immerwahr writes, “as if the law’s writers were mumbling their way through the important bit.” It seemed to signal a discomfort, or at least the semblance of it. Soon enough, such official compunction was decidedly on the wane. Theodore Roosevelt, serving as William McKinley’s assistant secretary of the navy, pursued the Spanish-American War of 1898 with the zeal you would expect of someone who toted around a book called “Anglo-Saxon Superiority.” Immerwahr devotes several chapters to the ensuing five decades, as the United States annexed Puerto Rico and the Philippines, brutally crushing independence movements, torturing Filipino insurgents with “the water cure” and giving mainland doctors veritable carte blanche to treat Puerto Rico as a medical laboratory. Seen through Immerwahr’s lens, even the most familiar historical events can take on a startling cast. Take World War II in the Philippines: Pointing to the murderous combination of American shelling and Japanese slaughter of civilians, he calls the war “by far the most destructive event ever to take place on U.S. soil.” The role that racism played in the country’s colonial acquisitions was palpable but sometimes counterintuitive. While imperialists often spoke about “civilizing” the “savages,” some of the most ardent anti-imperialists in the 19th century were white supremacists like John C. Calhoun, the senator from South Carolina, who was wary of letting “any but the Caucasian race” into the Union. The 1867 purchase of Alaska from the Russians encountered similar resistance, with The Nation complaining about the prospect of “Exquimaux fellow citizens.” As Immerwahr tartly observes, “The deal went through only because, in the end, there weren’t that many ‘Exquimaux,’ and there was quite a lot of Alaska.” Immerwahr brings the narrative up to the present day, exploring the American decision to give up territory after World War II, which he calls “virtually unprecedented” — after all, victorious countries tended to do the opposite. But this “twilight of formal empire” wasn’t simply the result of American selflessness. Technological advances eroded the connection between power and land. Securing access to a raw material like rubber mattered less when you could manufacture a synthetic version of it. The big exception, of course, has been oil — “the one raw material that has most reliably tempted politicians back into the old logic of empire.” What the United States has now is a “pointillist empire”: specks of land scattered around the world that have served as military bases, staging grounds, detention facilities, torture sites. (The United States has 800 overseas bases, whereas Russia has nine; most countries have zero.) If Theodore Roosevelt was the swashbuckling emblem of the country’s formal empire, Herbert Hoover — “an astonishingly capable bureaucrat” before he became a not-very-capable president — represented the turn toward globalization, standardization and logistics. It’s a testament to Immerwahr’s considerable storytelling skills that I found myself riveted by his sections on Hoover’s quest for standardized screw threads, wondering what might happen next. But beyond its collection of anecdotes and arcana, this humane book offers something bigger and more profound. “How to Hide an Empire” nimbly combines breadth and sweep with fine-grained attention to detail. The result is a provocative and absorbing history of the United States — “not as it appears in its fantasies, but as it actually is.”",The New York Times
2019,‘How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World’ Review: A Series Scales Up,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “How to Train Your Dragon” may not be the most beloved of computer-animated franchises, but it is one of the most reliable. The latest installment, “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,” gives the now-trilogy a pleasing arc. In the first movie (2010), Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), through a secret friendship with a not-so-fearsome dragon, Toothless, broke with centuries of Viking tradition to bring about a cease-fire (and cease-firebreathing) in human-dragon affairs. In “How to Train Your Dragon 2” (2014), Hiccup refined his leadership skills, ending the movie as a worthy successor to his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the chief of Berk, and his mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett), a pioneer in dragon whispering. More bittersweet and less triumphal than its predecessors, and directed by a returning Dean DeBlois, “The Hidden World” concerns the exigencies that Hiccup faces as a leader, both politically and personally. If you truly love that dragon you trained, its message says, let him go. As the movie opens, Berk is, in Hiccup’s estimation, “the world’s first dragon-Viking utopia.” But it’s not so utopian: Overcrowding is a problem at mealtimes, and the high concentration of rescued dragons in the settlement has made Berk a target for hunters. The most fearsome of those is a new villain, Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham, chewing on the cartoon scenery), who lives for the thrill of the chase and is always one step ahead of Berk’s peace-loving populace. Should the residents hold strong, or must they abandon their centuries-old home? Is Berk just a state of mind? And is Hiccup finally ready for marriage with Astrid (America Ferrera)? Toothless, thought to be the last of his breed, meets a female counterpart and is quickly smitten. But is she on the level, or is Grimmel, who has Toothless in his sights, using her as bait? Never the most sophisticated of digital dynasties, plot-wise, “How to Train Your Dragon” makes the most of these questions. If you’ve spent any time with these characters, it’s hard not to get swept up in the saga, and it’s easy to be moved by the bond between Hiccup and Toothless, who is, in effect, a very loyal dog who can fly and harness the power of lightning bolts. The skill and detail with which the dragons have been rendered has only improved over the three films, and in sheer numbers, “The Hidden World” probably offers the most dragons per minute. The hidden world of the title — which Hiccup is searching for — is their secret ancestral homeland, depicted in glowing pastels that suggest a geological kinship with Pandora from “Avatar.” But mostly the movie aspires to be goofy fun. Hiccup plays Cyrano during Toothless’s mating dance with his mysterious lady-dragon friend. Several former Judd Apatow associates (Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are back as comic relief, although you suspect that some of them — along with Kit Harrington as a reformed dragon hunter and Butler — stopped by the recording studio only briefly. And unusually for a sequel, this installment has the courage to feel conclusive. The series has earned affection for its characters and its disarming premise. Now it’s time to let it go.

2019,‘How to Train Your Dragon’ Brings Hope to the Box Office,"Maybe the studios just needed a dragon this whole time. After several lackluster weeks at the box office, many have wondered when things would pick up this year. A step in the right direction came this weekend: Audiences turned “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World” into a bona fide hit. The third installation of Universal’s animated dragon series sold $55.5 million in tickets, exceeding most analysts’ expectations and giving the franchise the best opening weekend of any of its three movies. That figure is especially impressive given that the latest (and supposedly final) “Dragon” installment had a slightly lower budget than either of the previous movies — about $129 million, against $165 million for the original (2010) and $145 for the second (2014), according to Box Office Mojo. Also notable: The two best opening weekends this year have both been for the final installments of trilogies. Until this weekend, M. Night Shyamalan’s “Glass” held the top spot. That superhero thriller opened last month to about $41 million in its first weekend. The latest “Dragon” likely benefited from a lack of competition — it was the only newcomer in the box office’s top five this week — and strong reviews (it currently holds a 91% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Big-name voices probably helped, too: The series features Cate Blanchett and Gerard Butler as the parents of its protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and the “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harington lent their pipes to lesser roles (though Ben Kenigsberg, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that you suspect some of the actors “stopped by the recording studio only briefly”). [Read our critic’s review of “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.”] There’s a gulf in sales between “Dragon” and this weekend’s second-place movie: Fox’s “Alita: Battle Angel” brought in just $12 million this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That’s not a great second-week showing for a film that cost roughly $170 million to make. Since opening, the Robert Rodriguez-directed movie has grossed an estimated $60.7 million domestically. Landing in fourth place, after “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” grabbed third, was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s “Fighting With My Family,” the comedic drama based on the life of the professional wrestler Saraya-Jade Bevis (known as Paige and played here by Florence Pugh). It opened in Los Angeles and New York earlier this month, but it got its first taste of nationwide ticket sales this weekend, bringing in about $8 million. That’s respectable for a movie that had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival just last month and, according to The Hollywood Reporter, was produced for only about $11 million. The fact that Dwayne Johnson was a producer probably didn’t hurt.",The New York Times
2019,"‘I Am Now Your Mom’: On Twitter, a Pledge of Support for L.G.B.T. Youths","A California woman reached out to L.G.B.T. youths on Twitter, volunteering to be their mom, and an entire tribe of strangers showed up for family duty. Coming out as gay, bisexual or transgender is rarely easy, particularly for those who fear they will be rejected by their families and friends. At a time when bullying and hate crimes against L.G.B.T. people are on the rise, social media can often provide a refuge, where love, acceptance and pride are strongly encouraged. Be you, various posts declare. It gets better. #LoveWins. But even as legislative efforts to ban gay conversion therapy gain ground, and a record number of Americans approve of same-sex marriage, the L.G.B.T. community faces formidable headwinds from social conservatives galvanized by the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back transgender and gay rights and a Supreme Court newly dominated by conservatives. And the toll of intolerance can have fatal consequences: Gay youths are more than three times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight peers, a recent analysis found, while transgender adolescents are nearly six times as likely to try to end their lives. So it was that Quinn Cummings, a writer and mother in Los Angeles, came across the news this week about a West Virginia Republican delegate who likened the gay community to the K.K.K. and appeared to imply he would drown his children if he found out they were gay. Saddened by his comments, and concerned about the impact they might have on closeted youths, Ms. Cummings took to Twitter on Thursday morning to offer a message of support: What Ms. Cummings did not expect was for the volunteer family to grow. “I went in for a doctor’s appointment and when I came out there were hundreds of family members,” she said. Soon, an entire tribe of strangers showed up for family duty — dads, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, neighbors and those cool, old friends from mom’s college days, promising to bake banana bread (or gluten-free whatever), help with college applications, bedazzle clothes and make the holidays not traumatic again. (Just make sure to wash the dishes, please.) Ms. Cummings’s post generated nearly 30,000 likes and nearly 2,000 responses, including from L.G.B.T. youths who told of not being accepted by their families. “You never had to ask,” Ms. Cummings responded. “You’re our kid. Learn everything, stay safe and know that everyone on this thread is just so proud of you.”",The New York Times
2019,‘I Noticed a Young Woman Outside the Bank Who Was Clearly Struggling’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY An open door on East 86th Street, a modest proposal at Radio City Music Hall and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I took the subway home to the Upper East Side after having dinner with some friends. I got off at 86th Street. There is a bank on one of the corners there that is immediately visible when you come up out of the station. As I got to the top step, I noticed a young woman outside the bank who was clearly struggling to use her card to unlock the doors to the A.T.M.s. An older woman with a cane was coming out of the bank. She opened the door from the inside, and then held it so that the younger woman could come in. Rather than thanking the older woman, the younger woman began to berate her for letting someone who might not be a customer into the bank. The older woman smiled. “You’re not from New York, are you?” she said. — Wendy Katkin Dear Diary: Your landscape has changedGlass and steel dominateYou even got a new nameBut you’ll always be El Barrio to meFilled with childhood memoriesOf days spent under the blazing sunBodega quarter waters to quench our thirstSpraying down cars with open fire pumpsAnd summer nights spent on the blockLate-night dips in the pool at Jefferson ParkCatching flicks at the CosmoHot fritters from the cuchifrito spotChildren of the ghetto, stoop lifeLifelong lessons learned on your concrete streetsBut home is what you’ll always be to me. — Nori Perez Dear Diary: It was 1950. I was 18. So was Rita. We had met in high school. I was attending art school at night at Cooper Union. During the day I was working as an assistant for Maxwell Starr at his private art school on Central Park West in the West 80s. One of his students, Theresa, worked at the ticket window at Radio City Music Hall. Whenever Rita and I wanted to see a show, Theresa let us in free. Rita and I planned to get married, and I decided to propose to her at that majestic place. We went to a show and, afterward, we went downstairs to the lounge and found a quiet corner. I retrieved a ring from my pocket. It was a modest ring. It had belonged to my grandmother, whose family immigrated to America from Poland in the early 1900s. My mother had given it to me for this purpose. I presented the ring to Rita and asked her to marry me. She was thrilled, especially in that glorious setting. Later, we returned to our families’ apartments, a 15-minute walk apart in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Rita went to her mother’s bedroom and found her asleep. She woke her up and excitedly announced the proposal, showing her the ring. “For that you woke me up?” her mother said. — Irving Bender Dear Diary: It was 1986. I was fresh out of college and newly arrived in Manhattan to pursue my dream of becoming an advertising copywriter on Madison Avenue. I got an entry-level position at Launey, Hachmann & Harris. The job initially involved mostly answering phones and greeting clients getting off the elevator. It didn’t matter. I was thrilled to be starting my career in New York City. New York was a little rough around the edges then, but the cost of living was still relatively high. I was three months and six paychecks into the job when I realized there was no way I could make ends meet after rent (only $350!) in a shared Upper East Side apartment, student loan payments, food and other necessities. I’ll never forget summoning the courage to walk into Bob Launey’s office to explain my situation. He chuckled. “I wondered how long it was going to take you to figure out you couldn’t live in New York City on that,” he said. “What do you say to another $300 a month?” — Sean O’Connor Dear Diary: I had lived my whole life in New York until I moved to Madison, Wis., for a job 13 years ago. Several years ago, I began to return twice a year for meetings. In June, before the latest round of meetings, I visited a friend in New Jersey. We drove into New York to do some tourist things. We circled the West Side endlessly trying to find a parking spot. Finally, we thought we saw one on a block where there was construction going on. The parking-regulation signs were obscured by scaffolding, so I jumped out of the car to get a better look. No parking during construction. O.K., but it was Sunday, and no work was happening. Plus, cars were parked along the entire block. It seemed fine. I saw a parking enforcement officer down the street. I caught up to him, and, to my surprise, he followed me back to check whether our spot was O.K. He looked at the sign, shook his head and proceeded to ticket every car on the block. — Livia Asher Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘I Put My Hand in My Pocket and Found an Envelope I Had Forgotten to Mail’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Serendipity on a rainy Saturday, a pair of cheap black gloves and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: It was late afternoon on a rainy Saturday, and I had dashed out to do a few errands. Making my way along Nassau Street, I put my hand in my pocket and found an envelope I had forgotten to mail. I looked around for a mailbox, hoping to find one that still had pickup that day. Just then, I saw a mail carrier coming toward me pushing her bag. I smiled at her, envelope in hand. She grinned, nodded and extended her hand. My envelope was on its way. — Maryanne P. Braverman Dear Diary: When I was 17, I spent the winter running errands for a director at La MaMa on East Fourth Street. I was born in New York City but had grown up states away, and I never felt like less of a New Yorker than the year I moved back. “Would you run out to Duane Reade to get the rest of this list?” the director asked one afternoon as we folded programs near a paraffin heater. “Sure thing,” I said. “But what is Duane Reade?” She laughed as I put on my coat. “You don’t have gloves?” she said. “Here, take mine.” They were perfect, cheap and stretchy and plain black. They were the kind of gloves you would buy if you forgot your own better ones at home, the kind you lend to a stranger. I wore those gloves all February, until someone else needed them and I gave them away. Almost 10 years later, I was working 20 blocks north as an editorial assistant in the Flatiron district. My boss rolled into the office one day wearing a scarf I had never seen before. It suited him. “Someone gave it to me on the street,” he said. “I must have looked cold, because at the next crosswalk, someone gave me these.” He held out his hands. He was wearing those same cheap, stretchy, black gloves. — Kirsten Reach Dear Diary: I was on the High Line when an older couple approached me. They asked whether I knew how to get to Greenwich Village. I pointed them toward the entrance that was closest to where they wanted to go. They thanked me. “Are you from here?” they asked. “No,” I said. “We are!” they exclaimed. — Marcie Goodman Dear Diary: In January 1958 I moved to New York from Davenport, Iowa. I was 23 and starting a new job in the marketing department at Look magazine. I had no place to live. My father had advised me to take a cab from La Guardia into Manhattan and to ask the driver to take me to an apartment building off Broadway where I could get a temporary residence on a week-to-week basis. I did exactly as my father had suggested, and during the ride from the airport I told the cabdriver all about my life and how excited I was to be coming to live in New York. Ten years later, I was living in Detroit with my wife and two children and managing the Look sales office there when I came to New York for a business meeting. After the meeting ended and it was time to return home, I got a cab at 51st Street and Madison to take me to the airport. Halfway there, the cabdriver pulled to the side of road and turned around. “I know you,” he said. “You’re from Iowa and you work for Look magazine.” We had a great chat, and when we got to the airport, I have him a $5 tip. It was a lot at the time. — Alan Waxenberg Dear Diary: It was the usual weekend delay at the Grand Street station. When the B train finally arrived, riders packed in, scrambling for something — anything!— to hold on to. A woman wearing glasses lost her balance when the train jerked abruptly. She tipped backward into the back of a man facing away from her. The man turned and hit her in the face. Her glasses soared into the air. He cursed at her before quickly moving away. Everyone in the car was stunned into silence. The woman gathered herself. “Has anyone seen my glasses?” she asked. “I need them to see.” Everyone’s eyes shot around the car. A young woman next to me got down on her knees. I shined my phone flashlight under the seats. Someone yelled out that they’d found the glasses. “You’re bleeding,” someone else said to the woman. We all mobilized again. An older man fished a tissue out of his pocket. A younger man turned his backpack inside out and pulled out two bandages. “Thank you,” the woman said as she accepted the items and our expressions of solace. “It was only a matter of time before that guy exploded. It could’ve happened to anyone, so I’m glad it was at me, rather than somebody else.” When the train got to the next station, she sat down, looking calm rather than shaken. — Shinhee Kang Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,Opinion | ‘I Remember the First Time I Saw a Teenager Die’,"Scenes from the trauma bay haunt those of us who work to save the victims of gun violence. Mr. Curran is a third-year medical student. PHILADELPHIA — I remember the first time I saw a teenager die. He came to Temple University Hospital in the back of a police cruiser with three bullet holes in his chest. He was wearing bluejeans that had turned red. The nurses cut them off and threw them at the end of the bed. The bluejeans that were no longer blue dangled for a while, eventually falling into the puddle of blood collecting underneath them. After nothing more could be done to save him, the bed that held his thin body was rolled away, leaving streaks of blood across the floor. As a first-year medical student, this image haunted me. I think it always will. Over and over, young Americans from Parkland, Fla., to North Philadelphia are carried into ambulances and the back seats of police cars and rushed to a hospital. The emergency room nurses and doctors lift them onto stretchers. If they are awake, they may ask if they’re going to die. The doctor tells them no. Once inside, the trauma team yells out locations of holes in their body. The medical student tapes paper clips to each bullet wound so that they’re visible on X-ray. If the heart stops, doctors break through the sternum with a mallet and a chisel. Two gloved hands hold the heart and start to squeeze. More nurses and more doctors help inject medicines. They place paddles on the lifeless heart. If God or luck or physiology allows, it beats again. And then the wheels on the bed spin toward the operating room and leave those horrible red streaks on the floor, red shoe prints all around them. In the wake of the struggle to save a human life, a silent, splattered room remains. Gauze, tubes, shirts, gloves, pants, tape and sneakers lie scattered. Hospital workers come in and wash away the blood. They bring mops, towels, brushes and trash cans, and work with respect and grace, on hands and knees. The room must be cleaned quickly because another young victim could be wheeled in soon. I started photographing this room out of the helplessness and despair I felt about these senseless deaths. I wanted the violence to stop. I asked if I could hold a camera. Not to capture the dead and dying. They deserve privacy and respect. But I wondered if capturing and sharing the moments after lives are saved and lost could help Americans understand what is happening. I place plastic covers over my shoes. Sometimes I hear screams — the loved ones receiving news that their son or daughter, brother or sister, spouse or partner, has been shot to death. Temple University Hospital treated 481 patients with gunshot wounds last year, and 97 died. In this one hospital in one neighborhood in one city. As a country, we lost nearly 40,000 lives to guns in 2017. These images are here to show you what happens. And to inspire change. Because here, in America, shouldn’t bluejeans stay blue?

2019,"‘I Was Shocked,’ Says Campaign Consultant of Illegal Effort in House Race","RALEIGH, N.C. — The chief strategist for a Republican congressional candidate at the center of an election fraud inquiry told North Carolina officials on Tuesday that he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing, attempting to distance the campaign from the illegal machinations that drew the attention of state investigators. “I care deeply about the integrity of our democracy, and I’m not going to put up with that junk,” said the strategist, Andy Yates, appearing confident, careful and sometimes indignant during the second day of an evidentiary hearing about a voter turnout operation in the state’s Ninth Congressional District. The district is home to the last undecided House race of 2018. Mr. Yates’s turn on the witness stand came a day after Kim Strach, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said that investigators had found “a coordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme” that benefited Mark Harris, the Republican candidate who hired Mr. Yates. Mr. Harris had a 905-vote lead over his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, when state officials refused to certify his victory because of concerns about fraud. [A state official shared some of the election board’s conclusions on Monday.] Although Republicans have held the Ninth District’s House seat for more than a half century, it was in peril last fall, when Democrats were on the brink of making substantial gains in Congress and the party had fielded a candidate they felt was among the strongest in memory in the Ninth. But the election board, which has the power to decide whether to order a new election, found that a Republican operative oversaw an elaborately concealed get-out-the-vote effort they came to believe was endemic with fraud and misconduct to benefit Mr. Harris. According to Ms. Strach and the testimony that followed on Monday, L. McCrae Dowless Jr., the political contractor for the Harris campaign, orchestrated the effort. It included the handwritten completion of some ballots and, in violation of North Carolina law, the in-person collection of absentee ballots. In Bladen County, where Mr. Dowless primarily worked, Mr. Harris won 61 percent of the received absentee ballots, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted. According to Mr. Yates, who did not invoke his constitutional protection against self-incrimination or testify with immunity, Mr. Dowless repeatedly and explicitly pledged that his work was within the confines of state law, which generally forbids third parties from handling absentee ballots. “Mr. Dowless told me that he knew it was illegal to collect ballots and that he told all his workers that it was illegal to collect ballots, that they would never collect ballots, that he never touched or handled a ballot,” Mr. Yates said. “I was shocked and disturbed to learn that that appears that it was not the case. If that had ever become evident to me in the campaign, I would have immediately cut off all contact.” Still, Mr. Yates’s testimony risked feeding perceptions that the Harris campaign was negligent, by design or happenstance, in its dealings with Mr. Dowless, who had convictions for perjury and insurance fraud and had been the subject of scrutiny — but not prosecution — for his political work. The testimony, though, was a lengthy account of some of the Harris campaign’s interactions with Mr. Dowless, whose hiring was personally directed by the candidate. Mr. Harris has not been accused of personal wrongdoing, but investigators found that his campaign financed the illicit effort, with tens of thousands of dollars that passed through Mr. Yates’s consulting firm. On Tuesday, Mr. Yates acknowledged that he had been in regular contact with Mr. Dowless, and that Mr. Harris himself had spoken with Mr. Dowless regularly. But Mr. Yates asserted that he had not been aware of any misconduct and did not believe Mr. Harris had either. Mr. Harris is expected to testify as soon as Wednesday. On Monday, Mr. Dowless, through his lawyer, declined to testify. But testimony showed that Mr. Dowless operated with a certain autonomy in southeastern North Carolina, several hours from the Charlotte area where Mr. Harris lived and Mr. Yates worked. Mr. Yates, for instance, said he did not demand receipts from Mr. Dowless before reimbursing expenses, and he acknowledged that he had not conducted a criminal-background check on the man who was running a crucial prong of a high-stakes campaign. Lawyers for Mr. McCready have asserted that Mr. Dowless was hired precisely because of his “proven history of generating a strikingly high, and downright suspicious, share of absentee-by-mail votes.” On Tuesday, Marc E. Elias, a lawyer for Mr. McCready, pressed Mr. Yates over what a candidate’s hiring of a person like Mr. Dowless might indicate. “It would make me question their judgment,” Mr. Yates replied after a long pause. Minutes earlier, Mr. Yates said he would not have hired Mr. Dowless had he known of a record that included a perjury conviction. “I would have believed that you couldn’t trust them,” said Mr. Yates, who added that there would have been a political cost if such a hiring ever became public. Even after two days of hearings, the scope and consequences of Mr. Dowless’s efforts remain somewhat unclear. Mr. Dowless and his associates were linked to more than 1,000 absentee ballot requests, but a crucial witness for the state testified that she had handled only 30 to 40 ballots herself. Republicans maintained that, given that only a handful of ballots had been provably spoiled, the state board did not need to call for a new vote. “If at the end of the day the board were to throw out an election with a margin of 905 over 100 votes, I think it’d be unprecedented, and I think it’d be dangerous,” Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, said on Tuesday morning. “I’m not saying they have to have 905, but it’s got to be somewhere in the ballpark.” State law does not set a specific threshold and instead gives regulators wide discretion. The state board may order a new election if four of its five members conclude that “irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness.” Democrats are betting on the board, which includes three Democrats and two Republicans, adopting a broad view of the statute, and on Tuesday the North Carolina Democratic Party eagerly circulated an editorial from The Charlotte Observer, the primary newspaper in the state’s largest city, with a headline that declared the “hearing isn’t over, but it’s over.” “Ninth District voters,” the newspaper wrote, “deserve the confidence of an election free from fraud.”",The New York Times
2019,‘If Beale Street Could Talk’ Offers a Tour of a Lost New York,"The film, directed by Barry Jenkins and nominated for three Academy Awards, was adapted from the 1974 James Baldwin novel and shot largely on the city’s streets. If you ask even a longtime New Yorker for directions to Minetta Lane, you will likely be met with a blank stare. The quaint one-way street, nestled in the heart of Manhattan’s Greenwich Village between Sixth Avenue and Macdougal Street, is only a few blocks from the wonderfully frenetic Washington Square Park, but it remains largely unknown. Still, it feels timeless. For Barry Jenkins, director of the film “If Beale Street Could Talk,” which was adapted from the 1974 James Baldwin novel and tells the story of love and injustice in 1970s New York, largely in the African-American cultural mecca of Harlem and what was then a more rough-and-tumble Greenwich Village, capturing the New York City of yesteryear was paramount. “I knew this was going to be an intimate film,” Mr. Jenkins said in a recent interview. “This is a period piece about New York. It’s James Baldwin’s sometimes acrimonious love letter to New York, but a love letter nonetheless.” New York has, of course, changed dramatically since the 1970s. Local institutions like B. Altman and Horn & Hardart are no longer part of the landscape. Entire neighborhoods have become denser and more vertical. However, on foot, remnants of the past still stick out, providing a sensory overload that is distinctly New York. While many of the rough spots in Greenwich Village have been smoothed out over the years, many scenes in the film were still shot there, and other neighborhoods — within walking distance or an easy subway ride away — were able to stand in. Throughout the city, narrow streets, urban parks and restaurants that have seen better days give a sense of the time and place that the novel and the movie sought to convey. To visually reflect the richness of Baldwin’s prose, Mr. Jenkins worked closely with the film’s production designer, Mark Friedberg, and Samson Jacobson, the locations manager, both native New Yorkers. “I leaned on those guys to not only try and find what places are organically part of the world of our characters, but also are New York, in all caps,” Mr. Jenkins said. In the film, a pivotal scene between main characters Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) at the intersection of Minetta Lane and Minetta Street, reflected such a sentiment and revealed New York as a place of promise, despite the many obstacles that both characters would soon face. “The Minetta scene was interesting because it was pouring rain,” Mr. Jenkins said. “This wasn’t our intention in the script, but on the day of filming these two young black actors who are unfamiliar to many people were just walking down the block on the night of essentially their first love and the skies have opened. It’s so picturesque, like 1950s Hollywood Americana.” If you visit Greenwich Village now, you’ll see a mishmash of boutiques and local restaurants, especially on the side streets like Charles Street and Greenwich Avenue, roads that don’t adhere to the uniform Manhattan street grid. Longtime music haunts like Village Vanguard and the Bitter End remain. In the novel, Greenwich Village is richly narrated in Tish’s voice, who observes not only the layout of Washington Square Park, but the eclectic people who have defined its existence. “We passed Minetta Tavern, crossed Minetta Lane, passed the newspaper stand on the next corner, and crossed diagonally into the park, which seemed to huddle in the shadow of the heavy new buildings of N.Y.U. and the high new apartment buildings on the east and the north. We passed the men who had been playing chess in the lamplight for generations, and people walking their dogs, and young men with bright hair and very tight pants, who looked quickly at Fonny and resignedly at me. We sat down on the stone edge of the dry fountain, facing the arch.” Fonny tells Tish that he used to occasionally sleep in the park. Filming for the Washington Square Park scenes actually took place at Stuyvesant Square Park near the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village development on the East Side of Manhattan. Washington Square Park, with its 1892 triumphal arch, remains a magnet for chess players and social activism. Its large size allows it to thrive as a universal meeting place of sorts, while Stuyvesant Square Park, located between East 15th and East 17th Streets and bisected by Second Avenue, is a much smaller park. “Washington Square Park doesn’t look at all like their Washington Square Park,” Mr. Friedberg said. “It looks like Versailles right now compared to the Washington Square Park that Fonny slept in. We ended up shooting in Stuyvesant park, which was also nice, but had the old benches and wrought iron.” Tish, who was employed in a department store, worked tirelessly through her pregnancy. Bergdorf Goodman, the luxury retailer on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, allowed scenes to be filmed in their store, but with a caveat. “They were really cool about us shooting there, but we had to get there when they closed and be out of there before they opened,” Mr. Friedberg said. After a lot of prodding, Mr. Friedberg was able to film in El Quijote, the Spanish restaurant at the Hotel Chelsea which operated for 88 years before it closed last year. (There are tentative plans for the restaurant, at 226 West 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood, to reopen after a renovation.) In the film, El Quijote stood in for El Faro, a long-gone Spanish restaurant that was located at the corner of Greenwich and Horatio streets in Greenwich Village. Fonny has a basement apartment on Bank Street in the West Village, which was extensively designed by Mr. Friedberg on a sound stage to resemble an older apartment, complete with a bathtub in the kitchen. In the novel, Tish is accosted at a market on Bleecker Street by a deranged man, which resulted in Fonny defending her and subsequently being framed for rape by a racist police officer; the filming for those dramatic scenes was completed on location in the Bronx. On Arthur Avenue, the “Little Italy” of the Bronx, located south of Fordham Road, a few minutes from the Fordham Road station (B and D lines) and the Fordham Metro North station, excellent pizzerias, delis and bakeries remain a way of life. It is a perfect stand-in for 1960s-era Greenwich Village. “The area still has the last bit of its Italian commercial culture,” Mr. Friedberg said. “Also, like Greenwich Village, the streets don’t perfectly line up in that area.” From 1958 to 1961, Baldwin himself lived in an apartment at 81 Horatio Street in Greenwich Village. However, he was born and raised in Harlem, the cultural nexus of the novel and the film. (From Greenwich Village, Harlem is an easy ride uptown on the New York City subway, with express service on the A and No. 2 and 3 lines and the 125th Street stations serving as gateways to the heart of the neighborhood.) Tish and Fonny first meet as children in Harlem. On film, we see them as adults, walking in Riverside Park, with the Hudson River and the sounds of the Henry Hudson Parkway in the distance. When Tish finds out that she is pregnant and is comforted by her mother, Sharon Rivers (Regina King), her family invites Fonny’s family to their apartment to tell them the news about the impending baby. The apartment scenes were filmed on location in Harlem, in a townhouse near St. Nicholas Park, which runs alongside St. Nicholas Avenue from West 128th to West 141st Streets. When Daniel Carty (Brian Tyree Henry) runs into Fonny on Lenox Avenue near 123rd Street, it feels like a family reunion of sorts; it goes back to the theme of Harlem as this unifying force for African-Americans. They were in a neighborhood filled with brownstones and grand avenues that also produced Baldwin and was at the heart of the Harlem Renaissance. While Harlem experienced a high level of urban decay in the 1970s, which Baldwin details, it still is seen as a force more positive than not throughout the film. Reflecting on some of the most memorable film locations in the city, Mr. Jenkins honed in on the Showmans Jazz Club on 125th Street near Convent Avenue in Harlem, which featured a scene with Joseph Rivers (Colman Domingo) and Frank Hunt (Michael Beach), two fathers sitting at a bar, trying to figure out how to save Fonny from a jail sentence. The bar impressed Mr. Jenkins during the film preproduction, and made it into the film. “Showmans is a place where I would go to unwind if I lived in the neighborhood,” he said. “It’s one of my favorite Harlem locations because it’s still there. The essence and spirit of your work really comes alive when you can get a lot of the city into a film.” Follow John L. Dorman on Twitter: @jon425.

2019,‘Insult to China’: A Model’s Freckles Spark an Online Storm,"HONG KONG — Jing Wen, 25, has modeled for Chanel and Prada and appeared on the cover of Vogue in China and Italy. But on Chinese social media, images of her freckled face have provoked a storm of outrage and abuse, spreading under the hashtag “Insult to China.” The model, known in China by her full name, Li Jingwen, appears in a campaign for the Spanish fashion brand Zara with her lips a striking crimson and the rest of her face bare — leaving her freckles on full display. The online response in China, where freckles are relatively uncommon and fashion images favor smoothly pale skin, has been fierce. Some users have accused Zara of imposing white beauty standards on Chinese women; others have come to Ms. Li’s defense and questioned the ideals driving the backlash. One commenter objecting to the image wrote, “Why are freckled faces misconstrued as high fashion?” “So that’s how you see Asian women?” another added. “I’ve lost all desire to buy things.” A third said the image was “just the West’s beauty standards for Asians, very different from ours,” adding, “For those women to be called the most beautiful in Asia feels like discrimination to the rest of us.” But Ms. Li also had her defenders. “This Chinese model has received the worst malice from her own people,” one response said. Another commenter wrote, “I feel it’s not the brand discriminating against Asian women, but people discriminating against people with freckles.” Maya Yu Zhang, a 27-year-old Chinese filmmaker, said the anger at the images stemmed from a desire for global brands to portray them in familiar ways, according to their own beauty standards. Ms. Zhang, who is based in New York, has made films exploring conformist notions of beauty, including one that includes her own mother insisting that she get beauty marks removed. “Chinese people sometimes forget how diverse we actually are,” she said. “We’re not a monolith.” She also expressed hope that the tenor of the debate would become more open-minded. Ma Heqi, a 24-year-old from Dalian, a city in northeast China, said she had tried to remove her freckles — known as “sparrow marks” in China — with laser therapy. “Even though I went overseas to study, I still find the existence of freckles on my face quite unpleasant,” she said, adding that some had called them “pockmarks.” Jia Tan, an assistant professor of cultural studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, noted that there was a long tradition that “measures nonwhite women’s beauty according to its approximation to white beauty,” with depictions sometimes veering into the territory of racist tropes. However, she said, the online backlash in this case “fell right into the rhetoric of nationalism and patriotism.” Chinese state-run news media covered the controversy, but seemed disinclined to whip up further outrage. An opinion writer in China Daily, an official English-language broadsheet, accused online critics of the Zara images of “over-sensitivity and a lack of cultural confidence,” while an op-ed in China Youth Daily, published by the Communist Youth League, called for an overhaul in beauty standards. “Some people can see Li Jingwen’s distinctive beauty, while others read it as ‘an insult to China,’ ” Yang Xinyu wrote in China Youth Daily. “The contrast begs an interrogation of our aesthetic ideals.” Ms. Li, a photographer herself, has not publicly commented on the response to the Zara images, but she did speak about her freckles in a 2016 interview with Vogue. “When I was little, I really hated them because normally Asians don’t have them,” she said. “In high school, I always tried to cover them, but now it’s O.K. I like them, and that’s enough.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Isn’t It Romantic’ Review: Rebel Wilson Mocks, and Obeys, Rom-Com Rules","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Isn’t It Romantic” is the second comedy in less than a week, after “What Men Want,” in which a woman gains the power to improve her life following a concussion. Natalie (Rebel Wilson), an architect whose colleagues treat her as a doormat, disdains romance and hates it in movies. Her appearance is played for laughs. (A halal vendor implores her to stop his runaway cart with her body.) Then, in the process of foiling a mugger, she smacks into a metal beam in a subway station and wakes up to find herself in a romantic-comedy version of New York, filled with clean air, flowers and cupcakes. She has a meet-cute with a Hemsworth (Liam). Her dog is suddenly obedient. Her newly capacious apartment looks like the 21st-century equivalent of a Doris Day pad. (The title’s nod to Rodgers and Hart notwithstanding, “Isn’t It Romantic” mostly operates on the assumption that rom-coms were invented in 1990 with “Pretty Woman.”) And her mousy best friend, Josh (Adam Devine), who was always encouraging her to be confident, has his own meet-cute with a woman who is both a yoga ambassador and swimsuit model (Priyanka Chopra). In short, the movie invites the screenwriters — Erin Cardillo, Dana Fox and Katie Silberman — to do their worst, cliché-wise, and then to mock themselves. Some of the parody lands, such as a running joke about how Natalie is trapped in a PG-13 world, where her foul language is dependably bleeped out by street traffic and prim edits elide her efforts to have sex. The director, Todd Strauss-Schulson, who had a way with projectile gags in “A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas,” keeps things visually lively whenever the film turns into a stealth musical. (“How did everyone know the choreography?” Natalie asks Josh after a bar crowd joins in her killer karaoke rendition of Whitney Houston.) Wilson, leaning on her comic persona to compensate for the script’s lack of wit or inventiveness, is a reliable deadpanner. Her one-liners — calling the alternate universe she’s trapped in “‘The Matrix’ for lonely women,” for example — are funny enough to carry this featherweight movie as far as it can go, which isn’t far. The film’s reliance on conventions even as it snickers at them gives it the faint air of a con. “Isn’t It Romantic” is designed to leave viewers feeling lightheaded and forgetful. That dizzy sensation could be love — or a mild head injury. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘It Began to Pour as I Started Across Town. I Had Neither an Umbrella nor a Rain Hat.’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Unprepared for a sudden downpour, an enthusiastic recommendation at Zabar’s and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: On weekends, I try to allow extra time to get from Queens to Manhattan by subway. But on this particular day I had not realized how far I would have to walk from the station to the West Village theater where I was going. It began to pour as I started across town. I had neither an umbrella nor a rain hat and was holding a magazine over my small wool hat to try to keep myself dry. As I approached Seventh Avenue, I decided to double-check that I was headed in the right direction so I wouldn’t go out of my way so close to curtain time. I stopped a man walking toward me, pointed in what I thought was the direction of Christopher Street and asked for confirmation. “Yes,” he said. “That’s Christopher Street.” I thanked him and started to hurry off. “Wait ma’am,” he said. “Take this.” He held out his large black umbrella. “But it’s yours,” I sputtered. “Now it’s yours,” he replied. — Rachel Donner Dear Diary: I was sitting in a terminal at La Guardia Airport waiting for a flight to Buffalo. The area was hot, crowded and stuffy. People were sitting wherever they could. I dozed off. When I opened my eyes I saw a nun sitting at a table across from me. She was looking at me. “I do not know what path to follow,” she said. “There are many paths,” I said. “Just choose one.” “I don’t know why I am reading this book,” she said. “Because it is a distraction,” I said. “And we all need distractions.” “What should I do now?” she asked. “Just put one foot ahead of the other.” I said. And then my plane was called. — Raymond Vegso Dear Diary: I was at a local discount store. It was filled from floor to ceiling with everything from shampoo to mops to underwear. I spotted the item I wanted on the topmost row of a hanging display. I looked around for one of those grabbing poles that could help me pull it down, but I didn’t see one. There weren’t any employees around either. I was considering my options when a woman stepped up next to me and pointed to her shoulder. I was perplexed. She put my hand on her shoulder and pointed to a ledge I could hoist myself up on. “Are you sure?” I asked. She nodded. Balancing myself on her shoulder, I was able to reach up and grab the item. “Thanks so much,” I said. We both smiled and went on about our browsing. — Diane Kirschner Dear Diary: I had an appointment to see an apartment and, according to Google Maps, had left exactly enough time to get there from work. Of course, I got there late and missed the appointment completely when the real estate agent had to go home. I was in the Barclays Center subway station. I began to feel overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to find a permanent place to live. I started to cry. The R wasn’t coming, so I decided to walk to Fulton Street to get the G. I was still crying when I walked onto the platform at the station there. A woman smiled at me. Embarrassed, I averted my eyes and brushed past her. “Are you O.K.?” I heard her ask. I stopped and removed my headphones. She was sitting on a bench. “What?” I said. “Are you O.K.?” She patted the seat next to her. “From one human to another,” she said. “What’s up?” I sat down beside her and, still crying, began to explain everything. We talked until, at some point, I started to laugh. When the train arrived, we got on together. And then we got off at the same stop. It turned out she had lived in my neighborhood for 15 years. — Molly Burdick Dear Diary: My mother and I were shopping at Zabar’s. A tall man appeared next to us. “Have you tried their stuffed cabbage yet?” he asked. We paused to comprehend his question. Noticing the look of surprise on our faces, he smiled. “They are really good,” he said. “Come this way.” Following him through the store, we soon arrived at a container with two stuffed cabbages and some tomato sauce. He pointed at the container. “This one, this is very good.” he said. I was still puzzled by his enthusiasm and wondered if there was anything special in the cabbages. “What’s inside?” I asked. “You know, meat, like hamburger meat,” he said. I looked at my mother. “Yeah,” she said, “I know.” “O.K.,” I said. “I’ll try.” Once my mother had put the container in her basket, he looked satisfied. “Enjoy,” he said, and then disappeared. — Aiko Setoguchi Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘It Has Stuck With Me 35 Years’: 11 Childhood Memories of Blackface and Other Racist Incidents,"Readers reveal racist behavior they committed or witnessed as children and reflect on how it affects them today. The blackface performances that 68-year-old Bernie Oakley remembers from the 1960s weren’t held during booze-fueled college fraternity parties. They were held at fund-raisers for local schools. And his father, who considered himself an anti-racist Sunday school teacher, was the M.C. Mr. Oakley was one of about 75 readers who wrote to tell us about their memories of witnessing or participating in blackface or other racist behavior when they were young. After Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia admitted, then denied, being in a photo that included someone in blackface and that appeared in his medical school yearbook, we asked readers to tell us about similar memories. ((Read more about the presence of blackface and other racist imagery in college yearbooks.)) Many recalled seeing or participating in racist activities at school, where it was sanctioned by adult role models, when they were children. Their memories, spanning seven decades from 1940 to 2010, chronicle the evolution and persistence of racist episodes within schools and among groups of children. Several described struggling to reconcile their enjoyment of those things with their anti-racist beliefs and to unlearn what they were taught. Here are some of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. In the comments, tell us if you have similar memories as a child, and how they affect you today. (In some instances, we have replaced a common racist slur with _____.) My mother, my sister and I spent the entire summer of 1942 in Mississippi. I recall vividly boarding an empty bus with my younger sister en route to our house after a day at camp. After paying our fare, we plopped down in seats four or five rows behind the driver. He promptly motioned for us to move to the most forward seats near him, like a teacher admonishing us for talking in class. We soon learned why. The bus filled to the brim with black people, who all had to sit or stand behind the only white people on the bus: two kids, 10 and 11 years old. The unfairness of this did penetrate my young mind. I was fortunate to spend most of my life in a Northeast university environment, where admissions of blacks in the 1960s forced me to confront, in myself, the intrinsic and often unconscious prejudices we Northerners carry. But even now, in retirement at age 88, the blackface stories from Virginia and elsewhere are giving me angst. I really did enjoy the comedy of earlier years; remember Rochester in the Jack Benny show? We laughed and felt no animosity toward blacks, but now — helped by the current news — I can see that we were unaware of how hurtful the stereotyping would be to a person of color. In the late 50s, when I was 8 or 9 years old, I remember attending minstrel shows put on as fund-raisers for schools. My father was the M.C. of these shows. They were a very popular event in my hometown, Burlington, N.C. On the stage would be a line of people sitting in chairs. Each person would have a talent that they would perform for the show. At each end of the line were two white men in blackface who would tell slightly off-color jokes in an exaggerated, Southern, black dialect. I enjoyed the shows. They were very entertaining. Of course, I now know how offensive those portrayals of black men really were. They were the perfect example of black men being depicted as not-very-smart clowns. At the time I was proud of my father. He was a Sunday school teacher in our Methodist church. From a very early age, he taught me to reject the racial discrimination and segregation in our town. I told my 40-year-old son the story of the minstrel shows a week ago. He was surprised to find his grandfather’s role was so prominent. He only knew my dad as a very liberal Democrat who loved to make fun of conservative Republicans. I was a 12-year-old kid at my cousins’ school-sanctioned minstrel show near Providence, R.I., where many kids were in blackface. I thought nothing of it, because like legions of others back then, I lacked the sensitivity to understand how hurtful that behavior could be. But when is this witch hunt that started in Virginia going to end? We’ve all done insensitive things, but it seems if we all want some tender mercy for our own misdeeds, we better be willing to give some. I am from a small town in Minnesota. When I was a preschooler in the 1950s, we all sang the ubiquitous “Ring Around the Rosy” that ended with “Last one down is a _____baby.” I am horrified that we were ever taught this version. I am aghast to this day. In 1963, when I was in seventh grade in Lake Arrowhead, Calif., I had a minor role in a high-school production of a play about Helen Keller. I wore black makeup on my face and the back of my hands and was taught to speak my lines in a warped Southern “slave” accent. There were no black students in our school nor any black families in the district, but the teacher/director chose to leave the parts in and find kids to play them. While the makeup was not exaggerated blackface, it was apparent that I was a white kid in makeup. I wanted to be a part of the show and accepted the role as all I would get after not being chosen to play Helen Keller. I felt false. I never believed in the accuracy or authenticity of my character. But being part of the magic of a theatrical production made me decide to do it. I feel sorry now. We should have made the teacher change the role. During the summers, my main entertainment in hot, very humid New Orleans was swimming at a pool. After legislation deemed that the city pools had to become integrated, the local government decided to close them. The bigotry affected every citizen whose right to utilize the pools had been taken away. I have no interest in ever returning to New Orleans because despite its marvelous cuisine and rich historical sights it left me with sad and embarrassing memories. When I was growing up in southern Louisiana in the 1970s, the word “_____” was used nearly every day around me. When an adult had to develop an alternate way of accomplishing something/making it work, especially if it looked bad or was done in a “lazy” way, it was always termed “_____-rigged.” I am a proud inventor as an adult woman. I love problem-solving and learning about electronics, machine or car repair because I am very curious. But 40 years later, my inescapable first thought is to call it “_____-rigging.” I was also taught to sing “Eeny Meeny Miny Mo” to include “catch a _____ by the toe.” I don’t know how I escaped this indoctrination. It’s plainly and simply disgusting to me today. My high school — South High School in Denver, Colorado — had Johnny Reb as our mascot. Confederate flags flew at all of our school events. I have a picture of my car in our senior year homecoming parade with a purple Confederate flag painted on the hood. NO adult (parents, teacher or otherwise) in my life thought to clue me in to how racist this was. This still angers me and pains me. I can only imagine what black students and their parents at my school experienced and felt about all of this. I remember being in fourth grade in West Seneca, N.Y., and having to race the only kid of color in our school for P.E. class. I was not popular; I was fat, and awkward. But this kid, because he was poor and black, was less liked than I. When the race began, a couple of kids held onto his shirt and started singing “Fight, fight, the _____ and the white, one is black and the other is right.” The P.E. teacher stopped the race, and we had to start all over again. I don’t remember if anyone was reprimanded for what happened. But it was so unsettling that it has stuck with me 35 years later. I don’t think this young boy stayed at my school for much longer. I often wonder what happened to him. It makes me sad. We were driving back to Maryland through Pennsylvania in 1996 after a family visit; I was about 8 years old. I saw a large cross on fire that stood in stark contrast to the night sky. I thought it was beautiful and pointed it out, thinking it was something done to show religious pride. My mother told me it was the work of evil men, men who were not Christlike at all in their violence and hate. I didn’t even know what the K.K.K. was. How sad it is that nobody taught me about racism or slavery or civil rights before then. It makes me feel ashamed of myself for not being a more curious child, and shame on my community for keeping us in a state of ignorance until we were “old enough to understand and not be traumatized by it.” Indigenous students were treated very poorly in my entire public school experience in Bismarck, N.D. Some kids from my school made T-shirts for a football game against another school with a high indigenous population. The slogan on the shirt read “Pack the Bowl, Clear the Rez.” It showed a pipe being cleaned out over the Bismarck Community Bowl, the field where they played homecoming games, and racist drawings of indigenous people falling out onto the field. “Clear the Rez” was a particularly chilling thing to invoke in a state with a history of forced assimilation and genocide of indigenous folks. Ask any non-Native American adult in Bismarck for their best impression of an “Indian voice.” Almost everyone there will give you the exact same racist skit about people from the town of Fort Yates. It is so normalized there that I had no idea people everywhere in the United States didn’t feel like that. After going to school at Bismarck High, I had to unpack and unlearn some awful phrases and attitudes. Even though I knew these things were racist, it was hard to get them out of my mind for years. My parents raised me to stand up for people being picked on, but I didn’t do it as much as I should have. Sometimes I would argue, but I was a gay transgender kid in a very hostile town to that, and as much as I tried to stand up for everyone, I really failed at that sometimes. I am deeply ashamed.

2019,‘It Is Not a Closet. It Is a Cage.’ Gay Catholic Priests Speak Out,"The crisis over sexuality in the Catholic Church goes beyond abuse. It goes to the heart of the priesthood, into a closet that is trapping thousands of men. CreditCredit MILWAUKEE — Gregory Greiten was 17 years old when the priests organized the game. It was 1982 and he was on a retreat with his classmates from St. Lawrence, a Roman Catholic seminary for teenage boys training to become priests. Leaders asked each boy to rank which he would rather be: burned over 90 percent of his body, paraplegic or gay. Each chose to be scorched or paralyzed. Not one uttered the word “gay.” They called the game the Game of Life. The lesson stuck. Seven years later, he climbed up into his seminary dorm window and dangled one leg over the edge. “I really am gay,” Father Greiten, now a priest near Milwaukee, remembered telling himself for the first time. “It was like a death sentence.” The closet of the Roman Catholic Church hinges on an impossible contradiction. For years, church leaders have driven gay congregants away in shame and insisted that “homosexual tendencies” are “disordered.” And yet, thousands of the church’s priests are gay. The stories of gay priests are unspoken, veiled from the outside world, known only to one another, if they are known at all. Fewer than about 10 priests in the United States have dared to come out publicly. But gay men probably make up at least 30 to 40 percent of the American Catholic clergy, according to dozens of estimates from gay priests themselves and researchers. Some priests say the number is closer to 75 percent. One priest in Wisconsin said he assumed every priest was gay unless he knows for a fact he is not. A priest in Florida put it this way: “A third are gay, a third are straight and a third don’t know what the hell they are.” Two dozen gay priests and seminarians from 13 states shared intimate details of their lives in the Catholic closet with The New York Times over the past two months. They were interviewed in their churches before Mass, from art museums on the weekend, in their apartments decorated with rainbow neon lights and between classes at seminary. Some agreed to be photographed if their identities were concealed. Almost all of them required strict confidentiality to speak without fear of retribution from their bishops or superiors. A few had been expressly forbidden to come out or even to speak about homosexuality. Most are in active ministry, and could lose more than their jobs if they are outed. The church almost always controls a priest’s housing, health insurance and retirement pension. He could lose all three if his bishop finds his sexuality disqualifying, even if he is faithful to his vows of celibacy. The environment for gay priests has grown only more dangerous. The fall of Theodore E. McCarrick, the once-powerful cardinal who was defrocked last week for sexual abuse of boys and young men, has inflamed accusations that homosexuality is to blame for the church’s resurgent abuse crisis. Studies repeatedly find there to be no connection between being gay and abusing children. And yet prominent bishops have singled out gay priests as the root of the problem, and right-wing media organizations attack what they have called the church’s “homosexual subculture,” “lavender mafia,” or “gay cabal.” Even Pope Francis has grown more critical in recent months. He has called homosexuality “fashionable,” recommended that men with “this deep-seated tendency” not be accepted for ministry and admonished gay priests to be “perfectly responsible, trying to never create scandal.” This week, Pope Francis will host a much-anticipated summit on sex abuse with bishops from around the world. The debate promises to be not only about holding bishops accountable but also about homosexuality itself. “It really never was my shame. It was the church’s shame. They’re the ones that should have the shame for what they have done to myself and many, many other L.G.B.T. people.” Father Greg Greiten “My family does not know that I struggle with this. I’ve never told them. I believe the church’s teaching on marriage, sexuality — just trying to understand what it means for me. It may sound kind of strange. I feel like, what I struggle with, I hope I can help other Catholics not lose their faith.” “This is my life,” a parish priest in the Northeast said. “You feel like everyone is on a witch hunt now for things you have never done.” Just a few years ago, this shift was almost unimaginable. When Pope Francis uttered his revolutionary question, “Who am I to judge?” in 2013, he tempted the closet door to swing open. A cautious few priests stepped through. But if the closet door cracked, the sex abuse crisis now threatens to slam it shut. Widespread scapegoating has driven many priests deeper into the closet. “The vast majority of gay priests are not safe,” said Father Bob Bussen, a priest in Park City, Utah, who was outed about 12 years ago after he held Mass for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. “Life in the closet is worse than scapegoating,” he said. “It is not a closet. It is a cage.” Even before a priest may know he is gay, he knows the closet. The code is taught early, often in seminary. Numquam duo, semper tres, the warning goes. Never two, always three. Move in trios, never as a couple. No going on walks alone together, no going to the movies in a pair. The higher-ups warned for years: Any male friendship is too dangerous, could slide into something sexual or could turn into what they called a “particular friendship.” “You couldn’t have a particular friendship with a man, because you might end up being homosexual,” explained a priest, who once nicknamed his friends “the P.F.s.” “And you couldn’t have a friendship with a woman, because you might end up falling in love, and they were both against celibacy. With whom do you have a relationship that would be a healthy human relationship?” Today, training for the priesthood in the United States usually starts in or after college. But until about 1980, the church often recruited boys to start in ninth grade — teenagers still in the throes of puberty. For many of today’s priests and bishops over 50, this environment limited healthy sexual development. Priests cannot marry, so sexuality from the start was about abstinence, and obedience. “I was in my 50s when I came out. I entered the seminary at 18, a young, enthusiastic, white, male virgin who doesn’t know anything, let alone straight or gay. There were years that I carried this secret. My prayer was not that, would God change me. It was that I would die before anyone found out.” Father Bob Bussen “When I was in the eighth grade, there were three things I could do. I could be a truck driver like my dad. I could be a doctor, I wasn’t smart enough for that. But I was gay, so the only other thing left was, I could be a priest.” The sexual revolution happening outside seminary walls might as well have happened on the moon, and national milestones in the fight for gay rights, like the Stonewall riots, on Mars. One priest in a rural diocese said the rules reminded him of how his elementary school forced left-handed students to write with their right hand. “You can be taught to act straight in order to survive,” he said. “I can still remember seeing a seminarian come out of another’s room at 5 a.m. and thinking, isn’t it nice, they talked all night,” the same priest said. “I was so naïve.” Priests in America tend to come out to themselves at a much later age than the national average for gay men, 15. Many gay priests spoke of being pulled between denial and confusion, finally coming out to themselves in their 30s or 40s. Father Greiten was 24 when he realized he was gay and considered jumping from his dorm window. He did not jump, but confided his despair in a classmate. His friend came out himself. It was a revelation: There were other people studying to be priests who were gay. It was just that no one talked about it. He reached out to a former seminary professor who he thought might also be a gay man. “There will be a time in your life when you will look back on this and you’re going to just love yourself for being gay,” Father Greiten remembered this man telling him. “I thought, ‘This man must be totally insane.’” But he had discovered the strange irony of the Catholic closet — it isn’t secret at all. “It’s kind of like an open closet,” Father Greiten said. “It’s the making of it public, and speaking about it, where it becomes an issue.” One priest, whose parish has no idea he is gay, remembered a backyard cocktail party a few years ago where fellow priests were saying “vile” things about a gay bishop. He intervened, and came out to them. He lost three friends that night. “I broke the code by announcing to them that I was gay,” he said. “It was a conspiracy of silence.” That is a reason many of the men are out to only a few close friends. The grapevine has taught them which priests in their diocese are gay, whom to trust and whom to fear. “This is not the whole story of who I am. But if you don’t want to know this about me, do you really want to know me? It’s a question I’d invite the people of God to ponder.” Father Steve Wolf “I was probably 40 when I came out to my family, and to some lay friends. Before then, I was out to certain classmates. I realized this is not a me issue. This is a human rights issue. If I were outed, I wouldn’t lie. But there is still way too much homophobia in the church.” All priests must wrestle with their vows of celibacy, and the few priests who are publicly out make clear they are chaste. Still, many priests said they had had sex with other men to explore their sexual identity. Some have watched pornography to see what it is like for two men to have sex. They ultimately found more anguish than pleasure. One priest had sex for the first time at 62, no strings attached, with a man he met online. The relationship was discovered and reported to his bishop, and he has not had sex since. Another priest, when asked if he had ever considered himself as having a partner, wondered what that even meant. He paused, before mentioning one very special friend. “I fell in love several times with men,” he said. “I knew from the beginning it wasn’t going to last.” Though open, the closet means that many priests have held the most painful stories among themselves for decades: The seminarian who died by suicide, and the matches from a gay bar found afterward in his room. The priest friends who died of AIDS. The feeling of coming home to an empty rectory every night. So they find ways to encourage one another. They share books like Father James Martin’s groundbreaking “Building a Bridge,” on the relationship between the Catholic and L.G.B.T. communities. Some have signed petitions against church-sponsored conversion therapy programs, or have met on private retreats, after figuring out how to conceal them on their church calendars. Occasionally, a priest may even take off his collar and offer to unofficially bless a gay couple’s marriage. Some may call this rebellion. But “it is not a cabal,” one priest said. “It is a support group.” Just over a year ago, after meeting with a group of gay priests, Father Greiten decided it was time to end his silence. At Sunday Mass, during Advent, he told his suburban parish he was gay, and celibate. They leapt to their feet in applause. His story went viral. A 90-year-old priest called him to say he had lived his entire life in the closet and longed for the future to be different. A woman wrote from Mississippi, asking him to move south to be her priest. To some church leaders, that outpouring of support may have been even more threatening than his sexuality. Father Greiten had committed the cardinal sin: He opened the door to debate. His archbishop, Jerome E. Listecki of Milwaukee, issued a statement saying that he wished Father Greiten had not gone public. Letters poured in calling him “satanic,” “gay filth” and a “monster” who sodomized children. The idea that gay priests are responsible for child sexual abuse remains a persistent belief, especially in many conservative Catholic circles. For years, church leaders have been deeply confused about the relationship between gay men and sexual abuse. With every new abuse revelation, the tangled threads of the church’s sexual culture become even more impossible to sort out. Study after study shows that homosexuality is not a predictor of child molestation. This is also true for priests, according to a famous study by John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the wake of revelations in 2002 about child sex abuse in the church. The John Jay research, which church leaders commissioned, found that same-sex experience did not make priests more likely to abuse minors, and that four out of five people who said they were victims were male. Researchers found no single cause for this abuse, but identified that abusive priests’ extensive access to boys had been critical to their choice of victims. The notion that a certain sexual identity leads to abusive behavior has demoralized gay priests for decades. Days after one man retired, he still could not shake what his archbishop in the 1970s told all the new priests headed to their first parish assignments. “He said, ‘I don’t ever want you to call me to report about your pastor, unless he is a homo or an alchie,’” he said, referring to an alcoholic. “He didn’t even know what he meant when he said homo, because we were all homos. He meant a predator, like serial predator.” This perception persists today at prominent Catholic seminaries. At the largest in the United States, Mundelein Seminary in Illinois, few ever talk about sexual identity, said one gay student, who is afraid to ever come out. Since last summer, when Mr. McCarrick was exposed for abusing young men, students have been drilled in rules about celibacy and the evils of masturbation and pornography. “Classmates will say, ‘Don’t admit gays,’” said the student. “Their attitude is that it is gay priests who inflict abuse on younger guys.” Priests across the country are wondering if their sacrifice is worth the personal cost. “Am I going to leave the priesthood because I’m sick of that accusation?” asked Father Michael Shanahan, a Chicago priest who came out publicly three years ago. “Become more distant from parishioners? Am I going to hide? Become hardened, and old?” Blaming gay men for sexual abuse is almost sure to be a major topic this week at the Vatican, at a much-anticipated four-day summit on sexual abuse. Pope Francis has called the world’s most powerful bishops to Rome to educate them on the problems of abuse, after high-profile abuse cases in the United States, Australia, Chile and elsewhere. “Why stay? It is an amazing life. I am fascinated with the depth and sincerity of parishioners, the immense generosity. The negativity out there doesn’t match what is in my daily life, when I see the goodness of people. I tune into that, because it sustains me.” Father Michael Shanahan “When I first came to my parish, I remember thinking, if I were to come out now, this would be the kind of place I could. That is far from my mind now. Obviously to my friends, it’s nothing I hide. But the climate we are in, I’d never self-identify as a gay priest.” The event has worried gay priests. A few years after the 2002 scandal, the Vatican banned gay men from seminaries and ordination. When the abuse crisis broke out again last summer, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, accused “homosexual networks” of American cardinals of secretly working to protect abusers. And this week, a sensational book titled “Sodoma” in Europe (“In the Closet of the Vatican” in the United States) is being released that claims to expose a vast gay subculture at the Vatican. A group of gay priests in the Netherlands recently took the unusually bold step of writing to Pope Francis, urging him to allow gay, celibate men to be ordained. “Instead of seeing increased accountability on the parts of the bishops, it could become once again a condemnation of lesbian, gay, transsexual people within the church,” John Coe, 63, a permanent deacon in Kentucky, who came out last year, said about the summit. Sitting in his parish’s small counseling room, Father Greiten reflected on it all. He wished he could talk to Pope Francis himself. “Listen to my story of how the church traumatized me for being a gay man,” he asked, into the air. “It’s not just about the sexual abuse crisis,” he said, his voice growing urgent. “They are sexually traumatizing and wounding yet another generation. We have to stand up and say no more sexual abuse, no more sexual traumatizing, no more sexual wounding. We have to get it right when it comes to sexuality.” For now, Father Greiten was getting ready for his 15th trip to Honduras with doctors and medical supplies. A shadow box hung on the wall behind him. It displayed a scrap of purple knitting, needle still stuck in the top. He calls it “The Unfinished Gift.” “What if every priest was truly allowed to live their life freely, openly, honestly?” he asked. “That’s my dream.”",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Cold as Hell’: Inside a Brooklyn Jail’s Weeklong Collapse,"Electricity and heat had been faltering for weeks, but complaints were ignored until a crisis trapped inmates in cold, dark cells. Hundreds of inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn spent the coldest days of the year locked in cells, largely without heat and hot water. Power was restored after a week, on Feb. 3, amid public outcry.CreditCreditStephanie Keith for The New York Times [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In the middle of New York City, they had been cut off from the world. It was the end of January, and hundreds of inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn had been locked in their cells after an electrical fire knocked out power in the building. There, it turned out, they would spend the coldest days of the winter in darkness, largely without heat and hot water. “It’s cold as hell,” one inmate, Sean Daughtry, told his lawyer. He could see his breath in the weak light that slanted through his cell window. When news of how the inmates were treated reached the world outside, the warden of the federal jail, Herman E. Quay, at first denied there was any problem outside a partial loss of power. “Inmate housing units have been minimally impacted,” Mr. Quay’s office told The New York Times during the blackout, a message initially echoed by the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. But dozens of interviews with inmates and their families, defense lawyers, jail staff, union officials and lawmakers briefed on the response of officials at the Bureau of Prisons painted another picture, revealing an account of the crisis that not only contradicted what the bureau said, but suggested it was even worse than it had initially appeared. The blackout, which lasted for a week, ended Feb. 3, when power was restored amid public outcry. A few days later, the Justice Department, which oversees the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that it was “committed to the safe and humane living and working conditions of all inmates and employees,” and that its internal watchdog, the Office of the Inspector General, would investigate the facility’s infrastructure and emergency response. Mr. Quay did not respond to requests for comment. The blackout crisis was just the latest episode in a long history of neglect and brutality at the jail, one that has been documented in previous Justice Department reports. Investigators over the years have issued findings that suggest the jail is among the worst in the federal system, determining at different times that prisoners have been beaten, raped or held in inhumane conditions. “It’s my opinion,” a former warden at the jail, Cameron Lindsay, said in an interview, that over the last decade “the M.D.C. was one of the most troubled, if not the most troubled facility in the Bureau of Prisons.” The M.D.C., one of the largest federal lockups in the country, houses more than 1,600 inmates, some of them linked to high-profile drug trafficking and terrorism cases, most charged with lesser crimes. It is largely a way station, where inmates spend relatively short periods awaiting trial or sentencing. While many federal inmates are held in less populous corners of the country, the M.D.C. sits between an expressway and the New York Harbor, amid one of the world’s great concentrations of lawyers and civil liberties advocates. Yet the jail has proved steadily resistant to attempts at scrutiny, including while under Mr. Quay. After Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, toured the jail during the blackout, he denounced not only the deplorable conditions, but “an absolute lack of urgency or caring by the leadership, particularly the warden.” “Something weird is going on,” an inmate, Kaemar Wilson, said to his fiancée in a message in mid-January. “I’m frustrated. I can’t figure it out, but nothing is working properly.” When his fiancée, Moriam Johnson, visited him a few days later, Mr. Wilson said the heating system and electricity seemed to be broken, but inmates were not given any explanation for the issues — or for the dinner of undercooked oatmeal the night before. Around Martin Luther King’s Birthday, when temperatures plunged into the single digits, Mr. Wilson told his fiancée that the building felt like a freezer. To keep their hands warm, inmates on his floor had filled a can with water, heated it with a contraband lighter and passed it around. Families began to call the jail. Union officials also called the warden. Anthony Sanon, head of the local chapter of the correction officers union, described workers in coats and gloves trying to keep order in the cold. “It was just unbearable,” he said. Mr. Sanon alerted regional union leaders. The warden and his staff assured him they would monitor the heat. “They were trying to sugarcoat it,” Mr. Sanon said. But the next weekend, on Jan. 27, a faltering electrical panel exploded, he said. Another inmate, Donnell Murray, would later recall in a message to his fiancée, “The fire alarm was sounding off and I could smell the smoke, and we were immediately locked in our cells.” Then, the jail went quiet. The Bureau of Prisons said Mr. Quay adequately notified Washington about the “initial fire and subsequent events.” The bureau did not say when this was done and what it did in response. Many inmates said that after the fire, the lights went out and they were locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, a lockdown typically enforced in emergencies, to keep staff safe. Asked how many days he was locked in, an inmate on the fourth floor later said he believed three consecutive days passed before he was released again, but he had become confused in his dark cell. “I had no idea what time, what day — you lost track of everything,” the man, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals, said in a phone interview. Cold air blew from a vent over his bunk. He tried to block it with a book cover. He lay listening to a battery-powered radio, wrapped up in three blankets, he said, until a guard saw he had an extra blanket and took it away. Still, he worried more about his cellmate, who suffers seizures and was not given his usual medication. The jail’s computers, used to request prescription refills, were down, along with the monitored phone system inmates use to call family. A line that connects the jail to local federal defenders’ offices was working, though, and when they were briefly released, the inmates began to call the lawyers. “They sound really frightened,” said Deirdre von Dornum, who leads the Brooklyn office of the federal defenders, on Jan. 31. She said the number of calls peaked that day, when temperatures fell to 2 degrees. The lawyers asked the warden to move the inmates or bring in blankets, but said they received only dismissive replies. On Feb. 1, after news of the blackout broke, Ms. von Dornum obtained a court order to enter the jail. She found the building illuminated by dim emergency lights. The cells were pitch-black. The fetid smell of nonworking toilets pervaded the jail. Men pounded on cell doors. In common areas, the temperature was bearable, but as she approached cells that faced the waterfront on one floor, she said, she was hit by a gust of cold air. The jail staff would not open the cells, but through the cracks of doors Ms. von Dornum glimpsed the silhouettes of the men inside. “They were wrapped in everything they had, and they had tried to cover the windows.” Inmates complained to her of the cold, brackish water that ran from the taps. A client known to swallow razor blades said he had not gotten his psychiatric drugs. In another cell, a man lay on bloody sheets. The man, Sean Daughtry, had a chronic sore on his leg that had festered during the blackout. “He had a raging infection,” his lawyer, Gary G. Becker, said later, after Mr. Daughtry was removed to a hospital. Mr. Daughtry, who was being held on charges of violating supervised release, said he had been denied antibiotics and Tylenol by jail staff. He was told to wash the wound with soap and water. Union leaders, however, said M.D.C. staff “actually held it together” through the crisis. During the long week when the jail remained in perpetual twilight, correction officers worked late preparing makeshift meals — sandwiches, cereal — that they took from cell to cell, said Mr. Sanon. “The inmates were very agitated, very angry,” he added. “They banged on the doors and cursed.” On a floor that houses lower-security inmates, a man who gave only his first name, Michael, told his wife that a correction officer had at one point opened his cell door, allowing him into the warmer common area. “I don’t know what’s going on here,” the guard had told him, “But this is inhumane.” Mr. Quay began working for the Bureau of Prisons in 1995 and had previously been the warden at the federal prison in Danbury, Conn., according to court filings and his LinkedIn profile. Aimee Jamison, who was a case worker at McCreary, a federal prison in Kentucky, while Mr. Quay was an associate warden there, described him as a conscientious manager. ”He’s a straight-up guy, and he’s not going to go to overlook the health and welfare of anyone, inmates or staff,” Ms. Jamison said. She said that Bureau of Prisons employees are used to working in circumstances that others might consider crises. “The bureau looks at things in its own way,” she said. “No matter what happens on the outside, we still go to work, and our job is to contain the inmates, no matter what.” Still, Mr. Quay’s response to the problems this winter faced criticism from elected officials and others. Mr. Lindsay, the warden at M.D.C. from 2007 to 2009, said every detention facility should have an emergency plan to deal with exigencies ranging from a missing tool to an escape to problems with heating. At the very least, he said, there should have been extra blankets. “If this is accurate — where they haven’t had heat for days on end — in 20 years in the B.O.P. I never saw anything like that,” said Mr. Lindsay, who now works as an expert witness. A facilities manager later testified at a hearing in federal court that issues began a week or two before the fire. The heating problems appeared to be at least partly unrelated to the electrical ones: on Jan. 21, some heating coils that draw water from the boilers had frozen in a cold snap and broke. After the fire, Mr. Quay failed to set up an emergency command center or give staff instructions other than to keep inmates locked up, union officials said in interviews. During the episode, which drew national attention to the treatment of inmates in federal jails, lawmakers demanded more answers from officials. Last week, many applauded when the Justice Department announced that its inspector general would investigate. But some question whether that will be enough to change the culture of a jail that has now been accused of widespread mistreatment of prisoners for the third time in less than 20 years. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the inspector general found that officers slammed Muslim inmates face-first against walls and told them they would die in secret. The inspector general also participated in an investigation into the beatings of two inmates by officers in 2002 and 2006. More recently, an investigation focused on officers who sexually assaulted female inmates who were on overnight cleaning duty between 2013 and 2016. Two former M.D.C. lieutenants and a correction officer were convicted, including one lieutenant who repeatedly raped a prisoner and threatened to send her to solitary confinement if she reported it. Last year, another inspector general report condemned conditions for women housed in an adjacent building. The women were confined to one floor with almost no natural light or time outside. Lawyers with the federal defenders, which represents hundreds of inmates at the jail, filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a Brooklyn federal judge to appoint an outside monitor who would have unfettered access to the jail. “The I.G. previously has investigated M.D.C. and issued harshly critical reports,” said Ms. von Dornum, the federal defender. “But nothing has changed.” In court papers, lawyers for the Bureau of Prisons argued the lawsuit applies only to a handful of inmates who allegedly suffered during the blackout. Those limited complaints cannot be the basis for the appointment of a monitor, they said. Besides, the government lawyers wrote, the problems have been fixed.

2019,‘It’s Not Getting Better’: Nigeria Braces for Election Day as Frustrations Boil,"GWAGWALADA, Nigeria — The seven sewing machines were quiet at Diamonds Empire on a recent morning. The blades of a standing fan were still. Adama Daniel sat behind the front desk of the dark, stuffy tailor shop and moped. The blackout in the neighborhood not far from the capital had started nearly 28 hours earlier. Customers were waiting on suits, dresses and a tiger-print miniskirt. Mr. Daniel was contemplating firing up his generator, but that would cut into his profit margins. In 2015 when he cast a ballot for president, Mr. Daniel, who is 29, thought he would be in a better place by now. He had bounded into a polling station to throw his support behind Muhammadu Buhari, who seemed bursting with ideas to grow the country’s lackluster economy. Mr. Daniel was elated when his candidate won. Finally, he thought, the country was on the right path. Now, with a presidential election set for Saturday, any economic gains of the past four years are far from evident in Mr. Daniel’s daily life. This weekend when he walks into the voting booth, Mr. Daniel is going to cast his ballot for Mr. Buhari’s main opponent, Atiku Abubakar. “He had four years and couldn’t do anything,” said Mr. Daniel, speaking of the president. “Another four years won’t make a difference.” Although Mr. Buhari did make notable moves toward improving the economy during his term, the impact has not registered widely. His crowning achievement: pulling the oil-dependent nation out of a grueling recession. He also chipped away at inflation. He banned imports of rice and other food to help local farmers. He moved more than five million people onto the tax rolls. Earlier this week, officials announced the last quarter of 2018 was Nigeria’s strongest quarter of growth since the recession ended in 2017. In a speech on Thursday night, he said Nigerians were seeing his economic efforts “bearing fruit.” But outside the wealthy elite, all that means little to countless Nigerians. Mr. Daniel, for one, spends $200 a month to buy diesel fuel for his generator to keep his business going. He’s anxious to finish his medical degree but administrators at his school, and all public universities, keep striking for months at a time to agitate for better resources. His brother has an engineering degree but can’t find a job that pays more than the tailors earn at Mr. Daniel’s shop. Mr. Abubakar, who has put economic issues at the center of his campaign, “knows what Nigerians need,” said Mr. Daniel. Nigeria is bracing for what could be a tight election this weekend. Threats of violence loom. In the northeast of the country on Tuesday, a convoy heading to an election event and carrying Kashim Shettima, a state governor, was attacked by Boko Haram, an extremist Islamist group which operates in the region. At least three people were killed, officials said. Many of the governor’s entourage fled into the bush after militants dressed as soldiers and riding in stolen military vehicles attacked, local news media reported. The incident drew attention to another of Mr. Buhari’s 2015 pledges: to destroy Boko Haram. Far from being crushed, Boko Haram has recently been gaining strength. In the south, militants in the oil-rich Delta threatened to disrupt the economy, presumably by blowing up pipelines, if Mr. Buhari were re-elected. At a rally for the president in Rivers State this week, at least four people were killed in a stampede. Election officials reported fires in several sites where ballot materials were being stored. Tensions have been so high that after the American ambassador to Nigeria called on both campaigns to carry out fair elections, Mr. Buhari’s party called his statements “implicit attacks against the government.” Mr. Buhari and Mr. Abubakar, who each have pledged to accept the election results peacefully, wrapped up final appearances this week at rallies across the country, where thousands turned out wearing dresses, rings, hats and scarves plastered with their candidates’ photos. But across Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, life grinds on far from the rallies, the violence and the political maneuvering. In Abuja, the capital, people cluster along the exhaust-choked highway all day, selling bags of bread from a nearby bakery at a markup. Metal drainage grates are missing from a major road, swiped by thieves hoping to sell them for scrap. Men playing after-work table tennis at a park complain about the price of rice and building materials. More than half of Nigeria is living in poverty, according to the World Bank. The grim situation has forced everyone to think only of themselves, some civil leaders fear. Hamzat Lawal, an anti-corruption activist who worked on a campaign to get more young people to run for office, said, “A lot of people are disconnected to the Nigerian dream where we’re all united and connected.” Mr. Lawal supports neither of the two leading contenders. Mr. Abubakar, a former vice president, and Mr. Buhari, a former general who was in power under military rule in the 1980s, are establishment candidates who are both in their 70s. Fifty-one percent of the 84 million registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 35, according to government officials. Last year Mr. Buhari called Nigerian youth “lazy,” alienating many. On Thursday, his official Twitter account posted: “It is understandable that we all want to live comfortable lives. It is also important to realize that the most comfortable thing we can all do is to work hard and live within our means.” His health has also been an issue. He spent months abroad being treated for an illness he has yet to disclose. He was missing from public view for so long and rumors he was dead grew so loud that he publicly denied he was a clone of himself. As an incumbent, Mr. Buhari carries a huge advantage. He has introduced poverty programs, including free school meals. Access to education in general has increased. He pledged recently to raise the minimum wage. “He’s trying,” said Nana Lawan, who wore a dress with Mr. Buhari’s face stamped on it at a rally this week. Yet many graduates say they can’t find jobs. Unemployment is rampant. Salaries are stretched for people who do have jobs. Some civil servants don’t receive regular paychecks. The price of fuel has increased. People complain rent and public transit prices are too high. “Do you see any customers in here?” huffed one shopkeeper in his tiny, empty store at Abuja’s largest market, where dresses were stacked to the ceiling. “Atiku says he will make things better,” he said, speaking of Mr. Abubakar. Inside the market, frustration was rampant. Look around, Ruby Shaibu King said, pointing to the people braiding hair, painting toenails and selling spiked heels and cheap plastic bowls. “Most everybody is a graduate,” said Ms. King, who is in her third year of university, majoring in mass communications. Jude Ben has a degree in business administration. He styles hair, along with dozens of others at the market. He’s so frustrated that he’s not voting. “I’m 25-years-old and they told me Nigeria is going to get better,” he said. “It’s not getting better. When will it be better? When I’m in my 40s or 50s?”",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Not Going to Hurt’: Cohen’s Testimony Does Little to Change Minds,"HIRAM, Ga. — Only time will tell whether Michael Cohen’s testimony to a congressional committee on Wednesday was a blip or a major chapter in the story of Donald Trump’s presidency. But across America, it was, for many, just one more show. From an Atlanta suburb to Seattle, the hearing played out in closed captions on televisions — another familiar sport to follow, or not. At a Dunkin’ Donuts in Hiram, Ga., the small dining area was packed, but no one was watching. At an oil-change shop, customers glanced up every now and again. A couple of employees watched for a few free minutes on a TV in the cramped waiting area — but only long enough, it seemed, to substantiate their disgust. “It’s a bunch of B.S. If it was any other president they wouldn’t be doing it,” said one employee, who said he could not give his name because of company policy. So it went in restaurants, cafes and lounges in this Atlanta suburb, a city of about 4,000 residents in Paulding County, where Mr. Trump captured nearly 70 percent of the vote two years ago. The hearing either was not playing, or was being largely ignored. But at a Krystal hamburger restaurant in town, Dwight Young, a retired Baptist pastor, and his wife were among the only customers glued to the television. “He’s trying to save his own neck, you know,” Mr. Young, 88, said of Mr. Cohen, echoing a tweet Mr. Trump had issued earlier about his former personal lawyer, who was convicted of campaign finance crimes and is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May. “It’s not going to hurt. I don’t think most people believe Mr. Cohen.” Mr. Young said that he already knew Mr. Trump was not a perfect man. But he said that he and other evangelical Christians were pleased that the president had moved the country to the right the way he had promised. “Christians voted for him because of the stand he took. The stand on abortion. The stand on the Supreme Court judges,” he said. Across the country, Marten King, a law student at Seattle’s University of Washington campus, caught a few minutes of the hearing as he cooked breakfast. A while later, he watched with his classmates and professor during a class on federal courts and the federal system. For Mr. King, 26, the central question was whether Mr. Cohen’s testimony would lead anywhere. “It’s very hard to assess — is there criminal wrongdoing here?” said Mr. King, who supported Hillary Clinton two years ago. Only a true indisputable blockbusting piece of hard evidence would move the needle, he said. [Read: Readers Debate Michael Cohen’s Credibility] In Colorado Springs, Colo., Louellen Welsch, 63, saw the hearing as little else than a circus put on by Democrats with an unreliable witness in the main ring. “This guy’s already convicted for lying,” she said. “I’m fed up. I pretty much read the headlines and don’t listen to a lot of it. I’ve disengaged.” Ms. Welsch, a conservative-leaning voter who prizes anti-abortion issues, is no fan of Mr. Trump. But she said the allegations of affairs and sexual harassment against President Bill Clinton had long ago inured her to sex scandals in politics. “I’ve sort of given up on that aspect of morality,” she said. “I wish none of it was there. But it’s all there. You have to pick who’s the best and who’s running.” About 2,000 miles away in an office in West Palm Beach, Fla., Julio Gonzalez, a business owner and avid supporter of Mr. Trump, saw nothing to change his mind about the president. He was glued to the television and described the hearing in two words: devastating and disappointing, mostly because Mr. Gonzalez believed that Mr. Trump was an honest man. Mr. Gonzalez, a donor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration committee, was particularly incensed by the accusation that the president is a racist. It’s the kind of charge, he said, that lands hard in a nation bitterly divided, often along ethnic lines. “The things that stick out the most, is Cohen’s statement that Trump hates blacks, how he is a racist,” said Mr. Gonzalez, 52. “I do not believe he is a racist at all,” Mr. Gonzalez said, pointing to Mr. Trump’s push for programs to rehabilitate blighted areas and the presence of Darrell Scott, an African-American pastor and a member of Mr. Trump’s executive transition team and diversity coalition. “And I have been to his properties such as Mar-a-Lago and the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., where I have seen plenty of African-Americans on staff. He would not be hiring and appointing African-Americans if he was truly a racist.” Mr. Gonzalez had already read articles about the hearing. He knew what to expect. Still, he said he found the process upsetting because it was a deterrent from more important issues, such as border security and economic growth. Jason Porter, 44, a gym teacher from Durham, N.C., agreed. Mr. Trump has been a decent president, he said, pointing to low unemployment and a strong economy. “Whether you believe in the wall or not, he’s doing it,” said Mr. Porter, finishing dinner Wednesday evening at Johnny’s Barbecue in nearby Louisburg, N.C., where he was waiting for a basketball match. Mr. Porter, a registered independent, said he often voted Republican in presidential elections. He said he did not vote for Mr. Trump enthusiastically, but could not face another Clinton in the White House. Besides, his former job, as an IT consultant for a large phone company, was outsourced to Manila in 2015, and Mr. Trump spoke to that. Mr. Porter said Mr. Trump was a lot like Ronald Reagan. “Reagan was pegged for being stupid, but he had an idea of what America should be,” he said. “Trump is like that. He has a vision for what he wants.” When asked whether he would vote for Mr. Trump if the election was happening now, Mr. Porter said it would depend on whom the Democratic candidate was. “If they run another Hillary,” he said, Mr. Trump would “get my vote all day long.” Mr. Porter said he did not have time to watch Mr. Cohen’s testimony because he was at work. But he thought it would probably be another Washington spectacle that wouldn’t really register in the rest of the country anyway. Late Wednesday morning, every television at Leon’s Cuts and Styles Barber Shop in Hiram, Ga., was tuned in. Leon Holmes, 48, the owner, had begun watching it at home and demanded, when he arrived at work, that the numerous TVs all be turned from an entertainment channel to the news. Mr. Holmes, an African-American who voted for Hillary Clinton, said he was never much of a fan of Mr. Trump, and said he thought Mr. Cohen was credible. And maybe, he said, the hearings were the beginning of something — a slide into a much more complicated phase in Washington politics. “I think a lot of stuff’s going to pop off, and he’s going to respond, and it’s going to get crazy,” he said. Connie LaRue Jackson, 58, a barber, agreed: “I think he’s going to get impeached.” “I think he’s going to resign — like Nixon,” Mr. Holmes said. “Oh, he ain’t going nowhere,” said another barber, Rashaun Blankumsee, 27, who said that everyone already knew what Mr. Trump was — a fact that he believed would dull the impact of Mr. Cohen’s testimony.",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s the Human Way’: Corruption Scandals Play Out in Big Cities Across U.S.,"ATLANTA — A senior aide to a former mayor of Atlanta collapses on a courtroom floor after hearing that she is headed to prison. F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles haul away computers and documents during a raid of a veteran councilman’s office. News cameras trail the most powerful alderman in Chicago as he walks to court to face a charge of attempted extortion. Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia accuse a powerful labor boss of keeping a key city councilman on his union’s payroll. Four of America’s largest cities are under the dark clouds of major federal corruption investigations. Residents, politicians and power brokers in all of them are holding their breath, waiting for signs of how deeply their civic cultures will be shaken. The investigations raise questions not just about who else might be caught up in them, but also about whether there can be any lasting cure for the chronic corruption problems that seem to dog big cities, so often dominated by a single party or political machine. In Chicago, Dick Simpson, a former alderman who is a political scientist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, called corruption a part of the municipal culture there. To change that, he said, “you have to not only destroy the political machine, but also actually create a history of clean government — that’ll be decades of work.” The investigations have already had a palpable impact. In Chicago, the criminal charges against Alderman Ed Burke have created all kinds of complications for the municipal elections set for Feb. 26. Political insiders are watching uncomfortably to see whether the scandal will harm any of the 14 candidates vying to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel. In Atlanta, Kasim Reed, who was mayor from 2010 to 2018, has not been implicated in the investigation swirling around his former administration, and he has vigorously maintained his innocence. Even so, the scandal has effectively sidelined Mr. Reed, once a rising Democratic star in the South and one of Georgia’s most powerful politicians. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles is not a known target of the widening probe in his city, either, though two of his appointees are under scrutiny, including a former deputy mayor. Last week, Mr. Garcetti put an end to months of speculation about his presidential ambitions by announcing that he would not seek the Democratic nomination in 2020. A federal indictment in the Philadelphia case, announced on Wednesday, centers on a union leader with major influence in city and state politics, and includes as a co-defendant the majority leader on the City Council, Bobby Henon, a former official of the union. Mr. Henon issued a statement saying he had done nothing wrong. The Chicago and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are the two most corrupt in the United States, based on the number of federal public corruption convictions from 1976 to 2016, according to researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Philadelphia comes in at No. 8. Atlanta did not make the Top 10 in that study, but even so, the civic conversation in the South’s most important city is strongly influenced by the 2006 conviction of another former mayor, Bill Campbell, on tax evasion charges stemming from an earlier corruption investigation. These investigations often expose webs of small-bore wrongdoing. The bribes that Katrina Taylor-Parks, the woman who collapsed in court Jan. 14, had pleaded guilty to accepting from a city vendor in Atlanta added up to just $4,000. Ms. Taylor-Parks, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Reed, returned to court last week, and the judge sentenced her to 21 months in prison. But her case is one facet of a wide-ranging investigation examining construction contracts, the use of city-issued credit cards, and lucrative concessions at the city’s international airport. It has already led to the conviction of two contractors, who each bribed a city official; a former chief procurement officer for the city, who accepted bribes; and a man named Shandarrick Barnes, who threw a brick through the window at one of the contractor’s homes, warning him not to cooperate with investigators. He also placed dead rodents on the property. Those gangster-movie touches have come with a decidedly Atlantan twist. Mr. Barnes had business ties to a woman named Mitzi Bickers, who has made headlines over the years as a pioneering gay politician, as a president of the Atlanta public school board, as the pastor of a predominantly African-American Baptist church, and as a controversial political consultant. She was indicted in April on charges that she accepted more than $2 million in bribes when she was the city’s human services director. Ms. Bickers has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Mr. Reed’s successor as mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, took office in January 2018, and a big part of her job has been dealing with the mess — rebidding airport contracts, listing the tiniest of city transactions with vendors on a public website, and naming a new “transparency officer.” In Los Angeles, where the downtown skyline is studded with construction cranes, investigators are focused on cozy relationships between politicians and the real estate executives who write checks to their campaigns and charitable causes. Such coziness has worried environmentalists and urban activists for decades, the more so now that the city’s neglected downtown is undergoing a renaissance, awash in money from Chinese real estate developers. The F.B.I. is paying attention now as well. Ever since the raid in November on the office and home of Jose Huizar, the City Council member whose district includes much of downtown, federal agents have been scouring his records for details of his financial connections to developers. (Asked for comment, Mr. Huizar’s lawyers issued a statement saying that Mr. Huizar “continues to work on behalf of the cultural, residential and commercial revitalization of Downtown Los Angeles,” but did not address the investigation.) A sign that the investigation extends far beyond Mr. Huizar surfaced recently when a researcher stumbled on a search warrant from July, indicating that the F.B.I. was looking for evidence of bribery, extortion and money laundering involving Chinese real estate investors, city politicians and their aides, including two of Mr. Garcetti’s appointees. The warrant described a sprawling web of possible corruption. Investigators appeared to be looking at whether campaign donations were traded for promises of project approvals, and whether there was outright bribery. The search was centered on an email account belonging to Ray Chan, a former deputy mayor. The investigators have yet to charge anyone with a crime. Even so, the investigation is rattling the city, and evoking its history of shady real estate dealings as it grew rapidly in the early 20th century, immortalized in the 1974 film “Chinatown.” “This is our new Chinatown,” said Jill Stewart, executive director of Coalition to Preserve L.A., an activist group that promotes transparency in government. “There was a huge amount of land use corruption. That’s always been a part of L.A.’s historic DNA.” Mr. Garcetti has sought to distance himself from any wrongdoing. “I am not responsible a hundred percent for everybody’s actions in this building, elected officials and staff,” the mayor said at a recent news conference. “But I do take my responsibility seriously, and I do expect every city employee to participate fully and cooperate fully with the F.B.I.” The investigation has revived efforts led by David Ryu, a City Council member, to limit contributions by real estate developers to city politicians’ campaigns and charitable causes. “There is a perception that exists that local politicians are influenced by developers, or special interests,” Mr. Ryu said. “If this perception exists, real or not, we have to do everything to root it out.” Chicago has 50 aldermen on its City Council, but none carried more weight than Mr. Burke, 75, the longest-serving member and the former longtime chief of the powerful finance committee. Federal authorities say he ran an old-school shakedown, threatening to stall city permissions to remodel a fast-food restaurant unless the owner hired Mr. Burke’s private law firm for real-estate tax work. “I’ve done nothing wrong,” Mr. Burke told reporters in early January after his first court appearance. Mr. Burke, who is married to Anne Burke, a justice on the Illinois Supreme Court, resigned his committee chairmanship, and a flurry of proposals quickly emerged for new ethics rules at City Hall prompted by his case. But he said he would go right on seeking re-election to the seat he has held since 1969. In recent days, tantalizing new revelations have emerged, raising the specter of a widening net: Local news media reported that another alderman has cooperated with federal authorities, secretly recording conversations for months with people at City Hall. Joe Moore, another Chicago alderman, said the mud from corruption cases tends to splash unfairly on all the city’s politicians. Corruption, he said, is “not the ‘Chicago Way,’ as people like to say — frankly, it’s the human way. Humans are fallible creatures.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Joseph Pulitzer: Voice of the People’ Review: A Flair for Journalism, Subdued","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Much of “Joseph Pulitzer: Voice of the People” is devoted to explaining how the pioneering newspaperman redefined American journalism. He pushed for language that the masses could understand. He devised visual presentations that accounted for how readers’ eyes might skip around to different parts of a page. And his papers engaged in a sensationalist style that, as described, was only slightly more responsible than that of William Randolph Hearst, with whom Pulitzer competed during the buildup to the Spanish-American War. None of these skills, except perhaps a flair for direct, comprehensible explanations, apply to the movie, a standard biographical primer from Oren Rudavsky. Notwithstanding the dynamic layouts from Pulitzer’s New York World, the film hasn’t found the material to make this subject pop visually. Historians and other experts describe Pulitzer’s life and ethos accompanied by the usual archival photographs. Adam Driver narrates, while Liev Schreiber speaks Pulitzer’s words, appropriately if distractingly mimicking a Hungarian accent. Perhaps the biggest surprise from today’s standards is how freely journalism in the late 19th century served as a revolving door with politics. (We hear about how Pulitzer, serving in the Missouri State House, promoted his own agenda in print.) And Pulitzer’s life — as an immigrant who championed other immigrants, the poor and unions, but had high-society ambitions that clashed with those ideals — is a fascinating study in contradictions. While there are amazing anecdotes here, there is little to catch the eye or ear.

2019,"‘Leading Men,’ a Novel About Tennessee Williams and His Lover, Casts a Spell From the Start","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In his 1956 book “In the Winter of Cities,” Tennessee Williams printed a small and exquisite poem titled “Little Horse,” a tribute to his lover Frank Merlo. This poem ends: Mignon he is or mignonetteavec les yeux plus grands que lui.My name for him is Little Horse.I wish he had a name for me. Williams and Merlo were together from roughly 1947 to 1963, a stretch during which the playwright composed some of the American theater’s enduring classics, including “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” “Suddenly Last Summer” and “The Rose Tattoo.” Merlo was a working-class New Jersey boy from an Italian family and a charming young war hero. When they met, Tennessee Williams was already Tennessee Williams, flush from the success of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” voluble and lit as if by klieg lights. Not long into their relationship, Williams wrote in a letter to a friend: “Have I ever told you that I like Italians? They are the last of the beautiful young comedians of the world.” Williams and Merlo’s years together are the subject of Christopher Castellani’s blazing new novel, “Leading Men.” Writing fiction is to no small degree a confidence game, and “Leading Men” casts a spell right from the start. “Truman was throwing a party in Portofino,” the first sentence reads, “and Frank wanted to go.” This is Italy, 1953. You know Truman’s last name without being told. What you’ve yet to learn is how reliably tender and evocative Castellani’s onrushing prose can be. His first achievement in “Leading Men” is to create a world, one inhabited largely by young, charming gay men, that seems to be comprised almost entirely of late nights and last cigarettes and picnics on good blankets and linen suits with the trousers rolled to the knees. This writer’s scenes glitter, and they have a strong sexual pulse. At the end of one party, in writing that has some of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s opaline poise, Castellani observes: “Then, slowly, as the ashes fluttered away and the eggy firework smell wore off and the yachts cut their radios, couple by couple staggered back up the steep narrow inclines, men in each other’s arms, men with women, packs of friends, their songs and shouts and laughter bouncing off the stone in hollow echoes.” His second achievement is to pry this milieu open and pour a series of intricate themes into it — not merely the nature of fidelity and of the artistic impulse but also the manifold variety of estrangements and humiliations that come with being the lover of a much more famous and talented man. Williams and Merlo drift aimlessly around Europe. Williams writes intensely (he had a fierce work ethic) and enjoys himself nearly as fulsomely. Merlo is Williams’s factotum and aide-de-camp. He makes the reservations and buys the tickets; he mends Williams’s socks, plumps the pillows and goes on late-night pill runs. “It was a job in itself keeping track of who he was angry with, and who was jealous of him, whose parties he was looking forward to and whose they’d have to make up some excuse to get out of.” Merlo had a sense of humor about his position. In life, as in this novel, when asked what he did, he replied: “I sleep with Mr. Williams.” Theirs was, for many years, a great love, one that Castellani describes as a “one-night stand that lasted 15 years — or 16, or 14, depending on who told the story.” In John Lahr’s agile 2014 biography, “Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh,” Lahr notes that Merlo’s other fundamental task was to tend to Williams through his “hysterical outbursts, his paranoia, his hypochondria.” “Leading Men” is largely told from the perspective of 10 years after its opening scene, when Merlo is dying from lung cancer in Manhattan and hoping Williams will visit. The book wraps a second, slightly less successful story around this first one. It’s about a fictional actress named Anja Blomgren whom Williams and Merlo meet in 1953. She goes on to become a Garbo-like film legend, adopting the name Anja Bloom. More centrally, in terms of this novel’s plot, she comes to possess the only copy of a short, final, previously unknown Williams play, which he had sent to her before his death. A young man wants to have it produced. Castellani hews closely to the facts of Williams and Merlo’s time together without being pinned down by those facts. There is nothing dutiful about the reimagining of their lives. This book is a kind of poem in praise of pleasure, and those pleasures are sometimes stern. Its author knows a great deal about life; better, he knows how to express what he knows. This novel’s furniture is spare but well-placed. There are just enough pivotal scenes (one involves a pack of feral boys and the apparent rape of two women) that each leaves room for overlapping echoes to rebound. Williams and Merlo were not monogamous. Williams once called crab lice his “occupational disease.” Merlo cheated, too, sometimes in revenge. He grew distant and moody over time. Men like Merlo were often scorned, even by other gay men. (Truman Capote once asked the poet James Merrill’s lover, the writer and artist David Jackson, “Tell me, David, how much do you get a throw?”) The love Merlo and others felt for the great men in their lives was not recognized by society. Among this book’s characters is the writer John Horne Burns (1916-1953). Burns’s unanticipated death in this novel leaves his longtime male lover with this painful realization: “His name would never appear beside Jack’s anywhere but private letters and the backs of photographs.” “Leading Men” has a few dead nodes in it and the subplot, involving the reclusive actress and a production of Williams’s final play, generates fewer sparks than does the account of Williams and Merlo’s dazzled propinquity. But this is an alert, serious, sweeping novel. To hold it in your hands is like holding, to crib a line from Castellani, a front-row opera ticket.",The New York Times
2019,‘Let’s Do It!’,"daily crossword column Erik Agard makes us talk to ourselves. TUESDAY PUZZLE — Some people groan over puns and other kinds of wordplay, but not me. I am not afraid to admit that I laughed — out loud, startling my colleagues — when I solved Erik Agard’s theme. Tuesday puzzles can be tricky to schedule, because they have to be slightly more difficult than Mondays, which is subjective to begin with. In addition, there are a few ways in which a puzzle can be made tougher. The vocabulary can be ramped up a bit, the cluing can be made slightly more opaque, or the theme can delay that gratification you’re looking for. In the case of this puzzle by Erik Agard, this is a Tuesday on all three counts, and I really enjoyed the eventual whack on the back of the head from the theme. The revealer really sealed the deal for me, but we’ll get to that. 1. TIL that some people — not me, mind you — give their muscles affectionate nicknames, which I suppose was bound to happen. In this case, the hamstring is also known as the HAMMY. 47A. No, no, no. You don’t take a BREATH MINT after a garlicky meal. Garlic is a wonder bulb, meant to be savored. You take a BREATH MINT after coffee, which leaves your breath foul and nasty. 66A: Yes, Oreos are filled with CRÈME. Some are also filled with more CRÈME, which are known as Double Stuf Oreos. Recently, someone who was apparently under a lot of pressure at the Oreo company came up with the idea of Most Stuf cookies, and I honestly don’t understand why they don’t bag the cookie part altogether and just sell the CRÈME in a fire hose. I would buy it. 8D: Native American FRYBREAD makes its New York Times Crossword debut, clued as being comparable to Indian naan. Want to make your own?

2019,"‘Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire,’ and Other Contentious Exchanges From Cohen’s Congressional Hearing","The hearing had moments of revelation and substance. But these were not those moments. For those who have closely followed every twist and turn of the investigations of President Donald J. Trump, there were new developments during Michael D. Cohen’s congressional hearing on Wednesday in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. But for many watching, the standout moments came in the fiery, and occasionally puerile, exchanges between Mr. Cohen, President Donald J. Trump’s longtime lawyer, and Republican committee members set on impugning his credibility. [Follow the hearing live with commentary from our reporters.] Paul Gosar, a Republican representative from Arizona, reflected the tone of many of the Republican members’ exchanges with a sign set up behind his chair, displayed from the beginning of the hearing. The sign showed a picture of Mr. Cohen superimposed on flames, emblazoned with the words “LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE!” Following Mr. Gosar’s questioning (in which he mocked Mr. Cohen’s apparent desire to be seen as a sex symbol), Mr. Cohen said that he was the one responsible for the congressman’s tactics. “It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for,” Mr. Cohen said, referring to the sign. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years. I protected Mr. Trump for ten years.” [Read the transcript from Mr. Cohen’s testimony.] Even before Mr. Cohen’s testimony began, tensions in the room ran high as Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina attempted to postpone the hearing, citing what he said was a violation of a committee rule. (The attempt was unsuccessful.) Mr. Meadows and the ranking member on the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, later pummeled Mr. Cohen, questioning him on the substance of some of his illegal activities including perjury and bank fraud, but also veering into name-calling and implications that Mr. Cohen was testifying in bad faith. For instance, in Mr. Jordan’s initial round of questioning Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jordan suggested that he resented that he had not been employed by the White House — and that his testifying was a result of his resentment about not being able to continue his legal work for Mr. Trump there. “You wanted to work in the White House and you didn’t get brought to the dance,” Mr. Jordan said. Other Republicans frequently yielded some of their time to Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan, influential members of the House Freedom Caucus and loyal defenders of the president. Representative James Comer of Kentucky let Mr. Jordan take the remainder of his time to again attack Mr. Cohen’s character. That time, Mr. Cohen took offense, responding to the congressman’s characterization of his testimony was incorrect. “Shame on you, Mr. Jordan,” Mr. Cohen said. [Donald Trump and Michael Cohen: the end of a New York friendship.] However, some of the most memorable exchanges came when Mr. Cohen was questioned by other Republican members. Mr. Comer, for instance, mentioned that he had called Mr. Trump a cheat in his opening testimony. If that’s what he would call Mr. Trump, Mr. Comer asked, what might Mr. Cohen call himself? “A fool,” Mr. Cohen responded. “You calling — O.K.,” Mr. Comer said. “Well, no comment on that.” Mr. Gosar, the Arizona Republican with the “LIAR, LIAR” sign, also attacked Mr. Cohen, saying that he, Mr. Gosar, had been getting texts “right and left, saying ‘how can anyone listen to this pathological person?’” “There’s no truth with you whatsoever,” Mr. Gosar said. “And that’s why that’s important to you to look up here and” — referring to his sign — “look at the old adage that our moms taught us: ‘liar, liar, pants on fire.’” But Mr. Meadows was perhaps Mr. Cohen’s most consistent antagonist. When Mr. Cohen called himself a nice guy, the congressman from North Carolina cut in: “I would beg to differ. The record reflects that you’re not a nice guy.” When Mr. Cohen claimed that he had been working on his written testimony late into the previous night, a red-faced Mr. Meadows said: “So you were writing it last night, Mr. Cohen? Don’t give me that bull.” And after Mr. Cohen used a portion of his opening statement to recount racist statements he said Mr. Trump had made in his presence, Mr. Meadows gestured toward Lynne Patton, a black official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whom he said he had invited to the hearing. “She says that as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was racist,” he said. “Neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,” Mr. Cohen replied. In the afternoon session, two freshman Democratic congresswomen took up Mr. Meadows’s question about Ms. Patton. Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts asked Mr. Cohen whether he believed that someone could make the racist statements Mr. Trump has made, have a black friend, and still be racist. Mr. Cohen said that he did. Ms. Pressley agreed. Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan went further, suggesting that Mr. Meadows had used Ms. Patton as a prop, an act that in itself was racist. Mr. Meadows objected strenuously, calling Ms. Tlaib’s accusation racist and, close to the hearing’s end, Mr. Cohen, who for hours had been the source of contention, sat quietly as the representatives argued among themselves.",The New York Times

2019,‘Lords of Chaos’ Review: Where Anomie and Speed Metal Meet Doom,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The director Jonas Akerlund works hard to deliver on the title of “Lords of Chaos,” a tale of bad music and terrible deeds. Inspired by a true story, the movie ladles up lots of pulpy bits and buckets of blood to tell a depressing, depressingly familiar story about what happens when young men with apparent means and a whole lot of free time get together to build their own precariously hermetic world. In this case, their clubhouse was the Norwegian black-metal scene of the 1980s and early ’90s, which combined anomie with face paint, speed metal and Linda Blair’s devilish vocalizations from “The Exorcist.” Norwegian black metal started to make mainstream news when some of its adherents were arrested on charges of murder, arson and other crimes. (They torched churches.) The bleak story is charted in the book “Lords of Chaos,” whose sensationalist subtitle — “The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground” — could serve as the movie’s elevator pitch (though “rise and fall” would be more accurate for the movie). Written by Akerlund and Dennis Magnusson, the screen version centers on Oystein Aarseth (a nicely slippery Rory Culkin), an entrepreneurial musician and professed Satanist who adopts the stage name Euronymous, after a Greek flesh-eating demon. The movie’s subject is ostensibly outré, but the narrative arc is all too familiar, tracking Oystein’s journey with his group Mayhem from garage-band anonymity to breaking-news infamy. In a voice-over that skews (for reasons you learn later) more sardonic than Culkin’s onscreen performance, Oystein lays out his origin story (he takes credit for inventing Norwegian black metal) and fills in the world he helped make. He’s selling a band and a flamboyant brand that grow more nihilistic and death-oriented as their notoriety and followers increase. One minute, the band is just a motley crew of hard-playing party monsters; the next, one guy is turning fragments of a dead bandmate’s shattered skull into jewelry. Akerlund, a veteran music-video director who intersperses “Lords of Chaos” with mildly surrealistic bursts, never establishes a coherent or interesting point of view. The tone unproductively veers from the goofy to the creepy, which creates a sense that he was still figuring it out in the editing. He skates over the story’s sociopolitical stakes but goes hard on the cheap shocks: a dead cat hanging from a ceiling like a fixture, bozo fans gnawing on a severed pig’s head mid-concert, close-ups of knives digging and plunging into bodies. He doesn’t seem to care much about those bodies, including that of a gay man who is sexually lured, and brutally murdered, by one of Oystein’s cohort. It’s never clear why things go as wrong as they do, other than Oystein’s brand marketing was disastrously successful. The character here certainly has a gift for dubious choices and bad company, including a singer portentously named Dead (Jack Kilmer, exuding low-key, melancholic charisma), and a creepy enthusiast, Kristian Vikernes (Emory Cohen), a.k.a. Varg, a.k.a. Count Grishnackh. Periodically someone rails against religion and conformity for a bit of lukewarm rebel posing, but all this soon sounds like a broken record at a party you’d like to leave. Far more effective is a scene in which a blank young man relaxes in his middle-class home shortly before killing a stranger for no reason at all.

2019,‘Mapplethorpe’ Review: A Timid Biopic of a Bold Photographer,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The statement Robert Mapplethorpe made with his photographs was practically self-evident. Every one of his pictures says “I think this is beautiful.” But the statement is followed by a question: “Don’t you?” Seen more than one at a time, his images create provocative, often startling juxtapositions. Consider the spadix of a white calla lily emerging from the center of the flower, next to, say, a man’s penis hanging outside the unzipped pants of a suit. Mapplethorpe’s question became one of the most controversial in modern art. And one that continued to linger long after his death in 1989, at age 42, from AIDS. “Mapplethorpe,” directed by Ondi Timoner, is a fictionalized biography of the photographer that is most alive when it’s putting its subject’s pictures on the screen, which it does often. And should have done more, because the movie is otherwise as timid as its subject was bold. Beginning with young Mapplethorpe in uniform as an R.O.T.C. cadet at Pratt, it cuts to some “New York City! Wow!” archival footage before the rebellious Robert meets cute with the poet Patti. The alliance between Mapplethorpe and the future rock star Patti Smith was movingly memorialized and mythologized by Smith herself in the 2010 book “Just Kids.” It came as both a surprise, and maybe not so much of one, to be informed in its pages that Smith was the practical one in the relationship. For all that, the art-worshipping duo were fierce nonconformists. “Mapplethorpe” does something I thought impossible: It makes Smith and Mapplethorpe kind of boring. The scene in which they dance together to a Tim Hardin record could be dropped into the middle of an episode of “This Is Us” and you’d never know the difference. (Patti is played, with a blandness that’s near-hilarious, by Marianne Rendón.) The movie soon settles into a conventional “and then this happened” structure. Robert expands his sexual parameters, Robert gets a Polaroid camera, Robert meets Sam Wagstaff, who is to become a lover and patron, and so on. In its respect for Mapplethorpe the artist, or maybe because of something less salutary, the movie hogties itself into passivity, never bothering to turn Robert into any kind of character. Viewers familiar with Mapplethorpe’s work are expected to sit up and say “Foreshadowing!” when Robert asks Sandy Daley, who gives him that Polaroid, “Can I take a picture of your flowers?” But other than that, the script, by Timoner and Mikko Alanne (adapted from a prior screenplay by Bruce Goodrich), avoids creative extrapolation with respect to Mapplethorpe’s inner life. This gives Matt Smith, in the title role, not a lot to do. The English actor has a physical resemblance to the film’s subject and is clearly both game and able, so that’s a shame.

2019,‘Miss Bala’ Fizzles on Hollywood’s Worst Super Bowl Weekend in 19 Years,"LOS ANGELES — It was the slowest Super Bowl weekend at the box office in nearly two decades, as poor reviews and winter storms combined to clobber Sony’s “Miss Bala” and other studios mostly sat out the three days. The Super Bowl does not automatically spell doom for Hollywood. “Taken,” starring Liam Neeson as a retired C.I.A. agent on a mission to save his kidnapped daughter, made its debut against the big game in 2009 and collected $25 million, leading to a three-film series. But the only major studio to take the risk this year was Sony, which released “Miss Bala” on 2,203 screens in the United States and Canada and came up with an estimated $6.7 million in ticket sales, according to Comscore. That total was not a disaster — “Miss Bala,” an action thriller starring Gina Rodriguez, cost only $15 million to make — but it’s never good when the only new wide-release film in theaters can’t overtake movies that have already been playing for weeks. “Glass” (Universal) repeated as No. 1 in its third weekend, collecting $9.5 million, for a new domestic total of $88.7 million. “Glass,” which completes an M. Night Shyamalan trilogy, has generated an additional $110 million in ticket sales overseas. “The Upside,” a sleeper hit starring Kevin Hart from STXfilms and Lantern Entertainment, took in about $8.9 million in second place, for a four-week domestic total of $75.6 million. “The Upside” has only been released in a handful of overseas markets so far, collecting $6.1 million, according to Box Office Mojo. “Miss Bala” was third. The PG-13 movie, directed by Catherine Hardwicke (“Twilight”), finds Rodriguez (“Jane the Virgin”) playing a woman dragged into the Mexico drug war. If nothing else, “Miss Bala,” adapted from a 2011 Spanish-language film of the same name, represents progress in Hollywood’s effort to be inclusive: In addition to having a female director and Latina star, the film had a mostly Latino crew. Total ticket sales in North America over the weekend stood at $71 million, according to Comscore, the lowest since 2000, when Hollywood only managed $66.3 million and the top film was “Eye of the Beholder,” which starred Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor and was a remake of a French thriller.",The New York Times
2019,‘No One Survived.’ A Taliban Attack Kills 32 at Remote Afghan Post.,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Afghan border security troops were asleep inside their remote post in southern Afghanistan early Friday when a Taliban infiltrator climbed a guard tower. Moments earlier, a lone sentry had left the post to wake his replacement. As the new sentry climbed the tower, he was shot dead by the insurgent hiding inside, officials in Kandahar Province said Saturday. Then, moments later, Taliban fighters rammed a stolen police Humvee packed with explosives through the entrance of the base, they said. Once inside, the attackers shot and killed security troops who had survived the initial explosion. All 32 men posted at the base died, said Khalid Pashtun, a member of Parliament from Kandahar. “No one survived,” he said. Officials said the insurgents escaped after looting the base, in Spinboldak district, across the border from the Pakistani city of Quetta some 60 miles south, where the Taliban leadership is based. Mohammad Yousuf Yunasi, a member of the provincial council, confirmed the attack but said he had few details. He said such ambushes are possible because Taliban fighters are often better equipped than border security forces. Some, he said, have night-vision goggles. “This is the main reason the police suffer high casualties,” Mr. Yunasi said. Officials said at least one of the Taliban attackers, the Humvee driver, was killed. The attack on the small base was the latest in a series of deadly Taliban ambushes of Afghan security outposts. Fighting during in the conflict, now in its 18th year, is normally limited during the harsh winter months, but it has spilled over from the traditional fighting season as the United States and the Taliban seek leverage in ongoing peace talks. The recent string of brazen attacks includes one on a government intelligence base last month that killed at least 40 people. But the government has also reported an increased targeting of Taliban fighters and commanders, particularly by American and Afghan airstrikes. They say hundreds of Taliban fighters have been killed in recent weeks. The next confirmed round of peace negotiations with the Taliban is scheduled for Feb. 25 in Doha, Qatar. Last month, the United States envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said that American and Taliban officials had agreed in principle to the framework of a deal in which the insurgents would guarantee that Afghanistan would not be a safe haven for terrorists. An agreement could lead to a full withdrawal of American troops in return for other Taliban concessions. Mr. Khalilzad said those concessions must include agreeing to a cease-fire and conducting direct negotiations with the Afghan government, something the Taliban have opposed in the past. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has complained of being sidelined by the talks. On Saturday, while attending a security conference in Munich, Mr. Ghani said Afghan government forces have borne the brunt of casualties since 2014, when the American-led NATO alliance ended its combat mission in Afghanistan. “The war is not an American war,” he said. Mr. Ghani said in January that 45,000 Afghan security forces had died in combat since late 2014.",The New York Times
2019,‘Not All Fun and Memes’: BuzzFeed News Employees Plan to Form a Union,"Last month, BuzzFeed laid off more than 220 employees, or 15 percent of its work force. On Tuesday, employees at the company’s news division responded with the announcement that they planned to form a union. “It’s not all fun and memes,” the organizing committee said in a statement. “Our staff has been organizing for several months, and we have legitimate grievances about unfair pay disparities, mismanaged pivots and layoffs, weak benefits, skyrocketing health insurance costs, diversity and more.” More than 40 of those who lost their jobs in the recent layoffs worked in the company’s bureaus in New York, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The cuts included all seven members of the BuzzFeed News national desk and six members of its nine-person national security team BuzzFeed’s revenue grew by more than 15 percent in 2018, but that gain wasn’t enough to stave off the decision by its founder, Jonah Peretti, to reduce the number of employees. In an email to the staff before the firings, Mr. Peretti wrote, “Unfortunately, revenue growth by itself isn’t enough to be successful in the long run.” Murmurs of a union started among company employees in 2015, when a group of staff members met with the NewsGuild of New York to discuss the issue of pay disparity, particularly in regards to women and employees of color. The group continued the effort last fall, when more than 50 employees participated in a meeting at the NewsGuild office. The job losses have further motivated the organizers, according to Dominic Holden, a politics reporter at BuzzFeed News and a member of the organizing committee. Davey Alba, a senior technology reporter, said, by her own estimation, “about 90 percent” of eligible BuzzFeed employees supported the idea. A BuzzFeed spokesman did not immediately comment on the organizing effort. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement: “We look forward to meeting with the organizers to discuss a way toward voluntarily recognizing their union.” BuzzFeed workers have already had some success in challenging management. Days after the layoff, roughly 600 current and former employees signed an open letter posted on Medium that pushed Mr. Peretti and other executives to compensate the laid-off staff members for unused vacation and comp days as part of their exit packages. It worked. Hours after the letter was published, Mr. Peretti notified the staff that he would grant the request. So far, the union effort involves only employees at BuzzFeed News, the division of the company led by the editor Ben Smith. If the company recognizes the union, a certification with the NewsGuild would follow, along with a negotiation of who would be covered under any contract. If BuzzFeed doesn’t recognize the union, the organizers said they would hold a union election with an official from the National Labor Relations Board present to facilitate a secret ballot. “I am confident in management,” Ms. Alba said. “I think that they will voluntarily recognize it.” Workers at BuzzFeed News are the latest digital media employees to pursue a union effort. So far this year, Vice Media, affiliated with the Writers Guild of America, East, has expanded the number of employees counted as union members, and employees at Refinery29 organized a union, also under the Writers Guild banner. Last year, employees at The New Yorker and New York magazine formed unions with the NewsGuild of New York. In both cases, management voluntarily recognized the organizing efforts. According to a report in the Harvard Business Review, 30 digital news sites and newspapers have recognized unions since 2015. “In total, the number of unionized workers in internet publishing has risen 20-fold since 2010,” the report said. Mr. Peretti is on the record opposing the idea. In 2015, he said, “I don’t think a union is right for BuzzFeed.” In an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Peretti floated a solution to the volatile economic landscape now affecting digital media companies: a series of mergers among the top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine Media and Refinery29. Mr. Peretti reasoned that, if BuzzFeed and those companies were to unite, they would put themselves in a better position to negotiate favorable terms with powerful tech platforms like Facebook. “He clearly understands the value of collective bargaining,” Mr. Holden said. “And we agree with him that collective action is critical to securing an equitable agreement.” An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the BuzzFeed News national security team before BuzzFeed made layoffs last month, and also misstated how many members of the team lost jobs in the layoffs. The team had nine members, not seven; six were laid off, not seven.",The New York Times
2019,‘Object’: British Lawmaker Blocks Bill Against Female Genital Cutting,"LONDON — A veteran British Conservative lawmaker has blocked a bill that would offer greater protection to girls at risk of genital cutting, drawing criticism across the political spectrum, with some calling it an “appalling” move. And it wasn’t the first time. The bill would allow children to be placed in temporary care if they were deemed at risk of genital cutting, as is the case for other child abuse. But because the bill was not introduced by the government, a simple objection in a sparsely attended session was enough for Christopher Chope to block it on Friday on procedural grounds with one word — “Object” — the second time he has done so since November. Mr. Chope’s latest move came a week after a woman in London became the first in the country to be convicted by a jury over the genital cutting of her daughter, at a time of heightened awareness about the issue, prompting reaction from campaigners and senior colleagues. David Lammy, a Labour Party lawmaker, wrote on Twitter, “Christopher Chope embodies a brand of thoughtless, regressive conservatism which can ruin lives.” Nimco Ali, a survivor of genital cutting and women’s rights campaigner, posted an exchange of text messages online in which she had asked Mr. Chope to give the bill a chance. He said no, calling for a full debate. “The truth is, he is simply playing games and doesn’t give a stuff about vulnerable girls,” she wrote on Twitter. Mr. Chope could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Zac Goldsmith, a fellow Conservative, who was among the bill’s backers, called Mr. Chope’s objection “appalling.” In response, Mr. Chope accused his colleagues of “virtue-signaling rather than looking at the substance,” in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper. “My constituents know what I am doing,” he said, adding that he was “not going to be put off” by a campaign of intimidation. The bill against genital cutting, introduced and debated in the upper house of Britain’s Parliament, had already cleared all stages there. But it has to pass the House of Commons before it can become law. On Friday, critics of Mr. Chope argued that his opposition wasn’t purely procedural. He previously objected to measures against taking upskirt photos of women and to the pardon of Alan Turing, the mathematician, computing pioneer and World War II code breaker convicted in 1952 for having sex with a man. (Versions of both bills passed later.) He has also consistently voted against allowing same-sex marriage in Britain, while most of his colleagues generally voted for it, according to TheyWorkForYou, a website that tracks votes and speeches by members of Parliament. Mr. Chope, who was first elected to Britain’s Parliament in 1983, is known for his opposition to the rapid passing of legislation brought without government support, called private members’ bills. In one of the singularities of Britain’s parliamentary system, bills can be proposed by any member of either house. But these texts are given less time for debate, and relatively few become laws. They have traditionally been used to highlight issues, spark larger debate and, in some cases, take the temperature of the room on issues likely to spark controversy. Britain legalized abortion in the late 1960s under a private member’s bill introduced by David Steel, a lawmaker who later became the leader of the small Liberal Party. The Labour government of the time gave its support only later and helped the bill get through Parliament. “I still get a mixture of fan and hate letters as though I were solely responsible for the legislation, when in fact I was just lucky to benefit from a quirk of British politics,” Mr. Steel wrote in The Independent in 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of the bill. A random name-drawing grants priority to some private members’ bills, and he came third in the ballot. Genital cutting — the practice of cutting or removing a girl’s genitalia for social or cultural but not medical reasons — has been a crime in Britain since 1985. It is usually done before girls reach puberty, is extremely painful and can have long-lasting effects on sexual activity, childbirth and mental health. But as more women have immigrated to Britain from countries where the practice is widespread, a study from City University in London estimated the number of women affected at more than 130,000 in a country of 66 million. In a one-year period ending in March 2018, Britain’s national health service recorded 6,195 women and girls with genital cutting, according to data released last year. On Friday, Britain’s home secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Twitter that he was very disappointed by Mr. Chope’s move, adding that he was “determined to stamp out this despicable and medieval practice.”",The New York Times
2019,‘One Million American Dreams’ Review: Stories From New York’s Potter’s Field,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Hart Island is in the Pelham Islands group, officially a part of the Bronx. East of the lively City Island, it is a grave site, New York City’s own potter’s field — a term from the New Testament that has come to denote a burial place for the poor, the anonymous, people without family or without family that can afford a marked resting place. The site is managed by the city’s Department of Correction and is not open to the public. Brendan J. Byrne’s documentary “One Million American Dreams” guides the viewer through several true narratives of how one might end up there. These stories can be heartbreaking. There’s a mother who had no funds to bury her dead infant. And a Cuban émigré working to send money to his family back home, who fell prey to dementia before dying incommunicado. Hart Island, the writer Luc Sante says in an interview, is emblematic of an indifference that all cities cultivate out of practical necessity. But in New York, he notes, the indifference is exaggerated. A case in point: the story of one drug addict whose family was never contacted after his body was found, kept as a medical-research cadaver for three years before being shipped to Hart Island. It took a New York Times reporter little more than a single phone call to locate the man’s widow. “With all honor to the dead, they are dead,” Sante says glumly at one point. Nevertheless, this documentary makes a powerful case that the city’s lost dead are due more honor than what Hart Island currently extends.

2019,"‘Opportunity Zones’ Offer Tax Breaks and, Maybe, Help for Communities","your taxes 2019 By enabling investors to postpone paying the tax man, new funds may draw money into distressed communities. But succeeding at both may be challenging. Affluent people have a new option for fending off the tax man: opportunity zone funds, which were included in the 2017 tax law as a way to help distressed neighborhoods. The funds are spurring interest among investors as a way of deferring and reducing capital gains. But whether they will substantially help needy communities is another question. Critics say that too often, the zones target the wrong districts. Amazon’s proposed corporate campus in Queens fell in areas designated as opportunity zones. The issue became moot when Amazon announced it would pull out of its planned New York headquarters. An Urban Institute analysis found that more than a quarter of designated zones already had relatively high levels of investment. Timothy Weaver, an assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, said the notion of tax-favored development zones has been tried before, often with lackluster results. “Money flows into the safe bets,” he said. He cited Louisville, Ky., where some areas that are already being gentrified have been designated as opportunity zones while some poorer tracts have not. “There’s no question,” he said, “that the primary beneficiaries of the program are the investors.” But in financial markets, opportunity funds are creating a buzz. “It’s arguably the most significant tax break in decades,” said Ben Miller, co-founder and chief executive of Fundrise, a real estate crowdfunding site that is sponsoring an opportunity fund. Based on recommendations from state governments, the United States Treasury has designated more than 8,700 eligible census tracts in urban, suburban and rural areas across the country. The opportunity funds are the vehicles for investing in these zones. The idea is that investors get federal tax breaks, while the neighborhoods get new businesses and upgraded properties, like apartment buildings, retail shops and hotels. But the rules are complex, and the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service didn’t clarify many details until October; more guidance is still expected. The recent government shutdown didn’t help. That said, opportunity funds are beginning to gain steam. The main questions for investors — such as what kind of investment gains are eligible for investment in an opportunity fund — generally have been answered, Mr. Miller said. “The benefits are pretty significant,” Mr. Miller said. Opportunity funds let investors postpone federal taxes on recent capital gains until the end of 2026; they can also reduce the taxable portion of those gains by as much as 15 percent, after seven years. Further, investors can eliminate taxes on additional gains from investing in the fund itself, if they hold the investment for 10 years. So, if you have investments that have appreciated, you can defer capital gains taxes by selling the investment and reinvesting the money into an opportunity fund within six months. Almost any sort of capital gain qualifies, whether from the sale of stocks or mutual funds, or other investments, including the sale of real estate or a business. (One investor in Fundrise’s opportunity fund, Mr. Miller said, invested a gain from the sale of a dialysis clinic.) Just the gains on an investment — rather than the entire proceeds of a sale — must be reinvested in the opportunity fund. That’s “highly unusual” and one reason opportunity funds may appear attractive, said Jeffrey Levine, chief executive of BluePrint Wealth Alliance. Say you sold stock for $500,000, and $300,000 of it was a gain. Just $300,000 must be rolled into the opportunity fund and the remaining $200,000 can be used as the seller wishes, according to an example provided by Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Wealth Solutions Group, part of Robert W. Baird & Company. By putting money in the fund, investors not only delay having to pay tax, but are also eligible for a partial exclusion of the tax on the reinvested gains. If you remain in the fund for five years, you will reduce the taxable gain by 10 percent; if you hold it an additional two years, for seven total, you will further reduce the taxable gain by another 5 percent. So, continuing with Baird’s example of the $300,000 reinvested gain, you would be taxed on $270,000 after five years, and on $255,000 after seven, assuming you made the investment in time to meet the various thresholds. “It wipes out a portion of the gain,” said Mike Windle, a partner with C. Curtis Financial Group in Plymouth, Mich. In addition, any profit you earn on your investment in the new fund is tax free, if you remain invested for 10 years. However, you must pay taxes on the initial gain that you rolled into the fund no later than Dec. 31, 2026, regardless of whether you remain invested in the fund, said Hal Zemel, a tax partner with the New York accounting and advisory firm Berdon. The funds are generally not for small-time investors. Minimum investments are hefty — often at least $50,000 to $100,000 and, in some cases, much higher. While the tax benefits are enticing, investors should consider that property development has its own risks, and zones targeted by the new funds are, by definition, intended to be in areas where development generally hasn’t occurred on its own. Because the funds are so new, it’s uncertain how profitable they are going to be — and much may depend on the developers. “Picking a manager is critically important,” said David Coelho, chief investment officer for opportunity zone strategies at Bridge Investment Group, a real estate investment firm. “It’s a bit of the wild West out there,” Mr. Zemel said. “You really have to do your due diligence.” Mr. Levine said he was cautious about recommending opportunity funds to clients. “The last thing you want to do is take your gain, get blinded by a tax benefit, and lose your money,” he said. It’s likely, he said, that local developers who already had projects underway in the designated zones will benefit most. State governors naturally wanted to designate opportunity zones in areas most in need of capital, but some neighborhoods may be too depressed to appeal to investors, said Avy Stein, co-founder of Cresset Wealth Advisors, which is a partner in an opportunity fund. He said he considered many of the zones in Illinois to be particularly challenging for investors, while areas of California and the Pacific Northwest, along with Houston, Nashville, Omaha, New York and Washington, D.C., were more promising. Fundrise is targeting areas in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington, D.C., as well as the Bay Area, including Oakland and San Jose. While it may appear that some areas had enough investment before their designation as opportunity zones, he said, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. For example, he said, the Manchester neighborhood of Richmond, Va., has had “pockets” of intense development but needs help to keep the momentum going. “Lack of further investment risks the failing of neighborhood redevelopments to date and a spiral back into decay,” Mr. Miller said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Paddleton’ Review: A Shrug in the Shadow of Death,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When contemplating the subject of dying, Michael (Mark Duplass) can muster little else than “eh.” “Paddleton,” and its gestures toward hushed profundity, might evoke much the same reaction from audiences. Before receiving a cancer diagnosis, Michael spent the bulk of his time with his best friend, Andy (Ray Romano), doing puzzles, playing a squash-like game called “Paddleton,” and watching the same kung fu movie repeatedly. The diagnosis changes nothing and everything about their routine. The two men, who seem to have only each other, bristle at having to engage in small talk with anyone. And yet “Paddleton” is an aggressively gentle film. Well, for a film about assisted suicide. “Paddleton,” a Netflix original film, spends most of its time chronicling the aftermath of Michael’s diagnosis and his subsequent decision to end his life with Andy’s help. Alex Lehmann, who directed the movie, and Duplass, who wrote it with him, make a commendable effort in observing its characters’ tics in hyper-specific detail. So do Romano and Duplass, who as actors are clearly invested in trying to imbue this intimate friendship with a lived-in familiarity and mumbly warmth. The pace is leisurely, the humor likable (until it proves a liability), and its two lead characters are illustrated with generous precision. And yet for all that, the payoffs feel negligible. “Paddleton” is so keyed into its protagonists’ various idiosyncrasies that it seems hesitant to grapple with its own central tension. Too often, Andy’s anxiety about Michael’s situation is deflected with humor, which lands only like a pat on the back, never reveling in the absurdity. In the end, the film takes too long to take itself seriously, and as such it struggles to deliver on its ostensible promise: that two weird men with a close bond will meaningfully confront death and its implications — to themselves and to their friendship. Previous writing-directing work by Duplass with his brother, Jay (“Jeff Who Lives at Home”), could be quietly devastating. “Paddleton” is mostly just quiet.

2019,‘Parkland: Inside Building 12’ Review: Recounting the Attack in Painful Detail,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. For roughly the first 50 minutes of “Parkland: Inside Building 12,” students and teachers recall last year’s attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in harrowing detail: who heard what and when, who hid where, which doors were locked, who was bleeding or killed. Much of the second hour is then devoted to remembering the 17 dead, one by one. At the close, when Emma González is shown reciting their names at the March for Our Lives rally, we have a mental image of each person. The movie, directed by Charlie Minn, is unbearable to watch, yet its centering of first-person testimony — supplemented with floor plans of the building and phone footage from that day — makes the massacre immediate in a way that sometimes gets lost in news coverage or political debates. As you watch the teacher Ernie Rospierski say he’s been avoiding thinking about could-haves and should-haves or hear descriptions of how precariously positioned the student Maddy Wilford was after being shot, it’s impossible to avoid the sense that their survival came down to chance. These could easily be other shootings or other survivors. In fact, Minn has also made documentaries (presumably with the same approach) on the Pulse nightclub and Las Vegas shootings, and at times this hasty, low-budget production gives off an unfortunate air of ambulance chasing. Music cues provide unnecessary goosing; cheap re-enactments trace the shooter’s whereabouts; and the director, who is sometimes on camera, intersperses good questions with manipulative prods to his grieving subjects. But the subjects are there, and to the extent that “Parkland: Inside Building 12” is a memorial, not a documentary, it has a raw power.

2019,‘Pit of Infection’: A Border Town’s Crisis Has Nothing to Do With Migrants,"Noxious sewage contaminated with feces, industrial chemicals and other raw waste crosses the border through the binational New River. The New River, which flows across the border between Calexico, Ca., and Mexicali, Mexico, has long been contaminated with sewage and industrial waste.CreditCreditEmily Kask for The New York Times CALEXICO, Calif. — For generations, residents of the Southern California border town of Calexico watched with trepidation as their river turned into a cesspool, contaminated by the booming human and industrial development on the other side of the border in Mexico. Noxious sewage filled with feces, industrial chemicals and other raw waste regularly comes in through the New River, which flows from Mexico’s Mexicali Valley and through Calexico, leaving neighborhoods along the waterway engulfed in pungent fumes. And it’s not just the river: From above, smoke billows from Mexican factories, illicit medical burn sites and tire pits, fueling widespread asthma in the region. As Washington debates spending billions to shore up barriers along the 2,000-mile southwest border, many residents in California’s Imperial Valley feel at least some of that money could be spent to address the region’s public health threats. Just feet away from Calexico, Mexico’s lax environmental rules and enforcement pose a regular menace. “It’s a pit of infection,” said Arturo Santiago, 50, who lives in a neighborhood adjacent to the river in west Calexico, atop a steep overlook. “It smells like farts if you open your window.” Mexico has long treated the New River as a drain rather than a river, discharging raw, untreated sewage from Mexicali homes and businesses directly into the water. The explosive growth of Mexicali into a city of a million people in recent decades, in part accelerated by the North American Free Trade Agreement, has exacerbated the problem. Today, even after various cleanup efforts, large mounds of unnatural foam and piles of trash — illegally dumped — float atop the dark green stream, which flows into the United States through a hole in a slatted border fence and flows north toward the Salton Sea in California. A 2018 report published by the regional water board shows that the river, where it crosses the border, contains extreme fecal coliform and E. coli concentrations that are orders of magnitude beyond established targets, because of the tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage that have been dumped into the river in recent years. State lawmakers have noted that the river is believed to carry pathogens that cause tuberculosis, encephalitis, polio, cholera, hepatitis, and typhoid. But Calexico, a small town of 40,000 in California’s Imperial Valley farm belt, has had little recourse but to endure the public health risks. Miguel Figueroa, Calexico’s assistant city manager, called the river a “historic environmental justice problem.” The westside homes adjacent to the river have historically been occupied by low-income residents, many of whom work in agriculture. Their relative poverty, plus the Imperial Valley’s lack of political clout in Sacramento, he said, were significant obstacles to drawing sustained attention to the river. Many have called for enclosing the river and diverting its waters to filter out pollutants. Those living near the river are not the only ones with concerns. The river also poses a security issue for border agents, said David Kim, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection. “Smuggling organizations still use the New River to move humans into the U.S.,” said Mr. Kim, noting that border agents are unable to go into the water to chase border violators because it is too hazardous. The air pollution concerns also have been worrying. Gilbert Rebollar, a board member of the Brawley Elementary School District, to the north of Calexico, said students regularly cannot go outside because the air quality is too dangerous. About 20 percent of children in Imperial County have asthma, according to a 2016 California Health Interview Survey, roughly twice the state average. That number may be higher in towns directly adjacent to the border. “There is a crisis here but it has nothing to do with immigration,” said Mr. Rebollar, who is also an analyst at the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District. “And it’s not just about money. It’s about holding Mexico accountable. Some of these hospitals are going out at night and burning medical waste.” Mr. Santiago, like many people living in the neighborhoods overlooking the river, said he had gone through about four air-conditioning units since he moved into his house in 2000. He and his neighbors suspect the corrosion damage is caused by chemicals in the air, though the local air pollution control board said it was not aware of these complaints. Rebeca and Miguel Zapata, whose grandson, Kevin, 15, often visits and has severe asthma, said they moved to the neighborhood adjacent to the river in the 1990s because the homes were cheaper there. Ms. Zapata, 76, said her allergies have become so severe she has to go to the doctor weekly for treatment. Public health officials in the region said allergies are difficult to pin to specific environmental causes. But fears and suspicions in the community persist. Nearly 20 years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency granted $31 million to pay for sanitation projects on the Mexican side of the border, completed in 2007, to improve the water quality before it reached the United States. That project, funded by North American Development Bank, which was created by Nafta, encased the river on the Mexican side in piping. No such piping was installed on the American side. But by May 2017, the regional California Water Quality Control Board was raising fresh alarms. In spite of progress, “the deteriorating condition of the sewage infrastructure” built in Mexico posed a severe threat to the water quality, the board wrote in a resolution addressed to several federal and international agencies. At least once a month, for at least six months, one million to 13 million gallons of raw sewage were released into the river by Mexicali, the water board said. Many along the border have groused about funding for water treatment projects not going to the American side. “It’s been really hard to digest and understand that American resources are going into Mexico,” said Mr. Figueroa, the assistant city manager. “It’s shameful, because the last time we checked Imperial County is in the state of California.” Community efforts to redevelop the river on the American side have faced delays over 15 years. About two dozens stakeholders at the local, state, and federal level have some oversight responsibility for the New River. The bureaucratic glut is perhaps partly to blame for the delays. “For crying out loud, when you have environmental problems that are that prevalent, that are affecting human beings and human health, that should be at the very top of the list,” said Eduardo Garcia, a Democratic member of the State Assembly who has sought to bring attention to the problem in the State Legislature. Two crucial developments have revived the cleanup efforts. In 2016 the state allocated $1.4 million to draft an engineering plan to begin collecting and treating the water. Then, in 2018, a state proposition allocated $10 million toward the project, part of a broader package to rehabilitate the Salton Sea. Mr. Figueroa is hopeful that, with enough money now to get the project off the ground, local officials can use the momentum to find the additional $10 million to $20 million they need to complete the project. “For the longest time we heard that we needed a shovel-ready project. And guess what, we have a shovel-ready project now and we have partial funding,” he said. There has been more success and investment in combating the air quality problems. The California Environmental Protection Agency said it maintains strong relationships with its Mexican counterparts. Federal money, meanwhile, has bolstered air-quality monitoring programs in Mexicali, which help Mexican authorities crack down on illegal trash-burning. Jared Blumenfeld, the new secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency under Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the state was “committed to doing the project” on the New River. He shared a video from a visit to Mexicali in 2011 that showed blood draining into the river from a slaughterhouse. Mr. Blumenfeld said he would be “fairly shocked” if money for the New River were not included on a new list of federal funding priorities. “We as a country have not made good on our commitments under Nafta to continue to make border improvements, and the New River is so emblematic of this,” he said. Residents here, after decades of promises, are not so sure that help will arrive, and are suspicious of officials at every level of government. “They’re either stealing the money or they’re not getting any,” said Mr. Santiago. “But they don’t pay attention. They don’t pay attention.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Progressive Prosecutor’: Can Kamala Harris Square the Circle?,"The Long Run Ms. Harris seemed to try to be all things to all people as a district attorney and state attorney general. Now, as she runs for president, her record faces a chorus of critics, especially on the left. Senator Kamala Harris says her critics are imposing false choices on her record.CreditCreditChristie Hemm Klok for The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Kamala Harris was three months into her tenure as San Francisco district attorney in 2004 when a gang member killed a police officer with a hail of bullets from an AK-47. Her announcement within three days of the murder that she would not seek the death penalty set off protests from her fellow Democrats as well as from the police. Senator Dianne Feinstein stood in front of thousands of mourners at the officer’s funeral at St. Mary’s Cathedral and urged her to change her mind; Jerry Brown, the once and future governor, was among those standing in ovation. The state attorney general threatened to take over the case, and Senator Barbara Boxer asked the Justice Department to prosecute it. Ms. Harris, the first person of color elected as this city’s district attorney, declared her decision a matter of principle: The death penalty, she believed, discriminated against poor and black people and would not deter more killing. But death penalty opponents wondered a decade later where that principle had gone when as California’s attorney general Ms. Harris appealed a judge’s decision declaring the state’s death penalty law unconstitutional. She said it was a matter of upholding the law; her critics asked whether she would have similarly defended segregation and statutes against interracial marriage. Now Ms. Harris is running for president as a “progressive prosecutor.” She says she sees no contradiction in the term, arguing that a tough prosecutor can also be a force for reforming the criminal-justice system. But already, mere weeks into her candidacy, she is facing a chorus of skepticism, especially from the left. The death penalty episode shows the tricky crosscurrents that she has had to weather — and that are likely to intensify as she tries to square that circle. In a dozen years as the top law enforcement official of the city and then the state, Ms. Harris was as much politician as prosecutor, appearing to try to be all things to all constituencies. More practical than ideological, she was defined most by resisting easy definition. She impressed Californians with her commanding presence — offering a preview of the senator the country would see pointedly questioning Republican nominees during confirmation hearings. But she developed a reputation for caution, protecting the status quo and shrinking from decisions on contentious issues. Years before ending mass incarceration became a bipartisan cause, she started programs to steer low-level drug offenders away from prison and into school and jobs. At the same time, she touted her success in increasing conviction rates, and as attorney general remained largely on the sidelines as California scrambled to meet a federal court order to reduce its swollen prison populations. She also repeatedly sided with prosecutors accused of misconduct, challenging judges who ruled against them. And while she summoned righteous anger toward the bank fraud that helped set off the Great Recession, holding out for more money for California homeowners in the National Mortgage Settlement, she said little when the governor diverted some of it to fill holes in his budget. “She played it very careful,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who served on an independent panel that investigated one of the cases of prosecutorial misconduct while Ms. Harris was attorney general. “She had her sights set on what her future might be, and she realized every day she was navigating a minefield, because she had law enforcement to deal with, she had the public to deal with, the minority community to deal with. I think she was trying to be very careful not to alienate.” She has also had to navigate the shifting politics of crime and race — and the expectations they bring with them. Ms. Harris began her career at a time when many African-American law enforcement officials were joining, even amplifying, law-and-order calls for stricter prosecution, to stop the drugs and violence victimizing their communities. When she became attorney general in 2011, crime was falling and the debate was evolving. Now, in the era of Black Lives Matter, many in the black community argue that the biggest law-enforcement problem is law enforcement itself, and her record is being assessed against calls for a wholesale reimagination of the criminal justice system — who should go to prison and for how long; indeed, should any but the most heinous criminals go to prison at all? At the other end of the political spectrum, President Trump has sought to frame the immigration debate around fear of rising crime, teeing it up as a campaign issue for 2020. In the waning days of the partial government shutdown over his demand for a border wall, he tweeted what he called a new Republican theme for the next two years: “BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!” Ms. Harris scorns what she calls false choices, and says her critics are imposing them on her record. Those who have worked for her call her disciplined, a characterization she prefers to “cautious.” She describes her thinking — about criminal justice, but also about the other issues animating her presidential candidacy, like health care and economic inequality — as scientific. “It’s a hypothesis; this is how we can do things better,” she said in a recent interview. “You have to inform it with: Where’s the empirical evidence? Where is the data? Where is the detail?” She does not like to be boxed in. “The thing that drives Kamala Harris crazy above all other things is to get reduced to a demographic archetype,” said Sean Clegg, a longtime strategist for Ms. Harris and other California Democrats. “‘You are XYZ because you are a black woman; you are XYZ because you’re from San Francisco.’ She’s a complex person like all of us. She’s also been the first. That’s a lot more difficult than it looks.” Ms. Harris, now 54, confounded expectations just by becoming a prosecutor. She is the daughter of immigrants — her mother from India, her father from Jamaica — who met as civil-rights activists in graduate school at Berkeley and gave Ms. Harris what she calls a stroller’s-eye view of the demonstrations of the 1960s. Most of her law school peers went into civil-rights work, recalled Jeff Adachi, who was a tutor in Ms. Harris’s program at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law and later faced off against her as San Francisco’s elected public defender. “You didn’t have a lot of minorities who were wanting to be part of law enforcement,” he said. She had to explain to family and friends before taking her first job out of law school, as a prosecutor in Oakland in 1990. As she described it in the recent interview, “When we want to reform systems, it shouldn’t and it can’t only be from the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the door.” She added, “Let’s try and do it from the inside and understand that those people are going to stand in a courtroom and ask for guilty verdicts for people who do harm to the community — and that’s consistent with all progressive values.” She earned a reputation as a sharp trial lawyer, and in 1998 became the managing attorney in charge of the career criminal unit in the San Francisco district attorney’s office. But she left within two years, frustrated by what she saw as the dysfunction of that office, which had the state’s lowest conviction rate and lacked basics like email and enough phones. She worked for the city attorney, and she prepared to run against her former boss, Terence Hallinan, in 2003. Ms. Harris had made political and social connections, dating Willie Brown, the powerful speaker of the California House, and serving on the board of the city’s Museum of Modern Art. But her polls showed she was a relative unknown. Mr. Hallinan, a former defense lawyer and a son of a Progressive Party presidential candidate, had infuriated the police department by winning indictments of top brass in a scandal involving the assistant chief’s son. Ms. Harris campaigned between Mr. Hallinan and a more law-and-order candidate, on a platform that ran the gamut: professionalizing the office and improving relations with the police, opposing the death penalty and creating programs to steer first-time nonviolent offenders away from crime. She brought a rare perspective — elected district attorneys are more typically white men; a 2015 study by the Women Donors Network found that just 1 percent are women of color. Communities of color, she argued, wanted tougher treatment for the drug dealers victimizing them; what they didn’t want from the police was excessive force. Almost immediately, her decision on the death penalty in the officer’s killing inflamed tensions with the police. But it was pragmatic as well as principled: She knew that San Francisco jurors rarely if ever returned death sentences. And despite the protests, polling showed that the public supported her. Some contend that the episode spooked her, that she spent the rest of her tenure trying to make amends with the police. Ms. Harris scoffs at the idea, pointing to her diversion program that allowed young low-level offenders to avoid incarceration if they enrolled in school full time and kept a job. “You think law enforcement was supportive of that?” she said. That program was relatively small, with only about 300 graduates over eight years. Mr. Adachi and others complained that it took only the offenders most likely to succeed. But its recidivism rate was remarkably low: less than 10 percent, compared with 53 percent statewide. Arguing that students who skip school are the ones who end up in the criminal justice system, Ms. Harris also started an anti-truancy program. She described it as carrot-and-stick: It threatened prosecution for parents whose children were chronically absent, but also helped them with health care problems and other hurdles to getting their children to school. Critics, though, said it was more stick than carrot, and failed to grapple with the depths of the social problems parents were struggling against. Either way, the program reflected Ms. Harris’s approach to her job. “Fierce,” said Lateefah Simon, a onetime teenage shoplifter who became executive director of a center that helps lift young women out of lives of crime. Ms. Harris recruited her to work in the district attorney’s office, instructed her to lose the Pumas and track pants, bought her a suit and told her she needed to understand the penal code. Ms. Harris herself kept an immaculate desk, with little more than a notepad and a keyboard at her fingertips. Ms. Simon called Ms. Harris “the 1999 version of Olivia Pope,” the impeccably tailored, steely-in-a-crisis hero of television’s “Scandal.” “She’s not easy,” Ms. Simon said. “If you beat up a woman in front of her children, you are going to jail. At the heart, she is a prosecutor. She wants to hold people accountable.” Suzy Loftus, who started working for Ms. Harris as a campaign volunteer in 2003 and is now running for district attorney, recalls Ms. Harris’s instruction as she swore her in as a prosecutor: “When you go into court tomorrow,” she told her, “you look the judge in the eye and say, ‘Suzy Loftus, for the people.’” (“For the people” is now the slogan for Ms. Harris’s presidential campaign.) “It’s professional and it’s about dignity,” Ms. Loftus said. “But it’s also about giving dignity to people who are most impacted by the system.” But it was Ms. Harris’s success in increasing conviction rates that became a central boast of her campaign for attorney general in 2010. An article in San Francisco Weekly that year challenged the numbers, noting that most of the convictions had come from plea deals, and that the conviction rate for cases that went to trial was lower than Mr. Hallinan’s, and had dropped over the previous two years. Assistant prosecutors were quoted saying that Ms. Harris had pressured them to take weak cases to trial in an attempt to look tough on crime as she prepared to run beyond the liberal city. Her office defended her by noting that she had won stiffer sentences than her predecessors, by demanding prison time instead of probation for crimes including robbery and home burglary. Ms. Simon, who was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2003 for her leadership on juvenile justice and now leads the Akonadi Foundation, a racial justice organization in Oakland, says she fights with her “radical friends” who think Ms. Harris was not progressive enough on crime. “I say, I’d love to see you run for D.A. and run a better office.” Ms. Harris, she said, had to contend with expectations from all sides. “She instinctually but also strategically had to think about the way people saw her,” Ms. Simon said. “The expectations not just of a black woman elected, but with black folks, they expected so much of her to go and revolutionize the system in four to eight years, which is impossible.” Ms. Harris ran unopposed in 2007 for her second term — the only San Francisco district attorney to have done so in nearly two decades. And she became increasingly well known nationally, publishing her first book, “Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer,” as she prepared to run for attorney general in 2010. She took office at the ideal moment for a prosecutor who wanted to rethink the criminal justice system. A panel of federal judges had ruled that overcrowding in California prisons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment — prisoners were stacked in triple bunk beds in gymnasiums and dying for lack of medical care — and ordered the state to reduce the population by about 40,000. The debate over prison crowding had been long-running and contentious, with victims’ rights groups and law enforcement officials opposing the idea of prisoner release. Ms. Harris stayed above the fray, as she would on a range of issues throughout her tenure, seeing herself less as a decision maker than as a lawyer serving a client. She had campaigned to the right of her Republican opponent on the question of easing the state’s tough three-strikes law. Once in office, she declined to take positions on ultimately successful ballot initiatives intended to reduce prison populations — one expanding opportunities for parole, the other reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors. She argued that because she was tasked with writing the descriptions of the initiatives that would appear on the ballot any public statements on the proposals might create the impression that she had a finger on the scale. This departed, though, from the practice of previous attorneys general. After the Supreme Court upheld the judges’ overcrowding order, the state promised to “promptly” release a significant number of nonviolent prisoners, giving credit for time served. A delay in meeting that promise drew a judicial scolding in 2014. The state’s response proved embarrassing, and unsuccessful: Reducing the prison population, Ms. Harris’s office maintained, would hurt California’s ability to fight wildfires by shrinking the pool of forced labor. “She really was a sideline player in all the decarceration efforts,” said Robert Weisberg, a law professor and co-director of the criminal law center at Stanford. “She didn’t stake out a strong position on what to do other than, ‘Let’s promote re-entry and anti-recidivism programs.’” The California attorney general’s office is large, about 5,000 lawyers, and Ms. Harris said she was unaware of the brief arguing for cheap prison labor. “A previous A.G. said to me, ‘You are going to inherit an office of 5,000 mistakes waiting for you every day,’” she said in the interview. “I have always owned that responsibility.” That was also her response to criticism that she had resisted appeals for DNA testing from Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate whose case had been taken up by groups including the American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Harris said she learned of the case in a New York Times column last year — after which she urged testing. Beginning in the summer of 2014, the nation — and with it, California’s attorney general — was thrust into a debate over police brutality, by the deaths of black men in confrontations with the police in Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; and other cities. Ms. Harris won praise for releasing statewide data in a way that informed rather than inflamed the brutality debate: It included numbers on the use of police force but also on use of force against officers. She instituted body cameras for police agents who worked in her office, and offered implicit-bias training for police statewide. But she declined to support statewide regulations for the use of body cameras, agreeing with local departments that they should set their own standards. And she did not support a bill that would have required the attorney general to investigate police shootings. Her office was also forced to confront an uproar over prosecutorial misconduct, with judges disciplining local prosecutors for lying and tampering with evidence. It was an issue she had faced as district attorney in a scandal involving drug testing at the San Francisco Police Department crime lab. A technician had been skimming drugs to feed her own habit, and Ms. Harris’s chief drug prosecutor had warned that she was sabotaging evidence. Ms. Harris said she only learned of the problem several months later, when it was revealed publicly. A judge then ruled that the district attorney’s office had violated constitutional protections requiring prosecutors to turn over any information that might damage witnesses’ credibility, and criticized the office for failing to tell defense lawyers about crimes or misconduct on at least 60 police officers’ records. Ms. Harris responded by accusing the judge of a conflict of interest because she was married to a defense attorney who had handled a case involving the lab. (A court rejected her motion.) As attorney general, Ms. Harris defended prosecutors by appealing judges’ rulings — dropping one appeal, during her Senate campaign, only after a video of judges criticizing her office went viral. In a case in Orange County, a public defender had discovered that the district attorney’s office was strategically placing jailhouse informants, offering them leniency if they could coax confessions from fellow inmates. A judge found that the district attorney’s office had lied to him about the use of informants and withheld potentially favorable evidence from defense lawyers. When the judge disqualified the entire office from a death penalty case, Ms. Harris appealed, accusing the judge of abusing his discretion. While she opened an inquiry into the case at hand, she rejected repeated calls for a broad investigation of the prosecutor’s office. In the recent interview, Ms. Harris said her decision reflected her experience when others had tried to disqualify her from the San Francisco death penalty case. It was up to voters, not the attorney general, she said, to remove elected prosecutors. “I knew misconduct had occurred, clearly it had,” she said. “And it was being handled at the local level.” Frustrated by her refusal to investigate, Erwin Chemerinsky, then the law school dean at the University of California, Irvine, joined with a former attorney general to ask the Justice Department to examine what they believed was a pattern of civil rights violations in the prosecutor’s office. Their letter was signed by 25 prominent law professors, prosecutors and defense lawyers. “Twice Kamala Harris called on my cell and said she was on top of it and looking into it,” he said. “To my knowledge, the California A.G. never did anything with regard to the scandal.” Professor Chemerinsky emphasized that he admired Ms. Harris’s work as a senator. But, he said, her office’s decisions on Orange County were “outrageous.” “Their reaction ranged from silence to criticizing the judge who found the misconduct,” he said. “Never did they attempt to be a force for reform.” In September 2011, Ms. Harris announced that she would not sign the National Mortgage Settlement, negotiated by the Obama administration with the banks at the center of the foreclosure crisis. What happened next, Ms. Harris and her supporters say, illustrates her agility in balancing competing interests. The proposed settlement essentially gave the banks amnesty against further prosecution. Ms. Harris wanted to leave open the possibility of investigation and lawsuits, and promised Californians to lock up the bankers responsible for the fraud. As the top prosecutor for the state with the bulk of foreclosures, she had the power to determine the fate of the deal. The lobbying was intense — from housing groups, from homeowners, from the Obama administration. “It was a constant tension between speeding the relief quickly in the middle of the crisis or taking the time to go through this investigation, which could take years, while people were losing their homes every day,” said Brian Nelson, a deputy who helped Ms. Harris negotiate the deal. She did not kill the settlement. She emerged with a better one: The banks agreed to $18 billion in debt reduction that Ms. Harris said would allow California homeowners to stay in their homes, and the national agreement included $2.5 billion for a fund to provide educational counseling and other services for those in danger of foreclosure. But critics, especially on the left, have long said that the settlement was no grand bargain. It did not require banks to pay much out of pocket; $4.7 billion of the $18 billion in relief came from forgiving second mortgages, many of which the banks would have written off anyway because they were so severely underwater, and $9 billion came from homeowners selling their homes for less than the value of their mortgages, meaning that homeowners did not stay in their homes. Ms. Harris retained the right to investigate and pursue claims against the banks, winning $921 million against five institutions. But no one went to prison; she explained to voters that she was frustrated, too, but the state could go only “where the evidence took us.” And most of the $410 million California got to help at-risk homeowners never made it to them; a judge found that Governor Brown diverted $331 million to plug budget holes. Ms. Harris recused herself from defending the governor because of her role in the settlement. She rebuffed housing advocates’ requests to meet with her, offering little more than a brief statement that the money should go to homeowners. Her decision to fight the ruling that had struck down California’s capital punishment law in 2015 created similar disappointment among those who had applauded her refusal to call for the death penalty in San Francisco. “This was not a situation where they were compelled to respond,” said Hadar Aviram, a law professor at Hastings who started a petition against appealing. “They could have done nothing.” The public, however, had three years earlier rejected a ballot initiative that would have abolished the death penalty in California. In the interview, Ms. Harris said that as attorney general she had had to represent her client, the governor, who supported the death penalty appeal. Even so, she had cited her discretion in deciding which cases to pursue when she declined requests to defend Proposition 8, a successful ballot initiative defining marriage as between a man and a woman, in federal courts. Once again, she said, her critics were framing a false choice: She could defend the death penalty for a client and still be opposed to it personally. Just as a prosecutor can be tough but also progressive. “One human being kills another human being, a woman is raped, a child is molested — are we really saying there should be no consequence and accountability?” she said. “I believe it is consistent with knowing that there is bias in the system, knowing that there are deep flaws in the system, knowing that there has to be reform of the system.” She added: “Are we really saying that you’re either that, or you believe that there should be serious consequences for people who commit serious crimes? I am both.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Prosecuting Evil’ Review: At 98, His Passion for Justice Hasn’t Dimmed","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Benjamin B. Ferencz is now 98, but in “Prosecuting Evil: The Extraordinary World of Ben Ferencz,” there’s no sign that his passion has dimmed. In this documentary from the Canadian director Barry Avrich, he tells of how he emigrated to the United States from the tumult of Eastern Europe in the 1920s as a child and grew to become the chief prosecutor in the Einsatzgruppen case at the Nuremberg trials. Ferencz was 27 when the case began and apparently not tall enough for the lectern without elevation. In the film’s best stretches, he offers a detailed account of the proceedings and what followed, including his encounter with the convicted war criminal Otto Ohlendorf shortly before Ohlendorf’s execution. He also takes us through his post-Nuremberg work, such as how he used a set of bones from Auschwitz to persuade the German government to maintain the country’s Jewish cemeteries in perpetuity and his advocacy for a permanent international criminal court. He explains how he and the Vietnam-era defense secretary Robert S. McNamara came to write an odd-couple Opinion article in The New York Times in 2000 urging Bill Clinton to sign the treaty creating that court, even though McNamara could have been one of the first defendants. There is additional commentary from one of Ferencz’s children, Don, and from notable legal figures like the Canadian Supreme Court justice Rosalie Abella. But the main interest lies with Ferencz himself, who comes across as thoughtful, principled and engaging in a film that, in keeping with his demeanor, is a modest profile rather than a sprawling portrait.

2019,Opinion | ‘Race Is Not a Costume’,"Readers share their thoughts on blackface. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. “Any collective reckoning with racism that comes out of this moment must go beyond the personal and offensive,” Jamelle Bouie writes in his column, “Blackface Is the Tip of the Iceberg,” which talks about the implications of a photo on the 1984 medical school yearbook page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, showing one man in blackface and another in a Klansman’s robe and mask. More than 900 readers responded to the column. Some acknowledged their ignorance of the racism inherent in the practice, while others argued that it was simply a byproduct of a different time in America’s cultural growth. Other readers referenced the pain, and sometimes fear, the image evoked in them, or pushed back against those who minimized the insidious nature of blackface and other similarly degrading practices. As Lisa F. Shaftel, a reader from Framingham, Mass., put it: “Blackface is not a costume; race is not a costume. That some people don’t understand this, is racism.” We’ve shared a selection of these comments below. They have been edited for length and clarity. I was a black student at U.Va. in the early 1980s and recall vividly being chased one night by two people in Klan regalia through the downtown mall in Charlottesville. I also remember seeing derogatory racist images tacked on telephone poles announcing fraternity bashes. Will the United States ever reckon with the history that blackface represents? To reckon would require accountability. Thus far, it would seem that it’s exactly the wrong kind of accounting on the balance sheets of great wealth and power — accrued through slavery and its aftermath — that matters most. — Mabel Wilson, Harlem Here’s the bottom line: White people do not want to see what black people experience. If they did, they would only have to look. It is a searing experience to feel the vulnerability and hurt that black people feel, and to realize that racism is a constant in their lives. Once white people really see it, they would not be able to abide it in any form — the mocking of people’s skin color, mannerisms or cultural differences. They’d become sick of it, at the stupidity of it, of the terrible cost and waste of humanity. And it would become very clear that anyone who thinks blackface is entertaining is not only tone deaf, but truly racist and should not be rewarded with a political position of any kind. — Mary Traina, New York When I was around 6 years old (around 1958), my mother planned for her and my dad to put on blackface and dress as Al Jolson minstrels for a Halloween party in our small town in the Catskills of New York. My dad refused, saying that one of his friends was black and might be offended. My mother argued that it was not racist. They ended up in the worst screaming fight that I ever experienced, my sisters and I hiding in our bedrooms, confused, tearful and afraid of the intensity and raw emotions that shook the house. I don’t know if my mother’s crying was from the shame of realizing her own ignorance, or if she was just disappointed that she wasn’t going to get a break from her difficult life. The traditions and seemingly harmless rituals that sit on top of our racist history must be admitted, and, through education and compassion, lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves. — rixax, Toronto Blackface is still disrespectful and racist whether they’re dressing up as historical figures or not. If I, as a black woman, want to dress up as Audrey Hepburn for Halloween, I don’t paint my face white. I put on a tiara and little black dress. — Kay, U.S.A. Normalizing racist behavior is what leads to centuries of oppressive statutes and laws and, of course, the carrying out of vigilante justice like lynchings and castrations. I shudder when I read many of the comments here because I realize that much really hasn’t changed and that those postcards from the past of black men burned, castrated and swinging, surrounded by the faces of white men, women and children smiling gleefully, might be passed off as a harmless prank. We’re not ready to discuss the “unusual depth,” as Mr. Bouie described it, of blackface quite yet. — Angelicia Simmons, Raleigh, N.C. I’m sorry, but this is no way to run a country. The focus should be, and remain on, the issues. I’m black, conservative and a Virginia native and resident. The picture of Gov. Northam is 35 years old. Yes, it’s offensive. But I don’t need “healing” as Pelosi and other Democrats suggested. When you give power to this type of gutter politics, you’ll lose many good people who won’t even dare enter the arena. — Edward Appiah, Virginia Was Gov. Northam in attendance when the Virginia Senate honored Robert E. Lee recently? If he did not object vehemently, then his apologies mean nothing. Blackface or white robes in the past is one thing, but if he has not stood up against racism, subtle or otherwise, that shows us enough of his character and beliefs. Do we really need to know more? — Bina Mody, California I grew up in Valley City, N.D., in the 1950s — not exactly a hot spot of progressive thought now, and certainly not then. My parents performed in a musical variety group sponsored by the local Elks lodge that would travel around lip-syncing songs by popular artists. My dad’s specialty was imitating Louis Armstrong, one of his heroes, and he did so in full costume, including blackface. He was a crowd favorite and was even asked to enter a talent contest sponsored by a Fargo television station, during which he performed “Blueberry Hill” in full regalia on TV. The group disbanded by the mid-’60s. In later years, when referencing his costume, he would just shake his head and roll his eyes. Blackface as a “harmless” prank in the 1950s and early ’60s is considerably more palatable than blackface some 20 years later, after the civil rights movement. That Ralph Northam and his friends didn’t understand the implications of racial caricatures in 1984 speaks volumes about their cultural I.Q. and common sense. — Patricia Horgan, Sauk Rapids, Minn. In this era of perfection, blackface is the moral equivalent of participating in a lynching. There’s a solid body of contemporary evidence on which to judge the governor of Virginia and we’re going back 35 years? At the same time, the most egregious lout gets to sit in and pollute the White House. Whatever happened to proportionality and common sense? — Harry Gikling, America At my daughter’s school event a couple of years ago, kids dressed up like historical figures. One was portraying Jesse Owens and — you guessed it — smeared shoe polish all over his face. Whether it’s the 1950s or 2010s, we’ll never get past this until we all agree that blackface is not appropriate and pass that message along to the next generation. — DMH, South Maryland I moved to New York City from a racially homogeneous life. My parents were racist and homophobic. In elementary school, I got into an argument with another kid and I called him “black,” which to me was the worst insult ever. My teacher, who was black, was gentle and used it as a teaching moment. I will remember and be embarrassed about that forever. I think Gov. Northam will get sympathy because my story isn’t unique. His record and those close to him should show the truth of the man he is now. — Jay, West Coast In 1967, my class presented the play, “You Can’t Take It With You.” With no apparent soul searching, and theater tradition backing her up, our director used blackface to turn white teens into comedic black servants. The dress rehearsal was a howling success, but the next day our director told us that some audience members had objected and that she was discarding the blackface and toning down the parody of black people. I remain humiliated by my ignorance. Laughing at black stereotypes or actors in blackface seemed acceptable in the ’60s and I shudder to think how long it took for that to change. — StandStrong, Vermont I firmly believe that we will never see the shunning and removal of those in office who support policies that dehumanize and mistreat people of color. We will just have to make do with these glaringly apparent, undeniable examples of racist behavior, like people wearing blackface. White people can at least see that for what it is while they continue to ignore and deny the more pernicious forms of racial oppression. — Wilma de Soto, Philadelphia We need to pay attention to the utterly demeaning, inhumane treatment of black Americans, but also to the more frightening fact that our country is as divided as ever. I’m disturbed by so many of the comments I have read, claiming all sorts of rationalizations for racist behavior and thinking. The past is present, here and now. Why provide the same old “I never saw this, never worried about it, never saw what was wrong with it” excuse? It is never O.K. to dress in blackface. It is never O.K. to entertain in a way that dehumanizes another race. And it is never O.K. to say it is O.K.

2019,‘Raisin’ and ‘Ghosts’ Will Be Featured in Williamstown Season,"Mary Steenburgen, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Uma Thurman are among the performers slated to appear in the Berkshires this summer as part of the Williamstown Theater Festival’s 65th season. The Tony Award-winning company on Monday announced its season, which runs from June 25 through Aug. 18, and will feature five world premieres and a production of Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun,” in celebration of the 60th anniversary of its Broadway debut in 1959. “Raisin,” which kicks off the festival on its Main Stage through July 13 stars S. Epatha Merkerson as Lena Younger and Francois Battiste as her son, Walter Lee. Robert O’Hara will direct. Ms. Steenburgen plays a mother who wants out of her 50-year marriage and Mr. Ferguson is one of her adult sons in the world premiere of “Grand Horizons,” written by Bess Wohl (“Small Mouth Sounds”). The show, a comic drama set in a senior living community, is directed by Leigh Silverman and runs on the Main Stage through July 28. Following her Broadway run in “The Parisian Woman,” Ms. Thurman returns to the stage for a new translation of Ibsen’s “Ghosts,” directed by Carey Perloff. In the play, scheduled from July 31 through Aug. 18, Ms. Thurman will portray Mrs. Alving, a mother who tries to protect her son Oswald from their family’s past scandals. The other four world premieres, in the festival’s smaller theater, are: “A Human Being, of a Sort,” a play by Jonathan Payne about an African-American convict tasked with guarding a Congolese pygmy at the Bronx Zoo; Sylvia Khoury’s “Selling Kabul,” about a former interpreter for the American military living in hiding from the Taliban; Sharyn Rothstein’s “Tell Me I’m Not Crazy,” about a grandfather who becomes a gun hobbyist; and Adam Bock’s “Before the Meeting,” which focuses on people working toward sobriety. Barrington Stage Company, another mainstay of the Berkshires theater scene, recently announced its summer 2019 program as well. Along with a revival of the popular Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical “Into the Woods,” the season includes “Fall Springs,” a musical comedy about fracking, and Stacey Rose’s “America v. 2.1: The Sad Demise & Eventual Extinction of the American Negro.” Ms. Rose’s play, a world premiere, won a prize recently established by the theater to support emerging writers. Steven Levenson’s “If I Forget,” a family drama about Jewish identity which had a well-received Roundabout Theater Company production in 2017, will be part of the Barrington season as well.

2019,‘Revenge Porn’ Law Finally Passes in New York,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] ALBANY — New York lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill to outlaw “revenge porn,” a practice that victims say can alter their lives as drastically as any other form of abuse, but from which there are few of the same protections. The bill’s passage was long awaited, and for many victims, long overdue. In an era of social media ubiquity and the permanence of the internet, revenge porn, the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit photos or videos, has emerged as an increasingly potent weapon. The images can follow victims for years, turning up when employers or romantic partners search for their names on the internet. Forty-one states have already outlawed revenge porn, as have Washington, D.C., New York City and several counties, including Nassau County. But in New York, victims told of years of helplessness. Prosecutors could not charge offenders for a practice that was not illegal, and judges turned down appeals for help on the grounds of free speech, even as other states moved to shore up protections. “I went to the police, and they told me there was nothing they could do. I went to Family Court, and the judge there told me that I had a First Amendment problem,” said Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer who was in Albany for the bill’s passage. She said she had started her firm after being the victim of revenge porn herself. Her harasser sent her emails containing explicit photos of herself and told her that he had blind copied her colleagues on the message, she said. “My clients describe it as an inescapable nightmare, and it is,” Ms. Goldberg said. In a sign of how quickly the landscape has changed, when New York’s bill was first introduced five years ago, it was a trailblazer; only a handful of other states had criminalized revenge porn. By the time the bill finally passed the State Legislature on Thursday, New York was a laggard. Under the new state proposal, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said he supports, offenders could be punished by up to one year in jail. The law would also allow victims to sue the person who had shared the revenge porn, which about a dozen other states permit. And it would be the first in the nation to allow judges to order websites or social media platforms — in addition to the original poster — to take down the photos or videos. The push to end revenge porn comes amid twin movements across the country: growing acknowledgment of sexual harassment and abuse, and an emerging conversation about what government’s role should be in regulating social media. While some of the highest-profile instances of sexual images as blackmail or revenge have involved the rich and famous — Jeff Bezos, Jennifer Lawrence and Rihanna for example — it has affected millions of people, from middle school students to Marines. As many as 10 million Americans have been victims of revenge porn, according to the Data and Society Research Institute, a think tank. “Revenge porn is not infrequent, nor is it just a celebrity issue,” said Senator Monica R. Martinez, a Long Island Democrat and one of the bill’s sponsors. “Our laws have yet to catch up with technology.” The bill had passed the Democrat-dominated Assembly last year but was opposed by technology companies and business groups, which worried that they could be held liable for content shared on their platforms. The proposal died in the Republican-controlled Senate. But Democrats won the Senate in November, paving the way for the bill’s passage. The bill would follow federal law in granting social media platforms and other websites some immunity from financial liability, holding only the person who posted the media responsible. Websites would still be required to take down any material if ordered by a judge. Minors would also be held responsible under the law, but they would appear before a Family Court judge, Ms. Martinez said. Some critics had worried that the law could send teenagers to jail. Most major social media platforms already have policies in place around revenge porn. But the bill would add an extra layer of accountability, said Lindsey Song, a lawyer with Sanctuary for Families, a group that advocates for survivors of gender-based violence. “Some of these major companies just have so much content,” she said. “Sometimes, unfortunately, victims of domestic violence and trafficking just don’t get to be a priority.” On Thursday, the Internet Association, an industry group that represents tech giants including Google, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, said it supported criminalizing revenge porn but still expressed concerns with the bill. “While the industry continues to have reservations about the bill, it is important for New York State” to pass the bill “so that victims of these horrific actions will have the ability to hold bad actors to account,” John Olsen, the association’s director of state government affairs for the Northeast region, said in a statement. The statement did not specify what those reservations were. Ms. Goldberg celebrated the bill’s passage on Thursday, her voice often shaking, even as she lamented the years in which she and countless others had suffered from its delay. “I’ve prepared to give this speech five times over five years,” she said at a news conference promoting the bill. “Sexual privacy is just a fundamental right.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Rocketman’ and the Best and Worst of This Week’s Trailers,"With “Bohemian Rhapsody” potentially winning big at Sunday night’s Oscars, it’s no surprise that two new trailers for musical biopics just dropped. Rami Malek’s is a front-runner for best actor as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and Taron Egerton plays another flamboyant, British-raised rocker, Elton John in this whimsical fantasy. The second clip for the biopic showcases impressive versions of hits like “Your Song,” “Bennie and the Jets” and “Tiny Dancer,” as it traces the former Reginald Dwight’s rise from overweight outcast to international superstar. The rags-to-riches-to-rehab arc of his life feels familiar, but the trailer is as dazzling as John’s over-the-top costumes. Writer-director S. Craig Zahler flips the “Lethal Weapon” script by casting Mel Gibson as a by-the-book cop with a loose-cannon younger partner (Vince Vaughn). The title promises a movie as violent as Zahler’s previous collaboration with Vaughn, “Brawl in Cell Block 99,” but the trailer doesn’t deliver much in the way of mayhem — at least until the final 15 seconds. Still, it’s fun to see Don Johnson, another alum of “Brawl,” get back on the beat as Gibson and Vaughn’s no-nonsense police-department boss. It’s another buddy-cop pic, as Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson play the real-life former Texas Rangers who tracked down Bonnie and Clyde in this Netflix original, which will open in theaters two weeks before it goes online. The veteran actors display a combustible chemistry reminiscent of Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in Season 1 of “True Detective.” It won’t be easy trailing Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway’s groundbreaking “Bonnie and Clyde” by more than 50 years, but based on this blood-pumping trailer, Costner and Harrelson just might be the guys for the job. This British relationship drama from the director Joanna Hogg (“Exhibition”) is already being touted as a contender for next year’s Oscars, but it’s hard to tell what it’s about from the first trailer. Honor Swinton Byrne and her real-life mum, Tilda Swinton, co-star as a daughter and mother whose bond is tested when the younger woman embarks on a tumultuous romance with a shady man (Tom Burke). The clip lays on thickly the laudatory quotes from critics. We’ll see if “The Souvenir” is still in the picture this time next year. The ’80s Los Angeles hair-metal band Mötley Crüe gets the biopic treatment in this Netflix original, which is not aimed at theaters. Maybe that’s because this first look makes it appear to be a by-the-numbers tale of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll … and more sex. None of the four actors who play the main band members makes much of an impression initially, but “Billions” scene-stealer David Costabile (as their manager) and “Saturday Night Live’s” Pete Davidson (as a label executive) seem like intriguing choices.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Ruben Brandt, Collector’ Review: Stealing Inspiration From Great Art","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Ruben Brandt, Collector” is a curiosity that wants to be more than that. The conceit is rather ingenious: to use a graphically inventive style of animation to manufacture a caper involving the theft of famous paintings. There are 13 of those, including works by Velázquez, Picasso, Manet and Warhol. The picturesque world they inhabit is a distorted mirror of our own, where people routinely defy gravity and have odd physical characteristics. A third eye. An extra breast. Elongated limbs. Facial features arranged according to approximately Cubist principles. A further oddity is that the figures in the paintings — Manet’s “Olympia” and her cat; Velázquez’s Infanta; Warhol’s “Double Elvis” — are rendered in similarly distorted fashion. This is, on the part of Milorad Krstic, the Budapest-based artist and animator who wrote and directed the film, a cheeky bit of arrogance. The old and modern masters bent the world to their visions, and Krstic, in turn, bends their visions to his own. This is charming at first, but over the course of more than 90 minutes it yields diminishing returns. The masterpieces are tokens in a convoluted tale of psychological trauma, gumshoe intrigue and glamorous globe-trotting, spun around the title character, a psychiatrist plagued by art-historical nightmares (and voiced by Ivan Kamara). He dreams that figures in paintings come to life and attack him, and a group of his patients at a serene Alpine clinic try to cure him by stealing the works in question. They, in turn — in particular one of them, a lissome burglar named Mimi (Gabriella Hamori) — are pursued by a detective named Mike Kowalski, who collects movie memorabilia. References to cinema and art pop up on screen almost too fast for the eye to assimilate, as Krstic whimsically scrambles genres and moods. Like many detective stories, “Ruben Brandt, Collector” moves backward and forward. Mike wants to figure out why Ruben is fixated on those paintings, while he (and other interested parties, including gangsters and spies) try to figure out where the thieves will strike next. They and the audience are led on a breezy tour of major museums, including the Prado in Madrid, the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Art Institute of Chicago. Those cities (along with Rome, Tokyo, New York and London), are rendered in zippy, precise lines. The people are lithe and sexy cartoons. The movie is fun to look at without quite being exciting to watch. This is mostly because the story never fully lives up to the ideas, and the ideas themselves are fuzzy and scattered. Scale, size and coherence matter in art as much as perspective or inspiration. At shorter length, with a less cluttered story, “Ruben Brandt, Collector” might have been a small masterpiece instead of a minor diversion.

2019,‘Russian Doll’: What to Read About the Hit Netflix Series,"Netflix’s “Russian Doll” is arguably the first true TV hit of 2019. Created by Leslye Headland, Amy Poehler and the star of the series, Natasha Lyonne, the show might be described as a raunchier “Groundhog Day” set in New York’s East Village. But there’s more going on here than that. As Lyonne’s Nadia Vulvokov keeps dying and restarting her life, the team behind the show uses its looping structure to examine midlife crises, gentrification, our need for human connection and possibly the Tompkins Square riots. The reviews have been nearly unanimous in their praise, and as with shows like “Killing Eve” and “Stranger Things,” viewers are still dissecting and analyzing it several weeks after its debut. Can’t get enough “Russian Doll” yourself? Here’s a roundup of great things to read about it. ‘“Russian Doll”: Repetitive Death Syndrome’ [The New York Times] In his pre-air review, James Poniewozik raved about the show, comparing it to recent eschatological TV comedies like “The Good Place” and “Forever.” He writes: “Like its peers, ‘Russian Doll’ resolves on the necessity of human connection, a familiar homily, but it’s too inventive and irascible to feel pat. This is a show with a big heart, but a nicotine-stained heart that’s been dropped in the gutter and kicked around a few times.” ‘“Russian Doll” Is the First Great Show of 2019’ [Esquire] Tyler Coates raves about the show, writing: “Russian Doll feels like an achievement, a high-concept premise told concisely in a structure that rarely feels confined or tight. It’s both freewheeling and contained, and it accomplishes what most shows are unable to pull off: it tells a universal human story in a specific and carefully constructed world.” ‘Review: “Russian Doll,” a Beautiful Puzzle of a Series So Good You’ll Watch It Twice’ [LA Times] Robert Lloyd at the Los Angeles Times offers one of several reviews pointing out the show’s replay value, calling it “a beautiful puzzle piece, a circular, multiplane, existential mystery-comedy set in the villages of Lower Manhattan.” He continues: “Peopled with memorable characters large and small, it’s a show that having watched once — not hard to do straight through and hard not to do straight through — you may want to watch again, to admire its machinery and joinery and find the clues you might have missed, but also because it feels just as good the second time around.” ‘Acerbic Yet Warm, “Russian Doll” Is More Rewarding Than Any Puzzle-Box Show’ [The A.V. Club] Danette Chavez offers a smart take on the show’s flawed protagonist, writing: “The all-woman team behind Russian Doll — which, aside from Lyonne, Poehler and Headland, includes director Jamie Babbit — know just how special their lead is, and craft a story both worthy and reflective of her. As much as we might like her, Nadia is deeply flawed, so there are no beelines to betterment, no bromides to dull the show’s stinging humor.” ‘The Key to “Russian Doll” Might Be Tompkins Square Park’ [The New York Times] Spurred by a series of Twitter posts from the critic Jason Zinoman, The Times’s Aisha Harris investigates the theory that the narrative of “Russian Doll” is “an against the grain meditation on the cultural guilt” leftover from the violence that took place in Tompkins Square Park in 1988, and notes that Headland and Lyonne responded positively to this theory. ‘How “Russian Doll” Unpacks Trauma and Emerges Triumphant’ [Variety] Caroline Framke examines the ways in which “Russian Doll” unfolds like a therapy session in her excellent piece on the show’s deeper themes and the way they’re reflected in its structure. She writes: “By the end, “the broken man and the girl with a death wish” have to deal with the kind of pain they never thought they wanted to explore. But as “Russian Doll” ends up arguing so convincingly, the only way to stop feeling the dull throb of that pain every damn day is to stare it in the face, force it to blink, and move on from there.” ‘Returning to “Russian Doll,” Again and Again’ [Boston Globe] It’s rare to see a TV critic return so quickly to a show he has already reviewed in order to dive deeper into its themes, but Matthew Gilbert does exactly that, writing: “In a way, ‘Russian Doll’ asks what happens when death is off the table. As her reincarnation loop continues — in episode two, that loop is so speedy that it’s played for farce — Nadia is prodded out of her perpetual sense of pointlessness; her apprehension of death is no longer making her human needs seem futile. The worst happens, she dies, but: It only brings her more life, more chances.” ‘“Russian Doll” Casts Men in Roles Usually Reserved for Women. The Results Are Brilliant.’ [Vox] Todd VanDerWerff noticed how the roles played by men in “Russian Doll” were the kind typically cast with women. “In particular, if you look at how Russian Doll uses men, you’ll realize how deep the series’ interest in centering women’s perspectives goes,” he writes. “This show uses men the way most pop culture uses women — which is to say it turns them into supporting players whose inner lives are mostly glossed over in the name of what the protagonist is going through.” ‘Natasha Lyonne Has a New Life. It’s Just That She Keeps Dying.’ [The New York Times] Kathryn Shattuck had a pre-premiere chat with Lyonne about New York, the show’s semi-autobiographical themes, the all-female writers’ room and more. Speaking about the way death is used is in the show, Lyonne says: “There’s probably a bit of a misconception around how key the deaths are. It was more an emotional story of bottoming out. There are metaphorical deaths big and small throughout the day: There are the bigger ones where you just feel like your whole world is collapsing, [because of] health or a relationship falling apart. Then there’s the smaller deaths of the text message that didn’t get responded to that you’re obsessing on, and it feels like you’re suddenly a hollow man inside.” ‘How Do You Dress a Russian Doll?’ [The New York Times] Ruth La Ferla takes a look at the fashion of “Russian Doll,” speaking to the program’s costume designer, Jenn Rogien, who also worked on “Girls” and “Orange Is the New Black.” Rogien says: “We needed these characters to feel cool and interesting. But we also needed them to feel like real people trapped in a very strange circumstance.” ‘“Russian Doll”: What Made Natasha Lyonne Leap Into Directing Her Netflix Comedy’ [IndieWire] The creators Natasha Lyonne and Leslye Headland spoke to IndieWire about how they assembled a very close team of personal friends to make the show, and about the vibe of a female-fronted production. Headland joked that day players would comment on how smooth and relaxed everything was on set. “And it was like, ‘Yeah, because it’s a female AD, and a female director, and a female showrunner and star,’” she said. ‘“Russian Doll”’s Charlie Barnett on Alan, Oatmeal, and the Bachelorette Party That Changed His Life’ [Vulture] Charlie Barnett, who plays Alan, spoke to Vulture about his time on the show, revealing that they shot multiple endings to the season — and that he had been too busy to see which one made it to Netflix: “I have to admit, I actually don’t even know how it ends. I’m working on another smaller movie with Jamie Babbit right now, and it was also my birthday like two days ago — I was waiting until I got back home to Los Angeles to finish watching it because I’d only got to episode three.” ‘“Russian Doll” Creators Say Working With Only Female Directors and Writers on the Netflix Show Happened by Accident but Was “Freeing”’ [Insider] Headland goes into more detail about the impact of an all-female writing and directing team on “Russian Doll.” ”It isn’t about finding a romantic partner,” she says. ”It isn’t about balancing parenthood and motherhood. It isn’t about trying to infiltrate a work force where almost in every industry we’re underpaid and underrepresented.” ‘This Is That Song From “Russian Doll”’ [The New York Times] Every time Nadia arrives back in the bathroom at her 36th birthday party, viewers hear the same song, Harry Nilsson’s “Gotta Get Up.” Aisha Harris offers not just a chance to hear that song again, but Lyonne’s comments on why they chose Nilsson. “There was always a kind of ending that was unpleasant that was percolating under the surface of his songs,” Lyonne says, “even at their most upbeat and certainly at their darkest.” ‘Here Are the “Russian Doll” Easter Eggs You Missed While You Were Trying to Figure Out WTF Was Going On’ [Cosmopolitan] Hannah Chambers has a fun piece that breaks down the references and Easter eggs embedded in “Russian Doll” from the meaning behind that Ariadne poster over Nadia’s desk to the revelation that three actors play multiple roles. “The good news is, creators Natasha Lyonne, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland loaded this series up with tons of Easter eggs, so its binge value is super high,” Chambers writes. “Here are some of the hidden details you may have missed while you were freaking out over the prospect of falling down your apartment steps and dying.” ‘The Deeper Meaning of Russian Doll’s Most Mysterious Character, Horse’ [Polygon] Over at Polygon, Karen Han takes a deeper look at one of the show’s most interesting supporting personalities, the homeless man named Horse. She writes, “Rather than being doomed to repeat himself like Nadia or Alan (Charlie Barnett), or being utterly oblivious, as all of Nadia and Alan’s friends and family appear to be, Horse seems to possess some grain of agency or knowledge that places him just out of that frame — he’s almost a shepherd.” ‘Relive the Magic of “Russian Doll” With Its Official Playlist on Spotify’ [Nerdist] This excellent article on the music of “Russian Doll” offers not only a way to listen to the show’s diverse soundtrack but also reveals that Lyonne almost chose songs by Lou Reed and Roxy Music to serve as the tune that Nadia hears every time she “awakens.” A s the writer Lindsey Romain notes, however: “it isn’t the only song that gives Russian Doll its unique edge. The series is a brilliant, heart-wrenching meditation on topics like mental illness, addiction, and endless cycle of self-destruction, and the entire soundtrack is loaded with gems reflecting its themes. The track list includes jams from John Maus, the Echocentrics, Cults, Pussy Riot, and more.”",The New York Times
2019,‘S.N.L.’ Features Halsey in Dual Role and Dips Into Bezos Photos,"It started off as a serious discussion about Jeff Bezos’ accusation that The National Enquirer was engaging in extortion and blackmail by threatening to expose his private photos. But the discussion didn’t stay serious for long. In its opening sketch this week, “Saturday Night Live” presented a parody of “Meet the Press,” hosted by Chuck Todd (Kyle Mooney) and featuring the panelists Eugene Robinson (Kenan Thompson), Peggy Noonan (Cecily Strong) and Donna Brazile (Leslie Jones). Mooney began: “Let’s start with what everyone’s talking about. In a new low for journalism, The National Enquirer was accused this week of blackmailing Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos.” “You’re all highly respected journalists,” he continued. “So, when all is said and done, what do you think Jeff Bezos’ penis is going to look like?” “Excuse me?” Jones replied. The panelists offered various theories (except for Jones, who remained astounded), and Mooney asked what the scandal said about the overall state of the country. Thompson answered: “It’s disgraceful, Chuck. It’s awful. I mean, this is a clear violation of someone’s privacy.” “And what about when the pictures do come out?” Mooney asked. “I will look at them,” Thompson responded. “I will make them into hilarious memes, and I’ll send them to all my friends.” The prurient subject matter derailed an interview with the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross (Kate McKinnon), who protested: “I don’t want to talk about penises. I’m one of the guys. I like watching sports and drinking a cold glass of blood.” And the topic overwhelmed an interview with the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker (Aidy Bryant), who explained, “I was U.S. attorney general for three months, and soon, I will go back to my job of breaking up fights on ‘The Jerry Springer Show.’” Asked by Mooney if her Whitaker had ever been instructed by President Trump to interfere in the special counsel’s investigation, Bryant began to answer. “I’m going to say something I left out of my testimony,” she said, “and this is going to blow everything out of the water here. Mr. Trump actually called me and whispered to me ——” Mooney interrupted: “I’m being told that the Bezos pics have actually come out at this very moment,” he said, vowing to devote the rest of the program to the photos. A sketch set at the Virginia State Capitol began with Thompson addressing a group of politicians there. “So we’re all in agreement that the lieutenant governor should be encouraged to step down,” he said, adding: One more quick thing before we get out of here. As you all know, earlier this week, our governor admitted to wearing blackface in college as part of a costume. And then later the attorney general. It’s extremely embarrassing to the state, and as chair of the ethics committee, I have to ask: Has anybody else worn blackface in college? One by one, the elected officials posed oblivious questions as each confessed to having worn blackface. “Does it count if you did it all the way back in the ’80s?” Strong asked. “No, of course not,” Mikey Day answered. “It was funny and cool in the ’80s.” Thompson corrected them both. “No, no, I’m going to stop you right there, Phil,” he said. “It does still count, and it was never funny or cool.” Mooney asked, “What if you wore the blackface as a tribute, like an homage to your hero?” “Who was your hero?” Thompson said. “Al Jolson,” Mooney answered. Returning to an idea it introduced in December, “S.N.L.” offered another installment of “Them Trumps,” in which the first family’s life is presented like the Fox drama “Empire,” and the president is Darius Trump (Thompson). In this episode, Darius Trump is being sped by limousine to his State of the Union address, telling the other passengers in the car that he will push back against the special counsel’s investigation. “This is America,” Thompson declares, “and even though I’m black ——” As police lights become visible in the rear window, he is interrupted by an aide played by Halsey, the evening’s mononymous host and musical guest. “O.K., we’re getting pulled over,” she says. “Oh, yeah, I knew that was coming,” Thompson says under his breath. A sketch titled “Women of Congress” started off as if it were going to be a satire of “Charlie’s Angels”: Nancy Pelosi (McKinnon) leads an action-packed team of female politicians who don’t often get the spotlight on “S.N.L.,” including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villaseñor), Maxine Waters (Jones), Kyrsten Sinema (Strong), Ilhan Omar (Ego Nwodim), Ann McLane Kuster (Aidy Bryant), Abigail Spanberger (Heidi Gardner) and Rashida Tlaib (Halsey). Then, shortly after its opening credits, it ended. Well, maybe another time, ladies. At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the political scandals that have roiled Virginia over the past several days: Che: You know, making jokes about the news can get a little redundant for me. But every so often, you see a picture of a governor in blackface and I’m like, This’ll be fun. So first, the governor of Virginia admitted to wearing blackface in college for a Michael Jackson costume — by the way, making it the least accurate Michael Jackson costume possible. That would be crazy enough, but then the attorney general was like, “You, too? Blackface is my jam.” And then Liam Neeson was like, “Blackface? Hold my beer. I didn’t want to bring this up ever before, but I was trying to kill a black dude with a baseball bat. Anyhoo, so my movie comes out Friday.” Jost: Virginia Governor Ralph Northam is still refusing to resign after a racist photo from his yearbook surfaced. O.K., but if it was in a yearbook, how bad could it be? [The photograph is shown onscreen.] Oh. O.K. So, very bad. I knew it was a yearbook, but I didn’t know the year was 1870. A bit later, Jost added: Democrats are now calling for Northam to resign, but the second in line is embroiled in now two sexual assault scandals, and the third in line also did blackface. So at this point, maybe Virginia should take a cue from the Oscars and just go without a governor this year. Or they could just come full circle and make it Governor Kevin Hart. When Chris Redd, Jones, Thompson and Nwodim came on stage to celebrate Black History Month and pay homage to previous cast members like Garrett Morris, Eddie Murphy and Ellen Cleghorne, were you expecting a totally sincere tribute? The segment took a satirical turn with the entrance of Mooney, a white man, who claimed he wanted to support his co-stars but kept interrupting to explain black history to them. “Did you know African-American contributions to entertainment didn’t start with ‘Saturday Night Live’?” Mooney asked to their chagrin. “‘To Sir With Love’ was one of the best movies of the ’60s,” he added. “America was surprised to see a black leading man. But we always knew what we were capable of.” Addressing the other performers on the stage, Jones asked: “Did he say, ‘We’? He said, ‘We.’”",The New York Times
2019,‘Saint Judy’ Review: A Plucky and Passionate Lawyer Doing Good,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Judy Wood is a real-life lawyer who — after moving to California and getting a job with an immigration law firm — discovered a passion that, by this film’s telling, led her to a case that changed asylum policies in the United States. Directed by Sean Hanish from a script by Dmitry Portnoy, “Saint Judy” begins by underscoring the title character’s resourcefulness, then playing up her pluckiness and single-mom status. These latter components recall “Erin Brockovich,” the acclaimed fact-based drama of 2000 that starred Julia Roberts. Judy also has a crusty boss, Ray Hernandez (Alfred Molina), a soured one-time idealist unimpressed with Judy’s enthusiasm for a particular subject: Asefa, an Afghan woman in a detention center, who is so drugged up by her keepers as to be practically catatonic. Judy (Michelle Monaghan) wants to wean Asefa off her meds, learn her story and make a case for asylum. Ray just wants papers processed and bills paid, so he fires Judy. Judy starts her own firm, stumbles upon an intern who happens to own a Porsche (good for fast rides to and from detention centers) and gets busy. Monaghan herself is a plucky and resourceful performer. It’s nice to see her in a movie in which she has more to do than parachute in and evince concern for Tom Cruise, as she’s been doing in the last 10 or 20 “Mission Impossible” pictures. But while the viewer can intuit that Hanish has a strong clear story to tell, the director too often tricks things up with noncredible flashbacks, fatty getting-from-one-place-to-another montages scored to anthemic pop and other extraneous matter. This diffuses what could have been a more engaging and perhaps powerful movie.

2019,‘Say Nothing’ Unearths Buried Secrets in Northern Ireland,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland,” Patrick Radden Keefe trains a cold eye on an incendiary subject. Despite having Irish ancestors who immigrated to the United States in the 19th century, Keefe, a journalist for The New Yorker, shares little of the “tribal solidarity” with the old country that was ubiquitous in Boston, where he grew up. “I never felt any particular interest in the conflict in Northern Ireland,” he writes. Whatever feeling he had about the Troubles — the vicious fighting between the mostly Protestant loyalists who wanted to remain British subjects and the mostly Catholic republicans who didn’t — amounted to a “detached concern.” It’s a somewhat startling admission, coming toward the end of this resolutely humane book, but an outsider’s perspective is what gives “Say Nothing” its exacting and terrifying lucidity. The title comes from a poem by Seamus Heaney that describes “The famous / Northern reticence, the tight gag of place / And times.” Keefe’s book is as much about this “penumbra of silence” as it is about lives lost and blood shed. The book begins with a longstanding mystery: Who abducted Jean McConville, and why? McConville was a mother of 10, born to Protestants and married to a Catholic, so overwhelmed by the daunting task of caring for her brood after her husband died that she seemed to have no time for anything else, much less sectarian intrigue. Yet in December 1972, at the end of the bloodiest year of the Troubles, a group of masked men and women barged into her Belfast home, dragging the 38-year-old widow away as her frightened children looked on. For the next three decades, the McConville children wondered what happened to their mother, with some of them electing never to leave Belfast in case she returned. The city was small, suffused with whispers of gossip, but nobody would actually talk. One inquiry by a family member was met with an ominous note that warned, “Get away.” Even after McConville’s remains washed up on a beach in 2003, the code of silence prevailed. Keefe follows the McConville story, interviewing more than a hundred sources and digging deeper and deeper, to the point where he comes to his own conclusion about who murdered her. But the culpability of any one individual is only part of this meticulously reported book; Keefe is also interested in “collective denial,” how an entire society tries to cope with trauma and brutality through obfuscation and pitiless rationales. For instance: “We believed that informants were the lowest form of human life. They were less than human. Death was too good for them.” Those chilling words belong to Dolours Price, another central figure in “Say Nothing.” Price, the daughter of Catholic republican stalwarts, grew up lighting cigarettes for an aunt who lost her eyes and both hands while participating in a bombing operation gone awry. At the time of McConville’s disappearance, Dolours was a vibrant 21-year-old and, like her younger sister, Marian, an enthusiastic member of the Irish Republican Army. You quickly sense that Dolours Price’s story is bound to intersect at some point with McConville’s; the question becomes when — and how. Keefe’s narrative is an architectural feat, expertly constructed out of complex and contentious material, arranged and balanced just so. He knows better than to hazard an interloper’s interpretation of where an “ancient quarrel” began. Whether you go back to the Protestant settlers of the 17th century or the Tudors of the 16th or the Norman raiders of the 12th, you’re already mired in an endless volley of recriminations and reprisals. “It almost didn’t matter where you started the story,” Keefe writes. “It was always there.” The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 brought some relief; with the exception of some violent eruptions over the past two decades, a long stretch of relative peace in Northern Ireland has held more or less steady. But the accord didn’t heal all wounds — and, in Keefe’s telling, it opened up some new ones. A number of former I.R.A. foot soldiers felt betrayed by the agreement because it kept the British dominion over Northern Ireland intact. Dolours Price, who spent eight years in prison for a 1973 London bombing, was one of them. “She had set bombs and robbed banks and seen friends die and nearly died herself,” Keefe writes. All those awful things — and for what? As she herself put it in an interview, “I was often required to act contrary to my nature.” Keefe’s depiction of Price is so rounded and intimate you’ll be surprised to learn that he never spoke to her. The first he ever even heard of Price was when he read her obituary in The Times, in 2013. Price participated in the so-called Belfast Project, a set of confidential interviews conducted with paramilitary fighters a few years after the Good Friday Agreement, kept under lock and key at Boston College and subject, from 2011 on, to a subpoena made at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The fate of the Belfast Project turns out to be an absorbing drama in its own right, as Keefe delicately unpacks the legal and moral quandary surrounding what amounts to a cache of confessions — conducted at considerable risk and in utmost secrecy — in which people implicated themselves and others in the cruelest, most brutal acts. A name that kept coming up in the secret interviews was apparently “Gerry” — as in Gerry Adams, who until last year was the leader of Sinn Fein, the political party long aligned with the I.R.A. In 2014, Adams was questioned by police about the death of McConville but never charged; in their interviews for the Belfast Project, I.R.A. volunteers said they reported to Adams. But to this day Adams, known as one of the I.R.A.’s most prominent leaders during the 1970s, denies ever having been a member of the I.R.A. It’s a gambit that’s both audacious and absurd. Keefe’s portrait of the shape-shifting Adams is unsparing; he calls Adams’s strenuously whimsical persona “cake fairs with a dash of bloodshed.” But then Keefe also posits that this very ambiguity made it possible for the various sides of the Good Friday Agreement to believe they could negotiate with Adams and arrive at a peace deal. This sensitive and judicious book raises some troubling, and perhaps unanswerable, questions. Does moving forward from an anguished past require some sort of revisitation and reckoning? Or are certain memories so perilous that they’re better left buried and ignored? A conspicuously unbothered Adams, for one, seems never to look back. As he once told an inquisitive reporter, in a quote that manages to sound naïve and cynical all at once, “If you don’t ask, you can’t tell.”",The New York Times

SAY NOTHING A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland By Patrick Radden Keefe Some months ago, I was in Belfast on a Friday evening, wandering, killing the time for a few hours. I was passing a secondhand record store and noticed that its door was open. So I went up the stairs, and in. There were no customers flicking through the records, just a man and a woman, both in their early 40s, I thought, sitting on a step, surrounded by empty beer bottles. The man had a joint in his mouth. They stared up at me. “Are you open?” I asked. The man took the joint from his mouth and — eventually — said, “I forgot to shut the shop.” I mention this episode, because it is impossible to imagine it occurring — the wandering, the door left open — in the Belfast I first visited in 1978 when I was 20, or the Belfast described in Patrick Radden Keefe’s “Say Nothing,” which starts with the abduction of a woman called Jean McConville, a young widow and mother of 10 children, in 1972. Keefe homes in on McConville and other individuals and, while doing that, tells a good-sized chunk of the history of Northern Ireland, a place George Bernard Shaw called “an autonomous political lunatic asylum.” In particular, he writes about what became known as the Troubles, and the people who caused or were caught in the Troubles. The Belfast of “Say Nothing” is a city of religious divisions, security checks, shootings, no-go areas. The city is small; it’s “Blue Velvet,” with none of the velvet. Jean McConville’s children know some of the people who are taking away their mother; they are their neighbors. The last thing she says to the eldest son at home at the time is, “Watch the children until I come back.” But she never does come back. She disappears — she is disappeared. If it seems as if I’m reviewing a novel, it is because “Say Nothing” has lots of the qualities of good fiction, to the extent that I’m worried I’ll give too much away, and I’ll also forget that Jean McConville was a real person, as were — are — her children. And her abductors and killers. Keefe is a terrific storyteller. It might seem odd, even offensive, to state it, but he brings his characters to real life. The book is cleverly structured. We follow people — victim, perpetrator, back to victim — leave them, forget about them, rejoin them decades later. It can be read as a detective story. There’s a nappy pin (a nappy is a diaper) at the start of the story, and at its end. When the pin reappeared, the novelist in me wanted to whoop but the reader wanted to weep. Because “Say Nothing” isn’t a novel, and that comfort — it’s only fiction — isn’t there. The nappy pin isn’t a novelist’s device; it was a real nappy pin, a small tool carried everywhere by Jean McConville, a mother. Its closeness to the novel is a strength of “Say Nothing” and — I’m tempted to write — “also a weakness.” But actually, it’s not a weakness, and only rarely a distraction. Occasionally, Keefe lets rip with the similes. “Petrol bombs,” he writes, “broke open on their steel bonnets, blue flame spilling out like the contents of a cracked egg.” That’s asking too much of an egg. On the other hand, his description of Dolours Price, a member of the I.R.A., in jail, on a hunger strike, being force-fed through a thin length of rubber hose, is vivid and quite rightly shocking. The book is full of the language of my youth, phrases I heard every day — “political status,” “shoot-to-kill policy,” “dirty protest,” “legitimate target.” And it is full of names, names that are more than names — Gerry Adams, Bobby Sands, the Price sisters, Burntollet Bridge, Bloody Sunday, Enniskillen, Margaret Thatcher, Ian Paisley — the names of people and places, events, that carry huge emotional clout, that can still silence a room or start a fight. [ What’s next for Northern Ireland? ] It is about who owned the language, or got the most out of it. Yes, the times were known as the Troubles. But as the Belfast writer Jan Carson puts it in her upcoming novel, “The Fire Starters”: “Troubles is too less a word for all of this. It is a word for minor inconveniences, such as overdrawn bank accounts, slow punctures, a woman’s time of the month. It is not a violent word.” So the I.R.A. invented the “armed struggle.” Violence joins injustice — it was the work of a marketing genius and the solid conviction of hundreds, thousands, of men and women: It was their war, their struggle. What Keefe captures best, though, is the tragedy, the damage and waste, and the idea of moral injury. Dolours Price and many like her believed that, after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, she had been robbed of any moral justification for the bombings and abductions. The last section of the book, the tricky part of the story, life after violence, after the end, the unfinished business, the disappeared and the refusal of Jean McConville’s children to forget about her — I wondered as I read if Keefe was going to carry it off. He does. He deals very well with the war’s strange ending, the victory that wasn’t. While much of the language of “Say Nothing” takes me back to my youth, a new word makes its appearance on one of the final pages: Brexit. “It would be ironic, to say the least,” Keefe writes, “if one inadvertent long-term consequence of the Brexit referendum was a united Ireland — an outcome that three decades of appalling bloodshed and some 3,500 lost lives had failed to achieve.” A more likely outcome, I fear, is a fresh border dividing Ireland, right on top of the old one. When the Republic of Ireland and Britain joined what became the European Union on the same day, in 1973, the border immediately started to become less relevant. The E.U. is a big part — the boring part — of the story. The border is there but hard to discern; “Spot the Border” is a popular game with people driving across it. Driving north, the kilometers become miles and the road signs are in English instead of both English and Gaelic. But there’s no evidence of the checkpoints or observation towers that were there before the Good Friday Agreement. Since the Brexit referendum, much has been said, and promised, about “soft” borders and “hard” borders. But as someone observed — I can’t remember who — all borders are hard, and the line across Ireland will be the only land border dividing Britain from the E.U. There will be checkpoints; there might also be observation towers. There will be men and women in uniform; there might also be armed soldiers with English and Scottish accents. There will be trouble, and there might also be Troubles. “Say Nothing” is an excellent account of the Troubles; it might also be a warning.",The New York Times
2019,‘Sharkwater Extinction’ Review: A Plea to Stop Killing Sharks,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Each time I’ve seen shark fin soup on a restaurant menu, it sounded conceptually sketchy. “The fin is considered a delicacy,” I recall being told, and there was the rub: Only the fin? What about the rest of the shark? Well, turns out it’s as bad as I thought. “Sharkwater Extinction,” the third feature film directed by the scuba diver and activist Rob Stewart, reveals a cruel market in which tens of millions of sharks are caught every year, their fins cut off and their bodies thrown back in the water to die. In his narration, Stewart recounts how he thought that if his films could make people love these animals, he could push popular opinion against their being hunted. He doesn’t quite pull this off here, despite impressive footage of him swimming with sharks. He does, however, convince us that these superpredators are important to oceanic ecosystems and that because they are so indiscriminate in their eating habits, they are full of toxins. Even if there were a way to fish for them humanely (there isn’t), Stewart argues sharks ought not be eaten at all. He and his fellow divers and photographers frequently put themselves in harm’s way in their around-the-globe investigations of frankly barbaric fishing practices. And the film ends on a tragic note, with Stewart’s own death because of a diving accident, which his survivors manage to treat without descending into morbidity. I’m sorry he won’t continue the work that meant so much to him, and clearly remains important.

2019,‘She Pulled a Book Out of Her Bag to Show Him What She Was Reading’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Watching two people meet on a downtown No. 1, left behind on New Year’s Eve and other reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was headed to work on a downtown No. 1. I was standing in the middle of the car. At 125th Street, a woman in the seat in front of me turned to the man sitting next to her. “I loved that book,” she said. He turned to her and smiled. They began to talk about the book and about the movie adaptation. She pulled a book out of her bag to show him what she was reading. I wondered whether they knew each other. Then they shook hands and introduced themselves. I checked their left hands. No rings. The train continued on. By now, they were laughing. Their shoulders were touching. It was like the beginning to a romantic comedy, a real-life meet-cute. We got to 72nd Street, and they were still chatting away. Would this be the last time they spoke? The train approached 59th Street. “Maybe I could give you my number and we can talk some more?” the man said. They exchanged phones, saving each other’s contact information. I got off at 50th Street. It was no longer just a regular day. — Alliana Semjen Dear Diary: On New Year’s Eve, we let our 3-year-old bring his guitar along to a friend’s apartment near Times Square. It was a brand-new mini six-string that he hadn’t put down since getting it for Christmas. He wanted to sing a song after the ball dropped, and I was trying to be a cool dad. It was pouring rain in Brooklyn, and after three canceled Ubers, we found a green taxi. We were soaking wet, two hours late and our son was yapping the whole time to the driver about how he was going to play his song. At West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue, we stepped out of the cab. It drove off just as an officer was telling us we had to walk four blocks north, then cross to the next avenue to come back down. That’s when our son asked us where his guitar was. I realized I had left it in the taxi. Our boy cried. My husband explained that we had lost the instrument, but that an act of kindness might bring it back. Of course, it took more than that: a report with the Taxi and Limousine Commission, calls to two police precincts and, finally, the help of a detective who connected us to the driver, who had been trying to find us. Two days later, he pulled onto our street and jumped out of the cab with the guitar in hand. “I remembered you,” he shouted to my son. “Now you can play your song!” — Corvette Hunt Dear Diary: I was standing on the checkout line at Fairway with a package of smoked salmon and some dry roasted cashews. A man approached me. “Are you in hardware?” he asked. I was totally baffled. He pointed at the items I was holding. “Nuts and lox,” he said. — John Lipman Dear Diary: In spring 2009, I was working throughout Chinatown and the Lower East Side as a home-health physical therapist. I did not have an office where I could to write up my notes, use a clean restroom or have lunch. On one particularly exhausting day, I started out at a public housing complex on Rutgers Street before stopping at a tenement on the Bowery and then a beautiful prewar apartment in SoHo. By then, it was lunchtime. I didn’t want to eat alone. Although I saw people every day, and was constantly navigating crowds on the streets, I felt very lonely in the job. I made my way to Henry Street. There, in a corner building, lived two patients of my co-workers. This older couple also happened to be my beloved grandparents. They had lived in Chinatown for more than 25 years. Somehow, it seemed, they had sensed that I would visit that day. They had tea, herbal soup, fried eggs, steamed rice and Chinese sausages and vegetables ready and waiting when I arrived. To this day, it’s still the best work lunch I’ve ever had. — Kat Lieu Dear Diary: I was walking along Henry Street in Brooklyn. A blind man with a white cane was walking toward me. To my right, a truck was backing into a parking spot. Just as the man with the cane passed me on my left, I heard a bang. I turned and saw a young man poke his head out of the truck to assess the damage to the tree that had just been hit. The man with the cane stopped and turned his head. “What was that?” he asked. I took a couple of steps back. “A truck was just backing up and hit a tree,” I said. “Don’t worry. Nobody’s hurt.”. “So it’s O.K.?” he said. “Yeah, the truck looks fine. I don’t see any damage.” He cracked a grin. “Not the truck,” he said. “The tree.” — Laura Lim Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘Shoplifters’ Director Pierces Japan’s Darker Side,"The Saturday Profile TOKYO — As befits a director whose movies chart the untidiness of Japanese family life, the office of Hirokazu Kore-eda is cluttered with piles of papers, books, photographs, videocassettes and CDs. But it’s the dozens of Frankenstein dolls perched around the room that really capture his emotional point of view. “I love Frankenstein,” Mr. Kore-eda said, reverently. “He is just so melancholy.” Mr. Kore-eda, 56, whose latest work, “Shoplifters,” has received an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film and has been a box office hit in Japan, specializes in stories about people who endure almost unbearable sadness. In “Shoplifters,” which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, a group of outcasts who live together as a family rescue a little girl from abusive parents and induct her into their clan of petty thievery. For a while, their ragtag clan seems more authentically connected than some families that share DNA. But — spoiler alert — ethical doubts late in the movie lead to a devastating rupture. Mr. Kore-eda says his films represent an implicit criticism of modern Japan. They tackle themes of isolation and social invisibility, as well as the numbing of souls that can come with professional success. “Nobody Knows,” one of Mr. Kore-eda’s best-known films internationally before “Shoplifters,” is the story of four young children abandoned by their mother in their small Tokyo apartment. In “Like Father, Like Son,” which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 2013, two sets of parents learn that their 6-year-old sons were switched at birth in the hospital, leading to agonizing decisions that expose class divisions between the families and leave them psychologically battered. “I don’t portray people or make movies where viewers can easily find hope,” said Mr. Kore-eda, during an interview in his studio in the Shibuya neighborhood of Tokyo. “Some people want to see characters who grow and become stronger over the course of a film. But I don’t want to make such a movie.” “It’s such a lie,” he added. “And I don’t want to tell a lie.” Mr. Kore-eda’s vision is starkly at odds with that of Japan’s leaders. With the economy enjoying modest expansion after decades of stagnation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a speech at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos last month, pronounced a “long-awaited positive feedback cycle” and trumpeted Japan as having a “hope-driven economy.” Such rosy rhetoric belies the demographic challenges that Japan faces, with a declining and rapidly aging population and mounting labor shortages. It also overlooks the insecurity that many Japanese feel working in contract or part-time jobs with scant chance of advancement. A little over one in six people live in poverty. And those who hold full-time jobs are often forced to toil for such long hours that some of them are dying from overwork. Against this backdrop, Mr. Kore-eda has diagnosed a society where local ties have weakened and nationalism is on the rise, particularly under Mr. Abe’s right-leaning government. So when, after he won the Palme d’Or, the country’s education minister invited Mr. Kore-eda for a congratulatory meeting, the director demurred. “I didn’t get the point of why they were trying to congratulate me,” Mr. Kore-eda said. “I don’t think it’s right for the government and moviemakers to get too close. So I wanted to keep a distance from the government.” “Shoplifters” was made in part with government funding, and some critics on social media have bashed the director as anti-Japan or hypocritical. “You took the money and then say that you want to keep a distance” from the government, wrote one blogger. “What a convenient excuse you make.” On Twitter, Tsuneyasu Takeda, a conservative commentator, accused Mr. Kore-eda of being a “shoplifting director.” Mr. Kore-eda told an interviewer from Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese daily, that he was grateful for the public money but viewed it as a subsidy from taxpayers rather than a grant from any particular administration. “If you think of culture as something that transcends the state,” he said, “then you understand that cultural grants don’t always coincide with the interests of the state.” The son of a soldier who served in the Japanese Kwantung Army during World War II in the puppet state of Manchukuo in China, Mr. Kore-eda grew up attuned to the vagaries of class within his own family. His father, who was a Soviet prisoner of war in Siberia, hopped from job to job, an anomaly in the postwar era of lifetime employment. Mr. Kore-eda remembered visiting his father at work at a chemical factory on the outskirts of Tokyo, anticipating that he would observe him dressed in a lab coat mixing compounds in test tubes. Instead, Mr. Kore-eda found his father on the factory floor, wearing a jumpsuit covered in oil stains. “I could tell he was not well treated or respected in the company,” said Mr. Kore-eda, who is now married with an elementary school-age daughter. “It was really shocking, and after coming home I could not really tell him how I felt about him. I felt pity for him.” His mother, who had grown up in a wealthy family, ended up supporting her children when her husband could not find or keep a job. She worked at a recycling factory and a cake-making plant. Mr. Kore-eda said his two older sisters had warned him not to talk about their mother’s work history, out of embarrassment. She nourished a love of movies in her son, watching Western films starring her favorites, Vivien Leigh and Joan Fontaine, on television with him after school. But it was Mr. Kore-eda’s father who ultimately supported his decision to pursue a career as an artist. His mother urged him to find more stable employment. At Waseda University in Tokyo, Mr. Kore-eda started out intending to become a novelist. But he watched a lot of Japanese television dramas and considered switching to screenwriting. He often cut class to go to the cinema to watch movies by Italian greats like Rossellini, Fellini and Visconti. “It’s a bit cringy to say,” he said, a trace of a smile emerging from his salt-and-pepper stubble. After graduation, he started out making documentaries, but switched to fictional, feature-length films in 1995 with “Maborosi,” the story of a woman recovering from the suicide of her husband. Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, described it as “a pictorial tone poem of astonishing visual intensity and emotional depth.” The seed of “Shoplifters,” Mr. Kore-eda said, came from a news article about an entire family put on trial for shoplifting in Osaka, Japan’s third-largest city. And after making “Like Father, Like Son,” he wanted to further explore the theme of family beyond blood bonds. In Japan, he said, “people still put a big emphasis on blood ties and family bonds,” a fixation that he sees as sometimes unhealthy. Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist at Chuo University who has written about Mr. Kore-eda’s films, said that “Shoplifters” was a rebuke of the traditional view of the Japanese family, where only blood relations can be trusted. “There are many families whose members don’t communicate or interact well,” Mr. Yamada said. “But the mock family members in the movie care for each other more than some real families.” In their own way, Mr. Kore-eda’s movies offer slivers of optimism as well as moments of impish humor. But does he still have hope for his country? He paused for several beats. “I have not thrown away hope,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Show Me That My Father Is Alive.’ China Faces Torrent of Online Pleas.,"HONG KONG — Many members of the Uighur ethnic group living in exile are worried that their relatives back home in China are locked up in internment camps — or dead. So when China released a video this past week to prove that a prominent Uighur musician had not died in custody as rumored, Uighurs around the world sat up. “Show me that my father is alive and well!” one wrote on Twitter. “Where are my relatives?” another asked. In one clip, a child held up a photo of her missing father, weeping as she said: “Show his video to us.” Murat Harri Uyghur, a doctor living in Finland, and a group of fellow activists gave the campaign a hashtag, #MeTooUyghur (#MenmuUyghur in Uighur), and urged others to add their voices to it. “Now, we want to know, where are millions of #Uyghurs?” the doctor wrote, using an alternate spelling of Uighur. He referred to reports that China is holding a million or more Uighurs, Kazakhs and members of other mostly Muslim Turkic minorities in internment camps in the far western Xinjiang region. Mr. Uyghur said he and other activists hoped to echo the #MeToo campaign led by survivors of sexual assault and harassment. At first, they were afraid the hashtag would be offensive to women, Mr. Uyghur said by telephone. “But then we said the Uighurs are also abused,” he said. “As a nation, it is like we were raped.” The social media campaign is part of a nascent effort to collect testimony and maintain a list of detainees — like an expanding wall of missing persons notices — to put pressure on China and demand answers: Who is being held in the sprawling network of camps? Are they alive or dead? What are the conditions like? And where are the children, the elderly and the infirm? The campaign strikes at the heart of Beijing’s effort to portray the camps as job training facilities, meant to improve detainees’ lives and foster stability in a once-restive region. Former detainees deny that, saying the camps are prisonlike facilities where they were forced to renounce devotion to Islam and praise the ruling Communist Party. In recent months, evidence of a system of forced labor in the camps has emerged. At a regular news briefing, Hua Chunying, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, sought to discredit accounts of abuses reported by the foreign media, saying that they were “made up out of thin air” or that the individuals in question did not exist. Asked to comment on the #MeTooUyghur campaign, Ms. Hua said: “China has a population of more than one billion. Do we need to send out a video of every one of them?” The camps have drawn international condemnation, including a rare rebuke from a Muslim-majority country, Turkey, this month. Turkey’s statement said that the well-known Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit had died in Chinese custody, prompting an official Chinese news service to post a video the next day of Mr. Heyit, who said he was healthy and under investigation. Within hours, Uighurs had begun posting about their own missing relatives. The diaspora has not always been so outspoken. Many Uighurs and Kazakhs have feared that speaking out about detained friends and relatives would invite Chinese retaliation against their families. Mr. Uyghur, the doctor in Finland, was among them. When his mother was detained in April 2017, followed by his father, he kept silent. But out of desperation, he eventually recorded a video of himself denouncing China for his parents’ plight. That clip, which he posted on Facebook in May 2018, was a then-rare personal account of the indoctrination program, which by that point had incarcerated at least hundreds of thousands of people. Now, with China showing no sign of curbing the program — and evidence emerging that the camps are growing in size and number — more Uighurs have been going public. Thousands have posted short videos or added names and details to lists of the missing. “People have started to stand up,” Mr. Uyghur said. “Psychologically, they are suffering. They don’t know what to do, but this might give them hope.” Last year, he founded a human rights group, UyghurAid, that is compiling recordings from around the world with the help of 30 volunteers. Activists are uploading those and other accounts to a single site, the Xinjiang Victims Database, which compiles names and biographical details of people believed to be held in the camps. The database contained more than 2,700 names as of Friday, a tiny fraction of the estimated total number of detainees. But each testimony about a missing loved one, the activists say, is a reminder that these are individuals with families and communities. And the pleas, often emotional, undermine the state’s narrative that the detainees are voluntarily participating in their indoctrination, they say. Human rights advocates say such a database also gives foreign diplomats specific information that they can raise with Beijing. “Once you have a list of thousands of testimonies, you can shove it in their faces,” said Gene Bunin, a Russian-American translator who started compiling the database in September with a small group of colleagues. Some activists believe their campaigns have already made a difference. In interviews last month in Almaty, Kazakhstan, a half-dozen Kazakhs said public appeals had pressured the authorities to release them or their relatives from internment camps. Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights, an activist group, has recorded hundreds of video appeals. Zharqynbek Otan, 31, a cook who was arrested in January 2017 and held in a camp for seven months, said he probably owed his freedom to the unceasing petitioning of his wife, Shynar Kylysheva, who is a Kazakh citizen. “I am very happy to have such a wife who will do everything to get me back,” he said. Without her efforts, he said, he might have ended up a laborer in one of the camp network’s factories. But these campaigns have encountered pushback. A group of Kazakh intellectuals recently called for Atajurt to be closed, saying the group harms Kazakhstan’s relationship with China. Atajurt’s head, Serikzhan Bilash, is being tried in Kazakhstan on a charge of running an unregistered organization. Some activists are being pressured by the very people they are trying to help. Gaziz Ornykhanuly said that shortly after he provided video testimony to Atajurt about his wife’s detention, she was released from a camp. But she is unable to leave Xinjiang to join him and their two daughters in Kazakhstan. In phone calls, he said, she insists she is happy to stay. “China is the biggest country in the world, the biggest economy,” she said, according to Mr. Ornykhanuly. “Why would we leave China?” He said she had urged him — under coercion, he believes — to stop working with Atajurt, the activist group. But he said he would continue to do so, by translating statements about missing people into Russian. “By helping people, I can ease this pain in my heart,” he said. “I’m witnessing all that has happened to Kazakhs and Uighurs in China, and I want to at least let the world know.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to Almaty. It is the former capital of Kazakhstan, not the current one. (That distinction now belongs to Astana.)",The New York Times
2019,"‘Sir, I Never Thought I’d See the Day I’d Be Working for a Colored Officer’","At War “Sir, I never thought I’d see the day I’d be working for a colored officer.” These were not words I expected to hear, in 2003, from a senior enlisted soldier. It was winter in Iraq’s Anbar Province, and we were standing in the bay of an abandoned train station, where our unit now lived. As the maintenance officer, I oversaw the bay, where we labored to keep a fleet of vehicles in shape for missions on Iraqi streets. Worn track pads and tires surrounded us. Grease-covered soldiers worked on heaps of metal left inoperable by combat. The sergeant was white, and probably in his late 30s, with a tan face darkened by red sandstorms. He possessed a level of discipline and diligence that was forged in years of service. We had served alongside each other for close to two years. We had trained together, deployed together and, over our unit’s wounded and killed soldiers, mourned together. He helped me to mature as an officer, recognizing that I was young and was experiencing combat for the first time. Facing common hardship, we bonded. I was 26 at the time, a newly promoted captain who’d gotten used to tough questions and observations from soldiers of all ranks. But when this sergeant rose from his chair, walked in my direction and said those words to me, I had no response. We had never had a conversation that would make me suspect he would express such a sentiment. And since I was not prepared to address its implications and assumptions, I simply walked away from the interaction, carrying with me a new, jarring data point in a lifelong reckoning with racism and the history it papers over, both in the service and the United States at large. [Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.] I’d been aware of the physical and emotional weight of racism before I ever encountered it firsthand. Both of my parents were raised in a South much different from mine in Fayetteville, N.C. — a pre-civil rights South that I glimpsed at family reunions in Arkansas, after libations loosened the elders’ lips. My father, a retired Army officer, often recalls being dismissed early from school to till a cotton field, while white children stayed behind and furthered their education. When he was a teenager, a group of white men surrounded him as he walked home from work. One man distracted him while another punched him in the face. My mother, a retired educator who grew up about four hours away from my father, has always been more tight-lipped about her upbringing — but whatever she experienced informed my childhood foreboding, my understanding that Fayetteville’s active Ku Klux Klan presence was an imminent risk to me whenever I left the house. My parents’ life stories served as a poignant warning about America’s racism toward its black citizens. It was a warning that came before the Fayetteville police pulled me, shirtless, at 16, from my car in the pouring rain. I was handcuffed and detained on suspicion that my girlfriend and I were using crack cocaine, when in fact we were only rounding third base. It was before a West Point classmate said that I should be spending the night in the “5th Regiment” — a nonexistent unit meant to refer to black cadets and, in this case, to imply that I had no place in the Academy’s four student regiments. Before a white woman I dated told me her family wouldn’t accept a black baby. Before this sergeant and I stood face to face in Iraq. As grating as his comment was, he had voiced what surely was a common experience for many white soldiers. I was one of only 67 blacks to graduate with my West Point class of 965 cadets; one of no more than three black officers in my first battalion in Korea; and again one of the few black officers in my unit when it deployed to Iraq. Wherever I went, I couldn’t help noticing the Army’s significant deficit of black officers. The sergeant didn’t seem hostile or demeaning. If anything, his voice seemed to waver, as if he were in that moment beginning to realize how racism not only negatively affects people of color but white people as well — how it causes them to buy into false narratives that legitimate institutions have perpetuated to advance white supremacy since our country’s founding. In 1925, the Army War College summarized a study of black soldiers in a memo titled “Employment of Negro Man Power in War.” “In the process of evolution the American Negro has not progressed as far as the other sub-species of the human family,” the document states. “As a race he has not developed leadership qualities. His mental inferiority and the inherent weaknesses of his character are factors that must be considered with great care in the preparation of any plan for his employment in war.” Among its conclusions was this: “Negro officers should not be placed over white officers, noncommissioned officers or soldiers.” The military that produced this document is the same military in which many black Americans have served and died — an Army that has now had its first black commander in chief and that just hired West Point’s first black superintendent since its founding in 1802. But that memo also distills our country’s conventional wisdom, which has variously justified slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, redlining and the mass incarceration of black Americans. As a black veteran, I find it hard to reconcile my pride in my service with a sense of complicity in upholding my country’s legacy of white supremacy while deployed. I still remember the black and brown faces of Iraqis that I helped to round up, zip-tie and detain using tactics similar to stop and frisk, the use of which some courts in America have found to be unconstitutional. These experiences created a moral chasm with which I continue to grapple. I’m now a 41-year-old civilian, father and husband. After completing my time in the service, I went to business school, worked on Wall Street and attended the creative-writing program at Columbia University. In each of these institutions, some form of racism persisted. I recall working on an investment banking deal team and hearing a client’s senior executive suggest that LeBron James spent the windfall from his Miami Heat contract on 20-inch rims. And I remember sitting in Ivy League classrooms where the only other dark face in front of me was my reflection in a wall-mounted flat screen. Over the years, I’ve focused on these contradictions — and on seeking deeper, truer historical context when it comes to America’s racism. I’ve attended workshops where white people and people of color work together to develop a common language to understand the effects of the institutionalized white control of power, wealth and opportunity — both historically and in the present day. This journey has opened my eyes to the possibility that this sergeant was the first white person who ever tried to have an open and honest conversation about racism with me. Last year, I accepted an invitation from a fellow black West Point alumnus to attend the academy’s annual Henry O. Flipper dinner, honoring the institution’s first black graduate and the Army’s first African-American commissioned officer. February snow covered the Hudson Valley, and a cold wind cut across the river. On my way into the mess hall, I ended up walking next to a black captain who had been injured in Iraq. I followed him inside and found myself sitting just a few feet away from then-cadet (now lieutenant) Simone Askew, the first black female student leader of West Point’s 4,400-strong cadet corps, who was seated at the next table. On my plate was the evening’s program with a photograph of Flipper, class of 1877. After the dinner, I ducked into the library and took a look around. I went up a level and saw cadets studying. Up another level, I found the rings of my fallen classmates. On the library’s top floor, I stumbled upon a bronze bust of Henry Ossian Flipper in his full-dress uniform. Born into slavery in 1856, Flipper defied racial prejudice and institutional power to survive West Point. He was also a notable public servant after his time in the service — which was cut short by a racially motivated court-martial. During my time at the Academy, I’d been too preoccupied with my own challenges to grasp the magnitude of Flipper’s accomplishment. No grand epiphanies stretched across the years as I stared into the contours of his statue. I was as humbled by his work as I was conflicted about my own. Flipper paved my path at West Point, a path that many officers of color still follow — in and for a nation that still seems determined to normalize the ideology of white supremacy and to write off our achievements as statistical anomalies.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Sorry Angel’ Review: A Love Affair Two Men Start, Knowing the End","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At first glance, Jacques Tondelli (Pierre Deladonchamps) seems to enjoy an unmoored, cushy life in early 1990s Paris. And the early 1990s Paris Christophe Honoré evokes in this film looks to be a good place for that. We are introduced to Jacques alone at an elegant bistro, giving a pleasant but slightly ironical glance at a male-female couple sitting nearby. In his late 30s, he’s dressed stylishly, mostly in blue, a color that suffuses the film, subtly, as has been Honoré’s customary light-touch going back to “Dans Paris” (2006) and “Love Songs” (2007). Soon Jacques’s date arrives: a shabbily dressed young hustler. And it clearly amuses the self-assured Jacques to dine with the fellow in such an upscale environment. Back at his apartment, Jacques commiserates with an older friend, Mathieu (Denis Podalydès). Jacques’s writing is going poorly, his finances are bad. Little to do but hang out and get high with his pal, although steps are taken not to disturb Jacques’s grade-school-age son, Loulou. As it peels Jacques like an onion, “Sorry Angel” also develops, in a loping, unhurried style, the narrative of a love affair that is never truly allowed to happen. The romance ignites when Jacques travels to the small French city of Rennes to oversee a production of one of his plays, an endeavor in which he has little interest. Ducking into a movie theater to avoid work, he happens upon the handsome, intellectually ambitious Arthur (Vincent Lacoste), who’s in his early 20s. They arrange a meeting later that night, but Jacques is hijacked by one of the actors from his play. Arthur follows them stealthily, almost impishly. He overhears their conversation, during which the actor brings up the fact that Jacques is H.I.V.positive. The revelation does not dissuade the smitten Arthur. In previous scenes, we’ve seen him struggling with how he’s been living a lie of sorts. A young man who can’t wholly help his callowness, he keeps around a girlfriend, with whom he’s clearly discontented, and sulkily cruises for men at night. All the while, he acts as if everything he does is exactly what he wants to be doing. Jacques and Arthur negotiate their immediate attraction through a mutual wariness that comes from different places: “I can’t face a final romance,” Jacques says at one point. They fall into a teacher/student relationship almost comfortably as they do a sexual one; one of the movie’s best scenes is a phone conversation during which Jacques delightedly gives a lesson on gay history and semiotics, with invocations of Walt Whitman and Chester Kallman. It took a while for this digressive movie to get its hooks in me, but once it did, “Sorry Angel” didn’t let go. A big part of it is Jacques, who in Deladonchamps’s hands is one of the most layered film characters I’ve experienced in some time. Egotistic, mercurial, erudite, recklessly affectionate, careless, vindictive, impulsive, he can turn from exasperating to heartbreaking in seconds flat.

2019,‘Stansted 15’ Protesters Who Blocked U.K. Deportation Flight Avoid Prison Terms,"LONDON — A judge on Wednesday handed suspended sentences and community service to 15 people who broke into Stansted Airport, north of London, to ground a flight removing migrants from Britain. The group entered the international airport in March 2017, after cutting through a fence and chaining themselves together on the tarmac near a jet that was chartered by the British Home Office to expel migrants to Ghana and Nigeria. Flights were disrupted at the airport for several hours. Three of the defendants, Alistair Tamlit, Edward Thacker and Melanie Strickland, were sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for 18 months, the BBC reported from the court. The others received 12 months of community service, including carrying out unpaid work. “In normal circumstances, only a normal custodial sentence would have been justified in this case, but in your case I accept that your intentions were to demonstrate,” Judge Christopher Morgan told the defendants in court. The protesters, who became known as the Stansted 15, were charged last year under a rarely used law that was passed in 1990 in response to the Lockerbie bombing, a terrorist attack that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over a town in Scotland, killing 270 people. The charges carried a maximum penalty of life in prison, and in December some public figures and human rights organizations criticized the convictions by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, to the northeast of London. Amnesty International said that the charges were excessive and that they could discourage others from taking nonviolent action in defense of human rights. Diane Abbott, an opposition Labour lawmaker who speaks for the party on home affairs, wrote in a tweet on Wednesday, “Civil disobedience has been used for centuries to challenge injustice.” “The Stansted 15’s campaign against brutal charter flight deportations was simply another example of this,” she added. Chris Long, the chief crown prosecutor for the east of England, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, “The evidence in the case supported the charge — that their serious actions were likely to risk the safe operation of the aerodrome.” The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges and are appealing their convictions. Melanie Evans, a charity worker, was one of the six people who cut the fence and helped carry blockade materials to the side of the parked Boeing 767 jet. She said that the group’s view was that Britain was compromising the safety of the migrants who were to board the flight. “At the time of our action, it seemed that there was no just way to protect these people because they were so quickly and secretly snatched away,” Ms. Evans said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Ms. Evans said she knew what she was doing was against the law, but she said she had expected a charge of aggravated trespassing, which has been used in previous cases. Raj Chada, who represented the defendants in court, said in a statement that the charges amounted to using “counterterrorism legislation.” “While we are relieved that none of our clients face a custodial sentence, today is still a sad day for justice,” he said, adding that the group “will continue to fight in the appeal courts to get these wrongful convictions overturned.” Protesters in Britain and other countries have staged similar protests to try to halt deportation flights. In July, a woman in Sweden refused to sit down in a Turkish Airlines flight, trying to block the removal of an Afghan man from the country. The woman, Elin Ersson, live-streamed the video, drawing praise from around the world, but she faces a fine or a prison sentence of up to six months if convicted of violating a Swedish aviation law. Last year, Prime Minister Theresa May apologized after some members of the “Windrush generation,” who came to Britain legally from colonies or former colonies from 1948 to 1973, were threatened with deportation because they could not prove they were residing in the country legally. But this week, the Home Office was organizing a charter flight to Jamaica to transport deportees. The Guardian newspaper said it would be the first such flight since March 2017. The Home Office would not confirm the details of the flight, but a spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that “all individuals on this charter flight are serious criminals.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 3: Guess Who’s Back?","Star Trek: Discovery Let’s call this a return to form for “Star Trek: Discovery,” in that “Point Of Light” was the first episode this season to remind me of last season. By which I mean it offered crowded, haphazard and choppy storytelling with bold choices that depart from historic Trek norms. (A suggested decapitation? Yikes!) It’s not a coincidence that this episode featured the return of the Klingons (this time with hair!), one of the most confusing plot points of the first season. The writers for “Discovery” — this was penned by Andrew Colville and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi — backed themselves into a corner with where they last left the Klingon Empire. L’Rell is now the chancellor because Starfleet planted a bomb deep inside Qo’noS, and Burnham gave her the detonator to use, essentially, to blackmail the Klingon High Council to make her the boss. If it didn’t, she would blow up the Klingon homeworld. What a way to win loyalty from the troops: Make me your leader or else I will blow up this planet and no one will be a leader. Of course, as we see in “Point of Light,” some houses are unhappy about L’Rell’s ascension. But not because of the blackmail. It’s because L’Rell’s torchbearer — essentially the Hand of the Queen — is Ash Tyler, also known as The Artist Formerly Known As Voq. Of course, they’re unhappy. Why would Klingons, who are known xenophobes (“Remain Klingon!”), be comfortable with a human as L’Rell’s deputy? Especially one with known Starfleet ties? Why would anyone think this would work? Somewhere along the way, L’Rell found time to get pregnant with Tyler’s child, whom we meet in this episode. This leads to a kidnapping, a fight scene and L’Rell needing the help of Section 31, Starfleet’s rogue spy group, to remain in power. Tyler’s undoing comes because he reaches out to his former lover, Burnham, to pass on crucial information about the potential disintegration of the fragile peace among Klingons, which L’Rell’s opponents see as treacherous. And they have a point. And somehow — “somehow” seems to be a common word when it comes to the Klingon story line — L’Rell is able to convince the Klingons that she cut off Tyler’s head because he slaughtered her son, and that her biggest challenger died defending her. The other Klingons now believe in her as a leader (I guess?) and don’t question how convenient all of this is. If you had trouble following all of this, don’t blame yourself. It was all a bit confusing because we don’t know much about L’Rell’s rivals and we can barely understand what they are saying. The “Discovery” team did not solve the problem of how difficult it made Klingon words to understand for the viewing audience. Even when they were speaking English, it sounded garbled. The other big — ahem — discovery this week: Spock has escaped and is wanted for murder for the killing of three of his doctors on Starbase 5. When Pike asks the captain of that starbase why he wasn’t notified or why there hasn’t been a manhunt initiated, the answer he gets is, “Rest assured, they’ve got people on it.” This answer doesn’t quite make sense and Pike knows something is up. But he lets the vagueness of it stand, knowing that if he pressed more, he’d likely raise some alarm bells among the Starfleet brass he knows. (Grumpy Trek canon note: Seriously? We never hear about Spock being accused of murder in the future? Yeah, yeah. Let’s wait and see how this plays out.) Amanda Grayson, Spock and Burnham’s mother, witnesses all of this because she’s paid a surprise visit to the Discovery. Mia Kirshner does admirable work here as Grayson, delivering the warmth that is a contrast to Sarek’s coldness. But boy, how easy was it for her to steal a Starfleet officer’s top secret medical files. Burnham tells Grayson that she did something “irreparable” to drive Spock away, but won’t tell her what. Eventually, after sharing another tender moment with Burnham, Grayson leaves and says she’ll go find Spock. And if there weren’t enough stories crammed into this episode, Tilly’s imaginary friend ends up being a fungus that created hallucinations of someone from her childhood. This conclusion — for now — was a big letdown for me. We finally got to see Tilly do something that wasn’t incredibly awkward. Her grappling with whether she had gone insane, in addition to fighting off the visions, were strong moments for Mary Wiseman. But I thought maybe the hallucination was going end up tied to the bigger picture of the season so far: the red signals. Instead, it just seems like a random quirk created by the writers to give Wiseman’s character more juice. (Of course, I could be wrong. We see the fungus captured — not released. So perhaps there is more to do with this story line.) Odds and ends • Angelic figure update: So Spock apparently saw the vision as a child and used it to find Burnham, who had run away. And somehow this is something that Sarek and Grayson never thought to mention to Burnham. Ever. Not even in passing. Either way, just more of what remains this season’s most compelling mystery. • I’ll have more to say on Section 31 as we see how the plot unfolds, but it was a welcome sight to see Michelle Yeoh as Georgiou again to close out the episode.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 4: On Death Watch","Star Trek: Discovery The most famous death scene in “Star Trek” history — one that transcended the franchise — was undoubtedly Spock’s demise at the end of the 1982 film “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.” It was momentous for multiple reasons: First, the death forced Kirk to actually confront the no-win scenario. Second — and perhaps most important — they actually killed off Spock. They offed a beloved character, shocking audiences and making the final scene (“I have been — and always shall be — your friend”) all the more meaningful. Those were real stakes. Compare that to this week’s baffling episode, “An Obol for Charon,” directed by Lee Rose, which took us through this ridiculous charade of making it seem as if Saru would actually die — complete with a death bed scene and what were essentially Kelpien last rites — only to violate the audience’s trust but having it all be for naught. What was the point of wasting Doug Jones’s excellent performance portraying a dying man when he wasn’t actually dying? Jones has been an underused standout on “Discovery” since the pilot. Aside from his role in a “Short Trek” episode between seasons, we rarely see any character development with Saru over the course of the show. So even if the writers did kill him off in this episode, it would have been an unnecessary waste of a character. (This wouldn’t be the first time “Discovery” did this, having killed off Michelle Yeoh’s Good Georgiou and Jason Isaacs’s Lorca prematurely.) The grand conclusion of Saru’s near-death experience, which comes after the Discovery encounters a spherical being who wants to download its knowledge before dying, is that Saru feels more in control of himself rather than feeling governed by fear as Kelpiens typically are. This feels cheap. Instead of having Saru become a better person through conquering obstacles, “An Obol For Charon” gave him a disease. And when did Saru and Burnham get so close? Why is Burnham crying next to Saru’s Not-So-Deathbed? We rarely see these two together by themselves. In fact, when Burnham was released from prison to serve on the Discovery again, Saru was visibly angry (as angry as he gets) that Burnham was allowed to serve again and openly said he didn’t trust her. Over the next several episodes, they got comfortable as co-workers, but seemingly nothing more. It was another contrived relationship that made the episode frustrating. (If you want a an example of a Trek episode that better handles the prospect of a key crew member’s death, go watch “Ethics,” an episode in the fifth season of “The Next Generation.” A cargo bay container falls on Worf, paralyzing him and leaving him to beg Riker to help him commit suicide. It is compelling character development, even as audience members know deep down that Worf is probably not going to die. ) The best parts of the episode came early, when the Discovery crew was having a simple meeting. These kind of lighthearted exchanges between crew members are much needed breaks from the general gloom and doom of “Discovery,” and it’s nice to see senior officers sharing a positive rapport. We don’t make much progress with discovering (sorry!) who the angelic figure is that has so vexed Burnham, Spock and, you know, the rest of the universe. Spock is on the run and the Discovery, until it got waylaid by the spherical alien, was hot on his trail. It is unclear to me what Starfleet thinks the Discovery is doing. Remember, Pike is not supposed to know the location of the shuttle Spock stole. Pike has that information because his first officer, No. 1, essentially smuggled it to him. Starfleet purportedly also has other ships looking for Spock. Won’t they know that Discovery is up to something? Oh, and Tilly is kidnapped by that giant fungus-like alien that Discovery was keeping locked up. This story line has been tough to follow because we don’t know what the alien’s intentions are or what the fascination is with Tilly in particular. We know that the spore drive has somehow disrupted life for those aliens, but the endgame isn’t clear. This has the makings of another wasted story line: To see Tilly develop because she has an alien that possesses her rather than seeing her succeed on her own, again, seems like contrived character development. Overall, it’s the second episode in which the season’s primary story line doesn’t move forward. That’s fine with me, of course. A lot of historic “Trek” episodes don’t have much to do with the central conflict. But this one felt like an unnecessary diversion from the more interesting mystery being solved by Pike and Burnham.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 5: A Trek KGB","Star Trek: Discovery No one ever really dies in “Star Trek: Discovery,” apparently. Even the characters who do die. After toying with our emotions last week with the potential demise of Saru, we have the return of Dr. Hugh Culber, whom we all thought was murdered last season by Tyler. How is he still alive? I got lost in Stamets’s technobabble explanation but it had something to do with thermodynamics, and how “energy cannot be created or destroyed.” It can only change states. The other big story line this week is the collision course of Section 31 and the Discovery crew. To properly understand this plotline, let’s take a step back and remember where Section 31 was introduced. It was one of the best story lines in “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine”: A rogue Starfleet black-ops group, with advanced technology, whose existence wouldn’t even be confirmed by the official Federation hierarchy. The operatives, like Sloan, came and went on ships as they liked, whenever they wanted. They committed assassinations, framed high-ranking politicians and abducted Starfleet officers. Section 31 was essentially a futuristic version of the KGB and made clear that Starfleet wasn’t solely the moral force for good that we saw in “The Next Generation.” It’s not that Section 31 bends the rules. In “Deep Space Nine,” it didn’t seem to have any. The group was so secret that in one scene, Admiral Ross wouldn’t even discuss it with Dr. Bashir “on the record.” (Section 31 has appeared in other iterations of Trek: “Enterprise,” which I won’t acknowledge existing, and “Star Trek Into Darkness,” which I will barely acknowledge existing.) In “Discovery,” all that intrigue is gone. Georgiou — speaking of characters brought back from the dead — is a key Section 31 operative. This makes sense — she is devious and has no moral compass. But in this universe, Section 31 operates openly and is treated like a normal career stop. Everyone knows about it. Leland, who seems to be its leader, greets Pike like an old friend. He sends a liaison — Tyler — to Discovery to get briefed on whatever intelligence the crew possesses. Remember, that in the “Deep Space Nine” version of Section 31, it wouldn’t need a briefing. The operatives, like Sloan, would have just taken the information without Pike and the crew ever knowing. Later in the episode, Leland tells Georgiou she is risking a court-martial. That a member of Section 31, in the way it has been described before, would be worried about a court-martial is laughable. And speaking of Tyler, he openly strolls around the ship and sits in the mess hall to chat with Burnham. I guess we’re all supposed to forget that he is not supposed to be alive. Remember, the Klingon Empire thinks that he’s been beheaded. Why would he take the risk that word of his strolling around Federation ships wouldn’t leak out? It would surely destabilize Qo’noS. By the end of the episode, Admiral Cornwell — welcome back! — orders Section 31 and the Discovery crew to work together to find Spock. She talks to Pike and Leland as if they’re arguing siblings. At one point, Leland says to Pike, “We go back a long way, Chris. But my job requires me to walk a line and I cross that with you. And I apologize.” Stop it. No one in Section 31 apologizes. For anything. Also, it is unclear to me why Pike wasn’t told ahead of time that Section 31 was looking for Spock, since the group operates out in the open. It’s our third straight episode where we don’t really get much movement on what is established as the main story line of the season: the red signals and Spock’s plight. The biggest change from last season to this one is that the episodes are more self-contained. I’m hoping we get back to the subject at hand soon, because these side plots, like Tilly and the mycelial network are getting distracting. • One thing that really stands out in “Discovery”: Its cinematography is top notch. The point-of-view shot from the vantage point of a torpedo when the Discovery fires a warning shot on what we thought was Spock’s shuttle is fantastic. • The writers made a choice this season to let Burnham explore more of her human side this season. You see Sonequa Martin-Green being much more expressive in reactions to potentially catastrophic events, like Saru’s death/not death and Tilly’s kidnapping. It doesn’t feel particularly genuine because the writers keep crying wolf. The stakes seem low because no one actually dies.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 6: A Better Saru","Star Trek: Discovery Evolution can come in many forms. Physical. Emotional. Mental. Societal. Saru brings it all in the latest episode “Star Trek: Discovery,” a self-contained, efficient and compelling chapter of an uneven season. It’s not a coincidence that once again, Doug Jones is at the center of several of the show’s best scenes. In “The Sounds of Thunder,” Saru is compassionate, angry, confident, defiant and reflective. What he is not: fearful, because he has survived vahar’ai. And Jones rises to the occasion. Much as Brent Spiner did with Data’s quest to become more human on “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” he shows us that evolution comes with bumps. We learn that the red signals have appeared over Kaminar, the home planet of the Kelpiens and the Ba’ul. The Ba’ul have, essentially, maintained control over Saru’s people for many years because the Kelpiens used to be the predator species, and the Ba’ul fear that an evolved Kelpien is a malicious one. The Discovery goes to investigate, and Saru visibly and uncharacteristically shows anger at Pike for amenably communicating with the Ba’ul and not initially sending him to the planet. (There is also an amusingly passive-aggressive moment early in the episode when Saru forgets to get up from the captain’s chair when Pike enters the bridge.) Saru goes to the planet and reunites with Siranna (excellent work here by Hannah Spear), who is both overjoyed to see her brother and fearful, as Kelpiens typically are, that Saru’s presence will upset the Great Balance. Saru, of course, knows the Great Balance is a fraud and a ploy to keep Kelpiens subjugated. But Siranna knows nothing of the outside world and thought Saru had been dead all these years. Eventually, Saru beams over to a Ba’ul ship, where he is once again on death’s door. He hulks up and becomes Super Saru, then breaks out of his chains to save a suddenly imperiled Siranna; meanwhile, the entirety of the Kelpien race goes through vahar’ai to lose their fears. What I am a little unclear about: Are the Ba’ul a bunch of people? Are they the, uh, blob-type thing we see threatening Saru, which looks like Venom from “Spider Man”? Of course, the evolution of the Kelpiens is problematic for the Ba’ul, so they try to pull off a bit of genocide for self-preservation. It doesn’t work. The biggest plot twist of the episode comes when the Red Angel shows up to do … something. The big reveal is that the Red Angel, whatever or whoever it is, might be a benevolent force. One thing is for sure, as the Discovery finds out. These sightings aren’t random. Spock, Burnham and now Saru have come into contact with it. In all three situations, the Red Angel has been used to save lives. Even still, the Federation believes it is a dangerous force, whatever it is, as Tyler from Section 31 makes clear at the end of the episode. The episode worked for me. It was ambitious and tightly-written, and it showcased a character that has been deserving of the spotlight. Odds and Ends: • We’re six episodes in, and we still don’t have any idea what’s going on with Spock. Even though I really enjoyed this episode, we are pretty far-off track from the mystery that was introduced in the first two episodes — two of the best of the series so far. • Trouble in paradise for Culber and Stamets? Culber seems to blanch a bit when Stamets touches him early in the episode. • Captain Pike is, by far, the most tolerant and patient captain we’ve seen at the center of a “Star Trek” series. He consistently listens to his subordinates, is an advocate for his crew and doesn’t make rash decisions. You can see why he eventually (at least according to traditional Trek canon) becomes an admiral.",The New York Times
2019,‘Stomp’ Turns 25. Here Are 10 Things You Didn’t Know About It.,"There’s more to the show than banging on a can. Ask George Lucas, Hillary Clinton — and the performer who’s been doing it for 20 years. One man’s trash really can be another man’s treasure. At least that’s the lesson you might take from “Stomp,” the durable New York-based stage show that has become a long-running institution in a city where sticking power can be hard to come by. About to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its New York premiere, “Stomp” has endured, not thanks to high-priced sets and effects, but from wielding everyday objects like brooms, garbage cans and wooden poles to create a wordless percussive explosion onstage. And let’s not forget the 150 or so performers who have smacked their way in and out of its cast. (On March 3, some alumni will join the current cast in the two performances, followed by a private party.) “Stomp” is the brainchild of Luke Cresswell, 55, and Steve McNicholas, 63, who still maintain creative control. (Blue Man Group, another downtown mainstay, was sold to Cirque du Soleil in 2017.) And while they have expressed interest in branching out — in 1997, Mr. McNicholas told the Times, “We’re kind of trapped, because we don’t feel we can walk away from it” — “Stomp” has come to define their lives. They started working together in the early 1980s, creating a one-off in their hometown Brighton, England, called “Romance Is Not Dead” that they performed on the day of the royal wedding of Charles and Diana as counterprogramming. Later, they busked on the streets outside the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in a band called Pookiesnackenburger. Mr. Cresswell described their early music in an interview as “very eclectic, punky, thrashy, scratchy,” and with “lots of running around.” The band eventually split up, but Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas formed a new troupe: an ensemble of eight performers that made its debut as “Stomp” at the festival in 1991. Mr. Cresswell had been the band’s percussionist; since he could only carry a few small drums, he began improvising on the street, which meant he would use surrounding objects as well. “We quickly learned how much the audience enjoyed that kind of experimentation,” Mr. McNicholas said. After three years of international touring, Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas brought the act to New York where it has never left the Orpheum Theater in the East Village. Along the way, “Stomp” launched several touring companies, appeared on late night television, filmed an HBO special and collaborated with A-listers. There have been bumps. In 2010, a national tour of “Pandemonium: The Lost and Found Orchestra,” another sound-centered show from Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas, was canceled after less than three weeks of performances. But “Stomp” itself has become part of pop culture and an unqualified success, which hasn’t fazed the founding duo. “We’re British and we live in England so we’re quite reserved,” said Mr. McNicholas. “We’re quite used to people telling us that we’re nothing special.” As the show celebrates a quarter century in New York, where a spokeswoman said it has grossed about $100 million, here are 10 things you might not know about “Stomp.” In the early 1980s, Pookiesnackenburger was a supporting act for Madness at the Dominion Theater in London. Yes, that Madness, as in the guys who earwormed “Our house in the middle of the street” into an entire generation of unsuspecting British teenagers. “They once described us as their favorite group,” Mr. McNicholas said. The connection has lasted. Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas helped orchestrate a theatrical launch show for Madness’s 2009 album, “The Liberty of Norton Folgate.” “Stomp” props might seem widely available. But Mr. Cresswell said that everyday objects, depending on where they’re made, make different sounds. He and Mr. McNicholas have the props shipped from Britain by boat. On one voyage in the late 1990s, a freak wave hit a boat carrying “Stomp” trash cans. The cargo box carrying the cans sank to the bottom of the North Sea. “Stomp” has used a total of 13,000 poles, 5,200 boxes of tissues, and 52,000 candles during its New York run. And for when the drummers have suffered injuries: 7,800 Ace bandages. In the late 1990s, George Lucas was looking to cast “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace,” the highly anticipated prequel to the franchise. He had seen “Stomp” on the West Coast. “They were looking for someone really musical and with rhythm,” Mr. Cresswell recalled. Mr. Lucas and the casting director, Robin Gurland, invited several “Stomp” cast members to audition. Ahmed Best got the job — as Jar Jar Binks, who ended up being one of the most reviled characters in “Star Wars” history. In the original 1994 review, the critic Stephen Holden wrote: “One person who would probably have given ‘Stomp’ his stamp of approval is John Cage. Not only does the show demonstrate with an entrancing charm the music to be found in everyday objects, it does so at a relatively modest volume.” Cage, who died two years before “Stomp” debuted in New York, was the influential avant-garde composer who thrived on defying convention, and urged other artists to do the same. The “Stomp” creators have had plenty of celebrity collaborators, from Bette Midler (the roots of the show are clear in a pre-“Stomp” segment from her “Mondo Beyondo Show”) to the vaudevillian Bill Irwin (on “The Late Show With David Letterman” in 1997). The founders’ favorite appearance, they said, was with Paul Simon and Jimmy Fallon, performing the Simon and Garfunkel hit “Cecilia” on “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” in 2011. Carlos Thomas, 42, is one of the longest running cast members, having made his debut 20 years ago. He was more prepared for his audition than most prospective performers, having grown up with a single mother who couldn’t afford to buy him instruments. “To practice rhythm, I would make drums out of pots and pans,” Mr. Thomas said in an interview. “In high school, I would be the guy who would take the desk, chair and chalk on the chalkboard and go ‘Chooka-chooka-chooka.’ I’d make music out of everything in the classroom.” In 2015, Daniela and Tom Isenschmid bought out an entire “Stomp” show in London so they could make the performance the main attraction at their wedding reception. “Stomp” auditions occur once every two or three years. They are essentially open calls. One time, a dancer brought her boyfriend to an audition in London. The boyfriend watched the workshop through a window. “We said, ‘Come in, come in.’ And he came in, and he was great,” Mr. Cresswell said. His girlfriend didn’t make the ensemble. Paul Bend did, and has been a “Stomp” cast member since 2001. The couple is no longer together. In 1999, Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas were planning to mark the millennium scuba diving off the Micronesian island Yap, until they received a call from the office of Hillary Clinton, who was first lady at the time. Mrs. Clinton requested that they perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on New Year’s Eve. (Quincy Jones, a longtime supporter of the partners, helped make the connection.) “Stomp” dutifully did the show and skipped the scuba diving. “Then we partied at the White House till 4 in the morning,” Mr. Cresswell said. “It was fantastic.” “It was the best party I’ve ever been to,” Mr. McNicholas added.",The New York Times
2019,‘Styx’ Review: The Refugee Crisis as Moral Thriller,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A taut moral thriller, “Styx” is a story of what happens when self-reliance runs into other people’s desperation. The lives of others don’t seem of much concern to a German doctor, Rike (Susanne Wolff), when she sets off on her adventure. Alone on a 30-foot sailing yacht, she is headed to Ascension Island, a mid-Atlantic speck roughly halfway between Africa and South America. With grit, provisions and a pretty coffee-table book about the island that suggests her romanticism, or perhaps naïveté, Rike is following Charles Darwin to Ascension. It’s a dream journey that will slam into the refugee crisis. One woman’s dream can look like someone else’s worst nightmare, even if the director Wolfgang Fischer initially makes Rike’s passage into existential isolation seem inviting. After a brief, eloquent preamble in Germany, he deposits Rike in Gibraltar, where she efficiently packs up her boat. Much like his protagonist, Fischer assumes a well-organized, seamless approach to his launch, setting the scene with a bright, direct visual style that feels largely informational — a lingering shot of what appears to be months’ worth of food and water — and only occasionally slides into the metaphoric, as when Rike sails past a gargantuan tanker that conveys an ominous dehumanization. Part of the allure of this expedition is its quietude, at least for the audience. Soon after Rike leaves Gibraltar, she is enveloped by the ocean, and the movie shifts into the visual and auditory minimalism that defines its alluring, almost hypnotically soothing first third. Fischer primarily shot “Styx” on the open sea, with Malta standing in for the west coast of Africa. It’s a headily seductive landscape painted in every conceivable shade of blue and daubed with white. Like Rike, you settle into the luxurious peacefulness, a stillness augmented by the water’s rhythmic splashes, her bustling movements and the boat’s gentle cacophony — the flap of the sails, the whir of the winch, assorted pleasant creaks. Excursions into solitude invariably must end, especially when there’s another hour or so of movie yet to come. Civilization intrudes on Rike’s seclusion when a man’s voice begins squawking on her radio. It’s a friendly, ever-so-slightly paternalistic intrusion. He provides an extreme weather forecast and promises future help if she should ever need it. A no-nonsense woman who seems perfectly capable of taking care of herself, Rike politely accepts the offer. Still, there’s something about the exchange that seems to irk her (and you), partly because the movie is playing with the figure of the independent modern woman, one who seems capable of handling any reasonable challenge. The violent storm that soon descends precedes a dramatic narrative shift — after the weather clears, Rike sees a fishing trawler overloaded with passengers. (They’re between Cape Verde and Mauritania.) Because the camera continues to share her point of view — and the trawler is distant enough — you hear voices but can’t make out faces, just bodies and frantically waving arms. Rike sends out a distress signal. Her boat is too small to save all the passengers, who she worries will panic and scramble onboard, sinking it. One voice after another answers back, a clamor of international strangers who sternly tell her to do nothing and wait for help. Rike waits and waits some more. In short order, the larger world crashes in, and a story of radical, deeply privileged individualism gives way to a potent, messy and sometimes uncomfortable parable about what human beings owe one another. The refugees are adrift on a sea of global indifference. Fischer puts a human face on the crisis through the introduction of a boy in his early teens (Gedion Oduor Weseka), who swims to Rike’s boat, almost drowning. Pulling him out of the water, Rike calls him Kingsley (the name on his bracelet), and they begin a wary relationship that movingly if schematically personalizes a larger social struggle. Fischer’s minimalism isn’t simply a stylistic choice; it’s also strategic. The story of an advantaged European face to face with desperately imperiled African refugees seems tailor-made for political pieties and the dubious enshrinement of one more white savior story. For the longest time, though, Fischer, working with a script that he wrote with Ika Künzel, refuses to preach or tip his political hand. Instead he focuses on the physical dangers and bodily assaults that Kingsley and Rike endure as the voices on the radio continue promising help and the voices from the boat eerily begin to dim. Rike’s stoic competence and Wolff’s attractive, contained performance have led you to think that she can handle anything, a fantasy that is as reassuring as it is grimly, horrifically false.

2019,"‘Synonyms,’ Drama by Israeli Director, Takes Top Prize at Berlin Film Festival","BERLIN — This year’s Golden Bear for best feature film at the Berlin International Film Festival was awarded on Saturday to “Synonyms,” a dryly comic, largely autobiographical drama about a young Israeli trying to reinvent himself in modern-day Paris. It was one of 16 films in competition at the festival, seven of which were directed by women. In his acceptance speech, Nadav Lapid, the film’s Israeli director, dedicated the award to his mother, who had edited much of the film but died during production. The selection committee was headed by the French actress Juliette Binoche. Angela Schanelec of Germany took home the directing award for “I Was at Home, But,” an elliptical film about a widowed mother whose teenage son runs away from home. In one of the most dramatic moments of this year’s festival, “One Second,” a drama by the acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou that is set during the Cultural Revolution, was removed from competition days before its planned premiere for “technical reasons,” a term frequently used in China as a euphemism for government censorship. The Silver Bear, the runner-up prize, was awarded to François Ozon’s “By the Grace of God,” a drama based on a real-life sexual abuse case within the Roman Catholic Church in France. The film, a solemn work by Mr. Ozon, a veteran French director, had been one of the most critically lauded in the festival. The French priest the film is based on, who is accused of abusing dozens of boys, has filed a lawsuit trying to delay the film’s release in France. Yong Mei took home the award for best actress and Wang Jingchun won best actor, both for their roles in the Chinese film “So Long, My Son” by Wang Xiaoshuai. In understated performances, Ms. Yong and Mr. Wang play a couple who lose their only son in an accident and are forced to cope with tumultuous events over several decades in China’s history. The Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature that “opens new perspectives” was awarded to Nora Fingscheidt’s “System Crasher,” about a violent 9-year-old girl caught within the German social system. “Piranhas,” an Italian crime drama whose screenwriters included Roberto Saviano, the Italian writer and author of “Gomorrah,” took home the prize for best screenplay. The Teddy Award for best L.G.B.T.-themed feature film was given to “Brief Story From the Green Planet,” an Argentine film about friends who encounter an alien creature. This year’s festival was the last Berlinale, as it is known in Germany, to be overseen by Dieter Kosslick, who has served as its director since 2001. In recent years, Mr. Kosslick has drawn criticism for what some observers have seen as an overly broad curatorial approach to the festival, which has grown significantly during his tenure. In November 2017, 79 members of the German film industry signed an open letter arguing that the festival required a “new start.” Mr. Kosslick will be replaced by two co-chiefs. Carlo Chatrian, who was until recently the artistic director of the Locarno Film Festival, will take over the Berlinale’s artistic direction, while Mariette Rissenbeek, who has previously been the managing director of German Films, a center for the promotion of German filmmaking, will lead the business side of the festival.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Tension Sculptures’ Explore Limits, Political and Physical","Five large-scale, primary yellow sculptures, made of an extremely durable synthetic rubber stretched between stainless steel armatures, will be open to the public on Park Avenue on Monday. This series, by the Brooklyn-based artist Joseph La Piana, is called “Tension Sculptures,” and will be installed on five corners between 53rd Street and 70th Street. “I generally like working with material that’s passive in nature, that can be activated through force, like gravity or suspension, that gives it another life,” he said. The rubber of these sculptures, he said, “will outlive who we are.” The dimensions of the artworks vary, but they’re all sizable; the tallest is 16 feet high and the widest is 22 feet long. The installation is presented by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fund for Park Avenue’s Sculpture Advisory Committee. The art will remain on display until the end of July. “The committee was initially drawn to Joseph’s concept of tension and the energy that these pieces will bring to the Avenue,” Barbara McLaughlin, president of the Fund for Park Avenue wrote in an email. The tulips, she noted, won’t bloom until late April — something Mr. La Piana said he looks forward to as well, as a chance to see how the colors will interact with the living environment. Of the sculptures, Mr. La Piana said: “The material is being pushed to its limits. They’re not going to snap, but they’re pushed to the limits.” Mr. La Piana said he sees the “Tension Sculptures” as having societal implications. “Politically and societally and environmentally, we’re being pushed to the point of collapse like the materials,” he said. “But in the sense that these sculptures will not collapse, there’s some hope.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘The 2019 Oscar Nominated Short Films’ Review: Heartbreak, Abbreviated","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Children in peril. The subject appears to be all the rage right now, if we judge by this year’s Oscar-nominated live-action short films, which are screening alongside their animated and documentary counterparts before the Feb. 24 awards ceremony. Four of the titles in question feature a child in some kind of horrific danger — whether it involves kidnapping, murder, accidental death or racial violence. Emotional manipulation is nothing new to cinema, but it can be particularly repellent if a film’s story feels pointless. And sadly, some of this year’s live-action nominees — which range from a drama about the real-life 1993 murder of the Liverpool toddler James Bulger (“Detainment”) to a stylized thriller about two boys stuck in quicksand (“Fauve”) — may seem cheap in that regard, with ghastly images and scenarios that appear designed to make us feel like we’ve seen something important and meaningful, without delivering on either import or meaning. By contrast, the one live-action short that doesn’t cavalierly put children in jeopardy, Marianne Farley’s “Marguerite,” a drama about an older woman who learns that her caretaker is a lesbian and has a surge of memories about thwarted love, feels like a reprieve. The animated shorts offer an even stronger corrective. These pictures can have a formal advantage over their live-action counterparts: Animated characters’ ability to move quickly and express clearer emotions allows filmmakers to pack more elaborate stories into shorter running times. Several of these efforts are able to focus on children’s emotional lives without turning them into opportunistic plot devices. To wit: Andrew Chesworth and Bobby Pontillas’s “One Small Step” portrays a young woman’s dreams of going to space and tells a complex, tender story in seven quick minutes. Trevor Jimenez’s surreal “Weekends” follows a young boy as he moves between his father’s busy, big-city apartment to his mom’s modest rural home. Then there’s Domee Shi’s Pixar short “Bao,” (which also screened theatrically before “Incredibles 2” last summer) about a woman whose charming vision of raising a steamed dumpling as if it were her child turns out to be a moving metaphor for an emotional impasse with her real son. [Fill out your Oscar ballot here.] Documentary shorts, meanwhile, also provide their share of sad tales, but here, engaging filmmaking can temper the despair — as in Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman’s intimate “End Game,” which looks at doctors and patients at two end-of-life facilities in San Francisco, and Skye Fitzgerald’s immersive “Lifeboat,” which follows volunteers trying to save refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean in small, fragile vessels. But perhaps the most disturbing film in this category is the shortest. Marshall Curry’s seven-minute-long “A Night at the Garden” presents moments from a 1939 Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden in which 20,000 people came together to hear speeches extolling Hitler and warning of a Jewish menace. In the current climate of intolerance, this footage is especially chilling. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.

2019,‘The Border’ Is a Stunning and Timely Conclusion to Don Winslow’s Drug-War Trilogy,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Of all the blows delivered by Don Winslow’s Cartel trilogy, none may be as devastating as the timing of “The Border,” its stunner of a conclusion. Though Winslow cannot have engineered all of this 14 years ago when he started this series, his sweeping new novel concerns subjects that put it right on the culture’s front burner: the Mexican-American border, the handling of migrant children, the opioid crisis and some barely fictionalized claims about how foreign money has bought influence at the highest level of the U.S. government. The book’s title, “The Border,” refers to both physical and moral barriers. Winslow is well aware that both that and its cover image, which depicts a razor-wire-topped wall spreading across a desert landscape, are politically loaded. “Loaded phrases, like loaded guns, are more interesting, aren’t they?” Winslow said to Entertainment Weekly in September. As for the book’s depiction of fiercely partisan American politics, including its treatment of characters who are unmistakable versions of the current president and his son-in-law: “I know this book is going to make some people angry. I can live with that.” Even though the first installment of this trilogy was named “The Power of the Dog,” after a biblical intimation of evil (“Deliver my soul from the sword; my love from the power of the dog,” Psalms 22:20), it only hinted at the magnitude and ferocity of what was to come. That opening novel now looks like the series’ relatively innocent prologue — and it is as blade-sharp, violent, pulse-quickening and reportorially shocking as the pinnacle of some lesser series might be. “The Power of the Dog” is, in brief, about the first decades that bind the destinies of Art Keller, a Vietnam veteran and later D.E.A. agent, and Adán Barrera, a young Mexican who will go on to achieve the most dizzying heights of power. The book begins in a burning Mexican poppy field in 1975 (“Only in hell, Art Keller thinks, do flowers bloom fire”) and leaves Keller among more poppies in 2004. Many unspeakable acts happen in between, melding the personal with the political (Iran-contra). It is all rendered unputdownable by Winslow’s unrivaled skill at his game. The second book, “The Cartel” (2015), remains the heart of this series, and not only because of its central chronological position. It cements the ambition and the “Godfather” caliber of this whole multigenerational undertaking, and finds the major figures at their most fully formed. Some of it takes place, as we now learn with hindsight, in what were practically idyllic times for the Sinaloa cartel, a real-life cartel run by the fictional Barrera, regardless of his situation vis-à-vis imprisonment. Inside or out, he called the shots — and shots were the most merciful form of punishment meted out to this group’s vicious enemies. As the Sinaloa operation devolved into monstrous war with rivals, counting journalists among its many casualties, mere brutality became a distant memory. A surprising array of characters from the earlier books reappears in “The Border.” One of them is a young boy who, in “The Cartel,” was seen kicking around a very bizarre soccer ball (an image readers of that book will never forget, no matter how hard they try). Keller and his new wife, Marisol Cisneros, the onetime mayor of Juarez, decide to try to help him. It is 2012 when “The Border” starts, smoke still rising from the colossal battle that dethroned Barrera for good. A major plot point is the internecine horror that descends after the kingpin’s demise. The fight for succession lasts through the entire length of the novel. Winslow means to journey deep into a new kind of hell this time, and to suggest that his readers recognize the sensation. This is a book for dark, rudderless times, an immersion into fear and chaos. It conjures more lawlessness, dishonesty, conniving, brutality and power mania than both of the earlier books put together. Because of that chaos, it might have benefited from an indexed cast of characters. But Winslow can’t provide one. For one thing, it would be a spoiler. You just have to watch these miscreants as they drop. The Barrera heirs, would-be successors and arriviste rivals — a whole indulgent younger generation named Los Hijos, characterized by wretched excess and suicidal stupidity — make for countless shifting allegiances, fake names, dispensable henchmen and other complications. Along with the battle to succeed Barrera, the plot involves Keller’s becoming head of the D.E.A. despite his strong distrust of the federal government and its approach to solving America’s drug problems. In order to do that, Keller sets himself up as a kind of independent investigator, which has a current resonance, too. The book makes Winslow’s clear case for why everything we’re told about Mexican drug imports is wrong: why New York is so vital to the country’s illegal-drug distribution, and even production; how Wall Street money and drug money are intertwined; and how money laundering intersects with businesses like real estate. Enter Jason Lerner, a very Jared Kushner-like character, and his father-in-law, John Dennison. Dennison has Donald Trump’s history, speaks Trump’s own words and has a name that combines two sobriquets (John Barron and David Dennison) that Trump once used while pretending to be his own spokesman. Winslow describes sting operations with immersive, heart-grabbing intensity. You don’t read these books; you live in them. You come to learn all about what it means for a good cop to go undercover as a bad one; for a black ex-con to be coaxed into the world of high-stakes New York drug dealing because he can reach a market Mexicans can’t; for a Staten Island addict to fall helpless prey to the drug trade’s latest bright idea (a near-lethal burst of fentanyl added to the usual heroin). Each story is personal. But each has huge ramifications in Winslow’s larger scheme. The single most wrenching subplot involves a 10-year-old Guatemalan boy whose life is all but over, thanks to a system of graft that makes prostitutes out of women and thugs out of men. The boy is not described cheerlessly; Winslow doesn’t write in that register. The child is amazingly hardy. But the book shows the single day, the single stroke of fate, that may determine his entire future if the systemic corruption that pervades “The Border” has its way. About making prostitutes out of women: Let’s just say that Winslow didn’t invent the horrors of the drug world, and assume he’s presenting a version of what he’s seen and heard about them. The words used around gender and race in this book are frequently ugly, and in these times that calls for a warning. Last and never least with Winslow: the matter of languages. He is fluent in many of them, and “The Border” once again shows off those talents. There’s slang, of course. Why have a snitch sing when he can be “doing his best Freddie Mercury imitation for D.E.A. right now”? There is cop. There is politician, hit man, high roller. There is psycho — always a favorite, and always handy in the circles in which these books have traveled. “We’re soul mates,” one character says to another. “In the sense that neither of us has one.” The border ends with another idea about the soul. “There is no wall that divides the human soul between its best impulses and its worst.” Two classic trilogies, “The Godfather” and now this one, are built upon it.",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind’ Review: Saving a Village, Using Books and Brains","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,” the directing debut of the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, is so worthy, so earnest and so achingly sincere that it’s almost painful to criticize. Yet even if you know nothing of its real-life hero, the Malawian engineer William Kamkwamba (whose 2009 memoir was the basis for this dramatization), you will know exactly where this well-intentioned tale is going: it’s right there in the title. We’re introduced to 13-year-old William (the delightful Maxwell Simba) in 2001, in his village in rural Malawi where lengthening cycles of drought and heavy rains are making harvests increasingly precarious. His parents, Trywell (Ejiofor, terrific as always) and Agnes (an affecting Aïssa Maïga), are determined to give their children an education. But when they’re unable to pay William’s school tuition, the boy — whose aptitude for fixing small appliances is already evident — takes to the library to teach himself. It’s not long before he’s fending off famine by repurposing scrap metal and bicycle parts into an ingenious irrigation system. Though hobbled by an obviousness that dampens any suspense, this sensitive, environmentally concerned movie is most successful when steeped in the particularities of its location. Corrupt politicians and predatory corporations use climate anxiety and falling grain prices as levers to further their own agendas. And as food supplies dwindle and Trywell’s neighbors succumb to buyouts and looters, the movie pulls inward, focusing its tug between tradition and modernity in Trywell’s resistance to his son’s fantastical-seeming plan. Challenging the story’s tonal monotony, Dick Pope’s cinematography is clean and unshowy, highlighting faces slowly sinking from hunger and fields turning all too quickly to dust. William’s experiment might end happily, but the suffering it alleviated is unlikely to do the same.

2019,"‘The Breaker Upperers’ Review: Calling It Off, With an Assist","Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The New Zealand comedy “The Breaker Upperers” adds some welcome irreverence to the homogenized mix of Netflix comedies. This collaboration between Jackie van Beek and Madeleine Sami — who wrote, directed and star together — exhibits their fairly irresistible comic chemistry, even if the conceit of the movie wears a bit thin. Their characters, Jen (Van Beek) and Mel (Sami), operate an agency that helps clients too wimpy or sneaky to end their own relationships. Each case requires its own form of deception. The two are introduced posing as police officers who tell a woman (Celia Pacquola) that her husband — who is about to flee to Rio — has disappeared. This is not an airtight line of work; for starters, as the movie acknowledges, it relies on Jen and Mel’s never running into anyone they deceive. But the business does supply Sami and Van Beek with a steady stream of gags until it becomes clear that the film’s real subject is their friendship. Mel has too much empathy to be a good liar, while Jen has grown wistful over the rocky end of one of her own past relationships. A cloud of mawkishness looms, though it never quite overshadows the rest. Also funny is James Rolleston, who dryly steals scenes as a 17-year-old rugby player who seeks out Jen and Mel’s services. Not only is he probably too young to be experiencing such a baggage-laden breakup, but he is also, amusingly, not the sharpest tool in the shed. That said, it’s possible the jokes about his bossy Maori girlfriend (Ana Scotney) play well in New Zealand. Here, they lean too heavily on stereotyping to land.

2019,‘The Changeover’ Review: Stranger Danger,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Changeover” is, as its title suggests, the story of a transformation. Based on the 1984 young-adult novel by Margaret Mahy, this chilly little tale of a supernatural romance between a spunky teenage girl and a mysteriously pouty boy has, post-“Twilight,” become a cultural cliché. Yet, thanks to fine performances and a narrative that doesn’t hang about to admire itself, the movie goes down as easily as a love potion at a coven. Set in Christchurch, New Zealand, a city still haunted by memories of the 2011 earthquake, the story centers on 16-year-old Laura (a fantastic Erana James), who lives with her overstressed mother (Melanie Lynskey) and little brother, Jacko (Benji Purchase). After Laura begins to receive psychic warnings that Jacko may be in danger, a strange old man (played by a deliciously unnerving Timothy Spall) develops an intense interest in the boy. At the same time, Laura is increasingly drawn to the glum, glamorously named Sorensen (Nicholas Galitzine), a stunner usually spied brooding on the fringes of school gatherings. Sorensen might be of dubious utility, but his mother and grandmother — well, they’re something else entirely. Creating a world where men are mostly absent or suspect and women must work to save themselves, Stuart McKenzie’s thin but serviceable screenplay (he also directed with Miranda Harcourt) smartly favors human drama over hocus-pocus. The paranormal showdown is fuzzy at best, but the pacing rocks and Spall radiates such ingratiating evil that he needs no help from special effects. When, in one creepily insinuating moment, he steers a possessed Laura toward her bedroom to “have some fun,” the kick of dread we feel is not from the occult, but from a peril that’s all too rooted in the everyday.

2019,‘The Competition’ Review: Vying for a Slot in an Elite Film School,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. La Fémis is an unusual film school: The establishment, in Paris, has no professors and no classes as such. Instead, students work with a variety of French film professionals in specific disciplines to learn by doing. Thousands of students apply every year. Claire Simon’s documentary “The Competition” shows the process by which 40 students, the limit in the term depicted here, are accepted to La Fémis — which is an acronym for the Fondation Européenne pour les Métiers de L’image et du Son (the European Foundation for the Image and Sound Professions). If you think you might be allergic to a film about a film school, I’ll level with you: This contains enough of the expected (for instance, a near-parade of young white would-be directors explicating their visions) that you wouldn’t be entirely wrong to give this a pass. But “The Competition,” after showing the process of submitting applications and sitting in assemblies (Simon risks replicating the tedium she’s portraying here) is in many ways juicy well beyond one’s expectations. I teach film, and this movie gave me some bracing lessons. I gasped at the way some of the admissions examiners slouched in front of applicants. (Resolved: Be more vigilant about posture in class.) And I almost gagged when another examiner remarked to colleagues, with contemptuous levity, that her group’s admissions ought to include “an Asian, a black and an Arab.” Almost comedic is a sequence near the end where a large panel of examiners argue over which (if any) applicants are trying to put one over on them. France invented deconstruction, I know, but the discourse here, in the pursuit of bad faith that I didn’t see in any of the would-be students we’ve seen interview, goes above and beyond reason. Writing about this film when it was shown under a different English title, the critic Richard Brody has averred it shows why innovation in French film has (by his lights) all but dried up. The movie’s most provocative aspect is its near-methodical portrayal of hive-mind thinking pursued as a kind of norm — not just by the examiners, but the hopeful applicants.

2019,‘The Favourite’ and ‘Roma’ Sweep the Baftas,"LONDON — “The Favourite,” a dark comedy about a love triangle involving Queen Anne in 18th-century Britain, was the big winner of the EE British Academy Film Awards on Sunday in London, with seven awards. Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” took home four — including the two most coveted, best film and best director — at the British equivalent of the Oscars. During an acceptance speech, Cuarón said the success of “Roma,” a film about an indigenous domestic worker in Mexico, meant the world to him, especially “in an age when fear and anger propose to divide us.” The “Favourite” had been tipped to win big. It gained 12 nominations in January, five more than any other film and received rave reviews in Britain. While it didn’t quite meet those expectations, Olivia Colman won the award for best actress as Queen Anne, repeating her success at last month’s Golden Globes, and Rachel Weisz won best supporting actress for her performance as one of the queen’s advisers and lovers. “We’re going to get so pissed later,” said Colman upon accepting her award, a British reference to getting drunk. She added that all three of the film’s actresses, including Emma Stone, should share her best actress title. “We can scratch in some other names.” [Read our critic’s review of “The Favourite.”] Letitia Wright, a star of “Black Panther,” won the rising award for young talent, which is decided by the British public. She had depression and considered giving up acting, she said during her speech. “Anybody that’s going through a tough time, God made you and you’re important,” she added. Rami Malek won best actor for his role as Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” while Mahershala Ali won best supporting actor for his role as an erudite pianist in “Green Book,” a road movie about race relations, set in 1962. Both won such awards at the Golden Globes, too. The Baftas, awarded two days before voting begins for the Oscars, are often considered a bellwether for the Academy Awards. “The Favourite” has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards, tying with “Roma” and setting up another showdown at that event on Feb. 24. The Baftas lacked the seriousness of last year’s ceremony, when actresses wore black and Time’s Up pins to protest sexual harassment. The event on Sunday was lighthearted, with political commentary limited to a couple of asides about Britain’s impending exit from the European Union. Andy Serkis, handing out an award for best music, said a film without music was like “Britain without Europe.” The run-up to this year’s Baftas was fraught. Last week, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which hosts the awards, removed the director Bryan Singer from its nominations because of allegations of sexual misconduct, including molesting a 13-year-old boy. “Bafta considers the alleged behavior completely unacceptable and incompatible with its values,” it said in a statement. Singer, who has denied the allegations, made no comment on Bafta’s decision, his publicist, Howard Bragman, said in an email on Friday. Singer was part of the team involved in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the biopic of rock band Queen that was nominated for outstanding British film. He is listed as the film’s sole director due to union regulations, despite having been fired before it was finished. In the end, “The Favourite” won that category. “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which received six other nominations, also won for best sound in addition to Malek’s award.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Gospel of Eureka’ Review: Christianity and Queerness Intersect in a Small Town,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Gospel of Eureka” is only 75 minutes long, yet feels much longer. That’s partly because this cheery documentary — about the uneasy alignment of L.G.B.T. life and avid Christianity in the town of Eureka Springs, Ark. — refuses to grapple with its glaring contradictions. Mostly, though, it’s because of the inordinate amount of screen time surrendered to a tiresome Passion play extravaganza. Watching people watch a stage is just lazy filmmaking, no matter how many donkeys, doves and bleating goats enliven the spectacle. Cutting repeatedly between the play and a rowdy drag show at a thriving gay bar, the directors Michael Palmieri and Donal Mosher underscore the parallels in the pageantry. The exuberant drag artists applying their war paint share common showbiz purpose with the actor playing Jesus, smearing himself with fake blood (“It’s edible!”) and proudly displaying the prop room’s selection of whips. Like his queer counterparts across town, his lip-syncing is flawless. Buffing difference into sameness is the movie’s modus operandi. Helped by a homespun narration and good-natured interviews, the filmmakers lock down a “no rancor here” tone that vigorously asserts itself at every turn. Discord over an anti-discrimination ordinance simmers quietly in the background, and a resident recalls his mother explaining his father’s late-life coming-out as submission to “a sexual disease,” but nothing is permitted to rankle the optimism. A truck driver grumping about permissiveness appears like a humorous aside, and an archive clip of a protester smashing a pie into the face of the anti-gay activist Anita Bryant transforms intolerance into slapstick. Favoring the superficial over the substantive, “The Gospel of Eureka” keeps skirting opportunities to excavate experience — like, say, prodding longtime gay residents about how the town navigated the AIDS crisis. It’s an odd duck on a Bible Belt pond: serene on the surface, but churning underneath.

2019,‘The Height of the Storm’ Is Heading to Broadway,"“The Height of the Storm,” by the French playwright Florian Zeller, is headed for Broadway, the Manhattan Theater Club announced Wednesday. The play, which ended a successful run in London last month, is moving to the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in September. It centers on a couple who, after 50 years of marriage, struggle to cope with change and uncertainty. The actors Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, who starred in the London production, will reprise their roles as husband and wife. Jonathan Kent (“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”) will direct. Mr. Zeller made his Broadway debut in 2016 with “The Father,” for which Frank Langella won a Tony Award for best actor. Another work of his, “The Mother,” starring Isabelle Huppert, is to begin performances Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Feb. 20. The world premiere of “The New Englanders” by Jeff Augustin (“Little Children Dream of God”), about a mixed-race family searching for happiness in a quiet New England town, will follow, in an Off Broadway run at City Center Stage II, also as part of Manhattan Theater Club’s new season. A third production, “Poor Yella Rednecks” by Qui Nguyen, is to debut next spring. Jointly developed and produced by Manhattan Theater Club and South Coast Repertory, the play is the second of Mr. Nguyen’s autobiographical trilogy that began with “Vietgone.” The story, told from the perspective of a mother, follows members of an immigrant family from Vietnam as they try to cement themselves in Arkansas. May Adrales, who worked with Mr. Nguyen on “Vietgone,” will direct. Manhattan Theater Club will announce five additional plays for the 2019-2020 season in the coming weeks.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Hole in the Ground’ Review: A Horror Film Is Suffocated by a Mother’s Love,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The frustrating horror film “The Hole in the Ground” opens with Sarah (Seána Kerslake) driving her elementary-school-age son, Chris (James Quinn Markey), to a secluded home in the Irish countryside. She hopes the move can provide a new beginning after her relationship with Chris’s abusive father. But her son struggles to adjust. He fights with Sarah, and runs deep into the woods at the edge of their home. When Sarah follows him, she finds a massive, roiling pit that sucks up dirt like quicksand. It powerfully draws the eye — perhaps it could suck up people, too. Soon, Sarah notices changes in Chris. He disappears from his bed at night; he buries beloved toys in the woods. Chris is rarely less than polite, but Sarah begins to suspect her child is not the boy he once was. Though he looks the same, even his declarations of love seem eerily hollow. In Sarah’s dreams, Chris attacks her. “The Hole in the Ground” has memorable images — the bottomless pit, a child’s hand warped and extended in creepy imitation of the spiders that once terrified him. But the visuals serve an emotional world that feels false. Horror films can elicit terror by reminding viewers of frustrations they ignore in normal life. But Sarah approaches every uneaten dinner, school performance and petty fight with the same kindly forbearance. The director, Lee Cronin, perhaps hoped to ingratiate his characters to the audience by presenting them as immaculate. But Sarah’s maternal love is too perfect, in the manner of a deity rather than a woman. In a film where the central horror is the otherworldly absence of personality, the intended fear is undermined by the presence of a mother and son whose flawlessness is itself unnerving.

2019,‘The Hooligans Were the Club’,"The near-collapse of the Polish soccer team Wisla Krakow involved hooligan owners, unpaid bills, police raids and a mysterious savior with promises but no money. Can one of Poland’s greatest players save the day? Jakub Blaszczykowski warming up with Wisla Krakow before a game last month. He has returned to his roots to, in effect, save the club.CreditCreditMaciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times MYSLENICE, Poland — The dark, uneven soil at Wisla Krakow’s training facility in this village 40 minutes south of Poland’s second largest city was frozen solid last month as a few hundred supporters trudged through the snow to greet Jakub Blaszczykowski. Blaszczykowski, a 33-year-old midfielder, has played in some of soccer’s biggest matches, including the 2013 Champions League final as a member of Borussia Dortmund, two European championships, and a World Cup with Poland’s national team. But on this January afternoon, Blaszczykowski was a long way from those moments. Instead, he was about to play his first exhibition game since rejoining Wisla Krakow, one of Poland’s most decorated teams. Wisla is the club Blaszczykowski made his name with, and the team he had promised to someday return to when he signed with Dortmund in 2007. He was not returning to ease into retirement, though, or for a final payday. In fact, the opposite was true: Blaszczykowski, known as Kuba, had come home in an unusual deal in which he agreed to take virtually no money to play and to join with two Polish investors to lend the club 1.33 million zloty (about $350,000) to cover his new teammates’ unpaid wages. The Wisla Krakow he rejoined, he knew, was in dire straits, its proud history besmirched after a series of disastrous events involving a hooligan takeover, missing money and a mysterious foreign investor who offered himself as a savior, collected the club’s ownership certificates and then — without producing even a single zloty — disappeared. Wisla Krakow’s problems were years in the making. But they started to accelerate in 2016, when the team’s longtime owner, Boguslaw Cupial, decided to sell the club. Cupial had been one of Poland’s postcommunist success stories, earning millions through his cable company, Tele-Fonika. In 1997, he invested some of his fortune in Wisla, transforming the club into an eight-time league champion under his stewardship. But Cupial took a big hit in the 2008 global financial crisis and in 2016 sold the money-losing club to a local buyer. That buyer promptly flipped the club to TS Wisla, a supporter-friendly umbrella organization that already controlled Wisla Krakow’s other sports teams. The businessman, it turned out, had no money, said Michal Trela, a reporter for Przeglad Sportowy, a Polish sports daily. “After one month,” Trela said, “the supporters bought the club back for 1 zloty” — around 25 cents. In an age of superrich foreign owners in soccer, a sale that actually gave fans a say in the running of their club should have been refreshing. But at Wisla, the purchase appeared to hand control to a group of soccer hooligans called the Sharks. “Almost every club in Poland has a problem with hooligans,” said Szymon Jadczak, an investigative reporter for the Polish television network TVN. “But in Wisla, the hooligans were the club.” The Sharks have a loud, intimidating presence at Wisla’s stadium and in 2015 a group of them made headlines when they were photographed giving the Nazi salute while in Rome to watch Roma play Lazio. Now they were calling the shots at Wisla Krakow, under the leadership of Pawel Michalski, who had served more than six years in prison for throwing a knife from the stands at an Italian player during a UEFA Cup match. Through TS Wisla, Michalski was able to ensure that two people with close connections to the Sharks were put in charge of the club, and contracts for everything from cleaning the stadium to printing the match-day programs were signed with friends and associates at what were viewed as inflated rates. The club, Jadczak said, became a “sort of cash machine” for people connected to the Sharks’ leadership. When questions were raised, the Wisla president installed after the Sharks’ takeover, Marzena Sarapata, held a news conference to dismiss the claims that the hooligan group effectively controlled the club. But a few months later, an arrest warrant was issued for Michalski, whom the police charged with heading a criminal group and with having involvement in the drug trade. Shortly afterward, Poland’s Central Bureau of Investigation undertook a series of raids in which they arrested dozens of hooligans. Michalski left Poland. Jadczak’s televised investigation about the takeover and mismanagement at Wisla — broadcast by TVN in September — was the last straw; the club’s top officials resigned, and the city of Krakow persuaded Poland’s soccer authorities to send any money owed to the club to the city instead, to cover unpaid rent at a city-owned stadium. Michalski was eventually arrested in Italy; he will stand trial later this year. Sarapata did not respond to phone calls or messages from The New York Times but did give an interview to a website owned by the same Polish betting company that sponsors Wisla and denied all the allegations. Meanwhile, the video clips of hooligans being arrested and of searches at TS Wisla’s headquarters made finding a new investor for the club difficult. And the unpaid players merely fell into line with the other debtors. Wisla needed a savior. In December, it thought it had found one. A French-Cambodian businessman named Vanna Ly, who claimed to have extensive investments in soccer clubs around the world, announced he would be purchasing 60 percent of Wisla Krakow. The rest would be owned by Noble Capital Partners, a British investment firm represented by a Swedish businessman, Mats Hartling. The deal was reported to be for 12 million zloty ($3.2 million). Ly arrived in Krakow to watch a game and began to meet people connected to the club. Invariably, they knew little about him beyond his name and his promise to invest. “I met Vanna Ly, he’s real, he exists,” said Rafal Wislocki, one of the few team officials untainted by association with the Sharks. “He has ID. I saw this ID. French ID.” Ly, Wislocki and other club officials took in a 1-0 league defeat against Lech Poznan on Dec. 21. It was the last game before the winter break, and Wisla Krakow, despite the crisis, sat a creditable eighth in the 16-team Polish league. Ly made clear that he was not impressed with the standard of play, Wislocki said, but at least sounded as if he knew how to run a soccer club. “He knew the answer when I asked difficult questions,” Wislocki said. The purchase contract was signed, though in hindsight, team officials said, even then something was awry: Despite claiming to control millions of dollars, Ly arrived in Krakow on a budget airline, and when he was spotted leaving Krakow’s city hall after a meeting, he attempted to hide from reporters under a black umbrella. The bulk of the money to pay off the team’s debts was due a few days later, but it never arrived. At first, Ly told Wisla officials that his phone had been stolen, preventing him from sending the cash. Later, they were told that Ly had had a heart attack on his private jet as it flew to New York. Ly was never heard from again. Despite repeated attempts by The Times to contact him by email and by phone, he did not respond. After initially hanging up the phone, Hartling emailed a one-line reply: “Ly is a criminal who will be pursued accordingly.” Asked about Ly in a text message, Adam Pietrowski, the player agent who had brought Hartling to Wisla and was briefly club president, replied with an emoji: a sad face with a Pinocchio nose. By then, Wisla Krakow had bigger problems than a missing investor. European soccer’s midseason transfer window would open Jan. 1, and with the club’s license to play suspended because of its grim financial state, and with its unpaid players likely to depart, Wisla had only a few weeks to stabilize its affairs. Wislocki, who had successfully run the team’s youth academy, was appointed club president. Blaszczykowski, out of favor at his German club, Wolfsburg, suggested he would consider a return. In January, he and the two investors he had joined forces with delivered a vital infusion of cash to cover the team’s back wages. Still, he delayed his full commitment to play until the restoration of Wisla’s license was assured. In the end, Wisla sold eight members of its squad in January, but the payment from Blaszczykowski, as well as the promise of playing alongside a player revered in Poland, stemmed the hemorrhaging of talent. “Kuba gives us belief that we can make this club great again,” Wislocki said. A few days after his first exhibition match, Blaszczykowski trotted onto the freezing field in Myslenice again as a large crowd sung his name. If anything, it was even colder. Again Wisla lost, again by 3-2, and again a crowd gathered by the entrance to the training ground in hopes of taking a photograph with Kuba. As the second half of that game began, word arrived that Wisla’s most urgent crisis was over: The league had restored the team’s license, allowing it to sell tickets to its remaining games. Wislocki announced that the club was selling 5 percent of its shares to fans; in less than 24 hours, the offer raised 4 million zloty (a little more than $1 million). Blaszczykowski eventually signed his contract, although league rules prevented him from playing for free. Instead, he’ll donate his 500 zloty minimum wage ($130) to a local children’s home. And he finally made his league debut in a 2-0 defeat against Gornik Zabrze last week. A new owner still needs to be found — without one, said Trela, the journalist, “it will be impossible to get a new license for next season” — but Wisla is breathing a little easier. Its coach, the former Poland international Maciej Stolarczyk, who took the job last summer, has known only chaos and financial crisis at the club. He, too, had met Ly, whose bold promises, he said, had been magnified by the Polish news media. “They said we will be another Manchester City in Poland!” Stolarczyk said, laughing. “But I want to say the team didn’t believe everything they were told.” His only concern now is the second half of the season. Having one of Poland’s best players is a bonus, he said, but he is acutely aware of the weight that Blaszczykowski carries. “Everyone will be looking at him, everyone will be talking about him, and also all the rivals will try to stop him,” Stolarczyk said. “So our task is to try and protect him.” Long after the final whistle of his first game back, Blaszczykowski did not seem to need protection. He was standing stone-faced as he signed every shirt that was handed to him and posed for every selfie. He was why parents had brought their children out in the biting cold to press against the fence, to squint into the low winter sun. He was why Wisla fans had hope again. “We love Kuba,” one man said. “Kuba is our hero.”",The New York Times
2019,‘The Iron Orchard’ Review: Black Gold and Blackhearted Men,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At a time when the despoliation of our planet is very much on people’s minds, the wildcatters of “The Iron Orchard” hardly feel like heroes. Seemingly nostalgic for a period when West Texas roughnecks settled scores with baseball bats and laid pipe with pickaxes, this lovingly made homage to avarice feels strangely limp. Instead of gushing, it trickles. Spanning the late 1930s to late 1950s, the story follows Jim McNeely (a flavorless Lane Garrison), from penniless store clerk to amoral oil tycoon. Toughened up by caricature bullies at his first oil-company job, he saves his salary, steals a co-worker’s wife (Ali Cobrin) and heads west to seek his fortune. As his hats and wallet swell, so does his gut, and flashbacks to his hometown honey in Fort Worth (Hassie Harrison) prepare us for romantic strife to come. Were he not such an arrogant jerk, we might even care when, en route to an ending much kinder than he deserves, challenges like swamp gas and a friend’s suicide temporarily slow his roll. In this adaptation of Edmund Pendleton Van Zandt, Jr.’s 1966 novel of the same name, the director, Ty Roberts, slaves over the visuals to the clear detriment of everything else. The dialogue (by Roberts and Gerry De Leon) is dire, the drama negligible and McNeely has more chemistry with his rigs and immaculate vintage cars than with either of his women. That leaves us with Mathieu Plainfossé’s rich cinematography, and sometimes it’s enough: His windblown plains and steely skies, throbbing sunsets and soaring derricks have a resonance and nobility that McNeely’s sorry struggles will never possess.

2019,‘The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part’ Review: Everything Is Not Awesome. Everything Is an Ad.,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The new animated Lego movie is pretty much like the last one. Or maybe I’m thinking of another one, not that it much matters. There are differences between editions, most fairly negligible. The unifying factor, to note the obvious about the state of big-screen children’s entertainment, is that they are all feature-length commercials. The “Transformers” series helped pave the way for Legos by flipping the old idea that movies (like “Star Wars”) were the creative source for the licensed merch, the lunchboxes and action figures. Now, toys, board games and so on are sometimes the originating point. This isn’t news; I know it, you know it. But it seems worth repeating again and ad infinitum, especially given that “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” isn’t as distractingly fun, shiny and bright as the more satisfying franchise installments. It drags and sometimes bores, which makes it easier for your mind to drift elsewhere, to thoughts of family, deadlines, chores, the creative impoverishment of the big studios and the casual, fundamentally corrupt commercial exploitation of the child audience. Put differently, what distinguishes this from the better Lego movies is that they’re good commercials. The new one was written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the franchise’s brain trust, and directed by Mike Mitchell, whose credits include “Trolls,” another toy-based feature. “The Lego Movie 2” mostly takes place in Bricksburg, the happy town where once upon a time in the buoyant 2014 movie, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an upbeat dude in an orange vest, triumphed to become a heroic master builder. Five years later, life in Bricksburg has turned into a George Miller-esque dystopian hellscape. Emmet still looks on the sunny side, but everyone else, including his pal, Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), looks like Lilliputian refugees in their own decrepit and sand-swept “Mad Max.” That sounds more promising than what transpires in the movie, a busy, noisy clutter of action sequences, pop-cultural allusions, life lessons and cute critters. The clever if rather cynical, self-reflexive back story involves live-action scenes of a bickering big brother and little sister who, unbeknown to Bricksburg, are the true master builders. The children’s disharmony makes trouble in their play world, draining it of color and optimism; in other words, everything is not awesome, to borrow the franchise’s insanely catchy theme song. There’s a tidy message here: Be nice to your kid sister, which is supernice advice especially because the movie was produced, directed and written almost entirely by men. The exception is the animation director, Trisha Gum, who worked with Mitchell on the movie’s look and feel, which is by turns immersive and wittily distancing, as when the Bricksburg story is interrupted by a shot of a toy dangling from a string. One pleasure of the Lego movies is how they personalize generic plastic bricks, creating a sense of life by combining scratches and other signs of the human hand — as if a child had used and reused these toys — with distinct, caricatured voices. Will Arnett’s demented take on Batman remains the standout, and it’s disappointing that he isn’t given more to do. In line with the live-action siblings, the under-inspired Emmet and Lucy drive the Bricksburg part. Much of the story involves an eerily smiley alien land (shades of Camazotz in “A Wrinkle in Time”) where Batman is to marry the polymorphous queen (Tiffany Haddish). Every so often, the kids and their mom (Maya Rudolph) pop up in the live-action scenes, and their family dissonance creates chaos and intimations of doom in Bricksburg until it doesn’t. The moral is that we should play nice, but also buy truckloads of Legos. In this respect, this sales pitch fits in with something that Walt Disney, a marketing genius, once said about his company not catering “to the child but to the child in the adult.” He was talking about his films’ viewers, who also happened to be the folks destined to foot the toy bill.

2019,"‘The Lego Movie 2’ Tops Box Office, but Falls Short of Expectations","The news out of Bricksburg this weekend was both good and bad. First, the good: “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” Warner Bros.’s latest story about animated Lego bricks and set in a plastic metropolis, topped the domestic box office. It sold about $35 million in tickets. The bad news: That figure is just about half of the $69.1 million its predecessor made nationwide during its opening weekend in 2014, according to Box Office Mojo, and considerably less than what most analysts expected. The sequel was written by the duo behind the “The Lego Movie,” Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, but this time directing duties were taken by Mike Mitchell (“The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”). In the sequel, Chris Pratt lends his vocal cords to the ever-optimistic hero Emmet alongside Elizabeth Banks (his companion Lucy), Will Arnett (an absurd Batman) and an ensemble that includes Tiffany Haddish, Maya Rudolph and Jason Momoa, who voiced a brick version of his box office titan, Aquaman. The movie brought in an additional $18.1 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio. Reviews have been generally favorable (with an 84% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes). But after an extremely weak Super Bowl weekend for ticket sales and a fairly quiet January, “The Lego Movie 2” failed to give the box office the boost it needed. [Read our critic’s review of “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.”] Coming in second was another debut: Paramount’s “What Men Want,” a comedy starring Taraji P. Henson that sold $19 million in tickets this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Henson plays an Atlanta sports agent who gains the power to hear men’s thoughts. The movie, directed by Adam Shankman, functions as an inversion of Nancy Meyers’s “What Women Want” (2000), which starred Mel Gibson as a male reader of women’s minds. Lionsgate’s “Cold Pursuit” might have been just another brutal revenge tale had its star, Liam Neeson, not made headlines last week following an interview in which he described a personal racist revenge story. The outcry that followed resulted in the cancellation of red carpet events for the film, which stars Neeson as a Colorado snowplow driver avenging a son’s death. Still, the film met analysts’ expectations, selling around $10.8 million in tickets this weekend and landing in third place at the box office.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Lego Movie 2’: How ‘Catchy Song’ Got So Catchy,"That song got stuck inside my head. Before a recent screening of “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” a promotion for the film was playing on a loop with a snippet from its “Catchy Song.” As the chorus repeated over and over that “this song’s gonna get stuck inside your head,” I found that very thing happening on a level so maddening I had to put my headphones in and play something else, anything else, to drown it out. Mission accomplished for the comedian, actor and musician Jon Lajoie, who was asked to write a movie song that would elicit mixed feelings: “maybe 49 percent annoying and 51 percent fun to listen to,” he said. Think Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling” meets Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Good Time.” Lajoie gained popularity through comedy videos he posted on YouTube, like rap parodies, fake commercials and even a song called “The Best Song.” He had a recurring role on the FX series “The League” and now records more serious folk rock under the name Wolfie’s Just Fine. “Catchy Song” has an airy sheen thanks to production by the D.J. Dillon Francis and vocals from T-Pain and That Girl Lay Lay. In a phone interview, Lajoie talked about the difficulty of following up the first “Lego Movie” hit song, “Everything Is Awesome,” what it takes to make an earworm and why he doesn’t feel bad for parents who have to listen to it over and over again. How did you end up writing “Catchy Song?” I’d wanted to do this kind of thing for a long time. But the opportunity to write music for an animated movie is few and far between, and it usually goes to Broadway people. I didn’t know whether I’d be good at all. But I wanted to at least try. The filmmakers liked my stuff enough to let me take a crack at it. What was your objective with it? At first we were going more in the direction of a song that is supposed to drive you insane, something that sort of feels creepy and brainwashy. And so I thought about it for a while and then, one day I was showering and I start screaming, “This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo! This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo!” So I wrote an annoying version of that. But eventually the movie’s story changed and it needed to be a somewhat enjoyable song. Was it daunting to think about how to follow up “Everything Is Awesome”? Yes, there’s no way to make a more annoyingly catchy song than “Everything Is Awesome.” So we thought, let’s look at the audience and acknowledge that we know this in an impossible task, and let’s lean into the meta-ness and take it one step further. We wouldn’t necessarily have to write a catchier song, we would just say that the song is super-catchy. Did you try additional ideas before settling on this? Yes, we had a song called “All Is Amazing.” We actually recorded a version of it but never used it. It was almost the exact same thing as “Everything Is Awesome” except every lyric was tweaked just a tad and every melody tweaked just a tad. In the end, we found that it was funny in the room, but after putting it all together it wasn’t that funny. And then there was this other idea where the song would be called, “It’s Hard to Follow Up a Hit Song.” So you can see the territory we were playing around in. What music were you listening to when thinking about this? I listened to a lot of Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. Also a lot of K-pop. There’s something very specifically bubblegum there with just a teaspoon of creepy. The producer Max Martin’s theories on writing a catchy song are very eloquent. They boil down to this: find a catchy melody, keep the same amount of syllables every verse and every chorus, hit the melody at the same rhythm every time, and hammer it into the audience’s brain by repeating it over and over. I definitely took that advice. Did it take a while to get what you wanted? We’d produced so many different versions of this song and were struggling to find the right sound. I knew Dillon Francis through a friend, so we sat down with him and he took our descriptions of what we were looking for. When we heard his demo, everyone just breathed a sigh of relief. And on top of that, throw in T-Pain on that chorus, who was incredible. I had written maybe 20 different verses for that song. Then we found That Girl Lay Lay. She came in and freestyled her verses. We sat there in shock and I just threw out all the verses I worked on for a year. So this song would not be what it is without them. Do you have a technique for getting rid of an earworm? Just go listen to any Beatles song. They’re the perfect example of a band doing what pop music is supposed to do but doing it in a great way that is sustainable. Do you feel bad for parents whose kids may want to hear this on repeat? I would feel bad if I wasn’t the person who has heard and heard and heard this song for a year. There’s no way anyone’s ever going to listen to this song more than me. video",The New York Times
2019,‘The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot’ Review: Nuff Said,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot” revives an exploitation film tradition, in which a sensational title hooks viewers for a movie that’s all windup and no pitch. The writer and director, Robert D. Krzykowski, even appears to have leaned into the concept, turning false advertising into a motif. The man (Sam Elliott), hunting for the Bigfoot, drawls that his average-footed prey is “not really living up to its name.” To back up, which the flashback-heavy narrative is prone to do, Elliott plays Calvin Barr, an American veteran who, in this version of history, assassinated Hitler, an action hidden by both the United States and the Nazis. That service separated Calvin (played as a young man by Aidan Turner) from his sweetheart (Caitlin FitzGerald), leading him to a lifetime of stoic moping and loneliness, save for the company of his brother (Larry Miller) and a loyal dog. Calvin has still got it, though — before the title card, he makes short work of thugs who try to steal his car — and good thing, too, because the government needs him to track a yeti. There is something admirably perverse about a movie that treats the killings of Hitler and Bigfoot as secondary to a character study of a crusty old man and his regrets, but that doesn’t make the film less dull or deflating to watch. Douglas Trumbull, who knows from ape men from his work on “2001: A Space Odyssey,” is credited as a visual-effects consultant. It’s a shame the Bigfoot sightings are so few.

2019,‘The Monsters Are the Men’: Inside a Thriving Sex Trafficking Trade in Florida,"JUPITER, Fla. — Something was amiss at a massage parlor near one of the wealthiest barrier islands in Florida. First, a health inspector spotted several suitcases. Then she noticed an unusual stash of clothing, food and bedding. A young woman who was supposed to be a massage therapist spoke little English and seemed unusually nervous. The inspector reported her findings to the police. They would eventually learn that her suspicions were right: The women were not just employees: They were living in the day spa, sleeping on massage tables and cooking meals on hot plates in the back. Some of them had had their passports confiscated. The inspector’s suspicions prompted a sprawling investigation across four Florida counties and two states — Florida and New York — over nearly eight months, resulting in the disruption of what authorities say was a multimillion-dollar human-trafficking and prostitution operation. The sweep led to criminal charges last week against several rich, prominent men, including Robert K. Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots; John Havens, former president and chief operating officer of Citigroup; and John Childs, founder of the private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates. Beyond the lurid celebrity connection, however, lies the wretched story of women who the police believe were brought from China under false promises of new lives and legitimate spa jobs. Instead, they found themselves trapped in the austere back rooms of strip-mall brothels — trafficking victims trapped among South Florida’s rich and famous. “I don’t believe they were told they were going to work in massage parlors seven days a week, having unprotected sex with up to 1,000 men a year,” said Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County, whose office opened the investigation. “We saw them eating on hot plates in the back. There were no washing machines. They were sleeping on the massage tables.” The women were shuttled from place to place — not only to nearby parlors but also across the state, said Sheriff Snyder. Sheriff’s deputies in Orange County, Fla., became involved in the investigation when women from the state’s Treasure Coast region were traced back to the Orlando area. Sheriff Snyder said he believed at least some of the women were working to pay off debt owed for what it cost to bring them to the United States. In some cases, the women’s passports were taken away. Traffickers cycled women in and out of parlors every 10 or 20 days, Sheriff Snyder estimated. Yet making a trafficking case remains difficult, in part because the women who were victims may not want to cooperate with the police. Only one has been talking to deputies, Sheriff Snyder said. He had lined up about a dozen Mandarin interpreters, but many other women refused to speak and were let go with an offer of assistance. “I would never consider them prostitutes — it was really a rescue operation,” the sheriff said, training his anger at the men whose demand for sex kept the massage parlors in business. “The monsters are the men,” he added. In addition to arresting men ranging in age from their 30s to at least one in his 80s, the police charged several women who appeared to be overseeing the operation with racketeering, money laundering and prostitution. Sheriff Snyder said investigators, who worked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, estimated the trafficking ring to be a $20 million international operation. Men paid between $100 and $200 for sex, the sheriff said; between $2 million and $3 million has been seized in Florida, he said, including a safe stuffed with Rolex watches. State Attorney Dave Aronberg of Palm Beach County, whose office leads a human trafficking task force with the F.B.I., said trafficking foreigners to work in places like massage parlors can be more difficult to root out than trafficking, for example, American girls who are recruited in person or online. “They come from countries where the police are part of the problem, and they’re smuggled into the country,” Mr. Aronberg said. Laura Cusack, a social worker in charge of the human trafficking prevention and education program at Place of Hope, an agency for foster children and trafficking victims in Boca Raton, said foreign victims were often threatened by traffickers in their home countries. “They’re told by traffickers, ‘I’ve got people waiting for you,’” she said. When social workers urge victims like that to come forward to the police, they say, “‘No, you don’t understand. They’re trying to find my little sister back home. They’re trying to find my daughter,’” Ms. Cusack said. Mr. Havens, the former Citigroup executive, was elevated to the post in 2011 by his longtime confidant, Vikram Pandit, Citi’s chief executive. The two became friends as senior executives at Morgan Stanley before they both left in 2005 to start Old Lane Partners, a hedge fund that was acquired by Citigroup two years later for $800 million. Both resigned from Citi on the same day in 2012, after the Federal Reserve indicated Citi was not healthy enough after the financial crisis to start paying more money back to shareholders. Through a spokesman, Mr. Kraft, 77, denied engaging in illegal activity, and Mr. Childs in a statement to Bloomberg also denied the charges. That such a lucrative trafficking network existed near the ritzy enclaves of Jupiter Island, home to the likes of golfer Tiger Woods, and Palm Beach, home to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, seemed unfathomable to some of the gawkers who posed for selfies — and in some cases cracked off-color jokes — on Friday outside the Orchids of Asia massage parlor in Jupiter, the enterprise that officials said Mr. Kraft had visited. But Palm Beach was also the place where a well-connected billionaire financier from New York, Jeffrey E. Epstein, was accused a decade ago of molesting dozens of underage girls — some of them runaways or foster children who are vulnerable to sex trafficking. A federal judge ruled on Thursday that prosecutors violated the rights of Mr. Epstein’s victims by failing to inform them of a plea deal that would protect him from sex-trafficking charges. The massage-parlor investigation began farther north, in Hobe Sound, a strip of mainland in Martin County where on July 6 the health inspector reported the signs of potential trafficking at the Bridge Day Spa, according to the arrest affidavit for one of the men. Sheriff’s deputies identified the spa’s owner and another nearby property under her name. They searched online forums where users posted about sex acts performed at the massage parlors. Based on the evidence they collected, they obtained a warrant to conduct surveillance. That approach was far more labor-intensive than past investigations, in which undercover deputies would go into the parlors and arrest women for prostitution, said Sheriff Snyder, a former Republican state representative who helped write Florida’s law against human trafficking. “I made this decision that we had enough of that: Let’s go after the traffickers,” he said. “I feel, on some level, extremely dissatisfied that I can’t do more. I know that we don’t even make a dent.” In the case of the Orchids of Asia parlor in Jupiter, where services were listed for $59 for half an hour or $79 for an hour, an arrest affidavit for the women managing the spa detailed a similar investigative approach. Police officers watched men going into the spa for 30 to 45 minutes at a time. Once they left, officers followed the men, pulled them over for traffic violations and confronted them about paying for sex. That evidence led to warrants for surveillance cameras, which police secretly installed inside the massage parlors — apparently under the ruse of a possible bomb threat. All of the men arrested in Jupiter were filmed paying for manual or oral sexual stimulation, according to police. Sheriff Snyder said the sex acts his deputies recorded in Martin County included sexual intercourse. Law enforcement spent several weeks identifying the clients, and the women managing the trafficking victims, as well as tracing their finances. Police and prosecutors wrote up their criminal charges and raided the massage parlors on Tuesday. By then, however, some of the women they had identified as victims had been moved elsewhere. New women had taken their place.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Pirate Days Are Over’: Goa’s Nude Hippies Give Way to India’s Yuppies,"India Dispatch GOA — Elisabeth Ramnacher, a German who prefers to go by the name Yogini, wanted to show her employees what Goa used to look like back in its hippie days. The only trouble was, she couldn’t find a picture of herself with clothes on. When hippies traveled overland from Europe to India decades ago, Goa was often the final stop on the trail, welcoming to its beaches Westerners who wanted to drop out in a place where living was cheap, drugs plentiful and swimming nude the norm. “Goans’ attitude and openness allowed the hippie culture to thrive,” said Ms. Ramnacher, 58, who first came in the 1980s and now owns the popular Villa Blanche cafe here in Goa. But most of the original countercultural community is now gone. It has fallen victim to age, higher costs of living and the death of the hippie trail in the late 1970s, as wars closed the route. The final blow came, remnants of the community say, when the government started cracking down a decade ago on the informal businesses the hippies had set up to support themselves. Today, Goa’s renegade lifestyle attracts an entirely new type of traveler — young Indians who are flocking here not to find themselves, as the hippies once did, but to celebrate their bachelorette parties or dance atop bars. As India’s economy booms and builds a middle class that barely existed two decades ago, Goa has transformed from a laid-back enclave for bohemian Westerners to a mass tourist destination for Indians. “Goa is not Goa,” said David D’Souza, the owner of Tito’s, which started as a beach hut restaurant built by his father in 1971, and is now a throbbing open-air nightclub. “It’s India now.” Tito’s shares a street crammed with similar clubs, like Bollywood Discothèque and Cocktails and Dreams. A stroll through the neighborhood is an assault on the eyes and ears, with neon signs glaring and drug pushers sometimes shouting to sell their merchandise, trying to be heard over a cacophony of electronic music bearing down from all directions of the night sky. “Lots of Indian youngsters have made bucket loads of money, and they just want to blow it,” Mr. D’Souza said. “It’s a lot more yuppie now.” The concept of vacation is relatively new for many Indians, a product of the economic liberalization and subsequent boom over the last three decades. In a country of 1.3 billion, if just 1 percent of the population joins the middle class, that means 13 million more people with the ability to take vacations. The United Nations estimates India will produce 50 million outbound tourists by 2022, compared with eight million a decade ago. Although India’s economy has averaged about 7 percent growth every year for the last 18 years, the typical middle-income Indian family still earns much less than its Western counterpart. This has directed the tourism internally, to places like Goa. MAHARASHTRA 10 MILES Villa Blanche Bistro Anjuna Tito’s Panaji Candolim GOA Arabian Sea CHINA Chandigarh INDIA New Delhi NEPAL GUJARAT INDIA Mumbai GOA Bay of Bengal By The New York Times Annually, tourists outnumber Goa’s population of 1.5 million by five times. Jagdeep Singh, 35, from the northern city of Chandigarh, recently chatted with his brother-in-law on Goa’s main strip of beach, which was dotted with trash, umbrellas stamped with beer logos and hawkers selling beads and scarves. Both men were wearing matching black-and-white Mickey Mouse T-shirts that complemented their black turbans. They watched 18 of their family members play in the waves, half wearing the Mickey Mouse T-shirts, the rest sporting Captain America ones. “My parents weren’t from this kind of culture,” Mr. Singh said. “If they came here, they would be in full dress and would be uncomfortable because people are in bathing suits and drinking.” He credits the growth of India’s private sector for affording him vacations like this. His father, a government employee, earned a meager salary. “My family never went on vacation when I was a little boy,” he said. “My son is 2 years old and this is his second time in Goa. He’s seen more of India than my parents.” A little further down the coastline, a group of Indian men on a company retreat wore matching straw hats, chugging Budweiser beers and throwing the empty bottles toward the sea. Nearby, a family from Gujarat, a state in northern India, hopped on a banana boat, the girls in long-sleeve dresses. Although tourism has been good for the local economy, not everyone is happy about the heaving crowds. Most visitors come from the north of India, where conservative mores reign. Goans scoff at their demand for “pure veg” food — observant Hindus avoid meat — and mock their wearing of jeans to swim in the sea. They also chastise them for taking photos of women in bikinis. Goa, India’s smallest state, was a Portuguese colony until 1961, when Indian troops annexed it. Last year, Goa’s state minister for planning called north Indian tourists the “scum of the earth.” Goans describe their own lifestyle as “susegad,” from the Portuguese “sossegado,” a term conveying the chilled-out contentment that comes with living here. Residents, and long-term visitors, are worried the influx from the north could change Goa’s tolerant culture. “Goa was a place to let your hair down, to be who you want to be,” said Stafford Braganza, 45, whose family is from Goa, but who lives and works in Mumbai as the head of makeup and technique at L’Oréal, the cosmetic company. Mr. Braganza, who is gay, was sunbathing on the beach with two friends, all wearing red Speedo-like bathing suits, their chiseled chests welcoming the sun. Even though India’s Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality last year, Mr. Braganza said the presence of northern Indian tourists made him feel less free and no longer quite so “susegad.” “Goans have a special culture of acceptance,” Mr. Braganza said. “But lots of Indians are coming from everywhere now, bringing their social customs from their conservative cities. And there’s a lot of them.” He acknowledged there could be a false sense of nostalgia for the hippie days, which weren’t without tension. Because hippies would go swimming nude — illegal in India — Mr. Braganza’s mother forbade him from going to the beach when he was growing up. Ms. Ramnacher, the cafe owner, agreed that the Western hippies could sometimes go too far. “We probably overstepped our bounds,” she said. When the Anjuna market was a hippie bazaar, bartering, not money, ruled. But the hippie merchant community was mostly wiped out when the government started to regulate businesses a decade ago, expecting taxes to be paid and business licenses to be purchased. Today, there are tensions between the Goan merchants and those who have come from across India to capitalize on the tourist rush. The newer stalls sell things like cashmere, unthinkable attire in Goa’s year-round heat but common in northern India. Remnants of the original hippie market can be found, but these vendors concede their days are likely numbered. “The pirate days are over,” said Michelle Antonio, 53, a Brazilian-Italian merchant selling handicrafts, and a resident of Goa for some 25 years. “Yes, there’s been a clampdown,” he said, but he wasn’t bitter and was instead grateful for his long run here. “In our own countries, we aren’t so welcoming to foreigners,” he added. “We never would have let people live, ‘susegad,’ for this long.” An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Stafford Braganza. He is the head of makeup and technique for L’Oreal in India, not the head of education.",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Prodigy’ Review: Evil Genius, Average Horror","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “The Prodigy,” a ho-hum horror movie given a mild boost by its credible performances, a small boy named Miles (Jackson Robert Scott) begins to exhibit disturbingly supernormal intelligence. Further red flags include sleep-chatting in Hungarian, abusing his babysitter and battering a classmate with a wrench. If this isn’t evidence enough of Miles’ bad-seed credentials, he also has one brown eye and one blue — weird eyes being a dead giveaway in the evil-spawn genre. Miles might be a little devil, but it’s not the Prince of Darkness who’s messing with his head. Enter a lanky psychologist with a very particular set of skills (Colm Feore), none of which prepare him for those of his pint-size patient. Yet the movie’s occasional chills do little to obscure the thin plotting, problematic pacing and a central mystery that’s left aggravatingly vague. Jeff Buhler’s script reveals too much too soon in a moodily photographed prologue showing a crazed killer mowed down by police while his latest victim escapes with one hand fewer than when she was snatched. Directed by Nicholas McCarthy and set in a weirdly depopulated Philadelphia (played by Toronto and its environs), “The Prodigy” features the usual buzzing flies and de rigueur jump scares (the best of which is in the trailer). Taylor Schilling is perfect as Miles’s distraught mother, who catches on so slowly that she seems a little dense. And because fathers are often sidelined in movies like this, Peter Mooney’s restraint in the role, when the camera does find him, is to be heartily commended. Toying fruitlessly with themes of reincarnation and the transmigration of souls, “The Prodigy” gives the audience little to muse on except who will make it to the end credits.

2019,Opinion | ‘The Trump-Russia Story’: Cue the Stage Lights,"In this drama, the stakes are enormous. Opinion Columnist The Trump-Russia story is a drama that has unfolded in four acts. George Stephanopoulos: “Are there any ties between Mr. Trump, you or your campaign and Putin and his regime?” Paul Manafort: “No, there are not. That’s absurd.” — July 24, 2016 Donald Trump: “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world, but we’re not involved in Russia.” — July 26, 2016 Hope Hicks: “There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.” — Nov. 11, 2016 Chris Wallace asks if there were any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mike Pence: “Of course not. Why would there be?” — Jan. 15, 2017 “There were contacts,” according to a Russian official. — N.Y. Times, Nov. 10, 2016 “Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians.” — Reuters, May 18, 2017 “Members of the Trump campaign interacted with Russians at least 32 times.” — The Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2017 “Trump and his associates had more than 100 contacts with Russians before the inauguration.” — N.Y. Times, Jan. 26, 2019 “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.” — U.S. Intelligence Community assessment, Jan. 6, 2017 Russian agents purchased advertising on Facebook and distributed inflammatory posts that reached at least 126 million Facebook users. The Russians published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos on YouTube. — Statements by the companies prepared for congressional hearings, October 2017. Russian intelligence conspired “to gain unauthorized access (to ‘hack’) into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” — Indictment of 12 Russians, July 13, 2018 President Trump acknowledges that even as his presidential campaign was underway in 2016, his business was in discussions with Russia about building a Trump property in Moscow. — N.Y. Times interview, Jan. 31, 2019 Paul Manafort tells prosecutors on undisclosed date or dates that he had repeated talks with a Russian, Konstantin Kilimnik, who is believed to have ties to Russian military intelligence. Kilimnik flew to New York for one crucial dinner meeting on Aug. 2, 2016, while Manafort was Trump’s campaign chairman, and they discussed a peace proposal for Ukraine that would resolve the dispute over Putin’s intervention there. This issue was high on Putin’s agenda. Manafort may also have handed over confidential polling data to Kilimnik; it’s not clear if this could have been used for Russian interference in the U.S. election. A federal prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, says on Feb. 4, 2019, “This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel’s office is investigating.” Manafort and Kilimnik left the Aug. 2 meeting separately by different exits. “I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the fateful day that I accepted the offer to work for a famous real estate mogul whose business acumen I truly admired. … It was my own weakness, and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light. “It is for these reasons I chose to participate in the illicit act of the president rather than to listen to my own inner voice, which should have warned me that the campaign finance violations that I later pled guilty to were insidious. … Most all, I want to apologize to the people of the United States. You deserve to know the truth, and lying to you was unjust.” — Michael Cohen, statement to the court, Dec. 12, 2018, after earlier confessing to lying to Congress about Trump’s investment interest in Russia A recent Washington Post/Schar poll found that 43 percent of Americans still are skeptical that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. That should no longer be in doubt. What isn’t clear is the role that the Trump campaign played, if any, in that interference. What we do know is that there were more than 100 contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign; moreover, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has shown that four people in Trump’s orbit lied about contacts with Moscow. Unlike a play, the stakes here are enormous: This drama is about the integrity of America’s political system. We should be careful about assuming we can predict the ending, but I keep coming back to Vice President Pence’s excellent question when he denied — falsely — that there had been any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign: “Why would there be?” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘The Umbrella Academy’ and ‘Doom Patrol’ Feature Strangely Similar Super-Teams,"It doesn’t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe, competitors in the field of subscription streaming video, get together to plan their schedules. So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing “The Umbrella Academy” on the same day (Friday) that DC Universe is releasing “Doom Patrol,” while you note that the “Doom Patrol” comic books were a primary model, along with “X-Men,” for the “Umbrella Academy” comics. Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero teams, which television happily feeds: The new series join DC Comics titles like “Legends of Tomorrow,” “Titans” and “Black Lightning” and Marvel shows like “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways,” “The Gifted” and “Legion,” to name a few. On the horizon are a couple of heavyweights, HBO’s “Watchmen” adaptation and Netflix’s “Jupiter’s Legacy.” So what do these two handsomely produced new shows add to the conversation? Continuing proof that comic books and TV shows have very different vocabularies, and that converting the first into the second requires hard choices. The most enjoyable adaptations commit to traditional TV values (“Black Lightning” on CW) or go all in on replicating the comic book experience (“Legion” on FX). Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they’re action thrillers in which the action feels forced and they’re family dramas in which we don’t really care about the family. Which brings us to “The Umbrella Academy,” based on the comics series created by Gerard Way (the multitalented artist who was also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance) and Gabriel Bá. Like “Doom Patrol,” which Way has generously cited as an influence, it’s about a superpowered band of outsiders assembled by a possibly mad, definitely abrasive genius who doubles as father figure. And, in this case, as actual father: Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) adopts the seven future members of the Umbrella Academy team as babies, shortly after they’re all born on the same day to mothers who didn’t appear to be pregnant. Frequent flashbacks show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark, many-chambered mansion, giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor. That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), who returns from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body (though he’s aged several decades beyond his 20-something foster siblings) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green, short-pants school uniform. The show’s primary mode, however — as the estranged team members reunite for their father’s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassins, one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “Legion” lite. (The show’s creator, Steve Blackman, was an executive producer on that FX series.) It takes stabs at hallucinatory, Gregory Crewdson-like visual setups, and it goes for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killers receive their orders in pneumatic tubes that pop up wherever they happen to be. The soundtrack, ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone, feels annoyingly self-conscious. [Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar.] Its attempts to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comics are halfhearted, though, and we’re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction; teenage alienation as an apocalyptic force that has to be brought under control. The first episode introduces the stock characters (loyal son, too-perfect daughter, rebel, cynic, screw-up) in lively fashion, but then the story bogs down in anemic mystery and filler, like a risible detour into the Vietnam War. It’s easy enough to watch, at least until the requisite season-ending big battle, a pale echo of “Carrie.” And there are performances that keep you interested, including Kate Walsh as a kind of time lord, Cameron Britton as a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher (of Nickelodeon’s “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn,”), who’s remarkably assured as a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler’s body. He carries the show as far as he can. The news about “Doom Patrol” is provisionally better, though much less definitive, since only two episodes were available. Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver (“Supernatural”), it’s about an older group of misfits than those in “Umbrella Academy,” and it works in a satirical, high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama. The dilapidated heroes present for the show’s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man, voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer, along with Elasti-Woman (April Bowlby), whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis, and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero), with as many powers as personalities. They have their own mansion, in the rural Midwest, where they’re overseen by their own eccentric genius (Timothy Dalton). “Doom Patrol” operates inside big quotation marks, with Alan Tudyk (who plays the villain Mr. Nobody) providing an arch, self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critics’ reactions to the show and intones, “Let the pretentious title sequence begin.” Dressing up the standard superteam tropes with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast. But a show that gives you a donkey who spells out messages in big green clouds of flatulence gets at least one more week from me.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Unicorn’ Review: A Gay Country Singer’s Grim and Lonely World,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Unicorn” takes its title from a 1974 L.P. by an outsider singer-songwriter named Peter Grudzien. Onscreen text describes the record, still a cult favorite, as one of the first openly gay country albums. But by the end of this sustained, frightening immersion in Peter’s private world, the title has acquired a darker connotation. Isabelle Dupuis and Tim Geraghty have made a grim and haunting documentary about what it means to burn bright, then die alone. Grudzien’s Astoria home in Queens belongs to “Grey Gardens” school of housekeeping. Shot mainly from 2005 to 2007, the movie shows Peter living there with his twin sister, Terry, who like him struggles with evident mental illness, and their near-centenarian father, Joseph, who remembers a childhood working in mines. (“For some people, life, it’s not worth it,” Joseph says in a blunt summation of Terry’s demons.) Peter prattles on about the old days, recalling a Nashville where, as he describes it, everyone looked effeminate. He performs at karaoke, sounding like someone who never carried a tune in his life. Even when three cousins try to stage an intervention, it is clear that this household — which Peter voices fear of losing — is a sanctum that can’t be breached. At one point Peter, dressed at his most outlandish, brags that he is wearing the same style of sunglasses worn by the Claude Rains character in “The Invisible Man.” Invisibility is what he achieved, and what this film — by staring so empathetically at squalor and loneliness — so painfully shows.

2019,‘The Unwinding of the Miracle’ Is About How to Die — and Live,"Inside the List She didn’t know it then, but Julie Yip-Williams began her memoir, “The Unwinding of the Miracle” — which enters the list at No. 8 — in July 2013. That’s when the 37-year-old mother of two, in the E.R. with stomach pains and nausea, learned she had Stage 4 colon cancer. The next month, she started a blog, partly as a record for her daughters, Mia and Belle (“especially if this cancer-fighting journey doesn’t end in the way we all hope it ends”), and partly, she wrote, “to carve out my own little space out there to express my sadness, anger, joy, hope, despair and a slew of other emotions that come with living with cancer.” Mark Warren, her editor at Random House, says, “Julie was my friend for a couple of years before the prospect of a book even came up. It was in the last year of her life, when her health was turning toward its end, and she was resolving all she could resolve, that we began to contemplate whether the blog could be a book.” Yip-Williams had been searching for a book that would help her prepare to die, but she hadn’t found one. “She was unnerved by the level of denial that she found in the culture at large,” Warren recalls. Warren introduced her to David Granger, who became her literary agent in August 2017. “I asked her to make me a list of her 15 favorite blog posts and then, while I was waiting for that, I dove in,” Granger says. “The first one I remember reading was what became Chapter 2 of the book, a letter to Mia and Belle. I was weeping by the end of the first paragraph, where she writes that she’s making a video so everyone knows what kind of food the dog, Chipper, eats.” The next month, Granger sold the project to Random House, which Yip-Williams proudly announced in her final blog post. “Cancer is completing my life, making it whole,” she wrote. “This blog will … be transformed into the memoir I always dreamed of publishing, except maybe not the cancer part, but I will take it anyway.” [ Read our review of “The Unwinding of the Miracle.” ] Warren says that “what began as a chronicle of early and imminent death became so much more — she would come to think of it as an exhortation to the living, to live most vividly by facing hard truths consciously. Yes, ‘The Unwinding of the Miracle’ is certainly a book about how to die, but even more than that, it’s a book about how to live. Her honesty and humanity will strip the bark right off you. It will wake you right up.” Julie Yip-Williams died on March 19, 2018.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Wandering Earth’ Review: Planetary Disaster Goes Global,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Wandering Earth,” directed by Frant Gwo, arrived with stratospheric anticipation. Described as China’s first space blockbuster, it is already a hit in its home country and, on a more limited scale, in the United States, where it opened earlier this month. It certainly proves that the Chinese film industry can hold its own at the multiplex: It is just as awash in murky computer imagery, stupefying exposition and manipulative sentimentality as the average Hollywood tentpole. Although the film is based on a story by Liu Cixin, it draws on a barely digested stew of planetary-cataclysm movies, with the eco-catastrophe and invasion films of Roland Emmerich serving as the most obvious spiritual guides. (Even a Chinese New Year setting correlates to the July 4 timing of Emmerich’s “Independence Day.”) In this case, the disaster — the first one, anyway — is that the sun is going to engulf the planet, so the multilingual United Earth Government has concocted a plan to send Earth out of the solar system using 10,000 propulsive engines, with Jupiter’s gravity providing the final oomph. But a slightly incorrect trajectory could cause a collision and end civilization, a crisis that is well underway. (Humans live in underground cities, having survived by lottery, and Earth’s surface is frozen.) Those affected include all of humanity, but in particular a brash young man (Qu Chuxiao) raised by his grandfather (Ng Man-tat) after his father (Wu Jing) left to help navigate from an international space station controlled by a heartless HAL-esque computer. As the calamities — earthquakes, rescues, communication failures and a last-minute celestial chemistry experiment — compound, the only shock of the new is that it’s the same as the old.

2019,‘The Wedding Guest’ Review: On the Run in India,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Wedding Guest” soon reveals that it has one of the most misleading titles of the year. It’s a thriller, not a light comedy of manners — but exactly what sort of thriller it will be is something that the director, Michael Winterbottom, keeps tantalizingly at bay. When we meet Jay (Dev Patel), a stoic, handsome man of mystery, he is departing London for Pakistan. He rents a car and, on what appears to be a lengthy, less-than-straightforward route, stops at a gun shop. We eventually learn he’s looking for a woman named Samira (Radhika Apte). And when he finds her, he ties her up and puts her in the trunk. Winterbottom, the globe-trotting, genre-hopping British filmmaker, has done well with dark territory before (the 2010 Jim Thompson adaptation “The Killer Inside Me”). And if in the past he’s come across like a dabbler — a director more interested in trying different styles than engaging with any one of them — here, his restless, touristic tendencies suit what might otherwise have been a rote on-the-lam scenario. The filmmaker wrote the script himself, and read no further to keep the surprises fresh. Samira was indeed about to attend a wedding — her own, to a groom not of her choosing. Jay was hired by Deepesh (Jim Sarbh), the boyfriend the Pakistani-born Samira, who spent part of her upbringing in Britain, has kept secret from her traditional parents. She can go back and get married if she wants, Jay tells her. But if she goes with Deepesh, she’ll never stop running. (It might have been easier to pose this choice before the abduction — and before Jay killed a man during the getaway — but this is a movie that places pacing above sense.) Deepesh is not the most reliable of paramours, and as Jay and Samira cross into India to meet him, “The Wedding Guest” turns into a rush of international cellphone calls, hotel hide-outs, false identities and phony jewels. The scenery, nicely shot by Giles Nuttgens and covering a wide swath of the country — Amritsar, New Delhi, Jaipur and Goa — is always great, and Patel and Apte’s chemistry approaches scalding levels as their characters grow closer. Despite all the bobbing and weaving, Winterbottom knows when to pause the proceedings for a ripe, noirish exchange. “Are you going to kill me?” “I should.” “Can I trust you?” “No.” For all its absurdities, “The Wedding Guest” makes it tough not to anticipate how that conversation will pan out.

2019,‘This Is My Space’: Kirsten Gillibrand’s Unabashedly Feminist Campaign,"The morning after the election of Donald J. Trump, Kirsten Gillibrand woke up and began crying. “Bawling,” she corrected herself. After spending the next two months “deeply depressed,” the junior senator from New York experienced what she called the most inspiring day of her political life: the women’s march. And almost two years to the day after that, Ms. Gillibrand sat in a Manhattan wine bar, holding a glass of pinot noir, and described why she believes the country and the Democratic Party need an unabashedly feminist campaign for president — and why she thinks she’s the candidate to run it. “You understand, this is my space,” Ms. Gillibrand said, in an interview. “I don’t know if my party will get as far as I will go on a lot of these issues. But I believe in them so strongly.” At a moment when women are ascendant in Democratic politics and polls show a record gender gap between the parties, Ms. Gillibrand and her advisers see an opportunity to ride a wave of women’s political energy right into the White House. While multiple women are serious contenders for president for the first time in American history, Ms. Gillibrand is the only one who is making running as a woman, for women, the central theme of her candidacy. Whether her campaign is successful or not, Ms. Gillibrand’s approach will test how much views have changed on issues like discrimination, sexual harassment and female leadership, after two years of an administration that has embroiled the country in an emotional debate over gender bias. Ms. Gillibrand says advocating for women has been the cause of her political life, from her days as a young lawyer raising money for women’s charities. But she is choosing the mantle of feminist crusader at a time when other core Democratic issues are more problematic for her. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] As a House member from upstate New York earlier in her political career, she held far more conservative positions on gun control and immigration. Her years as a corporate lawyer, taking clients that included a big tobacco company, and her past as a voracious fund-raiser from Wall Street donors complicate her ability to attack greed and inequality in big business. And by using her gender to find a toehold in the Democratic electorate, Ms. Gillibrand risks pigeonholing herself in a race where voters may be seeking a broader populist message. “There may well be a risk,” Ms. Gillibrand said, in what she calls her “women plus” campaign platform. “But it is who I am. I think the country would be so much stronger if women had greater voices.” Still, Ms. Gillibrand is unwavering. Calling out sexism and sexual misconduct in all corners — including her outspoken critiques of former President Bill Clinton and former Senator Al Franken — is a political calling card that she feels distinguishes her. Her first words on national television describing her rationale for running were that she is a “young mom.” Her first big speech as a candidate took place at a women’s march in Des Moines. Her first fund-raising event was hosted by a women’s group in the Bay Area. And her first question from the press — about her likability — she derided as “sexist.” Of President Trump’s 2017 tweet that Ms. Gillibrand “would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions,” she called the president “misogynistic,” saying in the interview, “I mean, he essentially called me a prostitute!” There is no real precedent for Ms. Gillibrand’s strategy: As a candidate, Hillary Clinton struggled to talk about her gender, and essentially tried to copy the approach of the male presidential candidates who had preceded her, said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton’s former communications director. “I had no idea what it looked like to do it differently; Senator Gillibrand is doing it differently,” said Ms. Palmieri, who has discussed Ms. Gillibrand’s presidential ambitions with her. “She knows the risk involved with being so plain-spoken and forward-leaning as a woman candidate and doesn’t care.” There is also the math: Women are expected to make up a clear majority of voters in a Democratic primary — nearly 60 percent, according to Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who specializes in female voting behavior. [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] For years, Ms. Gillibrand has fund-raised for women seeking office through her Off the Sidelines PAC, helping her develop a national network of female donors and a robust list of supporters. In 2013, she delivered a speech laying out her economic plan aimed at promoting women in the work force that included proposals for equal pay, paid leave, affordable child care, universal pre-K and raising the minimum wage. In the Senate, some of her biggest fights have been around securing greater protections for women facing sexual assault cases in the military, on college campuses and on Capitol Hill. Ms. Gillibrand has also shown a willingness to buck powerful men in her own party. In 2017, she made headlines by saying Mr. Clinton’s sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky should have prompted him to resign, angering the Clintons, who had championed her early in her career. Ms. Gillibrand is also still navigating the fallout from another controversial choice within her own party: her decision in late 2017 to become the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of Mr. Franken, following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Despite the backlash she has faced from some Democratic quarters, Ms. Gillibrand said she saved the party from itself, arguing that standing by Mr. Franken would have cost Democrats congressional seats in the midterms. And she said Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, would not have won his special election in Alabama if Mr. Franken had not stepped aside and provided the party with a clear message against the Republican, Roy S. Moore, a state jurist accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls. “God bless him if he wanted to sue every woman who made an allegation against him,’’ she said of Mr. Franken. “But just imagine this last election how many women came out to vote and ran for office, and young women. Would they have felt that nobody had their back?’’ Her advisers argue that the incident shows Ms. Gillibrand as a fighter unafraid to take on powerful men, and that the intense energy of women in the Democratic Party will outweigh the concerns. Her campaign distributed a memo as she entered the race saying that 58 percent of Democratic presidential primary voters in 2016 were women, and that female candidates won nearly two-thirds of open House Democratic primaries in 2018. “Looking at 2018, there was something in the water she will tap into because it’s authentic to her,” said Glen Caplin, a top adviser to Ms. Gillibrand. It’s a strategy neither Senator Elizabeth Warren nor Senator Kamala Harris have embraced in their presidential platforms. During her campaign rollout last month, Ms. Harris focused heavily on her connections with the black community and her career as a prosecutor. Ms. Warren has centered her argument around class, rather than gender, making her personal story of economic struggle the centerpiece of her pitch to voters. “Ultimately, that’s why I decided to run,’’ Ms. Gillibrand said. “Because I was concerned maybe the rest of the team doesn’t focus on these issues. Maybe the rest of the team doesn’t get where they need to go.’’ And while Ms. Gillibrand denounced questions of “likability” as sexist, Ms. Warren explicitly demurred from such labels in an interview last month. Ms. Gillibrand’s bluntness worries some Democrats in early voting states, who fear a repeat of the kind of sexism they believe sank Mrs. Clinton’s campaign in 2016. Linda Smoley, who hosted Mrs. Clinton at her Sioux City, Iowa, home in 2015 and attended Ms. Gillibrand’s first house party in Iowa in January, said she was so distressed after Mr. Trump was elected that she got anti-depressants from her doctor and then accidentally drove her car into her house. Ms. Gillibrand had reached out moments earlier about appearing at Ms. Smoley’s local women’s group, Siouxland Progressive Women. But after the trauma of 2016, Ms. Smoley at first voiced reservations about selecting another female nominee. “My only concern is that she is a woman,” Ms. Smoley said, “and I fear that in this misogynistic society in which we live, I think it will be hard for a woman because there are so many middle-aged and older white men who don’t want to cede power.” But moments later, she was reconsidering, gingerly. “But maybe we have turned,’’ she said. “Maybe this time, if she can convince those white women Trump voters how we as Democrats could make lives better, maybe she could get some of that vote that Hillary lost.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘To Dust’ Review: Death, Decay and Grief Wrapped in a Buddy Movie","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “To Dust” runs an hour and a half, and that feels right for a buddy movie whose comedy is as stubborn as this one’s. But the movie is also trying — daring — to seriously consider grief, and that movie could have gone on for much longer. You can feel the script, by Jason Begue and Shawn Snyder, straining to tickle an audience. So it has a bereft widowed Hasidic cantor named Shmuel (Geza Rohrig) team up with Albert, a dumpy, mildly grizzled community college biology professor — and complete stranger — played by Matthew Broderick. Shmuel wants to know what’s to become of the body of his recently deceased wife. His sorrow mutates into a paralyzing obsession that mystifies, annoys and embarrasses his mother, two young sons and orthodox community. The boys actually think he’s possessed, by a dybbuk in the guise of their mother’s ghost. This isn’t so much a spiritual or even existential concern for Schmuel as much as a scientific one: What, practically speaking, happens to a corpse? Like, how long does it take to decompose? When his faith and religious leaders have no easy answer, he corners Albert, who reads him one from a forensics textbook. That should be a wrap, honestly. But the movie has more than an hour to go, meaning we have to tolerate some obnoxious behavior (Albert actually curtails an office-hours session with a needy black student to turn his attention to Shmuel, who as far as I can tell doesn’t pay a dime of tuition). It means forced absurdity. Schmuel arrives at Albert’s, for instance, with a hog whose suffocation, burial and decay are meant to serve as a soothing science experiment. When that doesn’t work, the movie has them hit the road for even more scientific answers. You can see what this movie is after, something cockeyed but sincere, something in the neighborhood of Paul Mazursky, Elaine May or Alexander Payne. But the writing and filmmaking (Snyder directed) just aren’t quick enough. The film’s heart just isn’t in all of the pig chasing, fence climbing and disinterring. Broderick appears to be here for the comic relief of his mere familiarity, Albert being this diminished echo of his best public-education parts, in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “Election.” It’s not until the final minutes when the movie relaxes, the cute (and gross) stuff falls away, and the dark beauty of Shmuel’s suffering finally gets to breathe. Rohrig was the face (and soul) of “Son of Saul,” that formally audacious, morally appalling Auschwitz drama from 2015 (it won the foreign-language Oscar). He never made me laugh here, but he did nearly bring me to tears. Rohrig is so good at searching despair that I don’t know why the filmmakers didn’t just give the whole movie over to him.

2019,‘Total Dhamaal’ Review: A Bollywood Caper Stoops to Amuse,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s rare for a movie to announce so bluntly and accurately what it’s about and why it exists, but the numbskull Bollywood caper “Total Dhamaal” wastes no time: “It’s all about the money.” These are the first words you hear, sung in English, in an opening musical number so shimmeringly gaudy it would make Las Vegas blush. So, yes, the plot involves suitcases full of rupees, coveted and chased by the usual assortment of bumblers, gangsters and civilians. But also, the makers of “Total Dhamaal” needlessly remind us, the movie exists to celebrate and, of course, to make money. The making part is probably a given. “Total Dhamaal” (“Total Fun”) is the third installment of a popular series, all directed by Indra Kumar, with a simple comic philosophy: No physical gag is too silly or too juvenile; and, repetition can only up the ante. This time around the guest stars include Madhuri Dixit, one of Hindi cinema’s biggest stars (and best dancers) of the late 1980s and ’90s, and Anil Kapoor. For long stretches, Ms. Dixit is the sole female in “Total Dhamaal” (“Bro,” uttered again and again in English, feels like a verbal tell), and she’s a welcome presence even if the movie drags her down more than she lifts it up. The shaggy story, a sort of a poor cousin to “It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,” has its big climax in a zoo, where our hapless heroes wind up in their race to grab the cash. They pause to save the animals — a villain ex machina has poisoned their food — and, surprise, a lesson is learned: Kindness trumps greed. The moral seems as tacked on as the villain. But it’s a sweet thought and not entirely out of keeping with a movie that for all its crassness, comic and commercial, is basically good-spirited. And practical. One gag, in good Indian metaphysical tradition, has a man drowning in quicksand call for a rope; he’s handed a snake. There’s no perceptual error here, just this thought: Sometimes a snake is just a snake, but it’s not accidental that it can be used to pull a man from danger.

2019,‘Total Scam’ or ‘Fabulous’? Why Airbnb Deeply Divides Us,"A nuisance or a great way to earn income? [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Times story revealing the inner-workings of a group’s multimillion-dollar Airbnb scheme — unlawfully using the site to convert scores of Manhattan apartments into makeshift hotels — reverberated with readers around the world. We heard from hosts who share their homes to make ends meet, families who live next door to apartments rented out on Airbnb and travelers who use Airbnb — as well as those who prefer not to. The company’s rapid growth has transformed how millions of people travel. But it’s clear, from hundreds of reader comments, that there’s a heated debate over the impact of the so-called sharing economy on the character of neighborhoods, housing stock and quality of life. Below, a sampling of readers’ comments, shortened and edited for clarity. My husband and I own a small unit in a Battery Park condo building. Two years ago, I became aware of touristy people on the elevators complete with luggage and guidebooks. Short-term rentals are a definite no-no in our doorman building, regardless of city rules. The listings were removed. But, two days ago, an ad popped up on my Facebook page showing a listing in, you guessed it, our building. In buildings like ours, the issue is unvetted strangers roaming our halls and not taking care of things as owners would. I rent my flat on Airbnb. I work overseas so it suits me fine to have it as a pied-à-terre that brings in some money while I’m away. I understand people can get annoyed with tourists, but if it wasn’t for Airbnb, my neighborhood would likely be empty, except for a few elderly people. I follow the law here: The property is registered with the authorities. We create invoices using a government portal. And we have a complaints book and emergency signs that glow in the dark. If the government regulates short term rentals, and renters like myself follow the rules, I should be allowed to do with my property as I wish. Over the past few years we have used Airbnb in Asia, Europe and the United States. Out of 20 or so rentals, only two (in Shanghai and Brussels) were so horrendously misleading from what was advertised that we demanded our money back. Each time Airbnb made good and we were fully refunded. The vast majority of our experiences were positive. But we’ve also experienced the other side of the coin: Our upstairs neighbors converted their flat into an Airbnb. We lost much of our peace and quiet as overnighters were coming and going at all hours. It truly downgraded our quality of life. Airbnb is mostly great for customers and travelers. If you have to live with it, not so much. We rented out our two spare guest rooms on Airbnb. I thought I had correctly researched the laws beforehand. We kept our prices higher than our competitors to weed out party animals. We're on fixed incomes, so the extra money was useful. Most importantly, we got to meet great people from all cultures. Our neighbors weren’t bothered by our very occasional guests, who were always quiet. And the government got their taxes. But then they came knocking with a cease-and-desist order saying it was illegal. It turned out it was. The losers were us and the guests who lost the opportunity to stay in a nice home with a kitchen. My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Manhattan a few years back. The owner made a point of shushing us so neighbors wouldn’t know we were there. It was clear the building didn’t condone the activity. We spent most of the time feeling like trespassers. But some people say that it allows them to travel on their own terms or stay somewhere they would otherwise not be able to afford. Tourism in big cities has a huge impact on subsidized services like trains and emergency services, and these cities are right to collect taxes to offset these costs. The story says “most tourists left positive ratings.” That matters, right? Thousands of people had a good experience, and got the service of their choice. All these tourists spent money in New York City, giving work to locals. Any deception or illegality is not O.K., of course. And any externalities should be fully charged for. Most of my Airbnb experiences have been positive, and not replicable by hotels. David Roseberry, 66, Kennewick, Wash. Now that we’re retired, my wife and I like to travel, most often in Europe and usually for at least six weeks. Hotels don’t cater to our needs. They insist on supplying maid service or baggage services and a 24-hour desk that we don’t need or want. They don’t have kitchens or washing machines. Even so-called suites are tiny. So what are you supposed to do if you want to stay in a place for a week or two? The Airbnbs that we typically rent are not less expensive than a hotel room nearby, but you can get a living space where you can live normally. I’ve had more negative experiences with Airbnb than positive ones. The worst was a nightmare in Florence with disgusting stained furniture that you could actually see in the dim gray light of the cavern they called a living space. The pictures on Airbnb were astoundingly gorgeous, but it was a total scam. Long live real hotels! Having used Airbnb all over the country, I have mixed feelings about Airbnb. I can’t afford nice hotels and I enjoy using Airbnb to stay in residential neighborhoods, where I can shop and cook. The hosts have almost always been interesting folks who live on the premises. But I live in downtown Manhattan, where many rentals are out of sight. I see loads of people trundling up and down the sidewalks with their suitcases. I lament that neighborhoods lose their character and that realtors might be buying up apartments with no care about that. David DiRoma, 65, Baldwinsville, N.Y. When Airbnb first started, I thought that the “sharing society” idea was a great one. Someone with an extra bedroom in their home or apartment could rent it out periodically to a short-term visitor who needed a bed for a night or two. The owner was on the premises. The renter saved a few bucks, and the owner and local government made a few bucks. Unfortunately, once the smart operators figured out there was serious dough to be made, the whole thing left a sour taste. Wayne Chen, 26, New York City Airbnb is a fabulous way to help defer the cost of a vacation. I’ve hosted guests in my room before while I’ve been on vacation (with my roommates here), or vice versa while my roommates have been on vacation. I also personally prefer Airbnbs over hotels since they feel more personal, and also often come with a nice amenities like a kitchen. I think large-scale commercial hosts like these give Airbnb a bad name. Let’s crack down on this practice, but I’d hate to lose Airbnb to a few bad apples.",The New York Times
2019,‘Transit’ Review: An Existential Puzzler With Jackboots and Terror,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The past and present are a terrifying blur in “Transit,” a brilliant allegory set in France that opens amid wailing police sirens. The solitary man in a cafe sipping espresso doesn’t flinch. He is soon joined by a second man who gives him a name: Georg. “Why are you still here,” the second man asks, “Paris is being sealed off.” In urgent tones, they discuss visas, danger, money. Georg agrees to deliver two letters and then steps into streets filled with jackboots and terror, a world in which time seems to have folded in on itself. An existential thriller about loss, trauma, statelessness and historical amnesia, “Transit” is the latest from the German director Christian Petzold, an electrifying, original filmmaker. Petzold is likely best known in the United States for “Barbara,” a slow-burning drama about an East German doctor who, after a failed attempt to go to the West, decides to stay. In “Barbara,” to voluntarily remain in a totalitarian dictatorship is an ethical choice, a form of resistance. There are no valorous choices in “Transit,” where leaving is a high-stakes necessity for Georg and the desperate, panicked refugees around him. To stay is to die. To remain is also to exist in a time-space puzzle — perhaps another dimension, or a Philip K. Dick-style dystopia — in which German forces are flooding into present-day Paris. When Georg (a transfixing Franz Rogowski) leaves the cafe, the city he steps into looks familiar but different. He is meant to deliver the letters to a writer who turns out to have committed suicide, leaving behind a manual typewriter, a manuscript and a room washed in blood. “He caused me more trouble than the occupation,” a hotel worker grouses. Before long, Georg is dodging shock troops in a heart-thumping chase, and the conventional sense of historical time, with its reassuring sense of progress, has been undone. “Transit” is based on a 1944 novel by the German-Jewish writer Anna Seghers that draws on her experience as a war refugee. Petzold’s great stroke in adapting the book is to situate it in a historically indeterminate moment, overlapping past and present like a cinematic superimposition. He does this subtly, partly by omitting Nazi iconography — the swastikas and all the rest. The sirens in the opening could be sounding in today’s France, with its street protests and official state of emergency instituted in the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks. Even after the movie’s political stakes and backdrop come into focus, the story remains steeped in a kind of temporal dissonance. As “Transit” unfolds, its period remains slyly, artfully indefinite. Georg is on the run — he’s soon in Marseilles — and also firmly located in his own time and space. (He doesn’t look lost in time, though you briefly may be.) Petzold doesn’t set the story in a recognizably bounded here and now (or a circumscribed there and then). The soldiers storming Paris look like contemporary French riot police, and the streets they swarm are filled with current cars and passers-by in up-to-the-minute clothes, including a woman who, as Georg scrambles from shock troops, points at him, shouting: “He’s there! There!” It’s almost a surprise when she doesn’t punctuate her cry with the word “Jew.” In Marseilles, the plot thickens, the danger escalates, and the emotional temperature spikes. Georg assumes the identity of the dead writer, which introduces yet more complications. He also enters dramatically fraught relationships with other anxious refugees, including Marie (Paula Beer), the dead writer’s wife. A sad, jittery beauty, Marie doesn’t know that her husband is dead or that Georg has assumed his identity and, with it, their travel papers. Georg’s growing attachment to Marie is paralleled by his delicate, paternal feelings for a young boy (Lilien Batman) who, with his North African mother (Maryam Zaree), forcefully underscores the story’s topical political resonance. By turns intimate and expansive, “Transit” is a thrilling, at times harrowing labyrinth of a movie. Petzold draws from both the traditional European art film and the mainstream commercial cinema without embracing their orthodoxies. He doesn’t over-explain the trickier plot entanglements, confident in his audience’s ability to sort through its thickets. He embraces ambiguity as a principle but also sometimes gives the movie the accelerated pulse of an action flick: There are chases, fear at the door, screams in the night. It’s easy to imagine Humphrey Bogart in the role of Georg, trading melancholic regrets with Ingrid Bergman; in some scenes, Rogowski’s looks, haunting opacity and stolid physicality bring to mind Joaquin Phoenix, creating another time slip. Early in “Transit,” a narrator (Matthias Brandt) begins talking as Georg reads the dead writer’s novel. The narrator’s identity long remains a mystery; he drops in now and then to add or explain, not always precisely. He’s not altogether reliable, but neither is he especially unreliable. (He’s a storyteller.) As Georg begins reading, the narrator says, “He sensed it was his language, his native tongue.” The typewritten manuscript pages are excerpts from Seghers’s novel, which opens up assorted mind-bending possibilities: Georg is unwittingly following someone else’s script; he’s caught in a time loop or repeating history; or living in a present that is inseparable from the past. Petzold’s answer, I think, can be found in the crowded consulates in which Georg waits alongside despairing men and women, caught in the stateless, agonizingly familiar limbo reproduced in today’s refugee crisis. In 1940, Seghers’s compatriot, the Jewish intellectual Walter Benjamin, spent time in Marseilles trying to secure his own travel papers. Benjamin haunts Petzold’s movie, including in a shot of a sign for Rue des Pyrénées. Benjamin ended up fleeing across the Pyrenees Mountains, killing himself in Spain. In one of Benjamin’s final works, he wrote that “the ‘state of emergency’ in which we live is not the exception but the rule,” sounding an alarm about fascism that resonates powerfully in Petzold’s extraordinary, haunted movie.

2019,‘True Detective’ Season 3 Finale: The Fictions We Tell,"True Detective Whenever a film or television show drops into an English class, it is often to offer some literary insight into how it would like to be interpreted. This happened once before in this season of “True Detective,” when Amelia Reardon read passages from two Robert Penn Warren poems, and later when she referenced Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood” as a model for how she would approach the Purcell case as an author. Tonight’s superb season finale, “Now Am Found,” opens with some choice quotes from Delmore Schwartz’s “Calmly We Walk through This April’s Day,” a poem that ends with the line, “Time is the fire in which we burn.” It’s a vivid sentiment — Malcolm McDowell’s villain got to say it in “Star Trek Generations” — and an appropriate throat clearing for an episode, and a season, about where time has brought these characters and how they were singed in its flames. Will and Julie Purcell went missing in 1980, when they were children out riding their bikes together. Julie isn’t found until 2015, when she is a middle-aged woman tending the garden with her daughter, blissfully hazy about the past. In the 35 years between, time has done a number on Wayne Hays and Roland West, the on-again, off-again partners and on-again, off-again friends who never really left the case, even when it was taken away from them. And it certainly had its way with Will and Julie’s parents, with Amelia and her rocky marriage to Hays and with Harris James, Junius Watts (also known as Mr. June, played by Steven Williams), Mike Ardoin (Corbin Pitts) and those who have carried a dark secret with them. Some lives have been destroyed, others redeemed, but all have been shaped by marinating in this decades-long affair. The most pleasant surprise of this twist-filled 81 minutes: It’s not a pedophile ring! Following up a second season that was all about the gross conspiracies of the powerful and connected, the series creator, Nic Pizzolatto, seemed primed to reveal a network of sex traffickers tied to the Hoyt estate, with that creepy “pink castle” tucked deep inside a basement vault. The truth is much stranger and sadder, a different kind of sickness that is rooted in tragedy rather than perversion. After all the clues and misdirection and timeline-jumping, Pizzolatto gives most of it away in a large info-dump when the elderly Hays and West pay a visit to Watts, the one-eyed man who has been hovering around the action all season. He has been stage-managing a vile conspiracy from the beginning, although even he is not without redeeming value. In Watts’s telling, tragedy begot more tragedy. Hoyt’s daughter, Isabel, lost her husband and daughter in an accident, but when she discovered that young Julie Purcell looked a lot like her child, financial arrangements were made with Lucy Purcell to sustain the fantasy, so long as Will could come along. Will’s accidental death in the woods was an opportunity to make the fantasy official by using steady doses of lithium to confuse Julie into believing that Isabel was her real mother. Harris James was also present as a problem-solver — he took care of paying off Lucy for good, and he planted Will’s backpack under Woodard’s deck — but the arrangement ended when Mr. June freed Julie and she disappeared into the night, never to see any of them again. Julie turned up under a different name in a convent and happened to reunite with Mike Ardoin, who had loved her since childhood and made her his wife, with a daughter of their own. Pizzolatto is spinning a crazy story here, one that perhaps doesn’t hold up to closer scrutiny. In order to give Julie this unexpectedly blissful destiny, all parties have to agree to accept the fictions that brought her there: The fiction that Hoyt’s daughter, Isabel, was her real mother. The fiction that Julie died in 1995 after her time in the convent. The fiction that her husband, Mike, is willfully sustaining in order to protect her. Hays’s dementia plays a role in preserving those fictions in the end — although isn’t there a twinkle of recognition when he’s drinking the water? — but this is a kind and sensible way to leave a woman whose actual history is too painful to bear. The friction between Hays and Amelia has been one of the weaker elements of “True Detective,” particularly during a midseason stretch of the 1990 timeline. Pizzolatto doesn’t entirely redeem their relationship in “Now Am Found,” but he does make the keen observation that its foundation had been built on quicksand. “You and me,” says Hays to Amelia, “who we are together, this marriage, our children … it’s all tied up in a dead boy and a missing girl.” As much as Hays tried to discourage Amelia from writing her book or involving herself in the Purcell case, and as much as she pleaded with him to apply his talents elsewhere, it was never possible for either of them to break away, so it wound up defining them. It is fitting that the final revelation, the one about Julie’s childhood admirer and their reconnection as adults, comes from Amelia’s book, which Hays made the stubborn mistake of never reading. This last piece of the puzzle is hopeful for Julie and it is hopeful for Hays, too, who can finally settle in and appreciate the family he and Amelia created together, and who can receive his partner warmly, with all their past grievances forgotten. No one has to say, “The light’s winning,” as Rust Cohle does at the end of Season 1, but Pizzolatto generously implies it. Flat Circles: • On the other hand, what to make of Henry Hays un-crumpling the slip of paper with Julie’s address on it? Is he going to follow through, himself? That would potentially shatter this delicate illusion. • Without giving too much away about the twists at the end of Atom Egoyan’s great 1994 drama “Exotica,” that’s the work that this episode of “True Detective” most strongly recalls, about characters who playact their way around family tragedy to ease the pain of it. • Michael Rooker’s terrific one-off performance as Hoyt erases the most obvious culprit from the whodunit list, which isn’t easy for an actor who broke through playing the lead role in “Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.” Some of that old Rooker menace surfaces as a warning to Hays, though, about either one of them saying too much. • “What part of the case made you burn your suit at three in the morning?” “The bad part.” • West’s connection with a stray dog is a bit heavy-handed — two loners, kicked to the curb, finding each other in a low moment — but Stephen Dorff’s performance sells its authenticity. Through a haze of booze and pain, he sees salvation on four legs. • Overall, the third season was a solid return to form for the show, all the more impressive for pulling out of a midseason tailspin. Fine performances and a strong evocation of setting have held “True Detective” aloft for season after season, even when it has been let down by the plotting or by particularly ripe pieces of neo-noir dialogue. A few hiccups aside, Pizzolatto’s writing was more streamlined and disciplined this season than last, and the multiple timelines were elegantly managed. And by ending on a note of optimism, he plays shrewdly against his own reputation. Well done.",The New York Times
2019,"‘True Detective’ Season 3, Episode 5: A Convenient ‘Altercation’","True Detective After last week’s booze-soaked wallow in the creator Nic Pizzolatto’s worst instincts, it felt great to see “True Detective” move forward on the case again, even with the occasional hitch in its step. There are important revelations about what ended the investigation in 1980, new wrinkles to its reopening a decade later and a gathering of elderly forces to revisit it again 25 years after that. For the first episode since the opening two, the show gathered power from a meaningful convergence of timelines and the dysfunction of a community more interested in closure than in getting the facts right. The melee in 1980 that ended last week’s episode, gently labeled “the Woodard Altercation,” turned out to be the breakthrough that put a neat little bow on the original investigation. Brett Woodard was already under suspicion from the police, but his neighbors had gone a step or two further in linking him to the crimes because of his eccentric behavior and his overly friendly way with children. His ambush by a cadre of redneck vigilantes was so inevitable that he had already prepared like Jamie Lee Curtis in the new “Halloween,” hunkering down on a property equipped with trip wires, land mines and assault weapons. Survival doesn’t appear to be an expectation for Woodard — he just wants to take out as many hostile forces as he can before he goes. Life was too much for him to bear even before the Purcell kids went missing. For Hays, a fellow veteran, shooting Woodard is another burden he is forced to carry, which would be a more compelling idea if it weren’t explicitly vocalized or if Hays’s psychic rucksack weren’t already bursting at the seams. But making Woodard the fall guy for Will’s murder and Julie’s disappearance does bring “True Detective” back to the Arkansas of the West Memphis Three, where the desire to find justice quickly prevents a more thorough and credible investigation — especially when the person or persons involved are societal outcasts. In fact, there hadn’t been much follow-through from Hays and West since the early hours of the investigation, at least from what we’re privy to seeing on the show. As Freddie confirms in the 1990 timeline in this week’ episode, Woodard was puttering along in the opposite direction from where the children were headed. At the time, the one damning piece of evidence connecting Woodard to the crime was the discovery of Will’s backpack in his crawl space, but in 1990, with Julie still alive, Hays notes that the bag was left conspicuously undamaged by the explosion. This indicates that someone planted it during the few days in which police were combing through the scene. “Nobody was compelled to look too hard,” recalls Hays of the original finding, but the politics of exonerating Woodard 10 years later are equally undesirable. The desire for justice isn’t always the same as the desire for truth: Careers made by a high-profile conviction can be upended by its unraveling. There’s a reason it took over 18 years for the West Memphis Three to be released from prison — and under a peculiar plea deal, too. Unsettling a settled case has consequences. Those consequences are particularly substantial for Tom Purcell, who spent 10 years grappling with the uncertainty of his daughter’s whereabouts before she suddenly resurfaced. The best scenes in this week’s episode zero in on Tom’s anguish, which the superb Scoot McNairy plays as three parts authentic to one part performative, an emotionally devastated father who may still be hiding something. His estranged wife Lucy died of an overdose outside Las Vegas two years earlier, and Dan O’Brien, the cousin who briefly lived with the Purcells (and perhaps carved a peephole into Julie’s room), passed some bad checks and spent time around Vegas, too. Tom is alone in pleading publicly for tips on his daughter’s whereabouts, and he is alone, too, when confronted with a hotline message from a young woman claiming to be Julie, who wants “the man on TV, acting like my father” to leave her alone. That hotline call and the news that Lucy and Dan spent time in Las Vegas isn’t incriminating, exactly, but it does strongly suggest that one of Will and Julie’s parents had a role in what happened to them. Add to that the ransom note, which echoes Lucy’s thoughts about how “children shud laugh,” and there’s plenty of cause for speculation, all the way up the most recent timeline, when Hays finally gets around to reading his wife’s book. In the decade between the first and second timelines, however, there’s a bond between Tom and West that the show has introduced without yet defining how it developed. At a minimum, West seems persuaded by Tom’s grief and more willing than his partner to protect him from additional stress. It’s possible to read West’s sad state at the end of the episode — a potbellied recluse with stray dogs and a drinking problem — as indicative of regrettable choices, although it’s also possible that Tom had nothing to do with it. The bounty of clues and disclosures this week do much to counteract the continued friction between Hays and Amelia, which repeats itself from last week. The signs of Hays’s hostility and emotional remoteness are present in 1980, when he refuses to accept Amelia’s comforting gestures while West is recuperating from gunshot wound. In 1990, with Amelia’s book on the verge of publication, he lashes out again at a suburban dinner party with West and his girlfriend, which becomes yet another prelude to makeup sex. Hays’s denial of her insight and agency is a fault the show acknowledges — he wouldn’t have missed the ransom note clue if he’d bothered to read her book — but their scrapes have the effect of marginalizing her in the story, too. Like Woodard, she is reduced to another burden for him to carry. Flat Circles: • “There surely exists a mutable area of soul where grief is indistinguishable from madness.” In fairness to Hays, I would not have made it far into Amelia’s book, either. • Pro tip: When going over sensitive evidence of a recently reopened murder/kidnapping case, keep the door closed. • Hays isn’t a welcoming ear to the hardships of others, especially a guy like Freddie, who accuses him and West of ruining his life by browbeating him in the interrogation room. (“Please explain to me the trials and tribulations of being a white man in this country.”) Pizzolatto heroes are turned off by the weaknesses of others, even as they drown their own sorrows in whiskey. • “We do not say ‘good night’ without ‘I love you” is a genuinely lovely sentiment, patching together the holes that keep opening up in the Hays household. It’s more touching still with the knowledge that the bond between father and daughter will not hold. An earlier version of this article misidentified the timeline in which the “Woodard Altercation” took place. It was the timeline from 1980, not 1990.",The New York Times
2019,"‘True Detective’ Season 3, Episode 6 Recap: The Pink Castle","True Detective There’s a confusing and contradictory tension developing in this season of “True Detective” between the personal and the broadly conspiratorial. On one hand, we’re getting a better and better sense of what life was like for Will and Julie before their abduction. They were held captive by their parents’ dysfunction, which frightened and alienated them so much that the peephole in Will’s closet, the one we assumed was carved by a leering pedophile, was actually a place where the two children could pass notes to each other. On the other, the case has opened up to the larger, more powerful forces represented by Hoyt Foods, where Lucy Purcell once worked. Whatever role Hoyt Foods and its executive class played in the case has the effect of minimizing the domestic conflict among the Purcells. Now everyone is the victim, not only Will and Julie but also Tom, Lucy, Dan O’Brien, Freddy Burns and Brett Woodard. The whole gallery of suspects. It seems to be Nic Pizzolatto’s instinct to make “True Detective” a big show, about simple crimes that open up into expansive indictments of the shadowy networks that make them possible. The whodunit aspects tend to grow less important over time, to the point where a cabal of industrial and municipal power brokers was the true villain of the second season, and the inciting murder was resolved with a shrug. That’s a compelling choice on Pizzolatto’s part, supported by plenty of neo-noir classics like “Chinatown” and “The Long Goodbye.” But there are dramatic consequences, too. It not only produces enough red herrings to stock a deli counter, it also threatens to minimize the characters. When a situation is larger than they are, that’s another way of saying that they’re shrinking. In the 1990 timeline, the fallout over the hotline call from Julie — or someone presumed to be Julie — puts Tom firmly in the cross hairs of the investigation. Hays and West are castigated for dismissing Tom as a suspect too quickly, despite the fact that he didn’t have an alibi after 6:30 on the night of his kids’ disappearance. The caller’s claim that Tom was not her real father gets some support from the revelation that he is a closeted homosexual. His old boss tells the detectives that Tom’s job was already in jeopardy before the kidnappings because he’d been caught drinking on the job and asking for loans, and that his relationship with his co-workers had deteriorated after he was seen slipping into a gay club. Hays and West are given a search warrant for Tom’s place, where they find a pamphlet on conversion therapy. But Tom’s sexuality isn’t an indictment. It’s more a complication signaling that he hasn’t been forthcoming with the authorities, especially about his blood relationship with his children. With the focus shifting to Tom, this week’s episode attempts something hugely unconventional: It presents critical events from his perspective. It is exceedingly rare for a procedural like “True Detective” to veer off the investigative trail because it gives the audience information that the gumshoes don’t have. We know from Hays and West’s meeting with Dan O’Brian at the diner that Dan might have some important and dangerous news to share about the people behind Will’s murder and Julie’s disappearance. But it’s Tom who follows up on it after overhearing a couple of other investigators in the station. (They really do need to keep that door closed.) And so we’re privy to Tom’s solo mission to beat the goods out of Dan at the motel. And we’re with him in the final moments when he discovers the “pink castle” in a Hoyt executive’s mansion, crept up upon by a man who appears to be Hoyt’s security chief, Harris James (Scott Shepherd). For the time being, “True Detective” has put viewers in a situation where we know more than the investigators who have spent decades following the case. The fan theory that Hoyt Foods is funding a pedophile ring now has some support, which brings the show back to a familiar theme about the unspeakable perversions of the ultra-elite and the powerful networks that sustain and protect them. People of lesser means, the detectives included, are likely to get chewed up by the machinery. None of this absolves some of the key players from culpability in the crime, much less their sins as parents and caregivers, but their destinies aren’t entirely their own to determine. Lucy will overdose in Las Vegas under mysterious circumstances. Dan’s remains are discovered at the bottom of a Missouri rock quarry. And things aren’t looking so great for Tom at the moment. For Hays and West, it has meant chasing a more unknowable and elusive evil all these years — and helplessly watching as the casualties pile up along the way. Flat Circles: • Based on the Pizzolatto-isms we’ve heard so far, Amelia’s book seems like a tough read, but one passage from her book event in 1990 stands out: “Negation is deeper. It is the knowledge that every room you enter in the rest of your life, they should be there, and are not. Your memories become totems to that absence. A lost child is a story that’s never allowed to end.” In an episode given over to executive conspiracy, her words are a touching reminder of the human stakes still present for the Purcells and the community. • To introduce Devil’s Den as a known “cruising spot” this late in the season doesn’t suggest a well-considered take on Tom’s sexuality and how it figures into the larger story. Perhaps it will pay off down the line. • “He rested on the seventh. I always thought He should have put the extra day in, instead of half-assing it.” Hays has put God on notice.",The New York Times
2019,"‘True Detective’ Season 3, Episode 7: Missing Pieces","True Detective The documentary-within-a-show in this season’s “True Detective” has served as half illumination and half meta-commentary, a way to tease new thoughts from Detective Hays’s addled mind while taking shots at the current wave of true-crime docs, which have a tendency to dally around unresolved tragedies. Its director, Elisa Montgomery, may speak loftily about “the intersectionality of marginalized groups,” but she is passing through Hays’s life like a tourist, gawking at 35 years of dead ends, bad breaks and unfortunate lapses in judgment. And at the end of her stay, all Elisa can do is express disappointment over her visit: She knew he shared her skepticism over how the case was resolved, but he couldn’t provide her with “a missing piece.” “Young lady,” he replies. “my whole brain’s a bunch of missing pieces.” That sounds like a typical Nic Pizzolatto line, another salty lament from the bottom of the bottle. It’s a feature of the show that Pizzolatto’s detectives are broken people, because of either defining incidents from their past or their obsessions with the one big case that got away from them. Yet when Hays describes his brain as “a bunch of missing pieces,” it accounts for the entire design of the third season, which reflects how memory works. Over three timelines, the show has given us pieces of a puzzle that have never fit to Hays’s satisfaction, prompting him to circle back over assumptions and conclusions that haven’t stood up under scrutiny. By 2015, there are no borders in Hays’s mind between one time period and another: his visitation by the Viet Cong; his late-night wandering to the Purcells’ old neighborhood; and, in this episode, his memory of burning a man’s clothes in the backyard to cover up an interrogation gone wrong. For Elisa, interviewing Hays has been a frustrating act of excavation, as if she were spelunking into the dark, cavernous reaches of his mind to discover some elusive gem. She’s ticked that she doesn’t find it, but Pizzolatto suggests that she hasn’t earned it: This case has inspired her curiosity, but she hasn’t lived through its cascading tragedies and disappointments, so she doesn’t have the right to see it through. The nifty little twist in “The Final Country” is that Hays and West are using her for information, taking her theories on the case and following through on them after the shoot. The one-eyed man whom they had originally questioned about buying the corn husk dolls in 1980 — the same man who castigated Amelia at a book reading a decade later — is identified as a possible “procurer” for a pedophile ring. That leads the elderly partners to interview a former domestic worker at the Hoyt estate, who describes a one-eyed man who worked closely with Hoyt and the secretive goings-on that led to her departure. By now it’s clear that some unseen hand has been dictating where the investigation has gone. In 1980, the planting of Will’s backpack under the floorboards on Woodard’s deck was enough to close the case and pin both murders on the dead scavenger, despite Julie’s body never turning up. In 1990, Tom’s apparent suicide at Devil’s Den is staged to accomplish the same goal of putting the case to rest with the deceased. And when Hays and West tried, as free agents, to torture the truth out of Harris James, the gambit backfired so horribly that they couldn’t look into it any longer. A man in a black sedan has likely made certain of that. The bigger picture is starting to come into focus. Through Amelia’s sleuthing in the 1990 timeline, we discover that cousin Dan had some discussions with the one-eyed man at the bar where Lucy once worked. Through phone records and flight logs we also discover, again in 1990, that calls were exchanged between Lucy and a Hoyt number, and that Harris flew to Vegas the night before Lucy was found dead from an overdose. The dots are not quite connectable yet, but Hoyt, Harris, Lucy, Dan and the one-eyed man are all playing roles here, and no one, not least Hays and West, have had the power and political will to get to the bottom of it. The past few episodes of “True Detective” have busied themselves with unpacking this horrific conspiracy, but this week’s episode was especially effective in measuring the bruising cost of it — not just to our ragged heroes, but to the community at large. An incidental moment from the 1990 timeline hits the hardest: After Amelia visits one of the Purcell’s neighbors and procures a photograph of Will and Julie on Halloween, she asks the woman if she has ever thought about moving to town, away from this cursed place. “Why would I?” the woman replies. “Somebody’s got to stay. Somebody’s got to remember.” There are more mundane reasons that people continue to live in towns and neighborhoods like this after those communities have collapsed. But home is home, even when staying feels like tending a graveyard. Flat Circles: • One mystery that hasn’t been addressed is why Hays is estranged from his daughter Becca, but leaving that an open question makes her continued presence in his life more affecting. Here Hays is focused on a point of departure — first in a flashback when he drops her off at college, later when his dementia leads him to mistake a witness’s daughter for his own — and it seems possible that this may have been his last happy memory of her. • Amelia’s dropping a mention of “In Cold Blood” signals Pizzolatto’s own ambitions, for better or worse. “True Detective” was intended to be more than just another gruesome police procedural, even if it buckles under the weight of this pretension half the time. • This season has been building around the existence of a pedophile ring, but it has shown blessed restraint by not getting too explicit about it. The show hasn’t always favored leaving humanity’s ugliest impulses to the imagination. • So yes, the third season and the first season do exist in the same televisual universe. Let’s hope the Marvel-style crossovers end there.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Under the Eiffel Tower’ Review: In Whine, Truth","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Under the Eiffel Tower,” Stuart (Matt Walsh), an American bourbon expert fired for a “lack of passion,” likens his existence to the lives of quiet desperation described by Thoreau. “Desperation” seems too mild. When a friend (David Wain) invites Stuart to come along with him, his wife (Michaela Watkins) and their daughter (Dylan Gelula) on a French vacation, the trip has barely started before Stuart proposes marriage to the daughter — who is maybe half his age — at the base of the Eiffel Tower. And that’s before the title card. Rebounding from this mortifyingly dumb opening proves less difficult for Stuart than for the movie, directed by Archie Borders. The film is yet another ode to the restorative magic of wine country sunshine, which apparently also has the power to expose the story’s egregious midlife-crisis clichés. If you thought the men in “Sideways” were too schlubby, too pathetic, and the women too inexplicably accommodating, “Under the Eiffel Tower” is here to say, “Hold my Bordeaux.” Stuart quickly falls in with a rakish Scottish football player (Reid Scott) who teaches him to live for the moment; they end up disembarking from a train with a sophisticated vintner (Judith Godrèche) who awakens Stuart’s sense of chivalry. Godrèche, one of the producers, has perhaps masked her own quiet desperation trying to add depth to such a thankless role. There is some mildly amusing business involving the fate of the engagement ring, and Watkins turns up periodically to make withering remarks, serving as a de facto surrogate for the audience.

2019,‘Unprecedented’ Floods in Australia Force Hundreds to Evacuate,"MELBOURNE, Australia — After weeks of unrelenting heat and bushfires across the continent, torrential rain and flooding in northern Australia have forced hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes in what weather officials describe as an “unprecedented” event. Between Jan. 26 and the morning of Feb. 4, there was close to four feet of rain in Townsville, a coastal city in the state of Queensland, eclipsing records set in 1998 during a flood known as the “Night of Noah.” “In seven days, we’ve received our annual total rainfall,” said Jenny Hill, the mayor of Townsville. “We’ve never seen weather like this.” Ms. Hill said that about 18,000 residents had lost power and that hundreds of others had evacuated, including some who left their suburb on a garbage truck. Elsewhere, two police officers were stuck clinging to trees for half an hour after their car was washed away by floodwaters, while residents reported snakes and crocodiles roaming the streets. “Cannot stress it enough stay out of the water,” one woman urged on Facebook. The downpour pushed the nearby Ross River Dam to almost 250 percent of its capacity, forcing the floodgates open as officials instructed people to move to higher ground. Emergency crews, including about 1,500 members of the Australian military, helped rescue people and their pets with inflatable boats and treat others who were injured. As of Monday, state schools in Townsville and the surrounding areas were closed. Officials also urged residents to save water after the flooding burst pipes and put pressure on local treatment plants. “This continued heavy rain and flooding has damaged homes, isolated communities and displaced people from their homes,” Shannon Fentiman, the acting communities minister in Queensland, said in a statement. The floods have been declared a “catastrophe” by the Insurance Council of Australia, while the government is giving each displaced resident up to 180 Australian dollars, or $130, to help cover the cost of food, medication and clothing. Karl Sullivan, the general manager of risk at the insurance council, said that the high density of homes in “hazard areas” had increased the risk and cost of flooding. “We’re building more things that are more expensive” in “risky places,” he said. Mr. Sullivan said that thousands of properties were at risk and that the insurance council had already received about 2,500 claims in the Townsville area. The floods follow weeks of unrelenting heat across Australia, which caused mass animal die-offs, raging bushfires, and prolonged and severe drought. The back-to-back events have stretched the capacity of Australia’s emergency services to respond, said Martin Rice, the acting chief executive of the Climate Council, an Australian research group. He said that while it was difficult to attribute any one extreme weather event to climate change, warming air temperatures had increased the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, “causing more frequent and intense rainfall in northern Australia.” If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, Dr. Rice added, rainfall around the world is likely to become more intense, creating challenges for infrastructure, the environment and human health. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the rainfall on the Queensland coast since Jan. 26. Two feet of rain has fallen on average in the Townsville region, not two feet in Townsville.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Untogether’ Review: Adrift in Los Angeles, Looking for Love","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. As far as I can see, the main purpose of “Untogether” is to fetishize Jemima Kirke. Playing Andrea, a writer and barely clean heroin addict, Kirke is a Marilyn Monroe fantasy in vintage frocks and strawberry curls. Stripping, stretching, dancing and posing, she works the camera so assiduously that her latest sexual partner, Nick (Jamie Dornan), barely gets a look in. Not that Nick, an emotionally shuttered doctor with a successful memoir under his belt, would register any more forcefully were Andrea not perpetually wiggling between him and us. And he’s not alone in his lack of definition: there’s scarcely a behavior or line reading in this exasperating relationship drama that doesn’t feel like affectation. Fraudulence might be a plot point, but only the writer and director, Emma Forrest, knows why it has to permeate the entire movie. Defined by emotional damage in lieu of personalities, Andrea and her younger sister, Tara (played by Kirke’s real-life sister, Lola Kirke), bumble through separate romantic crises. While Andrea uses sex to coax love, Tara, an oversharing aesthetician, is pulling away from her middle-aged boyfriend (an underutilized Ben Mendelsohn) and toward a twinkling rabbi (Billy Crystal, if you can believe it). His civil rights-era stories and hip sermons (“Can Siri Google your soul?”) leave her breathless. Dreamily shot in Los Angeles by Autumn Durald Arkapaw, “Untogether” toys with themes of faith and self-knowledge. But in a movie where quips (“You look like velvet, but you’re Velcro”) too often substitute for conversation, insight is fleeting. Like its psychologically adrift characters, this debut feature comes fancily packaged; what’s inside, though, is mostly hot air.

2019,‘We Are Very Close to Getting Out of This’: Venezuelans Envision Their Country’s Future,"Venezuelan readers tell us where they think their country is heading, as two opposing leaders duel for power. Starvation stalks many in the oil-rich nation of Venezuela. Two leaders claim the presidency. And at night balaclava-clad security forces drive around on motorcycles, raiding the homes of protesters, threatening and sometimes killing them. Venezuela is a country gripped by crisis. After protesters took to the streets last month to denounce President Nicolás Maduro and embrace Juan Guaidó, who proclaimed himself the country’s rightful president, we asked Venezuelans to tell us how the crisis is affecting their outlook for the nation’s future and their willingness to be politically active in their country. We heard from more than 40 Venezuelans, including those living in the country and abroad. Some are buoyed by hope. Others are terrified. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been condensed and lightly edited. For 20 years I have been against this regime, but I have never been part of a formal political group. And I was silent for a few years due to fear and also because I did not see a clear picture to get out of this. We have been very afraid of repression, of dying at the hands of the criminal underworld or at the hands of the state security forces. However, we now trust that we are protected by the people on the street and by the support obtained at the international level. We are very close to getting out of this. I am a professional, and I have studied and worked all my life. My current biweekly salary is not enough to eat satisfactorily even one day. I am willing to participate civically and peacefully in all the calls made by President Guaidó that require massive support. I am willing to collaborate voluntarily in protecting and distributing humanitarian aid to the most needy people. Guaidó has presented himself with a very clear route, well studied and without improvisation, which makes us have faith that we are on the right track to restore our democracy. I am one of the more than three million Venezuelans exiled throughout the world. I am currently living in Argentina. What has affected me the most is knowing that the remittance money I send weekly is no longer enough for a three-day basket of market goods for the three people back home whom I help. The political change in Venezuela is unstoppable. These protests feel different because we are all united with a single conviction — which is to get Maduro out of Miraflores to start giving room to the transitional government led by Guaidó. Once the government transitions to democracy, I’m ready to devote myself to my country’s reconstruction and give all that I’ve learned on the outside. Apparently there are many countries that consider interventionism to be nothing more than pointing out violations of human rights. It feels as if they care more about our nation’s oil than all the people who die every day in Venezuela. The best way other countries can help is to recognize Guaidó as president in charge of the country. It is the most democratic way, and the more countries that join, the more isolated the Maduro regime will be. My willingness to take risks peaked in 2017. I, alongside some classmates, friends and colleagues, formed a group dedicated to properly documenting the general unrest in our city, since conventional media outlets had been silenced or forcefully closed. I exposed myself to the violence that people from La Resistencia faced daily in clashes against National Guard officials, armed “colectivos” loyal to the socialist cause and local police. After seeing how many people the government was willing to kill in a single day to solidify its power — tens of protesters, with zero hesitation — I decided to take a step back and start getting my affairs in order to leave the country. A year later in June 2018, heartbroken and hopeless, I left the country. Since Juan Guaidó took charge as the interim president, my hope has flourished again. I still feel some willingness to take those risks and be an active part of the change that’s going on. The responsibility that one feels to one’s native land hasn’t gone away. I’m an actor. I do theater. I offer help in communities. But I don’t involve myself with politicians, not voluntarily. I choose not to vote, and I choose to remain absent in the political game of this dictatorship. I don’t support Juan Guaidó, but I do support his movement. I see the hope in his actions, but I doubt the benevolence of the United States and its interest in my country. Getting help from other countries is not the right thing to do, but in this case it is necessary. I would choose to leave this place, but I have no choice. I’m scared of my future and scared for my friends and family, because I know we are not getting good news soon. Our older son left the country fleeing violence against students. It’s been a year and a half since we saw him. He went to Canada. Our younger son had an emergency surgery, but our health insurance had become worthless. We had to use the foreign currency savings that we had and get help from family and friends to cover the operation and hospitalization. I have spent 20 long years personally opposing this regime. For 13 of them, I was a Venezuelan public employee. In my position, I was ordered to march in support of the government and to wear a uniform that tied me to the regime. I always refused, and I invited them to fire me. They never did. I have a profound conviction about my duties and rights, and I believe that by persevering through constitutional and peaceful means, we will be a country of freedom and opportunities. Nobody will distract me from that purpose. Last year, I was a worker in the public sector, where the Chavista ideology was present on “Civic Mondays,” when you sung the national anthem to the flag, when there were calls to vote in the rigged elections of the regime. In my house we felt the crisis in many ways. Protein was rarely consumed. To make our typical arepa we needed to buy corn, to parboil and grind it — a process we had to do every day since we very rarely got the precooked cornmeal. It was available only on the street for prices that did not fit our budget. Coming from work and seeing people eating from the garbage, people with dry skin and short hair from poor diet, gave me a feeling of hopelessness. I could not stand watching my country decline every day. This and more made me emigrate to another country. In the past, I participated in various marches against the dictatorship. At that time, I was still a university student. But since Juan Guaidó took the presidency, I’ve participated in very few protests. If I return to Venezuela, I am willing to belong to any university or political movement that allows the advancement of democracy in my country. Venezuela could become the democracy we’ve been waiting for if we all remain united. Supporting a military intervention to end the regime would be the last option, but sometimes it is necessary in regimes that do not listen to their people. All my life I have seen only one government in my country, only one way of ruling things, and I’m deeply unhappy that every year the situation gets worse and worse. My family and I have lost weight. The hyperinflation makes it really difficult to buy substantial food; we only eat carbohydrates like arepa every day. There’s a really big pressure on me and people to emigrate, to leave the country, to seek what our parents earned when they were my age, like a house and a car, a decent living. A lot of members of my family have done that, and I think they are so brave for it. But I want to stay here. I’m willing to stay here and help rebuild my country, to make it decent again. I think we need young minds and fresh blood to make Venezuela anew.

2019,"‘We Were Friends, and Then We Started Killing Each Other.’ India Recalls Partition. Carefully.","AMRITSAR, India — How do you memorialize a holocaust that even now, seven decades after it took place, may still not be entirely safe to talk about? In 1947, as the British prepared to pull out of India, they put pen to map and, with a last bit of swagger from a fading colonial power, severed the country in two, creating Pakistan. What happened next as authority collapsed and more than 10 million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs scrambled to get to the right side of the new borders is recorded in witness accounts at the Partition Museum here in Amritsar. Sudarshana Kumari watched a mob impale her 1-year-old cousin on a spear. Amol Swani’s father held a can of fuel and some matches, instructing her to set herself afire if rioters broke into their home. And A. K. Anand saw terrified families fleeing villages by foot, in ox carts and on horseback, along roads littered with corpses picked apart by dogs and bloated from the rain. “Can you imagine?” he asks in a museum video. “We all became dumb and thought, ‘Yes, help us, God, save us.’” The exact toll is unknown, but historians estimate that between a few hundred thousand and two or three million people died. That was 70 years ago, but the ghosts of partition and the descent into chaos that followed it still hover over the country, and over Amritsar, the Indian city near the border with Pakistan where the museum opened in 2017. The city is dotted with Hindu temples, and tourists flock to see the palatial Sikh gurdwaras — but of the vibrant Muslim community that once lived here, there is little trace. The mere decision to open the museum, the first devoted to the partition, was fraught. For decades, a project of this kind was hard to imagine. Discussion of partition was left largely to academia. Some witnesses interviewed for the exhibits went most of their lives without telling their own children that they had fled across the new border. Few wanted to revisit those months of mayhem, kidnap, rape and murder, when neighbor turned on neighbor, mobs set trains carrying refugees on fire and many hands were bloody. And there was little encouragement for survivors to talk about what happened, said Faisal Devji, a professor of Indian history at the University of Oxford. “In the early years of independence,” he said, “the governments of India and Pakistan discouraged any recounting of partition’s violence, both so as to protect the religious minorities who might be blamed for it and to place a positive halo around the achievement of freedom.” CHINA AFGHAN. Amritsar Punjab PAKISTAN New Delhi INDIA Bangladesh Arabian Sea Bay of Bengal SRI LANKA 500 Miles By The New York Times As eyewitnesses die off, however, there has been a push in recent years to record their recollections. Record — but share cautiously. In 2009, Guneeta Singh Bhalla, a researcher in the United States, began interviewing survivors. Then that effort became the 1947 Partition Archive, a geographically ambitious project in which scholars and volunteers have conducted more than 7,500 interviews in 12 countries and 24 languages. Worried, however, that releasing some of the interviews might endanger participants — even after all these decades, and though most of the people who recounted their experiences were now in their 70s, 80s and 90s — researchers gave a lot of thought to the best way to share them, said Ms. Bhalla, executive director of the archive. “After consultation with experts at Holocaust memorials and psychologists here in India and Pakistan, as well,” she said, “we have concluded it would be irresponsible to put certain oral histories out in the open via YouTube.” The archive has shared the interviews through collaborations with Tata Trusts, Stanford University and Ashoka University, among others. Emotions remain raw. Some Indians like Kartar Singh, a broad and work-worn Sikh who is 88, wonder if the country can ever really heal. In a village of golden-tipped rice fields near Amritsar, Mr. Singh slid to the edge of a rope cot and recalled the Sikh mobs that had chased Muslims from his small community with knives and guns. When one Muslim man refused to leave India, instead kneeling in the dirt and facing Mecca, a Sikh rioter decapitated him, he said. “My soul was shot,” Mr. Singh said through sobs. “We were friends, and then we started killing each other.” At the Partition Museum, curators say they chose to take an unblinking look at the horrors of 1947, though not one unsympathetic to the people who were swept up by the passions. Mallika Ahluwalia, the museum’s chief executive, said merely displaying the collection in a city with a history like Amritsar’s invited a reckoning. In the fighting after partition, more than a third of the city’s buildings were destroyed and its Muslim population declined from nearly 50 percent to less than 1 percent. In the previous decades, the British had stoked tensions in the city among religious groups. “You have people flogging Indians,” Ms. Ahluwalia said. “You have them being made to rub their noses in the dirt. They are being tortured until they give false testimony.” One result was a rift between Hindus and Muslims that lasted to 1947 and beyond. India today still experiences violent flare-ups between religious groups. Each month, about 25,000 people visit the museum. They watch the videotaped interviews. They stare down a mock well like the one into which women jumped to their deaths to evade capture during the violence. They linger in a jail cell once used to hold Indian independence fighters. The exhibits put a human face to tragedy. There are letters between two childhood friends, one a Hindu in India, the other a Muslim in Pakistan, who pine for the days when they lived as neighbors, unencumbered by a border that forced them to communicate through “the cold lifeless medium of the written word.” There is a frayed inventory of the items that were divided between the two countries, including textiles and Indus Valley antiquities. “They took a 5,000-year-old necklace and said half the beads go to India, and half the beads go to Pakistan,” Ms. Ahluwalia said. And there are the items people carried as they trekked through monsoon rains to squalid refugee camps in new lands: a chipped food tin, a wedding sari, a woman’s winter coat. Most visitors who lived through partition have the same reaction as they wind through the exhibits, said the manager of the museum, Rajwinder Kaur: “They cry.” Opinion",The New York Times
2019,"‘What Men Want’ Review: A Mind-Reading Woman Flips the Script, Sort of","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “What Men Want” presumes a lot of things about its viewers. One is that they won’t tolerate a satire of workplace sexism if it doesn’t sometimes put the woman in her place. Another is a taste for Fiji water, an object of product placement so frequent that you worry for a drought in the South Pacific. Directed by Adam Shankman, this comedy flips the script on Nancy Meyers’s “What Women Want” (2000), in which a Chicago chauvinist (Mel Gibson) gets his comeuppance after gaining the power to hear women’s thoughts. This time, the mind reader is an Atlanta sports agent, Ali (Taraji P. Henson), who works at a boy’s club of a company and is repeatedly passed over for partner status. Her boss, Nick (Brian Bosworth), tells her, “You’re doing great in your lane.” But thanks to either a knock on the head or the laced tea given to her by a psychic (Erykah Badu), Ali begins to hear what men are thinking, the better to get sweet, sweet revenge. Part of the message, of course, is that it doesn’t take a mind reader to see that Ali’s colleagues — who court a star African-American basketball player (Shane Paul McGhie) with a racist video filled with bling and women — are complete boneheads, working in a frat house dressed up as an office. [Read our interview with Erykah Badu, who got her start in acting before turning to music.] While “What Men Want” starts off as a stinging critique, it undermines that message with one of Hollywood’s favorite idiotic subplots. Because the star player’s father (Tracy Morgan) doesn’t trust a woman without a family, Ali tries to pass off a one-night stand and his son (Aldis Hodge and Auston Moore) as her husband and child. Presumably Ali’s ability to hear their thoughts would make that charade easier. So would a simple conversation. But Ali is a bad communicator, and one lesson the movie deigns to teach her is to listen more carefully. If the original delivered payback to a sexist, the new film ought to let a victim of sexism turn the tables. “What Men Want” doesn’t stick to that conceit, however, despite such barbed moments as when Nick says aloud that he would fire Ali if he didn’t fear a #MeToo outcry. The film insists that Ali, like Gibson’s ad man, receive her comeuppance: She learns to respect her gay assistant (Josh Brener) and to be less selfish in her career and in bed. Memo to working women: Don’t be ball busters, or else. The gender politics of “What Men Want” only sometimes play as retrograde, though. The movie covers all its bases, determined to give every segment of the audience what it wants, with dubious success.

2019,‘Where the Hell Is HUD and Money?’ De Blasio’s Own Ally Pans Nycha Deal,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] “Where the hell is HUD and money?” Stanley Brezenoff, a career public servant in New York City since the 1970s, was deeply frustrated. On Jan. 31, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Ben Carson, the secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, struck a deal that subjected the New York City Housing Authority to federal oversight without any commitment of new federal funding. “I think that it is not a good agreement for Nycha and for the city,” Mr. Brezenoff, the outgoing Nycha chairman, said in an interview. Mr. Brezenoff, an ally of Mr. de Blasio who was hailed in April by the mayor as “one of the great public servants in the last generation,” said he believed the deal was unfair. It was bad for New Yorkers, he said, especially for the more than 400,000 who are living in dilapidated public housing riddled with problems, from leaks to heating issues and vermin. It let the federal government off the hook. “I’m a city guy. If I care about anything in my professional life, it’s the well-being of New York City,” Mr. Brezenoff said. “Honestly, that’s the prism I was looking at it from. Starting from: Where the hell is HUD and money?” After decades of reducing funds for Nycha, the federal government was now blaming mismanagement by New York City for the resulting deterioration of Nycha properties, and taking no financial responsibility. Mr. Brezenoff refused to sign the paperwork. “The city and Nycha have all the responsibility, limited authority and all of the financial burden,” he said. “That in a nutshell is why I’m against it.” But Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, said the threat of federal receivership was “very real,” and it was not the time for brinkmanship. “While the mayor respects Stan’s opinion and thanks him for his unrivaled legacy of public service, you don’t gamble or play a game of chicken when it’s your job to prevent Donald Trump from becoming the landlord of 400,000 public housing residents,” Mr. Phillips said. A HUD spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment. The agreement stops short of a full federal takeover of the city’s housing authority, something Mr. de Blasio opposed. In the announcement with Mr. Carson, Mr. de Blasio called it “a strong path forward and a very tangible path forward.” It includes the appointment of a powerful federal monitor — paid for by New York City — and a commitment from the city to spend an additional $2.2 billion over 10 years on repairs for its crumbling system of 175,000 public housing apartments. It also gives some authority to the federal housing secretary that is similar to a federal receiver, such as the ability to abrogate city contracts and go around Civil Service requirements. “This is a receiver in everything but name,” Mr. Brezenoff said. Because he refused to sign the deal, the general manager of Nycha, Vito Mustaciuolo, did so in his place. On Tuesday, City Hall announced that Mr. Brezenoff would be replaced as interim chairman of Nycha by the middle of the month. The city’s sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, was appointed to take over temporarily as officials hunt for a permanent leader. When Mr. de Blasio named Mr. Brezenoff to lead the troubled public housing authority in April, he did so amid scandal over its failure to properly inspect for lead, and in the middle of a sprawling federal investigation. Mr. Brezenoff, who by that point had already become the go-to Mr. Fix-It for Mr. de Blasio, took over weeks before the city and the authority moved to settle a case brought by the United States attorney, Geoffrey S. Berman, over dangerous conditions and endemic mismanagement at the authority. Mr. Brezenoff, 81, said that he had felt some hope late last year after a federal judge rejected the terms of the initial deal between Mr. de Blasio and the United States attorney’s office. The judge, William H. Pauley III, strongly suggested that the federal government should take over New York City public housing, even as he chastised federal officials for abdicating their legal responsibility to the residents of the nation’s largest public housing system. “A big part of what he said was that the resources are not there,” he said of the judge’s ruling. “I believe he was right.” Mr. Brezenoff did not like the settlement but signed on because, he said, he had only recently arrived. When, several months later, he was presented with essentially the same deal — but one that gave even more powers to HUD — he said no. “How is it possible for there to be this moralizing from the U.S. Attorney, as if Nycha was a creature unto itself, not dependent on federal resources?” he said. Experts on public housing have also placed the blame for Nycha’s troubles on a lack of federal investment. Nicholas Dagen Bloom, a professor at the New York Institute of Technology who studies the Housing Authority, said the agreement — and the performance goals it sets out for Nycha — could only be met with more money from Washington. “To reach these goals in all of the categories they set, you’d have to start fixing everything everywhere, now. And that money is not there,” Professor Bloom said. “If Congress doesn’t appropriate, you’re dealing with Whac-a-Mole.” Mr. Brezenoff said that after the rejection of the settlement, he argued for the Housing Authority to come up with its own plan. He wanted to resist pressure from Mr. Carson, who late last year threatened to declare the authority in “substantial default,” which could lead to a takeover. The federal government, Mr. Brezenoff said in the interview, “bears a lot of the responsibility and therefore should bear a good deal — in my view, all — of the financial burden.” “Call their bluff,” said Mr. Brezenoff — a longtime poker player — speaking of the federal government. “You say: ‘You do it,’” he added, and without additional money from the city. Mr. Brezenoff acknowledged that the decision was not his to make. He said that Mr. de Blasio “believes passionately” that there should be no federal takeover of any city responsibility. “The mayor makes those calls, not me. I’m a soldier in that sense,” he said. “But I get to choose whether I stay or not. “So I was ready to go.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Why Have a Large Library and Not Use It?’ Janet Malcolm: By the Book,"By the Book The journalist, whose new book is “Nobody’s Looking at You: Essays,” read indiscriminately in her youth: “Bookish children are not critics. They just like to read.” What books are on your nightstand? I take it you mean the imaginary Doric column that supports a teetering pile of current and old books that the interviewee wants to bring to the reader’s attention. My actual nightstand is a small wood table with a box of Kleenex, a two-year-old Garnet Hill catalog and a cough drop on it. When I go to bed I bring with me the book I am reading during the day. Right now it is the British edition of Sally Rooney’s brilliant, enigmatic new novel, “Normal People.” How do you organize your books? I organize them by genre. The largest section is fiction, which I alphabetize. I also alphabetize poetry. The other sections — biography, autobiography, theater, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, history, classical literature, literary criticism, art, photography, books by friends — are not alphabetized. I can find my way around them. I have been doing a lot of rereading in recent years. Why have a large library and not use it? Why keep books, if you are not going to read them more than once? For the décor? The answer isn’t entirely no. A book-lined room looks nice. I like walking into my living room and seeing the walls of books with faded spines that have accreted over many decades. [ Read our review of “Nobody’s Looking at You.” ] What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? “Our Princesses and Their Dogs,” by Michael Chance, which was given to me by my British son-in-law for Christmas a few years ago. People who know me associate me with cats rather than dogs, but in this case that has no bearing on the book’s prominent place in my heart. It was published in 1936, when the princesses’ uncle Edward had not yet abdicated and their dad was just Bertie, Duke of York. But it is almost as if the author could see into the future and recognize the family’s special monarchical fitness. Its benign charisma wafts out from delicate black-and-white photographs, and from a text that can only be read — if it is not to be found entirely risible — as an allegory of the relation of royalty to its people. Chance writes largely from the points of view of the family’s happy dogs — two corgis named Dookie and Lady Jane, three Labradors named Mimsy, Stiffy and Scrummy, a Tibetan lion dog named Choo-choo, a golden retriever named Judy and a cocker spaniel named Ben — pausing only to praise the owners for being “not merely people who love dogs but warmhearted, human people who, understanding their animals, are therefore understood by them in return.” At 9, Elizabeth already has the kindly placidity of the queen she is to become. Five-year-old Margaret steals the show with her mischievous charm. Margaret’s adult life of petulant desperation, mordantly chronicled in Craig Brown’s 2018 book “Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret,” could not have been foreseen in a million years by readers of “Our Princesses and Their Dogs.” What books would you recommend to someone who wants to know more about American culture? “Democracy in America,” by Alexis de Tocqueville, “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” by Mark Twain, and “The Other America,” by Michael Harrington. Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most? The poet Louise Glück, the short story writer Alice Munro, the journalist/essayist Ian Frazier, the journalist/biographer Calvin Tomkins, the critic Sharon Cameron, the journalist/essayist Michael Greenberg, the art historian Michael Fried. May I stretch your “working today” criteria to include Richard Wilbur and Philip Roth, who, in the eye of eternity, were still working the day before yesterday? Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like and didn’t? Barack Obama’s “Dreams From My Father.” It is good or good enough (“You’re likable enough, Hillary”) but it isn’t Rousseau’s “Confessions” or Gosse’s “Father and Son.” The extravagant praise it received seemed excessive to me. Obama himself is another matter. I came to intensely admire and appreciate him over the years of his presidency. I believe he is a great man. What kind of reader were you as a child? An avid reader, to use Robert Gottlieb’s wonderful phrase. I read everything in sight. I read the Grimm fairy tales, “Heidi,” “Little Women,” “Emily of New Moon,” “Little Lord Fauntleroy,” “The Snow Queen”; I went to the library every week and took out the four books you were allowed to borrow. I liked contemporary romantic novels with hints of sex (“he unbuttoned the top two buttons of her blouse”). My father would give my sister and me classics for birthdays and Christmas — “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” “Les Misérables,” “David Copperfield” among them. I didn’t differentiate between the adult masterpieces, the cheesy adult books and the children’s classics. Bookish children are not critics. They just like to read. What do you plan to read next? I plan to go back to “Bleak House,” which I put aside during the holidays. It was like a boulder that was standing in the way of shorter books that were in the house, tempting me with their bigger type and smaller ambition. For example, Alexander McCall Smith’s cozy (though by no means trivial) new No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency novel, “The Colors of All the Cattle.” Now I am ready to return to the wild terrain of Dickens’s great work. Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? I love all of Jane Austen’s major heroines — Lizzie Bennet, Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse, Anne Elliot and Elinor Dashwood — and one of Tolstoy’s heroes, Prince Andrei. I also very much like Ántonia Shimerda, the heroine of Willa Cather’s “My Ántonia.” A favorite antihero or villain? There are none. I follow the author’s direction to despise him or her. On second thought, I must confess to a sneaking liking for the antiheroine Lizzie Eustace — as Trollope himself surely had. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? I like books in the genre that could be described as the bee-in-your-bonnet genre, books in which the author has an obsessive thesis, and argues it so brilliantly that you come away completely convinced and elated by the erudition that has powered the argument. Some examples are: Edward Said’s “Orientalism,” Leo Steinberg’s “The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion,” Ted Hughes’s “Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being” and Edgar Wind’s “Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance.” Among the genres I avoid are books on bodybuilding and moneymaking. What’s the last book you recommended to someone in your family? The 13-volume edition of Anton Chekhov’s stories translated by Constance Garnett. When do you read? All the time.",The New York Times
2019,‘Woman at War’ Review: Industrial Blight as Icelandic Fable,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Approaching weighty themes with a very light touch, Benedikt Erlingsson’s “Woman at War” is an environmental drama wrapped in whimsical comedy and tied with a bow of midlife soul-searching. The package is lumpy at times, but not unwieldy, thanks to an engaging central performance and a cinematographer, Bergsteinn Bjorgulfsson, whose sweeping shots of frozen heath and lowering Icelandic skies wash the screen — and our minds — of extraneous distractions. The movie’s heart and spine is Halla (Halldora Geirharosdottir), 50, a sunny choir director and fearless eco-activist. Intent on halting the construction of a new aluminum smelter outside Reykjavik, she sabotages power lines and demolishes the drones deployed to deter her. So far, she has eluded capture despite increasingly daring exploits; and when we see no partner or family other than an identical twin sister (also played by Geirharosdottir), we wonder if her adventures are filling more than just a need to save her homeland. The arrival of a letter announcing that her application to adopt a child, filed years earlier, has been approved, strengthens that suspicion. Yet as Halla teeters between motherhood and vandalism — between creation and destruction — her embrace of the natural world intensifies. A dead sheep’s carcass shields her from helicopters, and, later, hot springs revive her frozen body. Often she’s pictured moving through water or clinging to the earth, face buried in gorse and arms flung wide, as if trying to stop her world from spinning. Surreal touches, like pop-up musicians only Halla can see, give the movie’s politics a playful, fairy-tale cast, but “Woman at War” is more captivated by Halla’s internal struggle. Should she raise a child or change the world? Or can the first achieve the second?

2019,"‘Wrestle’ Review: On the Mat, Fighting for a Future","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Profiling four members of an underdog high-school wrestling team in Huntsville, Alabama, “Wrestle” constructs an empathetic portrait of a mat that’s anything but level. Filmed in 2015-16 during its third season, the team is already defeating more experienced and better-financed opponents. Yet, as the countdown to the State Championship begins, we see how deprivation can hobble the most promising talent. Parents are incarcerated or otherwise invisible, and the school, with one of the highest concentrations of poor students in the state, has been listed as failing for years. Resources for athletics are virtually nonexistent. Capturing over 600 hours of vérité footage, the directors Suzannah Herbert and Lauren Belfer observe the young men’s chaotic personal lives as closely as their wrestling. Sinisa Kukic’s camera is gentle and unobtrusive (he and Herbert moved to Huntsville for the duration), quietly watching as Jailen, fine-boned and wide-eyed, is accused by the police of public urination; the genial Jaquan is pulled over for a dimming taillight; and Jamario battles anxiety over the pressure to graduate and provide for his pregnant girlfriend. Their teammate Teague, given to ingenious last-minute contortions on the mat, cheerfully admits to being prescribed multiple medications that he doesn’t take, preferring to self-medicate with marijuana. Watched over by their inexhaustible and caring young coach, Chris Scribner — a former screw-up who recognizes that the chances he was given will probably be denied his students — the four stumble toward State. “Wrestle” isn’t slick or impartial, and doesn’t claim to be, yet the movie has a raw honesty that disdains forced uplift. So when we hear the words “I need help,” the plea is so generally applicable that it scarcely matters who has spoken.

2019,"‘Wrong Side of History’: In Queens, Amazon Deal’s Demise Reveals Deep Divisions","Shortly after news broke on Thursday that Amazon was abandoning its plans for a campus in Long Island City, Queens, local elected officials and activist groups who had opposed the deal held a celebratory rally near the site where the company had planned to build its new offices. But along with those cheering the deal’s demise, many hecklers from another faction appeared — those who supported Amazon coming to New York and blamed opponents for torpedoing a deal that would have brought sorely needed jobs and improvements to the community. “Where you gonna get the jobs?” one heckler shouted. [For the full story on Amazon’s decision to pull out of New York, read more here.] And so, as the Amazon news reverberated around New York City and beyond on Thursday, perhaps nowhere did it get a more divided reception than in Long Island City, the neighborhood that would have undergone the biggest transformation as a result of the deal.

For many, the deal carried the potential to turn Long Island City into a major tech hub and an attractive corridor for bars, restaurants and stores.

Smith, a real estate broker who lives and works in Long Island City. But the deal also ignited social and economic tensions in an area where luxury residential developments rub up against low-income areas like Queensbridge and the other housing projects. Some longtime residents were concerned that the company’s arrival would exacerbate the ongoing gentrification and luxury development in the neighborhood, while others said whatever drawbacks were worth the economic windfall the deal would generate. “I can’t see why bringing a company here when we’re losing companies is a problem,” said Cory Watson-El, 41, a U.P.S. driver with a route in Long Island City. Amazon’s arrival would have helped offset job losses caused by the departure of other large employers, he said, including FreshDirect, which moved from Long Island City to the Bronx last year.

2019,"‘Wrong Side of History’: In Queens, Amazon Deal’s Demise Reveals Deep Divisions","Shortly after news broke on Thursday that Amazon was abandoning its plans for a campus in Long Island City, Queens, local elected officials and activist groups who had opposed the deal held a celebratory rally near the site where the company had planned to build its new offices. But along with those cheering the deal’s demise, many hecklers from another faction appeared — those who supported Amazon coming to New York and blamed opponents for torpedoing a deal that would have brought sorely needed jobs and improvements to the community. “Where you gonna get the jobs?” one heckler shouted. [For the full story on Amazon’s decision to pull out of New York, read more here.] And so, as the Amazon news reverberated around New York City and beyond on Thursday, perhaps nowhere did it get a more divided reception than in Long Island City, the neighborhood that would have undergone the biggest transformation as a result of the deal.

2019,‘You Brought Us Here. What’s for Lunch?’,"Letter 93 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. ___ Just before a panel on the Australian election at Twitter’s offices in Sydney on Wednesday, Chris Uhlmann, the Nine Network’s political editor, asked how it’s going for The New York Times in Australia, and what I make of the country. It’s a question I get a lot so I ran through what I often mention: That subscriptions are growing but we’re still learning; that I find the country to be more complex than it presents itself to be; that I love living here; and that in terms of government, it’s a surprisingly secretive place. Chris agreed with that last point wholeheartedly, and offered an enlightening comparison to the United States that I thought Australia Letter readers might want to chew over and comment on. He tied the dynamics to history. In the United States, he said, people don’t trust government because the country was founded by religious zealots who fled British persecution. “But in Australia the government brought the people here,” Chris said, “and the government doesn’t trust the people.” That means, he said, public officials behave more like their prison guard ancestors: They protect themselves; they limit information sharing to insiders. And rather than railing against government or starting revolutions, Australians tend to be accepting of what the government says. As Chris put it, it’s the attitude of, “You brought us here. What’s for lunch?” Feel free to howl your support or derision for that idea in our NYT Australia Facebook group or by email (nytaustralia@nytimes.com). But Chris’s larger point — and I’ve heard this from many others in Australia, including a few former prime ministers — was that our two democracies are very different, not just in structure, but also in the deeper recesses of national identity, which shape how government and the governed interact. And on the secrecy point, there’s more to say. It came up again when we were on the panel, when an audience member asked how it affects Australian politics and news media. There are a lot of answers to that question — but the one I emphasized involved the dearth of independent data. You can watch the Twitter livestream here to see exactly what I said, but here’s a slightly fuller explanation with a couple of the examples I had in mind. Exhibit A: Immigration and Egalitarianism Australia is in the midst of a heated debate about how much immigration is too much, but there’s a lot we don’t know (beyond anecdotal cases) about who gets in or turned down and how that might be changing. The Department of Home Affairs did not publicly release last year’s annual immigration report so we can all see how the system works. Rather, a few months ago, just a piece of it leaked to The Australian — noting a migration decrease, in line with The Australian’s conservative politics. Our requests for the raw data and full report have been repeatedly denied. More broadly, when it comes to research around race and discrimination, Australia has fewer trustworthy statistical sources than it needs, whether it’s about achievement in schools, health care, or other sectors that might help the country see how its multiculturalism plays out in public institutions. Academics tell me the data collection either isn’t there, hampering in-depth analysis, or it’s in bits and pieces. When researchers do pull those elements together, there are signs of a major problem with segregation. But without more information it’s hard to accurately assess how one of Australia’s biggest changes over the past 50 years — its rapid growth into becoming an increasingly diverse, multiethnic society — is developing and evolving. Exhibit B: Time-Use Data Gaps in data also undermine Australia’s understanding of itself and global changes in technology, gender and work. A few weeks ago, for example, I was looking for information that would support my hunch that Australians are simply better than Americans (and much of Europe) at work-life balance. I went looking for what is a pretty standard data set worldwide, the results of a national time-use survey. These time-use surveys are hardly groundbreaking or innovative. In the United States and elsewhere they measure “the amount of time people spend doing various activities, such as paid work, child care, volunteering, and socializing.” I expected that there would be one in Australia too. Wrong. The last time-use survey in Australia was completed in 2006. Before smartphones. Before the global financial crisis. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does conduct research on work and technology in general (and the work is strong), but a broader examination of how Australians spend their time is totally out of date. The Labor party has promised to restore the survey if they win the upcoming election. But even then, the next survey wouldn’t get started until 2020. Why It Matters If the government collected and openly shared more data about Australian life, policy debates would be richer, and the partisan divide might be less extreme. That’s in both politics and media. Imagine a world in which governments (all governments, or at least all democracies, because this is a problem found not just in Australia) valued transparency enough to do more research on their own and to strengthen not just public disclosure laws, but also their enforcement. Imagine a world in which leaks and crisis committees — royal commissions in Australia, independent counsels in the United States — were less common and less needed. It would mean more clarity and undisputed facts in our social media streams. It would mean that conversations about security, inequality, corruption and a bunch of other things would be less reliant on anonymous sources with questionable motives. In short, it would mean government — regardless of a country’s history or the quirks of its founders — doing what it is supposed to do: serving the people.

Each calendar reveals something about how the people who created it relate to the world around them while also preserving rich cultural identities and memories.” ___ Not all complaints, in restaurants or in life, are created equal, as our critic Pete Wells points out in this useful (and insightful) guide about how to provide constructive criticism.

2019,’70s Rock,"daily crossword column Will Nediger puts the cart before the horse. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’ve either got the midweek malaise or a virus, so I’m going to offer you just the basics today. Please feel free to discuss the rest among yourselves. This was a very clever puzzle by Will Nediger, and the theme eluded me for quite some time. The “Aha!” moment, however, was delicious. 39A: As a devotee of ’70s rock music, I had a hard time not envisioning ELO or ELP for this three letter entry. But with that question mark, the answer happens to be PET, as in PET rock. Yes, kids, you read that right. There was a time when millions of people paid $3.95 each — this was in 1970s dollars, worth approximately $18.64 today — for a novelty item that consisted of a cardboard box (complete with air holes), some wood shavings, a manual for the care and upkeep of your pet and, of course, a rock. No, it wasn’t a sentient rock. It was your plain old, basic rock. So the next time your grandparents make fun of your fidget spinners, ask them how their Pet Rock is doing. 2D: Hand up if you couldn’t get Margaret Thatcher out of your brain after reading the clue “Thatcher’s creation.” Me too. But we are not supposed to be thinking of her; that is just clever misdirection. A thatcher can also be someone who makes a thatched ROOF. 11D: “Park place?” isn’t the Monopoly property (“place” would be capitalized). In this puzzle, it is a place where one might park the car, and that would be a CURB. 25D: Without the question mark, “Auto-reply?” is the automated message you might leave on your email if you are out of the office on vacation, not that I would know. In this puzzle, however, the answer is ECHO, because an ECHO is an automatic response to sound waves hitting a surface. On the right side of the grid, Mr. Nediger has compiled a set of three words that typically have the prefix “pre-.” (Hey, “prefix” might have made a good entry.) The “pre-” is removed, leaving a real word that means something else and is clued that way. A synonym for the “pre-” word is on the left. I’m not sure if that’s a convoluted way of explaining it or if the cold medication is kicking in, but either way, “pre-” word minus “pre-” on the right, synonym for “pre-” word on the left. For example, at 22A, the answer to the clue “Go for a stroll” is AMBLE. Makes sense. But then we have 20A’s “Pre-22-Across,” and what does that mean? When you solve some of the crossings, the answer turns out to be FOREWORD. And when is an AMBLE a FOREWORD? When you add the “pre-” in the clue to it: PREAMBLE. I’m always happy when I can include a trendy contemporary author in a puzzle, so I was happy that Will kept my Colson Whitehead clue — COLSON’s been in the puzzle before, but always clued in reference to Chuck Colson. (It’s unfortunate for Celeste NG and Yiyun LI that two-letter words are a no-no!) Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2019,日本のワーキングマザー　妻の過大な負担・夫の過少な支援,先進国のどの国よりも、家事負担の割合が少ない日本の男性。家事負担が女性に集中していることが、女性がより良い仕事に就くこと、ひいては経済成長を難しくしている。 夕食後、家族の洗濯をこなすヨシダカズコさんCreditCreditAndrea DiCenzo for The New York Times 東京 — 　ニシマサヨシコさんの書類作業は、いくらやっても終らない。 彼女は、毎日こと細かに記録をつけなければならず、それ以外にも注意深くチェックし、押印しなくてはならない書類をたくさん抱えている。日々の会話、行動、食事の内容までもすべて記録するのだ。 これらの作業のうち、マーケティングのプロである彼女の仕事のためのものはひとつもない。すべて、子供たちの保育園に必要な書類で、彼女が出社前に片付けるものなのだ。 38歳のニシマサさんは、日本のほかの多くのワーキングマザーと同様に、仕事とは無関係の、しかし骨の折れる事務的作業を山ほど抱えている。このような作業は、彼女の働く機会を制限している。今、日本は、彼女のような女性にもっと働いてもらう必要があると、唱えているのにも関わらず、だ。 安倍晋三首相は、「ウィメノミクス」というキャッチフレーズの女性活躍推進戦略を提唱し、停滞する日本経済を活性化させる明確な目標を掲げている。 1月に開かれた世界経済フォーラム年次総会（ダボス会議）で、安倍首相は日本の女性の労働参加率は67％になり、日本では歴代再考となり、「米国などより高い比率になった」と胸を張った。 しかし、日本の多くの女性は職場で限られた役割に甘んじている。女性の、ひいては日本全体の願望の最大の障害のひとつが、彼女たちの肩にのしかかる、家庭での家事や育児の負担だ。 これは、日本という国に根強く残る性別役割分担の名残からくるものだ。日本の女性たちの労働参加率が記録的な高さを更新している一方、彼女たちの膨大な家事や育児の負担は減る気配がない。しかも、男性の手助けがないのは典型である。 事実、日本の男性が家事や育児に割く時間は、世界の先進国の中で最も短い。 慶応義塾大学経済学部の津谷典子教授の分析によると、週49時間働く女性の家事労働時間は平均25時間近くだという。一方、夫たちの家事労働時間は平均5時間弱だ。 「女性をとりまく雇用状況の変化と比較すると、家庭内での男女の関係性は、全く変化がない、もしくは、全く欠如しています」と津谷教授は言う。 ニシマサさんの日々のスケジュールをみてみよう。彼女の下の子供二人が通う保育園では、子供の体温、1日二回何を食べたか、気分はどうか、睡眠時間、遊んだ時間を、すべて記録することを家族に課している。その上、彼女の8歳の息子が通う小学校と放課後の塾でも、すべての宿題を親が確認することになっている。 記録をつけるのは序の口だ。日本では、料理や掃除、洗濯も、欧米人を圧倒的に超えるレベルなのだ。日本の一般的な夕食には、たくさんの種類のおかずが並ぶ。お弁当は芸術作品の域だ。食洗機はまだあまり普及していない。洗濯は、といえば、大容量の衣類乾燥機を持っている家庭は少なく、濡れた洗濯物は物干しにかけるのが一般的だ。 彼女は、この家事のほとんどをこなしている。 経営コンサルタントである彼女の夫は、しばしば、夜遅くまで仕事をするが、たまにクライアントと飲みに出かけることがある。このような働き方も、日本では、特に男性に対しては、当然のこととして期待される。 しかし、日本経済は、ニシマサさんのような高い教育を受けた女性が能力を最大限発揮することを必要としている。第二次世界大戦後の高度経済成長期には、日本の女性たちは、結婚や出産を機に、退職するのが一般的だった。女性たちは家庭を守り、夫たちは「日本株式会社」の成長を支えるため、過酷な長時間労働を強いられてきた。 1970年代の後半ごろから、既婚女性たちが徐々に働き始めた。そして、1990年代初め、株価と土地のバブルがはじけ、多くの既婚女性たちが家計を支えるために仕事に復帰した。 その後、かつてはアジアの経済を牽引してきた日本だったが、長い経済停滞から、なかなか浮上できず苦しんだ。日本は世界第2位の経済大国の地位を、2011年、中国に明け渡した。安倍首相は、日本経済を再び成長軌道に乗せ、世界に忘れ去られないために努力していることを、繰り返しアピールしてきた。 人口減少と高齢化に直面して、日本の雇用主は労働力確保に苦戦している。政府は、外国人就労ビザを部分的に緩和したものの、移民の大幅な受け入れ拡大については否定的な姿勢をとっている。そのため、安倍首相は、長期にわたって経済を支えるために女性に働いてもらうことの重要性を強調してきた。 しかし、働く女性の半数近くはパートタイムで働いており、半数以上は期限付きの契約社員として働いていることがで、男女の大きい賃金格差が固定化されている。 OECDの調査によると、世界の先進国の女性の管理職の平均は4.6パーセントと比較して、日本は、１パーセント以下である。 安倍首相が「ウィメノミクス」政策の策定に影響を与えたレポートを執筆した、東京のゴールドマンサックスのチーフ日本株ストラテジストのキャシー松井さんは、女性の雇用率を男性と同様のレベルにまで引き上げることができれば、日本の経済力は10％以上向上すると指摘している。 そして、もし女性がよりレベルの高いキャリアを実現し、見合った給与を受け取ることができれば、日本経済を押し上げる力はさらに大きくなると付け加える。「でも、それを実現するために、何ができるのでしょうか？」 今現在、日本の女性たちは両刃の剣に直面している。 ニシマサさんの雇用主である日本企業は、他の多くの日本企業と同じく、彼女がかかえる多くの家事や育児をこなせる働き方を許容している。彼女は、一番下の2歳の子供が小学3年生になるまでは、時短で7時間だけ働ける一方で、給与は3割カットされる。子供が生まれる前までしていたような残業を、今ではまったく命じられることはない。かつては、毎日午後10時かそれ以降まで働いていたのにだ。しかし、そのせいで、彼女は8年間昇進がなく、昇給もわずかしかない。 「どうしてかと上司に尋ねたら、私が時短で、仕事の成果も少なくなっているからだ、と言われました」 ニシマサさんは、東京の一流大学を卒業後、教科書の出版社に営業職として入社した。明るい性格と、会話はずませるのが上手な彼女は、すぐに成果をあげた。 4年後に結婚。すると会社から、彼女の処遇を、既婚女性に対する慣習により、パートタイムに切り替えると言われたことにとても驚いた、と話した。 ニシマサさんは転職先を探しはじめた。面接に行った先の会社でも「あなたは夜遅くまで働けないよね？」「旦那さんはあなたがどれだけ忙しくなるか理解してくれるのかな？」などと言われた、という。 転職活動を経て入社した出版社では、結婚しているかどうかは問われなかったという。しかし、労働時間は長く、29歳で妊娠した時、ニシマサさんは仕事のペースを落とさず、深夜までオフィスで仕事をこなし続けた。妊娠初期に流産してしまった。 ２度目の妊娠した際にも、こなせる仕事量が減っていると周囲に思われないように、長時間働き続けた。午後10時に退社する際、「私が一番早く帰宅していたので、同僚に謝りながら帰っていました」 出産後も、ニシマサさんは仕事を辞めようとは考えなかった。しかし、彼女の夫は、昇給や昇進のために厳しい目標を達成しなければならず、結局彼女が育児のために仕事を減らすことにした。 「理論的には、ヨシコがもっと働いて、私の仕事量を減らしても良いのですが、現実としては、なかなか難しいのです」と、夫のニシマサカズヒロさんは説明した。 ある日、家事と育児に忙しくしていたニシマサさんに災難が降りかかる。雨模様のある朝、ニシマサさんは保育園で必要な着替え、タオル、フキン、水筒などをつめた大きな袋を二つをもって階段を駆け下りていた。急ぐあまり彼女は滑って転び、足を骨折してしまったのだ。 「頑張りすぎていたんです」 ニシマサさんが怪我をした直後の2か月間だけは、夫のカズヒロさんは早く帰宅するようになった。また、仕事前に、子供達を保育園に送り届けることにした。これは、カズヒロさんが今でも家族のためにこなしている数少ない仕事の一つだ。 そして現在、カズヒロさんは、住宅ローンを返済するためにも、長時間労働の日々に戻っている。午後10時前に帰宅することはまれで、もっと遅く帰ってくることも多い。土曜日は、カズヒロさんは遅くまで寝ている間に、妻が子供達をピアノ教室やスポーツ教室に連れて出す。　 ヨシコさんが足を骨折したときを除いて、カズヒロさんが仕事場を昼間に抜けたことは一度もない。子供達が病気や怪我をしたり、学校が早く終わる時など、連絡を受けるのはいつもヨシコさんだ。 ヨシコさんは週に一日、早く出社している。子供達に服を着せ、朝食を用意し、オフィスに赴く。同僚たちが出社する前に静かな時間を確保するためだ。 「その時間を確保しておかないと、家事や子供のことを、夫はすべて私にまかせっきりにしますから」 第一子の出産後、仕事に復帰する日本の母親の割合は、全体の約半数だ。しかし、日本の母親たちの多くがパートで働いている一方で、夫たちは過酷な長時間労働を続けている。この状況が、過労死という現象を生じさせている。 長時間労働を前提とする日本の文化は不必要であり、非効率と生産性の低さにつながっていると、指摘する専門家もいる。もし、すべての人が労働時間を短縮すれば、女性が同等に並ぶことができ、同時に日本社会全体も恩恵を受けるだろうと主張する。しかし、日本の企業文化を変えようとする働きかけにも関わらず、未だに長時間労働は当たり前として残っているために、男性のが家事や育児に割く時間が取れないのだ。単純に男性には（家事育児の）時間がないのだ。 シラキューズ大学で政治学の准教授を務めるマルガリータ・エステベス＝アベは、「もし、日本の労働時間が短縮されれば、若い世代の男性たちは父親としてもっと働けるでしょう」と指摘する。 日本社会に根強く残る文化的期待も大きなハードルになっている。 昨年、住宅メーカーの大和ハウス工業が、300組の夫婦を対象に実施した「共働き夫婦の『家事』についての意識調査」では、男性も女性も、家事の9割近くを妻が負担していると回答した。そして、多くの家事について、夫は認識していないとという結果が出た。この調査結果は、＃名もなき家事、というハッシュタグとともにソーシャルメディア上で拡散された。 「男性側の意識はまだ低いと思います」と話すのは、東京でグラフィックデザイナーとして活動するヨシダカズコさん(38)だ。「私の夫には、男女平等という概念がないですね」 ヨシダさんは毎日、子供達の送り迎えをし、食事を作り、掃除をし、入浴させ、子供を寝かしつける。保育園で、子供のために手作りの人形をするよう指示された時、ヨシダさんは夜なべして人形を縫った。 ヨシダさんの夫は、家で何もしなかった自分の父親よりは、子供達ともっと関わりを持ちたい、しかし、二人の小さな子供達を自分で世話する自信はないと話す。 「仕事が大変なんです。夜遅く帰ってきて、朝もヘトヘトになんです」 ヨシダさんは、子どもを迎えに行くため、オフィスを出た。駅につくとヨシダさんは、ホームの椅子に腰掛け、混んだ電車に乗る前に、列車を二本見送った。この瞬間が、この日唯一の休憩時間だった。 ニシマサさんは、金曜日の午後、都心の職場から5歳の娘のメイちゃんと2歳の息子ハルキ君の保育園へと急いだ。園に到着してすぐ、積み重なっている子供用の布団の前に、直行した。 二人の子供の昼寝用の布団を取り出し、シーツをはがし、家で洗ってきた綺麗なシーツをかけた。翌日の土曜日にも、綺麗なシーツをもって保育園にくることもある。月曜日のバタバタを少しでも軽減したいからだ。 そして、週末に洗わなくてはならないメイちゃんの上履きを回収した。その後、保育士がニシマサさんに工作用紙を渡した。これは、週末に国旗を作る宿題用だ。 外に出たニシマサさんは、突風が吹く中、メイちゃんとハルキ君を自転車に乗せる。洗濯物の詰め込まれた袋にくまのぬいぐるみを押し込み、スカートの裾を引き上げて、自転車に乗り、家路についた。 3人は午後6時を少し過ぎに帰宅。10分後、一番上の息子である8歳のカズアキ君が学童から帰宅する。ランドセルを床にドンと置き、ハルキ君が持っている飴を奪った。小さな弟は憤慨する。 ニシマサさんはキッチンでエプロンをつけ、食材を切り、食事を作り始める。夕食のメニューは、きゅうりのマリネとトマトサラダ、からし菜の胡麻和え、蒸しかぼちゃ。それに、味噌汁とごはんだ。 子供達はたくさん並べられたご飯に集中せず、マンガに釘付けになっている。ニシマサさんは、ご飯を少し口にしながら、保育園から持ちかえった洗濯物を洗濯機に入れ、お風呂を沸かしている。そして、カズアキ君が先生から直すように指摘された宿題の箇所を確認しながら、食器を洗い、残り物を片付ける。 子どもたちは、順番にお風呂に入り、出てくる。ニシマサさんは子供達を寝かせつけようとするが、なかなか寝ようとしない。午後9時を過ぎて、彼女は、温かいうちに飲めるといいなと思いながら、コーヒー淹れる。 午後10時前に、彼女の電話にメールが届く。クライアントとの飲み会に出ていた夫からではない。子供の友人の母親から、翌朝、夫たちが寝ている間に、子連れで一緒に朝ごはんを食べながら遊ばせようという誘いだった。 ニシマサさんは保育園の日誌を書く「作業」を始める。最後の力を振り絞って、掃除機でリビングの床を掃除した。 ようやく、全員が寝室に入っても、子供達はバタバタと騒いでいる。 「もういや！」とハルキ君。 「ママもいやだよ」とニシマサさんが落ち着いた調子でいった。「もう寝ようね！」 ニシマサ家は夜11時ちかくになって、ようやく静まる。夫はまだ帰宅していない。 「長時間働く社員が出世するんです」とニシマサさんはいう。「それに、上司たちにはみんな、専業主婦の奥さんがいるんですよね」 2019年2月15日 訂正: 既報の記事の中で、ニシマサ家に関していくつかの点で間違いがありましたので訂正します。ニシマサヨシコさんが時短で勤務可能な時期は、下の子供が小学校２年生ではなく、３年生までです。ニシマサさんが以前勤めた会社から、結婚後、彼女の待遇をパートタイムに切り替えると言われたのは、既婚女性への慣習として言われたものでした。自動的にというものではない、とのことです。ニシマサさんが、流産したのは、臨月ではなく、妊娠初期でした。記事中で、夫の平日の夜の行動について不正確な記述がありました。ニシマサさんによると、しばしば、夜遅くまで仕事をしますが、クライアントと飲みに出かけるのはたまにしかない、とのことです。,The

2019,#MAGA Church: The Doomsday Prophet Who Says the Bible Predicted Trump,"A charismatic pastor in New Jersey (who also calls himself a rabbi) leads a church fixated on end times. Before the apocalypse, however, he’s fitting in a trip to Mar-a-Lago. CreditCredit On a Sunday morning at Beth Israel Worship Center in Wayne, N.J., a bearded pastor named Jonathan Cahn stood on an elevated platform, gazing over a full house. Stage lights shifted from blue to white as the backing band played a drifting melody. Two men hoisted curled rams’ horns and let out long blasts. “Some of you have been saying you want to live in biblical times,” Mr. Cahn said, pacing behind a lectern. Then he spread his hands wide. “Well, you are.” Sitting at the end of a sleepy drive an hour from Manhattan, Beth Israel may look like any common suburban church. But the center has a highly unusual draw. Every weekend, some 1,000 congregants gather for the idiosyncratic teachings of the church’s celebrity pastor, an entrepreneurial doomsday prophet who claims that President Trump’s rise to power was foretold in the Bible. Mr. Cahn is tapping into a belief more popular than may appear. A recent Fox News poll found one in four Americans believe “God wanted Donald Trump to become president.” Celebrities like the televangelist Paula White and Franklin Graham have boosted the idea. The president’s own press secretary suggested as much in a January interview. And on the opening day of the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, the millionaire businessman Michael Lindell took to the stage and declared President Trump “chosen by God.” Mr. Cahn was ahead of the curve. He has dedicated an entire book to this very thesis, an insight he claims to have received from God. “The Paradigm: The Ancient Blueprint That Holds the Mystery of Our Times,” in fact, is only the most recent installment of a best-selling series dealing with the supposed mystical meaning behind all manner of current events. In it, Mr. Cahn likens Mr. Trump to the biblical king Jehu, who led the ancient nation of Israel away from idolatry. With his growing stature, Mr. Cahn is also a rising figure in some quarters of conservative politics. In an email to congregants, Mr. Cahn shared his latest good news: This weekend he is making his first trip to the president’s vacation retreat, Mar-a-Lago. He is set to address a small gathering of activists and advisers. After worship on a recent Sunday, in a roped-off section flanked by security guards, Mr. Cahn signed piles of his books before a small crowd. At 59, Mr. Cahn cultivates a refined demeanor, rarely appearing without a signature all-black suit and tie. He laid his hands gently on one man’s shoulders and offered quiet counsel. “Be patient,” he said. “Keep praying for breakthrough.” Gail Greenholtz, an elder member, stood near the end of the line. “Many of us consider him a prophet of our time,” she said. “A visionary.” Michael Cooney, 58, had driven an hour to hear the pastor teach on politics and prophecy. “It’s all relevant for this moment,” he said. “He shows us that Trump was actually in the Bible.” Central to Beth Israel’s story is the unlikely rise of its pastor, a liberal Jew transformed into an end-times evangelist. The tale is also a step into a controversial and burgeoning layer of American religion, where commerce, supernatural belief and patriotism blend freely. Daniel Silliman, a Valparaiso University professor of religion, called Beth Israel and its pastor part of a long tradition of Americans “looking to prophecy as a way to absorb the chaos” of current events. “It can make someone feel that God is working through human history,” he said, “transforming anxiety into a sense of fullness.” The son of a Holocaust refugee, Mr. Cahn was raised in a nominally Jewish family in the New York suburbs. But from an early age, he was drawn to the more esoteric corners of belief. He devoured the writings of Nostradamus, the Virginia psychic Edgar Cayce and far-out conspiracy theories about ancient astronauts. Mr. Cahn soon stumbled on “The Late Great Planet Earth,” the 1970s best-seller that argued doomsday prophecies of the Bible were playing out with events like the Cold War and Israel’s Six-Day War. Mr. Cahn bought the book thinking it was about UFOs; instead he was given a crash-course in Christian eschatology. “I was just floored,” Mr. Cahn said. On his 20th birthday, after a near-death experience — and to the dismay of his Jewish father — he became a Christian. By the 1980s, Mr. Cahn was leading outreach for a hippy-style church in New Jersey. His hair and beard grown shaggy, he led services with a guitar slung around his neck. Mr. Cahn later broke off to lead an independent congregation, Beth Israel, and built his following through a slot on Christian radio, where his messages took on an end-times flavor. After the 2001 terrorist attacks struck Manhattan, Mr. Cahn adopted a sharp, even more apocalyptic focus. In sermons, he began comparing the attacks to the ancient warnings of the Bible, drawing largely from the book of Isaiah, where God vows to punish the disobedient nation of Israel. Mr. Cahn said abortion, gay rights and the perceived retreat of religion in the public square were all troubling signs that America, like ancient Israel, had lost its way. Once rolling with this comparison, Mr. Cahn began seeing patterns everywhere. As the Israelites turned away from their God, they were attacked by Assyrians; America, in modern times, was also attacked by a foreign army from the East, Al Qaeda terrorists. After the ancient siege, the Israelites vowed to replant a destroyed sycamore grove with new trees; near ground zero, a huge sycamore tree was also destroyed, as the towers fell. The supposed connections go on. Tenuous as they may seem, Mr. Cahn saw the links as compelling. His flock did too. “God revealed patterns,” he said. “I called it the download process.” Mr. Cahn eventually turned his thesis into a full-length book, “The Harbinger,” in 2012, put out by the publishing arm of the powerhouse Charisma Media, a Christian multimedia company that also runs a daily news site. The book climbed up best-seller lists and hovered there for months, alongside blockbusters like “Fifty Shades of Grey.” He followed his debut with a companion edition and three other titles, all embellishing on the same theme of prophecies replaying today. “None of us knew it would be so successful,” Mr. Cahn said. “It was the Lord’s hand, I believe that.” A charismatic preacher inveighing against imminent devastation is nothing new. America has long been fertile ground for would-be doomsday prophets, stretching back centuries. Matthew Sutton, a professor of history at Washington State University and the author of “American Apocalypse,” said Mr. Cahn fits a unique American mold. “In key historical moments, religious figures like this find a way to step in,” Mr. Sutton said. “They draw from apocalyptic theology and say, ‘We have this secret knowledge and can explain what’s going on.’ It fosters this sense that God’s judgment is hanging over your head.” Among several of Mr. Cahn’s recent predecessors of this ilk would be televangelists like the Christians United for Israel founder John Hagee, whose books include “Can America Survive?” and Jim Bakker, the controversy-prone preacher who now hosts an end-times TV program and sells disaster survival products. Mr. Cahn brings the tradition fully into the social-media age: many of his fans first saw him on Facebook; hundreds of posts and reposts of his sermons are uploaded on YouTube, slipped into the corners of the web where esoteric religion and conspiracy theories overlap. Into this mix came Mr. Cahn’s latest book, “The Paradigm,” which could be his most polarizing, tying his prophetic work to the election of Donald Trump. The book, published in the months after Trump’s win, again likens America to the ancient nation of Israel — two peoples, Mr. Cahn says, who have a unique relationship with God. He then argues that all sorts of figures in contemporary politics have biblical counterparts. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, for example, are the modern-day analogues to wicked Ahab and Jezebel. Trump is the warrior-king Jehu, who took control of the nation and cast idols out of the capital. “Jehu also sought to drain the swamp,” Mr. Cahn said. Trump, “like his ancient predecessor,” Mr. Cahn writes in his book, was a “flawed vessel” being used by God. “The unlikely and controversial warrior was destined to become the new ruler of the land,” Mr. Cahn goes on. “The template would ordain that Donald Trump would become the next president.” Pointing to Trump’s possible rollback of abortion rights, appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges and the move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem, Mr. Cahn casts Trump as a heroic figure. “Trump is offering us a window for revival, a window to return to God,” Mr. Cahn said. “What happened in the election was not about Trump but about something much higher, the purposes of God.” Mr. Cahn promotes his work aggressively in Christian media, appearing regularly on “The Jim Bakker Show,” “Sid Roth’s It’s Supernatural!” and “The 700 Club,” where he draws upon his Jewish background, using the title of rabbi or wrapping himself in a prayer shawl emblazoned with the Beth Israel logo. He also has political aspirations. Mr. Cahn speaks at events in Washington alongside conservative standard-bearers like Michele Bachmann and James Dobson, where his portrayal of America as a cultural battleground falls on sympathetic ears. In 2016, he even addressed a United Nations gathering. Mike Huckabee, the Fox News commentator and former governor of Arkansas, once introduced Mr. Cahn as “soul-stirring and stunning, spellbinding.” Mr. Cahn likes to say he is surprised by his own success, preferring supernatural explanations. When speaking, he begins slowly but picks up pace, almost falling over his words with excitement. He also has a flair for the theatrical tale. Lounging in a back office at the church, surrounded by framed paintings of biblical landscapes, he sprinkled enchanted anecdotes in conversation. How did he raise money for his first church? “A mysterious American Indian appeared with a check for $150,000. They called him Wahoo. God instructed him to come to me.” How were his books received? “With the first book, a hurricane flooded our building. For the release day of the new one, my appendix exploded. People called it spiritual warfare.” He even presents his family life in magical terms. He has three children and describes his relationship to his Brazilian wife, Renata, as a “supernatural love story.” As Mr. Cahn’s star was rising, Beth Israel also mushroomed in size. The congregation more than tripled over the years and outgrew its humble perch in Bergen County. In 2008, Beth Israel moved to a cavernous old department store a half-hour away and remodeled the building to resemble the white-stoned city of ancient Jerusalem, recasting the drab industrial structure as a mystical suburban barracks. In the parking lot, massive Israeli and American flags billow in the breeze. Beth Israel draws from the Charismatic movement, which has roots in Pentecostalism, and also incorporates elements of Messianic Judaism. Congregants alternate between calling Mr. Cahn their pastor or rabbi, and their place of worship a church or synagogue. Services are also held on Friday evenings, at the start of the Jewish Sabbath, and Mr. Cahn arrives to the building just moments before worship begins. By the time he bursts on stage with a headset microphone, the crowd is fully primed. A dance troupe of women, dressed in red and waving scarfs, prance nearby as the crowd sways in song. During a recent evening service, some 500 congregants gathered as helpers lit traditional Shabbat candles near the foot of the stage. Mr. Cahn dropped Hebrew into his sermon, and at times, the crowd haltingly joined in to pronounce the foreign words themselves. In a middle row, one elderly woman pulled out a worn Bible with stickered pages, the margins filled with notes from previous lectures. “There are prophecies around us,” Mr. Cahn intoned from the pulpit. “We’re in deep and we’re going deeper. Open your mind, brace yourself.” Perhaps not surprisingly, as the church’s growth may have been swift, controversies around the pastor and his flock have also swelled. Progressive groups, like the website Right Wing Watch, have been tracking Mr. Cahn’s rise for years. Others have raised questions about whether his messages about Trump veer from protected religious expression to political endorsement. Churches are unable to participate in political campaigns on behalf of, or in opposition to, candidates; if they do so, they risk losing their tax-exempt status. Mr. Cahn shrugs at the charge. “I don’t tell anyone how to vote,” he said. “I say, ‘You need to consult God, and this is what God says on the issues.’” After a beat, he added, “They can read between the lines.” Others object to his claims to divine insight. In particular, Mr. Cahn has attracted the attention of a network of Christian critics who see him as part of a growing stream of over-the-top supernaturalism in the church. Tensions came to a climax in 2015, when Mr. Cahn suggested in a book and during several TV appearances that an imminent cataclysm was on the horizon. Leaning on arcane readings of the early books of the Bible, Mr. Cahn said that just as God visited judgments on the wayward Israelites according to a particular seven-year pattern — something called “the shemitah” — modern catastrophes might follow a similar pattern. In 2001 came terrorist attacks, in 2008 there was an economic crash. Mr. Cahn asked: could 2015 bring another disaster? But months passed, and the doomsday date came and went. He was dismissed as a grifter. One critic likened Mr. Cahn’s prophecy project to a “fragile house of cards,” set to tumble down. A Christian polemics site called Pulpit & Pen denounced Mr. Cahn in several posts. J.D. Hall, the site’s founder, called Mr. Cahn “the most prominent and successful omen huckster” working today. “Pastors should warn people away from Cahn,” Mr. Hall said recently. Mr. Cahn actually grows embarrassed discussing the doomsday fiasco. He insists he has always included disclaimers on his work and never set exact dates. Rather, Mr. Cahn wanted to warn that a cataclysm could happen, not that it would. “I always say: You can’t put God in a box.” Still, he appears to have learned from the brouhaha, growing even more cautious about making prognostications that could fall through. His latest book, for example, was released only after Trump had taken the White House and is largely backward-looking, giving biblical explanations to current events only after the fact. He also declined to weigh in on Trump’s 2020 chances. “The Bible doesn’t say one or two terms,” Mr. Cahn demurred. Meanwhile, Mr. Cahn’s success has come at a private cost he seldom discusses. Though not estranged, his Jewish family never fully knew what to make of his dramatic pastoral turn. They rarely, if ever, visit the church, and he remains troubled by the idea they will not be spiritually saved. “I don’t know where their hearts are at now,” he said. “It’s not something we talk about.” At times, Mr. Cahn appears to be a star in a show that has grown out of his control. Fans may take his project more seriously than he does himself. His debut book was originally billed as a work of fiction, for example, a nuance lost on most readers. “At first, people started to call me a prophet, and I would stop them and say, ‘No, no,’” he said. “But it always made for an awkward moment.” Instead, he stopped correcting them. It was just easier. “So, sometimes, I don’t say anything,” Mr. Cahn said. “I let it be.” Still, his book series marches on. The latest installment, titled “The Oracle,” is due in September. Like the others, it concerns biblical prophecies, with Trump again making an appearance. On a Friday evening this winter, deep into the government shutdown over the border wall, Beth Israel was packed, even though a snowstorm had been forecast. One man plucked a plaintive tune on a guitar as Mr. Cahn wound up the service, inviting the crowd to bow their heads. He guided the them in a soothing prayer. “Close your eyes,” he said. “If you haven’t been born again, today is your day.” There were murmurs through the room. Mr. Cahn concluded and then gently reminded the crowd about the booths in the back. Congregants could buy shawls, jewelry and apocalypse-themed calendars. Books were for sale, he said. New members could even get a gift copy, signed free of charge. After worship, congregants gathered near the canteen, where steam rose from platters of rice, beans and soup. Several worshipers described how they once attended other, more mainline churches before discovering Beth Israel. Some still have a home church elsewhere but come here for a supplemental dose of mysticism. Bob Keene, a 68-year-old school-bus driver, described the appeal. “Learning about prophecy puts me at ease,” he said. “The problems I’m having, the things I’m going through, those are also part of God’s plan.” Roxanne Mangal, a middle-aged woman in a flowery blouse, joined the table. She said the pastor had healed her of a terrible illness. Joining Beth Israel also brought wealth. “My income tripled,” she said. “It quadrupled.” Now she wanted to show Mr. Keene a more recent miracle she’d seen, captured on a cellphone photo, no less. After President Trump had moved the United States Embassy to Jerusalem — the subject of great excitement at the church — she believed she saw the New York skyline light up in heavenly sparks. “God did that,” she said, thrusting the phone forward. “Hmm,” Mr. Keene said, looking at the photo politely. “I thought it was a sunset at first.”",The New York Times

All the chestnut logs used in its construction were cut at an 18th-century sawmill on the site, and the mill is believed to now be the property’s guest cottage. The house was eventually turned into a year-round residence, and in 2008 it was bought and revived by the current owner, William Bretschger, a construction manager specializing in historic restoration. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. Size: 6,491 square feet Price per square foot: $208 Indoors: Orient Lodge, as the three-story house is called, is a trove of period details, including etched-glass windows, chinoiserie wallpaper, vertically striped wainscoting, beamed and latticed ceilings, and monumental cobblestone fireplaces built with rocks from a stream on the property and ornamented with welcoming messages inscribed in gold leaf.

2019,'Late Night’ and ‘Shazam’ Lead the Week’s Best Trailers,"With “Captain Marvel” touching down in theaters, perhaps it’s no surprise that this week’s batch of new trailers favors tales of superheroes and female empowerment. Mindy Kaling’s latest project casts her as the first female writer on the staff of a talk show with a British host (Emma Thompson). Bought by Amazon for $13 million at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the comedy — written by Kaling and directed by TV veteran Nisha Ganatra — deals with the timely theme of workplace equality. The engaging initial trailer spotlights the film’s impressive ensemble, including Kaling’s former co-worker on “The Office,” Amy Ryan, as a network executive, and John Lithgow as Thompson’s husband. After debuting a surprisingly funny trailer at Comic-Con International last summer, DC’s superhero origin story returns with an equally amusing follow-up. “Superpowers? Dude, I don’t even know how to pee in this thing!” the caped crime-fighter (Zachary Levi) tells his pal. So what if he can’t quite leap a tall building in a single bound? The new shocker from “Hereditary” director Ari Aster unfolds at a nine-day outdoor gathering that takes place every 90 years in rural Sweden and quickly turns horrific. Attendees include Florence Pugh (“Fighting With My Family”) and two actors from Kathryn Bigelow’s “Detroit”: Jack Reynor and Will Poulter. The teaser’s idyllic tone gives way to a small handful of gory and grotesque images, proving maximum impact can sometimes be achieved by showing less, not more. “Smallville,” it ain’t. This superhero-horror hybrid takes place in a bucolic Kansas town where an alien child (Jackson Dunn) crash-lands and is raised on a farm by a kindly couple (Elizabeth Banks and David Denman). Only when his superpowers develop, he’s tempted to use them for evil, not good. The unnerving trailer trumpets the presence of producer James Gunn, who was fired from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise over offensive past tweets, but the film was actually written by his brother Brian Gunn and cousin Mark Gunn, and directed by David Yarovesky. Gina Rodriguez bombed as a would-be action hero in “Miss Bala,” but she seems better suited to Netflix’s “comedy romance breakup film,” as it’s billed in the trailer. The “Jane the Virgin” star plays a music journalist whose nine-year relationship with her boyfriend (Lakeith Stanfield, of “Sorry to Bother You”) ends when she decides to leave New York City for San Francisco. But before she moves, she plans one last blowout with her best friends (Brittany Snow and DeWanda Wise).",The New York Times
2019,"1,600 Motel Guests Were Secretly Streamed Live in South Korea, Police Say","HONG KONG — Two men have been arrested over the online streaming of the “intimate private activities” of 1,600 unsuspecting motel guests across South Korea, the latest instance of illicit electronic spying in a country where thousands of cases were reported last year. The men — who are 48 and 50, but whose names were not released — are accused of setting up hidden cameras in 30 motels across 10 cities, the police said in a statement on Wednesday. The video was shown online for profit. Tiny cameras with one-milimeter lenses were hidden in hair dryer holders, satellite boxes and closed electrical sockets, the police said. More than 800 intimate videos were then shown on a website that charged some viewers for a monthly subscription. Overseas servers were used to conceal the camera users’ real IP address and evade detection. “This is the first time that livestreamed videos on overseas websites were detected” in a South Korean spycam case, the police said. In three months, the scheme brought in 7 million won, or $6,200. The arrests come as the country grapples with waves of voyeuristic spycam crimes, known as molka, in which people are surreptitiously filmed in private places like changing rooms and public restrooms. About 6,800 cases of illicit filming were reported to the South Korean police in 2018, according to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of the Republic of Korea. Many others go unreported or undetected. The video is often widely distributed online without the knowledge or consent of those who are shown. One of the arrested men in the latest case is accused of planting cameras in the southern provinces of Yeongnam and Chungcheong, while the other is accused of operating cameras remotely and managing the overseas servers that served as hosts to the illicit images. The police believe the men had two accomplices; two other men were named as suspects but have not been arrested. Under South Korean laws targeting online crimes of a sexual nature, anyone found guilty of making intimate videos without the subject’s consent can face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won, or $26,500. Even if the subject agrees to being recorded, distributing intimate video without consent can lead to the same maximum punishment. Spycams present a persistent, hidden threat that leaves many people wary, in particular women, who are the most common targets. In an effort to identify and remove hidden cameras in restrooms in Seoul, the capital, government officials announced in September that they had assigned 8,000 employees to inspect each of the city’s 20,554 public restrooms, a move that critics said would not fix the root of the problem.",The New York Times

2019,10 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. TEI BLOW & LAUREL ATWELL at Baryshnikov Arts Center (March 15, 7 and 9 p.m.). “You have to put yourself on a merry-go-round that keeps turning all the time,” Merce Cunningham said of how he helped his dancers prepare for the unusual staging of his 1994 work “Ocean,” in which they are surrounded by the audience. Blow and Atwell use “Ocean” as the seed for a work-in-progress audiovisual experience they call “Entry.” Here, audience members lie on the floor (on blankets) to view film and light projections, which include abstracted and manipulated sections of Cunningham’s choreography. Though the show itself is not a live dance performance, it is an immersive and inventive reimagining of one. 866-811-4111, bacnyc.org CHINA NATIONAL OPERA & DANCE DRAMA THEATER at the David H. Koch Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.; through March 24). Billed as a dance drama, this troupe’s “Princess Zhaojun” tells the tale of a Han dynasty-era concubine named Wang Zhaojun, who leaves her privileged palace life to marry a Hun monarch on the northern Chinese border, thus bringing peace to the region. Her story is conveyed here through traditional Chinese music, luxe costumes and choreography by Kong Dexin, who also directed the production and who counts herself a direct descendant of Confucius — 77th generation, to be exact. 212-496-0600, davidhkochtheater.com DYLAN CROSSMAN DANS(C)E at the 92nd Street Y (March 15, 8 p.m.; March 16, 4 and 8 p.m.). In its 25th year, the Harkness Festival, a monthlong display of modern dance, continues its celebration of what would have been Merce Cunningham’s 100th birthday. To illustrate the lasting effects of his influence, the festival is showcasing companies founded by Cunningham alumni. This week, Crossman, who danced with Cunningham’s troupe through its concluding Legacy Tour, presents a new work called “Jamais Plus.” With its clean lines and physical decorum, it retains elements of the Cunningham style but mixes them with messier, more human moments to find idiosyncrasies beneath a polished surface. 212-415-5500, 92y.org CUNY DANCE INITIATIVE at Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 20-23, 7:30 p.m.). Over the past five years, this expansive residency program has brought more than 100 dance artists to 13 CUNY campuses across the city.

With a combination of dance and theater, this series illuminates dance history with unique, original productions. For this iteration, it honors the writer Deborah Jowitt, a calm, insightful voice in dance for more than 50 years, celebrated for evocative writing that prioritizes curiosity over judgment. Performances will include stories, anecdotes, film footage and live dancing by many of those Jowitt has written about, including Carmen de Lavallade, Valda Setterfield, Gus Solomons Jr. and Martine van Hamel. On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Jowitt will participate in a panel on dance writing with several of her contemporaries. 646-395-4310, 14streety.org/fromthehorsesmouth GRAHAM DECONSTRUCTED at Graham Studios (March 20, 7 p.m.). This intimate studio series gives Martha Graham fans a chance to watch new and revived work up close before it heads into the theater. For this iteration, the company opens up a rehearsal of Graham’s 1962 “Secular Games.” The work for 12 dancers skewers sexual stereotypes and the comedy of courtship. Its choreography has been reconstructed for the piece’s first performance since the 1970s. The full production will be at the Joyce in April. 212-229-9200, marthagraham.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] NATIONAL COMPANY OF IRELAND at Kingsborough Community College (March 15, 8 p.m.).

In the early 1930s, Lincoln Kirstein enticed George Balanchine to New York, where they founded what became City Ballet.

The program comprises excerpts from Balanchine classics that have connections to items in the exhibition, like “Concerto Barocco” and “Agon.” The performances are included with museum admission; limited seating will be available first come first served.212-708-9400, moma.org PERIDANCE CONTEMPORARY DANCE COMPANY at Salvatore Capezio Theater (March 16-17, 7:30 p.m.; through March 24).

Also on the docket is “All Told” by Alice Klock, a former longtime dancer for Hubbard Street Dance Chicago; “Nightwalkers” by Yoshito Sakuraba; and a duet by Ido Tadmor, who’s something of a rock star of dance in his native Israel. 212-505-0886, peridance.com WORK UP 5.3 at Gibney (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). As part of this year’s iteration of Gibney’s annual professional development program for early-career artists, three choreographers will each present a short work that has been nurtured during their residency: Laurel Snyder presents an improvisational solo that explores the boundaries we create for ourselves. Nana Chinara examines “violence on a black queer femme body,” as she states in a press release. And Richardson celebrates black camaraderie and takes inspiration from public movement that he observed at a parade for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org",The New York Times

Ms. Ardern, who told reporters that she would meet with China’s president, Xi Jinping, and the country’s premier, Li Keqiang, said the long-planned trip had been scaled back to a single day in light of the attack. The visit will be “literally 24 hours, and traveling with as little time away as possible,” Ms. Ardern said, adding that the trip had been planned “some weeks ago” and that Chinese officials had been “incredibly accommodating” about her decision to shorten it after the shooting attacks on two Christchurch mosques in which 50 people were killed. Her original plan had been to travel with a business delegation from New Zealand and to make stops in three cities. Instead, she will travel without the group and will visit only Beijing. There have been growing fears that New Zealand’s close economic relationship with China was fraying after Ms. Ardern was unable to schedule a visit there to follow up on a November invitation. Around the same time, the start of a much-anticipated joint tourism initiative with China was canceled, and that has now been rescheduled for Friday. China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner and imports more than $10 billion of its products. Commentators suggested that Ms. Ardern’s government was facing retaliation because it had joined other Western nations in taking a tough stance against the Chinese technology company Huawei. The company took out advertisements in the country’s largest newspapers last month, trying to win public support in New Zealand for its involvement in the country’s 5G telecommunications networks. “China is an important regional and global actor with whom we must work on challenges facing the global community and those critical to the security and prosperity of our region,” Ms. Ardern told reporters on Monday, having previously played down talk of tensions. The apparent shift in the relationship came as her cabinet met on Monday to decide what form its investigation into the Christchurch attacks would take, settling on a royal commission — an independent inquiry reserved for the most serious matters in New Zealand public life. Ms. Ardern said the commission would investigate whether anything could have been done to prevent the attacks, in which a gunman killed 50 people and injured 50 more as they worshiped at two mosques during Friday Prayer on March 15. The gunman broadcast the killings live on Facebook. The inquiry would also examine the accessibility of semiautomatic weapons — Ms. Ardern has already acted to ban military-style versions of such guns — the role social media played in the attack, and whether New Zealand’s security services or other government agencies could have done anything to prevent it. Muslims in New Zealand and overseas were “quite rightly asking questions about how this terror attack was able to happen here,” Ms. Ardern said. Dean Knight, a public law professor at Victoria University of Wellington, said royal commissions were usually led by retired judges, lawyers or industry experts and took “as long as they need to take,” though Ms. Ardern said this inquiry would not take “years” as others have in the past. “Because they can be bespoke in their work, it’s possible to develop a strategy to deliver things promptly,” Dr. Knight said by email. “But if the inquiry is run with the tradition of court-like processes, it will slow things down.” Ms. Ardern said it was “unacceptable” that the gunman’s video was still available on social media platforms, even after tech companies assured her that they were working to remove it. While she would not comment on the policies of individual companies, shortened videos of the shooting — which has been classified as illegal to share by New Zealand’s chief censor — were still available on Twitter on Monday. Twitter said in an emailed statement that it had “rigorous processes and a dedicated team in place” for emergency situations such as the Christchurch attacks, and that it cooperated with law enforcement where required. The company did not detail what the emergency processes entailed or how they differed from normal moderation tools. It did not say whether New Zealand law enforcement had made specific requests. Twitter has asked users to report such material if they see it, but Ms. Ardern said relying on users to flag the video was “not an effective way of managing incredibly disturbing content.”",The New York Times
2019,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice There’s a saying in journalism (and in other endeavors, with minor variations) that twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend. If that’s true, we have a bunch of coincidences for you this week. There are two Supreme Court biographies: Evan Thomas’s “First,” about Sandra Day O’Connor, and Joan Biskupic’s “The Chief,” about John Roberts. There are two spy books: the novel “American Spy” and the political history “Spies of No Country.” Two memoirs, by Carolyn Forché and Mitchell S. Jackson. And weirdly — which is to say, coincidentally — two books with the word “betrayal” in the subtitle. The lesson here may only be that eclecticism likes company. And that sounds like a trend. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles LOT: Stories, by Bryan Washington. (Riverhead, $25.) The subtle, dynamic and flexible stories in this debut collection play out across Houston’s sprawling and multiethnic neighborhoods. About half of the stories are about a single family, and in particular about the coming-of-age of a teenager, the son of a black mother and a Latino father. “The promise Washington displays is real and large,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. He is “an alert and often comic observer of the world.” WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD IS TRUE: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance, by Carolyn Forché. (Penguin Press, $28.) In 1977, someone Carolyn Forché had never met arrived at the poet’s door in California and convinced her to travel to El Salvador to document the perilous political turmoil there. Forché recounts the ensuing experience, and its lasting effect on her life and work, in this new memoir. “Once Forché’s story gathers momentum, it’s hard to let the narrative go,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “The shape of her memoir hews closely to what she herself saw and heard — and how, out of the horror, she began to discern what she needed to do.” FIRST: Sandra Day O’Connor, by Evan Thomas. (Random House, $32.) O’Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, was as practical, fearless and independent-minded off the bench as she was on it; in this intimate and admiring portrait, Thomas, a veteran journalist and biographer, expertly navigates both her pathbreaking career and fulfilling domestic life. Jeffrey Toobin, reviewing it, calls the book “fascinating and revelatory,” and concludes that “Thomas’s book is not just a biography of a remarkable woman, but an elegy for a worldview that, in law as well as politics, has disappeared from the nation’s main stages.” THE CHIEF: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts, by Joan Biskupic. (Basic, $32.) This assiduously reported, briskly written biography offers new behind-the-scenes details on John Roberts’s life and career, but shows just how hard it is to figure out who the chief justice really is or what he stands for; Biskupic, an analyst at CNN, ends up calling her own subject an “enigma.” But as our reviewer, Adam Cohen, notes, she also “suggests that he is pulled by two often-conflicting instincts. One is ideological: a desire to move the court rightward on race, religion and other issues. The other is institutional: an interest in the court being respected and seen as nonpolitical.” THE PARADE, by Dave Eggers. (Knopf, $25.95.) In Eggers’s tense parable of a novel, his eighth, two men known by numbers instead of names are contracted by a road-building company to lay down a highway in a war-torn foreign country in time for a government parade. “Without the usual biographical hints tucked into conversations and internal thoughts, Eggers differentiates between Four and Nine solely through their reactions to the post-civil-war devastation around them,” Idra Novey writes in her review. “How this setup reduces the two men to their willingness — or refusal — to see others is striking.” THE MASTERMIND: Drugs. Empire. Murder. Betrayal., by Evan Ratliff. (Random House, $28.) Ratliff’s page-turning investigation explores how Paul Le Roux transformed himself from a nerdy kid with a talent for encryption into the boss of an international drug cartel. Alan Feuer’s review calls it a “fever-heated” effort to understand that transformation, and says that the author “clearly deserves this year’s Award for Dogged Journalism” whether or not his book contains larger lessons: “Ratliff’s tale is unique, so strange and so compelling, it is almost better left to float alone.” AMERICAN SPY, by Lauren Wilkinson. (Random House, $27.) This gutsy debut thriller — about a black female F.B.I. agent haunted by an old case — delivers plenty of action while addressing thought-provoking issues of identity, belonging and moral compromise. “Running informants was about cultivating their trust,” the heroine says. “I found it worked best to lie frequently.” Mick Herron, reviewing the novel, applauds it for “embracing ambitions and concerns that don’t always figure highly in the spy genre,” while remaining “first and foremost a thriller.” ZORA AND LANGSTON: A Story of Friendship and Betrayal, by Yuval Taylor. (Norton, $27.95.) This engaging, overdue study of the famous yet underdiscussed friendship and collaboration between Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes traces one of the most consequential relationships in American literature. “‘Zora and Langston’ refocuses our attention on the positive aspects of their relationship, while doing its best to explain — through historical records and firsthand research — what really brought their friendship to an end,” Zinzi Clemmons writes in her review. “Chief among the book’s strengths is that it does not shy away from pointing out … contradictions in the relationship at its heart.” SURVIVAL MATH: Notes on an All-American Family, by Mitchell S. Jackson. (Scribner, $26.) Jackson tells the story of his family in Portland, Ore., and of the men in particular — offering social context for their decisions, good and bad. He relates the often sordid tales of addiction and neglect with radical love and honesty. Our reviewer, Darnell L. Moore, calls it “a model of autobiographical writing that demonstrates how reportage and critical attention to the complexities of black life — its intersectional textures — can be the source material for an inimitable memoir.” SPIES OF NO COUNTRY: Secret Lives at the Birth of Israel, by Matti Friedman. (Algonquin, $26.95.) In the early days of the Israeli state, a secret unit of Jewish spies posed as Arabs, living the tension and drama of Israel’s relationship with its neighbors. Spy histories “often fall short in tapping the depths of their lives — or, more aptly, their humanity,” Neal Bascomb writes in his review, but “Spies of No Country” “stands out as a wondrous exception.”",The New York Times
2019,10 Recent Netflix Originals Worth Your Time,"Interested in getting more suggestions on what to stream? Sign up for the Watching newsletter, which we send out every Monday and Friday. Netflix was already home to a dizzying amount of content before it committed to churning out 1,000 original series, films and specials in 2018. And there’s much more on the horizon: The streaming site has production deals with not only Barack and Michelle Obama, but also with some of TV’s most powerful creators, including Ryan Murphy, Marti Noxon and Kenya Barris. Then there’s the steady flow of (often foreign) Netflix originals that are bought by the streaming service postproduction — “Bodyguard,” for example, was created by the BBC. It’s a lot to keep up with. If you’ve fallen behind, here are some recent Netflix originals that are worth checking out. Whether you’re looking for a new reality dating show, an irreverent comedy or a broody British thriller, there’s a little something for everyone on this list. It’s rare for a new show to garner as much universal adoration as this dark comedy did when it had its premiere in early February. Created by Leslye Headland (“Bachelorette), Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler, “Russian Doll” stars Lyonne as a New Yorker stuck in a loop of dying and coming back to life at the same time and place — in the bathroom at her 36th birthday party. Funny, cleverly structured and a little melancholy, the series turns out to be a surprisingly poignant meditation on repressed trauma and self-actualization. And even if all that weren’t true, it would still be worth the watch for Lyonne’s tough-as-nails Nadia, a true original, just like the woman who plays her.— Stream it on Netflix. [We’re rewatching the first seven seasons of “Game of Thrones” before the final season. Sign up to get our guides straight to your inbox.] Teen sex comedies typically rely on gross-out humor: sticky substances turning up in inopportune places, badly timed cases of mistaken identity, drunk kids doing things with people they don’t really like. But this British series, starring Asa Butterfield as a 16-year-old transfer student and the indomitable Gillian Anderson as his sex-therapist mom, is different. It’s certainly not prudish — the opening scene alone is testament to that. But despite the nudity and explicit sex scenes, “Sex Education” is an earnest, sweet coming-of-age (no pun intended) story, featuring excellent performances from Butterfield and Anderson, as well as the supporting players Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey.— Stream it on Netflix. [The 50 best movies on Netflix right now.] Following his excellent stand-up special, “Homecoming King,” the comedian Hasan Minhaj returns to Netflix with this political variety show. (You could call it a “late night show” but, well, that designation makes less and less sense in the age of streaming.) “Patriot Act,” now in its second season, is like a cross between “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” Like the latter series, “Patriot Act” structures its episodes by subject, allowing Minhaj to dive deep into a topic — like immigration enforcement in the United States, predatory drug pricing or the rise of Amazon — for 20 minutes at a time. The episodes aren’t numbered, so you can pick and choose which issues appeal to you. And the wide-eyed, hyper-aware Minhaj is an energetic and charismatic host. Enjoy.— Stream it on Netflix. A taut, six-episode thriller (bless the British), “Bodyguard” features the former “Game of Thrones” star Richard Madden as the title character, a veteran named David Budd who is assigned to protect a Conservative member of Parliament, Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Budd is a tough-guy hero who looks good in a leather jacket, but he’s not made of steel, and Madden makes sure the strain of his job shows plainly on his face. When it had its premiere in Britain last year, “Bodyguard” became the BBC’s most-watched drama since 2008, and Madden won a Golden Globe earlier this year for his performance as the tense, trauma-addled Budd.— Stream it on Netflix. Based on the 2017 book by Samin Nosrat (who has a column in The New York Times Magazine), this charming, four-part docu-series explores the four essential elements in cooking. “Salt Fat Acid Heat” is part travelogue, part instructional guide. Viewers tag along as Nosrat jets from Italy to Japan to Mexico, and back to her home in California, learning from the locals about how to achieve culinary perfection. On this show, good cooking doesn’t require following a recipe to the letter. Instead, it requires knowledge of how certain ingredients and processes can produce mouth-wateringly good food. Nosrat’s enthusiasm is infectious, making the show a must-watch for foodies and anyone who longs to be a competent, intuitive home chef.— Stream it on Netflix. Another British show, “Derry Girls” is set in Northern Ireland in the ’90s, during the Troubles. This sprightly comedy follows a high schooler, Erin (Saoirse-Monica Jackson), her daffy cousin Orla (Louisa Harland), and her friends Michelle, Clare and James (Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O’Donnell and Dylan Llewellyn). The threat of violence permeates the series: James, Michelle’s newly arrived English cousin, is forced to attend their all-girls’ Catholic school out of concerns for his safety were he to go to the boys’ school. And yet the show’s creator, Lisa McGee, keeps it in the background, focusing instead on the characters’ more typical day-to-day teenage concerns. Siobhan McSweeney is a standout as the Catholic school’s deadpan head nun.— Stream it on Netflix. Anyone else miss “Blind Date,” the early-’00s dating show that let viewers squirm watching first dates? Netflix has just the show for you. Each episode of “Dating Around” centers on one hopeful New Yorker as he or she goes on a series of first dates, and don’t let the sleek production fool you: The show may look more polished than earlier iterations of dating reality TV, but the dates range from sweetly awkward to I-want-to-tear-my-eyeballs-out-but-I-can’t-stop-watching excruciating. There are no on-camera testimonials here — you have to judge for yourself (with the help of some cheeky editing) what each participant thinks of his or her date. As glam as the establishing shots may look, the show is as awkward as New York dating really is.— Stream it on Netflix. This loose adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s famous 1959 horror novel was one of several spooky Netflix offerings to debut around Halloween last year. Its creator, Mike Flanagan, takes some liberties with the source material, setting his version in the present day. He also centers the 10 episodes on the Crain siblings, who have been haunted for years by their brief childhood stay at the creepy Hill House. The show goes back and forth between past and present, with varying results. It’s hard to make those jump-out-of-your-seat scares stretch for the series’ 10 hours, and there are times when you might wish that a ghost is just a ghost, not a metaphor for lingering childhood trauma. But for horror fans, or Jackson acolytes, “Hill House” is good for some spine-chilling thrills.— Stream it on Netflix. Another of Netflix’s ’Ween ’18 originals, “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” is the long-awaited star vehicle for Kiernan Shipka, who played Sally Draper in “Mad Men.” If you grew up watching the series “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” starring Melissa Joan Hart, be warned: On “Chilling Adventures,” the Archie Comics character gets the dark-teen-supernatural-drama treatment. It has more in common with the CW’s “Riverdale,” both of which were developed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The series opens on the eve of Sabrina’s “dark baptism” (which, let’s be honest, is basically a werewolf bar mitzvah), and treats its lead character’s unusual circumstances as a way to explore the tricky balancing act of growing up female.— Stream it on Netflix. “You” first debuted on Lifetime, back in September 2018. The psychological thriller, based on the novel by Caroline Kepnes, struggled to find an audience, and the network canceled it after one season. But when it landed on Netflix in December, “You” became a bona fide hit, and its second season will be produced by Netflix. Following a bookstore owner named Joe (Penn Badgley) who stalks and, eventually, woos an aspiring young writer and grad student named Beck (Elizabeth Lail), “You” is both frothy and sharp. Cleverly, the show makes Beck just as absorbing — and in some ways, as slippery — as Joe. It’ll tie your stomach in knots, in a good way.— Stream it on Netflix.",The New York Times

2019,10 Students Who Beat the Odds to Win a New York Times Scholarship,"On a trip to Costco about four years ago, Jailine Peña López, now 18, asked her mother to buy her a little white table and a little red chair. The set was made for children, but it meant a lot to Ms. López, who until then had done her homework on the bed, the bus or the subway. As she and her mother moved from place to place in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, she cherished the miniature furniture because it gave her a space all her own. “The table and the chair became a motivation for me to keep going and keep doing my homework and pursue my dream of higher education,” she said. Her drive paid off. Ms. López is a star student at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics and has participated in extracurricular activities like the Model United Nations. And she is one of 10 students chosen this year for The New York Times College Scholarship Program, which means she will get up to $15,000 in financial assistance for every year of college, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities with The New York Times Company. The scholarship, which is financed by reader donations and an endowment fund, has helped hundreds of students afford tuition at top-tier universities. This year’s winners shared their experiences with homelessness, poverty and abuse. They described family members’ struggles with mental illness and addiction. They recalled traumatic experiences that, ultimately, motivated them to fight for change. “I just want to stop the cycle, because it’s just too much pain,” said Davina Scott, 19, who witnessed devastating violence growing up in Jamaica and systemic injustice in Queens, where she lives now. She has been accepted to Howard University and wants to study political science and criminal justice. Anchal Malh, 17, was evicted from her home in Queens on the night before her 12th birthday. Despite a period of homelessness, she excelled in school. This year, she will become the first woman in her family to attend college. For girls in future generations, she said, “it’s my responsibility to make sure that they have a woman in the family to look up to.” Melanie Earle, 17, was involved in a car crash four years ago, leaving her with post-traumatic stress that she struggled to talk about for a long time. She hopes to use her scholarship to pursue mechanical engineering, humanitarian studies and maybe a language or two. Jaylen Campbell, 17, earned top grades in middle school but was frustrated when his efforts did not improve life for his family in Brooklyn. So he collected bottles and cans on the street to recycle for a nickel apiece. Now he feels the academic work is paying off. Another scholarship has taken him to China, and in college, he wants to study engineering and use it to improve people’s lives. Nefertari Elshiekh, 18, worked several jobs to support her family and still became an honor student. She was so grateful for the education she received that she is determined to become an elementary schoolteacher — and to fight for fair educational policies. Hanah Jun, 17, watched her mother struggle with mental illness while she and her grandmother did their best to stay afloat in Queens. But Ms. Jun also excelled as a volleyball player and musician, participated in student government and held part-time jobs. She is passionate about the environment and open-minded about her career. “I just want to help people,” she said. “I think that through everything, I’ve developed a very strong sense of empathy.” Ms. Jun and several other scholarship winners described their favorite young adult novels or comic books with infectious enthusiasm, explaining that they found role models in fiction when they could not find them in real life. But the nonfiction was less comforting: In essays and interviews, all 10 pointed to recent news headlines that had left them unnerved or afraid. Salma Elsayed, 17, a model student who taught English to girls in Egypt in 2017, was struck by news reports of teachers going on strike across the United States. “The issue of education in this country is constantly something I think about, and the disparities that students face,” she said. Derek Rodriguez, 17, said news reports about children being separated from their parents at the United States border with Mexico struck a raw nerve. He could relate. His stepfather was taken away by immigration agents who stormed his home when he was 5. “That was the point when I had to grow up,” he said. Mr. Rodriguez wants to become an international businessman and see the world. Ms. Elsayed, inspired by activists in her own community, is considering running for office. Runnie Exuma, 17, has creative ideas about what she might like to study in college — something that combines technology, humanities and the arts. And as an activist, she has already worked for racial justice and immigrants’ rights. “Any activist work I do is connected in a way,” she said. “It’s a struggle that we’re all fighting for.” These students know a scholarship will not make their problems disappear. When Ms. Jun learned in late February that she was a winner, she was in the parking lot of a funeral home, mourning her mother’s death. Ms. Scott said that her half sister, Latrar Scott, 25, went missing more than a year ago and still had not been found. And while Mr. Campbell’s achievements have earned him travel opportunities and academic accolades, he still collects bottles from time to time to raise extra money for his family. “I still want to help with groceries,” he said. The students are following in the footsteps of nearly 300 others who entered The New York Times College Scholarship Program before them, like Dextina Booker, 25, who was a member of the 2011 cohort. Ms. Booker earned her bachelor’s degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is pursuing a master’s in integrated design and management. Ultimately, she plans to go into academia. During her undergraduate years, she learned to appreciate everything she has overcome — not only because the difficulties made her stronger, but also because they gave her a useful perspective. “A lot of the ideas that I come up with stem from my background, from the people I know and the things they need,” she said. Ms. Booker added that the scholarship’s mentorship opportunities made her feel less alone among college classmates who had grown up in relative privilege. “Having someone there who understands even the basic things about you — you feel seen,” she said. “It feels like you’re not alone.”",The New York Times
2019,"100 Afghan Soldiers Said to Flee Across Border, Chased by Taliban","MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — At least 100 Afghan soldiers abandoned their posts and fled imminent capture by the Taliban by crossing the country’s border into neighboring Turkmenistan, only to face immediate expulsion, Afghan officials said on Saturday. It was the latest in a series of insurgent attacks in the hotly contested Bala Murghab district, where an entire Afghan Army company was killed or captured on Monday. By Saturday, its defenders said the district had mostly fallen into Taliban control. Afghan officials gave varying accounts of what happened Saturday, with some saying the soldiers would be returned to safety by Turkmenistan, and others that they had been forced back by the Turkmenistan Army into a no man’s land, a 500-yard-wide strip between border fences. And some said the soldiers had been forced back into Taliban hands by day’s end. Saleh Mohammad Mubarez, the commander of the Afghan local police in the district, said that 140 soldiers from the Afghan Border Police, a military unit, had fled toward Turkmenistan after two days of Taliban attacks on bases in the Morichaq area. “The situation is very bad: The district is on the verge of collapse,” Mr. Mubarez said. “The reinforcements have not been enough. The air force must help and launch airstrikes.” Qais Mangal, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the soldiers had fled toward Turkmenistan but insisted that they were “within Afghanistan.” Jamshid Shahabi, a spokesman for the Badghis provincial governor, said the soldiers had fled as part of a previously arranged security plan. Others described a more dire situation. Habibullah, an army officer on the battlefield who like many Afghans uses one name, said that after heavy pressure on two bases, 20 soldiers had surrendered to the Taliban and more than 100 fled to the Turkmenistan border. “We lost contact with them,” he said. Farid Akhezi, a member of the Badghis provincial council, said 12 Afghan border posts had been abandoned, with 50 soldiers surrendering to the Taliban and 100 others fleeing into Turkmenistan. He said that country’s army forced them back, so they surrendered to the insurgents late on Saturday. Most of soldiers were said by local officials to be part of the Afghan Border Police, which is part of the Afghan military. Mr. Mangal, however, said they were local irregular militiamen, not soldiers. The Taliban wiped out an entire Afghan National Army company in the same district on Monday, killing 16 soldiers and taking 40 prisoner. Over the course of the week, 36 Afghan security force members were confirmed killed in Taliban assaults in Badghis Province. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, claimed that the insurgents had now captured the Morichaq area. “More than 30 soldiers surrendered to the Taliban,” Mr. Ahmadi said. “The remaining soldiers tried to cross the border, but Turkmenistan’s border forces did not allow them.”",The New York Times
2019,"100 Days In, Mexico’s President Revels in High Ratings and Waves Off Recession Fear","MEXICO CITY — As a candidate, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promised to remake Mexico, vowing to end corruption and impunity, attack inequality, pacify the country and disrupt a status quo that, he said, favored the few — the wealthy and powerful — and marginalized everyone else. On Monday, in a confident speech marking his first 100 days in office, he insisted that transformation was firmly underway. “We have already begun to write the prologue of the great work of national transformation,” he declared. “We will continue to build, among everyone, the beautiful utopia. We are going to continue walking toward that great ideal of living in a new, free, fair, democratic and fraternal homeland.” Most Mexicans seem to agree, giving their folksy, man-of-the-people president stratospheric approval ratings. Some recent surveys put his support above 80 percent. “Overall, right now, Mexicans seem to appreciate that he’s out there, connecting with them, looking out for them and putting forward a program,” said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. “Even if some of us are skeptical about the possibilities of really transforming Mexico,” he continued, “it’s a program that really does seem to be people-focused.” Despite Mr. Lopez Obrador’s popularity, doubt and antipathy abound among some sectors of the Mexican population. His speech didn’t dwell much on the less favorable and widely criticized aspects of his term, most notably weaknesses in the national economy, which is suffering anemic growth and low investor confidence. In recent weeks, credit rating agencies have issued warnings about Mexico’s sovereign debt and state-run oil company Pemex. Mr. Lopez Obrador nodded at the lackluster economic growth but insisted that there was no sign of a coming recession — “as our conservative adversaries would like or as their analysts predict with bad faith,” he said. He has blamed the actions of the ratings agencies on what he calls the “neoliberal” policies of prior presidential administrations. In his speech, which was broadcast live on television from the presidential palace in downtown Mexico City, the president extolled his signature achievements to date. He said his government had begun delivering on its promises to buoy the poor and marginalized through an array of social welfare and development programs, including increasing pensions and other benefits for the elderly, expanding student scholarship programs for the impoverished and promoting job-creation initiatives for the young. He also underlined the creation of a new security force, the National Guard, which will be in charge of the nation’s public security. And he highlighted his government’s push to combat fuel theft, which, he said, had led to “good results,” including cutting the monthly volume of stolen fuel from 81,000 barrels in November to the current rate of 15,000 barrels. While Mr. Lopez Obrador acknowledged in his speech that his administration had not yet been able to make a significant dent in certain serious crimes, including homicide rates, some analysts continue to fault him for failing to articulate a clear public security strategy. “Beyond the creation of the National Guard and the combat of fuel theft, there isn’t a defined agenda,” said Francisco Rivas, general director of the Observatorio Nacional Ciudadano, a group that studies security and justice issues in Mexico. Some analysts also expressed concern about the ramifications of Mr. Lopez Obrador’s efforts to streamline government — and, some say, of his effort to consolidate power — in part through layoffs and salary cuts. Sebastián Garrido, professor at CIDE, a Mexico City university, said the strategy had left “many annoyed functionaries” and inexperienced staff, which could affect the efficiency and operations of the government. “I think this is a risk in the midterm,” he said. Mr. Lopez used the speech, which ran nearly 80 minutes, to deliver not only a list of greatest hits in the administration’s first three months but also an outline of the evolving blueprint for the rest of his term in office. He reiterated his promise to cancel a sweeping education reform that was a signature effort of his predecessor, and to push, among other initiatives, major infrastructure and public works projects including a new oil refinery, roads, an airport expansion and a rail line that would stretch through several southern states and create, he said, 300,000 jobs during the construction phase. “I am convinced that everything we do to reactivate the economy, to produce, to create jobs and achieve the material and cultural well-being of the people will result in social peace and tranquillity,” he said. “If there is justice, there will be security.”",The New York Times
2019,11 Movies You Need to See at New Directors/New Films,"Critics’ Notebook Every spring, the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center present New Yorkers with the cinematic miscellany known as New Directors/New Films. This year’s program of movies, many gleaned from the international festival circuit, runs the gamut from the glorious to the grim and includes works of socially conscious realism, historical fantasy and experimental documentary. Our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, offer these highlights. Some time in the 18th century, a young African boy is purchased by a European noblewoman and subjected to a curious form of enslavement. Given the name Angelo, he grows up among aristocrats who treat him not as a servant but as a curio and a symbol of their own benevolence. Angelo’s biography feels like both a plausibly factual chronicle and a fantastical allegory. Shot with classical rigor and attention to detail (with room for a few telling anachronisms), the Austrian filmmaker Markus Schleinzer’s second feature presents history as a lavish, lucid nightmare from which nobody, Angelo least of all, can hope to awaken. (A.O. Scott) A tale twice told, the ingenious Turkish puzzle “Belonging” opens with an unseen narrator introducing the story and then another voice delivering a just-the-facts description of a murder. Detailed, largely affectless and sometimes rushed, this recitation accompanies images that initially seem completely unrelated, even random. In time, though, words and images begin syncing up — we hear “the security chain was locked” over a shot of a safety chain lock — creating a seamless correspondence between what we hear and see. The writer-director Burak Cevik then flips the switch and the movie shifts into a more lyrical narrative register, one that fills in all the little nuances, most notably the intimate in-between moments that both explain and obscure so much. (Manohla Dargis) Lila Avilés’s debut feature never leaves the high-rise Mexico City hotel where its title character, Eve (Gabriela Cartol), works long hours cleaning rooms with spectacular views. The effect of is claustrophobic, but also strangely serene, even sublime. The camera follows Eve through daily routines that include awkward encounters with guests, friendly exchanges with co-workers and curt meetings with supervisors. Our sense of exploitation and alienation is palpable, but the moments of beauty, tenderness and freedom that punctuate the drudgery provide flickers of humanity that feel almost miraculous. (A.O.S.) Chinonye Chukwu’s film, which opens New Directors, is a somber, ethically serious consideration of the death penalty. It’s an issue movie that wants to be thought-provoking rather than polemical. It is also a showcase for the formidable talents of Alfre Woodard, who plays the warden of a prison where executions are a regular part of life. As the next one approaches (the condemned man is played by Aldis Hodge) the warden struggles with emotions that threaten every aspect of her identity, professional and personal. Woodard enacts this struggle with minimal vanity and abundant grace. (A.O.S.) In 2004, María Alché appeared in “The Holy Girl,” the Argentine director Lucrecia Martel’s haunting second feature. Fifteen years later, Alché’s directing debut shows signs of Martel’s influence in its blend of oblique narration and subtle psychological insight. But Alché, who is also an accomplished photographer, brings her own arresting visual sensibility to this story of grief, longing and memory. Mercedes Moran plays a middle-aged mother of three almost-grown children who is thrown off balance by the death of her sister. During her mourning period, nothing much happens, and yet everything happens, as Alché and Moran practice a kind of emotional sonar, picking up signals that lie deep under the dramatic surface. (A.O.S.) The documentary “Honeyland” contains worlds in one beautiful, seemingly simple story. Its focus, Hatidze Muratova, lives in a tiny stone house in remote northern Macedonia with her octogenarian mother, a plucky dog and an irregular number of cats. Her passion and apparent livelihood, though, are the wild bees she tends — keeping is too possessive — with hand flaps, vocalizations and deep respect. The directors Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska don’t overexplain this world, its history or seemingly fragile present, including the origin of the chaotic, sprawling family who soon moves in and begins taking over the bees. The family’s at times infuriating disruptions (animal lovers beware) turn this quiet, moving observational documentary into a heart-skipping thriller as well as a perfect encapsulation of humanity’s catastrophic domination of nature. (M.D.) During the Kosovo war in 1999, against a backdrop of NATO bombardment, a Serbian truck driver (Leon Lucev), transports a mysterious cargo toward Belgrade. He gives a ride to a young man whose reasons for traveling are equally enigmatic, and the two of them make their way across a chilly, drab landscape in this mordant, minimalist road picture, directed by Ognjen Glavonic, who leavens the journey with hints of suspense and glints of absurdist humor. This isn’t “The Wages of Fear” so much as the dividends of existential anxiety and political despair. (A.O.S.) If it bleeds, it leads — and pays the bills. That’s the uneasy truism and slow-boiling moral of the gripping documentary “Midnight Family,” about a household of ambulance workers. The title isn’t metaphoric (or not exactly), but refers to the Ochoas, who operate one of the many private ambulances that race through Mexico City. Fantastically shot by the director Luke Lorentzen, the documentary develops an urgency that suits the life-or-death stakes onscreen. By turns terrifying and exhilarating, “Midnight Family” unfolds with such velocity that it may take a while for your ethical doubts to catch up to what’s happening. When they do, they leave you gasping. (M.D.) The pig’s head on a stick, posted in a jungle encampment occupied by a pack of feral children, pays obvious homage to “Lord of the Flies.” But Alejandro Landes’s “Monos” infuses the themes of that schoolboy parable with a grim, contemporary political perspective and filters them through cinematic influences that include Terrence Malick and Werner Herzog. The kids are members of a guerrilla army in the Colombian countryside. Their mission is to guard an American hostage played by Julianne Nicholson. A lot goes wrong. As the action shifts from mountains to rain forest, Landes makes clever use of drone-mounted cameras and trippy sound design to turn the natural world into a hallucination. Unless the human characters are figments dreamed up by the landscape. (A.O.S.) When 16-year-old Mandy (an appealing Rhianne Barreto) wakes up on her family’s front lawn one dark day, she finds herself with no memory of and a body marred with wounds. The question of what happened — as well as why, who and where — reverberates through this thoughtful, low-key drama which tracks Mandy’s anguish and anger as a personal trauma increasingly becomes an exploitative public spectacle. As Mandy fights to recover her memory, she struggles with her fears, family and friends, growing progressively more isolated. Making a fine feature debut, the American Pippa Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt. (M.D.) Time bends in this sly, often-lovely drama, which pivots on a young surveyor whose past catches up with him while he’s out in the field. At one point, he walks into a seemingly deserted classroom, initiating an enigmatic journey into the past that keeps bumping into the present. Using splashes of primary color, punctuating zooms, visual echoes and narrative ellipses, the Chinese writer-director Qiu Sheng puts a fresh gloss on Faulkner’s observation that the past is never dead. It’s always here, vibrating in every red scarf, bird song and moment. “Suburban Birds” will open soon, but is so good — and delightfully kinked — that it’s well worth catching now (and watching twice).

2019,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice Murder! Espionage! Fashion! We’ve got a fun grab-bag of books this week, from true crime (“The Trial of Lizzie Borden”) to memoir (Isaac Mizrahi’s “I.M.,” Aatish Taseer’s “The Twice-Born”) to three different takes on groundbreaking women: an anthology of Andrea Dworkin’s feminist writings, a group study of five female novelists and a biography of the woman who organized a spy ring for the French Resistance. In fiction, Helen Oyeyemi has a new novel, and we recommend story collections from David Means and Christos Ikonomou alongside a debut novel from Novuyo Rosa Tshuma that explores Zimbabwe’s troubled history. Finally, something from one of our own: The Times’s top newsroom lawyer, David McCraw, has written a spirited examination of truth, journalism and the First Amendment as it plays out in his job and in the culture at large. That book, “Truth in Our Times,” is a good bet for Times readers as much as Times employees, and for anyone who cares about the future of a free press. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles THE TRIAL OF LIZZIE BORDEN: A True Story, by Cara Robertson. (Simon & Schuster, $28.) Lizzie Borden, accused of killing her father and stepmother with an ax in 1892, has gone down in history as villain, victim, punch line and the media sensation of the Gilded Age. This new book about the case was nearly 20 years in the making, and it is “enthralling,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Robertson does not work for the prosecution or the defense. She marshals us to no conclusion. She only reopens the case and presents the evidence afresh, all those alluring details out of an Agatha Christie novel.” LAST DAYS AT HOT SLIT: The Radical Feminism of Andrea Dworkin, by Andrea Dworkin. Edited by Johanna Fateman and Amy Scholder (Semiotext(e), $17.95.) Andrea Dworkin, who died in 2005, at 58, was determined to show how women could never be free as long as they lived in a world that was structured by men’s ambitions, needs and desires. This new anthology collects pieces of her essays, novels and previously unpublished works. “A new generation of feminists have reclaimed her,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “seeing in Dworkin’s incandescent rage a source of illumination, even as they bristle at some of her specific views. This new anthology of her work, shows that the caricature of her as a simplistic man-hater, a termagant in overalls, could only be sustained by not reading what she actually wrote.” GINGERBREAD, by Helen Oyeyemi. (Riverhead, $27.) For her new novel — a meditation on family and what it means to be part of a community — Oyeyemi has taken old fairy tales, seasoned them with 20th-century history and pop-culture references, and frosted them with whimsical detail. “Her sentences are like grabbing onto the tail of a vibrant, living creature without knowing what you’ll find at the other end,” Eowyn Ivey writes in her review. The novel is “jarring, funny, surprising, unsettling, disorienting and rewarding. It requires the reader to be quick-footed and alert. And by the end, it is clear what has grounded the story from the start — the tender and troubling humanity of its characters.” I.M.: A Memoir, by Isaac Mizrahi. (Flatiron, $28.99.) Throughout this autobiography by one of America’s most acclaimed designers of the 1990s, his innovation and confidence are evident, contrasting with an industry that, despite its superficial fickleness, can be deeply resistant to change. Our reviewer, Thessaly La Force, finds Mizrahi’s descriptions of his unhappy boyhood to be “unexpectedly tender” as well as “heartfelt and honest.” She concludes that Mizrahi is, “at his core, an artist above all else.” TRUTH IN OUR TIMES: Inside the Fight for Press Freedom in the Age of Alternative Facts, by David E. McCraw. (All Points, $28.99.) McCraw, the deputy general counsel of The Times, leads readers through some of his most memorable cases, particularly those involving Donald Trump. He expresses concern about the crisis of public trust, stating that “the law can do only so much.” Preet Bharara, reviewing it, says that “McCraw is in prime position to provide this backstage view as he draws equally on his experience as a writer and a lawyer. He excels at both, explaining legal issues in lay terms and unspooling the stories that propel the book.” MADAME FOURCADE’S SECRET WAR: The Daring Young Woman Who Led France’s Largest Spy Network Against Hitler, by Lynne Olson. (Random House, $30.) Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, who fought the Nazis while enduring sexism in her ranks, is little remembered today. This biography argues that she should be celebrated. “Olson writes with verve and a historian’s authority,” Kati Marton writes in her review. “Fourcade, she tells us, was beautiful and liked men, but she was obsessed with defeating the despised Boches. … With this gripping tale Lynne Olson pays her what history has so far denied her. France, slow to confront the stain of Vichy, would do well to finally honor a fighter most of us would want in our foxhole.” INSTRUCTIONS FOR A FUNERAL: Stories, by David Means. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) Means’s fifth collection, populated with adulterers and criminals, railroad bums and other castaways, suggests that beneath every act of violence there pulses a vein of grace. “This is Means’s most self-reflective and self-reflexive book to date,” Justin Taylor writes in his review, “both sweeping and narrow, panoramic and fragmentary, possessed … by ‘a gloriously full understanding … fractured to shards.’ What beauty there is in their jagged gleaming. What pleasure it gives us to gather them up, and to dream of a world made whole.” GOOD WILL COME FROM THE SEA, by Christos Ikonomou. Translated by Karen Emmerich. (Archipelago, paper, $18.) This collection of linked stories, set on an unnamed Aegean island and featuring a cast of wry, rough-talking Greeks reeling from the country’s economic devastation, showcases Ikonomou’s wit, compassion and infallible ear for the demotic. “In Ikonomou’s world, the island is a prison and the sea forms the bars,” Fani Papageorgiou writes, reviewing it. “Yet he approaches the grimness and desperation of his characters’ lives with lightness and humor, in an idiomatic Greek seamlessly translated by Karen Emmerich. … In his prose, the lyrical and the rough are always intertwined.” OUTSIDERS: Five Women Writers Who Changed the World, by Lyndall Gordon. (Johns Hopkins University, $29.95.) Gordon links five visionaries who made literary history — George Eliot, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Olive Schreiner and Virginia Woolf — through their shared understanding of death and violence. “Gordon is best known for her brilliant studies of Woolf, Charlotte Brontë and Emily Dickinson,” our reviewer, Lara Feigel, writes. “As a biographer, she’s been a visionary herself, mind-reading her way into these figures’ creative processes. She displays the same insight here.” THE TWICE-BORN: Life and Death on the Ganges, by Aatish Taseer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Attempting to rediscover his traditional Indian roots through the study of Sanskrit, a journalist finds himself alienated from them. “Taseer’s discovery of India results in a detailed, learned and highly readable tour of Hindu history,” Wendy Doniger writes in her review, “noting many of the positive contributions of the centuries of Muslim rule and dwelling at some length on the degrading and demoralizing effects of the British Raj. But along the way, the saffron scales seem to fall from his eyes as he describes the rise of Hindu nationalism.” HOUSE OF STONE, by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma. (Norton, $26.95.) This ambitious and ingenious first novel uses a young man’s search for his personal ancestry as a way of unearthing hidden aspects of Zimbabwe’s violent past. In his review, Dinaw Mengestu calls it a “remarkable” debut whose hero, Zamani is “too rich and complicated a character to be reduced to any single metaphor or symbol. … Tshuma’s brilliant layering of competing images and metaphors is one of the many marvels of this wise and demanding novel. While Zamani may claim, over and over, that what he’s seeking is a full accounting of history at the most intimate level, the stories that are slowly and painfully revealed suggest that something far more complicated is at work.”",The New York Times
2019,"11 Premature Babies Die in Less Than a Day in Tunisian Hospital, Sparking Outrage","TUNIS — Outrage grew in Tunisia this past week after 11 premature babies died in less than 24 hours from infections acquired in the same hospital as doctors and patients expressed frustration over the country’s struggling public health care system. The babies died recently at the Rabta hospital maternity ward in central Tunis, the country’s capital, after nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, infections led to deadly septic shocks, the health ministry said. Four more babies died later, and two of those deaths were also linked to the infection, said officials at a news conference at the health ministry on Friday. After the deaths, Abderraouf Cherif, the health minister, who had been nominated just months ago, quickly resigned. Several top health officials were fired. Sonia Ben Cheikh, the interim health minister, called the deaths a “national disaster” and said officials suspected a problem with the sterile room where hospital staff members prepare the premature babies’ nutrients, which were delivered intravenously. “We have doubts on the sterilization of the room and of the tools, which may have led to the infection,” she said at a news conference on Monday, adding later on local television that the department where the newborns died was short on workers, with only three doctors for 40 beds. The public outcry was worsened by the hospital’s handling of the deaths. Local television showed families holding the bodies of their newborns in cardboard boxes that had been handed to them by hospital staff members, sparking indignation on social media, especially after an official from the health ministry said on television it was not an “unusual practice” because “it can be less traumatizing than giving them in a simple blanket.” That official was fired a few days later. Prosecutors have opened an investigation, and the health ministry has asked a committee of doctors and pharmacists to investigate the deaths and the possible human errors that led to them. Mohamed Douagi, a doctor who is leading the investigative committee, said there was a wave of panic when the first babies died on Thursday, leading to “mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on three babies at the same time.” “There was a medical failure but we don’t know yet at which step,” Dr. Douagi said at a news conference on Friday. The deaths have shaken Tunisia’s government, which has been unable to reform the Tunisian health system, a recurring demand since the popular uprising of 2011 that toppled the country’s longstanding dictatorship. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said on Thursday during a meeting with the heads of hospitals around the country that he would “ensure there will be accountability for any fault that happened during these events.” He also acknowledged that the health care system has been in disrepair for several years. “The health sector is suffering from a crisis and the last reform took place more than 14 years ago,” he said, adding that since the 2011 revolution there had been “laxity,” “corruption” and a “lack of authority.” “Nobody can deny this, and it is everybody’s responsibility,” he said, “And all together we have the duty to find solutions.” For many doctors, the deaths are symptomatic of deeper issues with public health care. They say their working conditions have badly deteriorated, pointing to a lack of proper medical equipment, bad hygiene and rising distrust from patients. Tunisia’s health care system had long been considered one of the best in Africa, providing free or cheap care to millions of Tunisians through a national health insurance system. But since the 2011 revolution, corruption has increased and public hospitals and insurance funds have fallen into increasing debt, making it harder to pay suppliers for equipment. Zeineb Turki, a doctor and spokeswoman for Afek Tounes, an opposition party, noted that there had been “more than 10 ministers in less than eight years after the revolution.” “None of them had time to reflect on the sector’s underlying issues, and all of us knew it would eventually lead to such a tragedy,” she said. The number of young Tunisian doctors leaving to work abroad has grown significantly in recent years, according to the Tunisian medical association. In 2018, half of all the newly registered doctors left Tunisia to work in Europe or in Gulf countries, seeking better working conditions and higher wages. After the death of the premature babies, several young doctors created a Facebook page, “Balance ton hôpital,” French for “Denounce your hospital,” where they shared pictures and testimonies of their workplace struggles. Aymen Bettaieb, the vice-president of Tunisia’s organization of young doctors, said, “We have been speaking out for years but now the patients and the people are also with us.” He added: “We are counting on this national wave of anger to make things change once and for all,” he said.",The New York Times

2019,"12 People, Including 6 Coaches, Plead Not Guilty in College Admissions Scandal","BOSTON — A tennis coach with a country club membership and a second home on Cape Cod. An assistant teacher at a Houston public high school. A college administrator whose reputation as a stickler for the rules belied what prosecutors say was a penchant for secretly taking bribes to facilitate students’ admission. All together, a dozen people, including six coaches, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Boston on Monday in the college admissions scandal that has ensnared Hollywood celebrities and forced a reckoning at elite colleges where prosecutors say students were admitted on the basis of falsified test scores and athletic credentials. Those who appeared in court showcased the wide range of people who prosecutors believe were caught up in the scheme. The man who connected them all was William Singer, a college admissions consultant known as Rick who has pleaded guilty to helping the children of clients cheat on college admissions exams and to facilitating bribes. So far, the prosecutors have revealed little beyond what is in the charging documents, leaving several mysteries. The United States attorney’s office has said that the investigation is continuing, leading to speculation that more parents or coaches could be charged. At a news conference on March 12, Andrew E. Lelling, the United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said that one client of Mr. Singer’s had paid $6.5 million to facilitate their child’s admission to college — many times more than what any of the other parents have been accused of paying. This payment is not mentioned in any of the documents, and the person who paid this sum has not been revealed. A spokeswoman for the attorney’s office would not identify the family or the school, but said it was paid to get a child into college through the athletic recruiting scheme. Also on Monday, the federal Department of Education sent letters to the eight colleges where coaches are alleged to have taken bribes, saying that it was opening an investigation of its own, according to a department official with knowledge of the investigation. The letter said that the investigation, first reported by Politico, would examine, among other things, whether the colleges violated any laws or regulations governing federal financial aid programs. It asked the colleges for information about their admissions policies, as well as the names, Social Security numbers and academic transcripts of students who were allegedly admitted as part of the scheme. Those who appeared in court in Boston on Monday, all of whom have been indicted on one count of racketeering conspiracy, are each accused of participating in one or both aspects of the scam. At one end of the spectrum of those charged was Gordon Ernst, the former head tennis coach at Georgetown University, who has been accused of taking $2.7 million in bribes from Mr. Singer to designate at least 12 applicants as recruits to the tennis team. Prosecutors are seeking forfeiture of Mr. Ernst’s country club membership and a second home on Cape Cod, among other assets. Mr. Ernst appeared in court on Monday flanked by two prominent defense lawyers. At the other end was Lisa Williams, an assistant teacher at a Houston high school known as Niki who prosecutors say took bribes — the indictment cites one in the amount of $5,000 — in exchange for allowing cheating on the college entrance exams. The judge noted that Ms. Williams, who entered her plea in a voice barely above a whisper, had qualified for a court-appointed lawyer. In a sign of the wide interest the case has generated, television cameras and photographers crowded the sidewalk outside the courthouse an hour before the hearing. Access to the courtroom was limited, with some journalists confined to a spillover room. Inside the courtroom, the defendants, their lawyers and family members, and a few members of the public, filled the benches on the left and in the center, while the benches on the right were packed with reporters. Most of the defendants appeared in suits, but one charged in connection with test cheating, Igor Dvorskiy, the director of a private school in Los Angeles, was dressed informally, in a gray sweater. Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley conducted the hearing with the efficiency of an assembly line. She brought the defendants up three at a time to be arraigned. Mr. Ernst came first, and in addressing him about his rights and the consequences of violating the conditions of his release, Judge Kelley instructed the others to listen carefully so that she did not have to repeat herself. All of the defendants are out on bail, of varying amounts. Those who also appeared on Monday were Donna Heinel, the former senior associate athletic director at the University of Southern California; Laura Janke and Ali Khosroshahin, former University of Southern California soccer coaches; William Ferguson, the former women’s volleyball coach at Wake Forest University; Jorge Salcedo, the former head coach of men’s soccer at the University of California at Los Angeles; and Jovan Vavic, the former U.S.C. water polo coach. Others included Steven Masera, the accountant and chief financial officer of Mr. Singer’s company and a related nonprofit through which prosecutors say he funneled the bribes; Mikaela Sanford, an employee of Mr. Singer’s who is accused of taking online classes in place of some students so that they could submit the grades she earned as part of their college applications; and Martin Fox, the president of a private tennis academy in Houston, whom prosecutors say Mr. Singer paid for helping to arrange some of the bribes. Mr. Ferguson is accused of taking a bribe of $100,000 in exchange for designating the daughter of one of Mr. Singer’s clients, who had previously applied to Wake Forest and had been wait-listed, as a recruit for the volleyball team. His lawyer, Shaun Clarke, said outside the courthouse that his client was not guilty and would fight the charges. “No one — no one — was admitted to Wake Forest who didn’t earn it, as a student and as an athlete,” Mr. Clarke said. “Bill Ferguson does not belong in this indictment.” More hearings, with other defendants in the case, are scheduled for later this week. In an indication of how high a priority the case is for the office, Mr. Lelling, the United States attorney, attended part of the hearing on Monday.",The New York Times
2019,12 Plays and Musicals to Go to in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater. ‘AIN’T NO MO’ at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on March 27). When Donald J. Trump was elected president, a lot of people talked about fleeing to Canada or elsewhere. Few made good on it. But Jordan E. Cooper’s play imagines a world where black Americans prepare to depart en masse. Stevie Walker-Webb directs a satire in which black lives mobilize. 212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘HADESTOWN’ at the Walter Kerr Theater (previews start on March 22; opens on April 17). Directed by Rachel Chavkin, Anaïs Mitchell’s swooning folk opera, which retells the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, descends on Broadway. When the musical first ran Off Broadway, The Times wrote that Mitchell’s “lovely music and well-turned lyrics are tightly bound together.” Reeve Carney and Eva Noblezada star. 877-250-2929, hadestown.com ‘JULIUS CAESAR’ at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on March 28). Shakespeare’s tragedy arrives Off Broadway at Theater for a New Audience. The director Shana Cooper approaches the play, which she first staged at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2017, as a resonant political thriller. Rocco Sisto is Caesar, and Brandon J. Dirden is Brutus. 866-811-4111, tfana.org ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ at the Park Avenue Armory (previews start on March 22; opens on March 27). A staggering collapse, a theatrical resurgence. Written by Stefano Massini, adapted by Ben Power and directed by Sam Mendes, this history of Lehman Brothers from its beginnings to its bankruptcy comes to New York. When he saw the three-man show in London, Ben Brantley praised “its exceptional concentration of narrative simplicity and depth, in which minimal resources seem to expand into unlimited riches.” 212-933-5812, armoryonpark.org ‘MARJANA AND THE FORTY THIEVES’ at the Doxsee (previews start on March 28; opens on April 1). Maybe you know a certain story with the name Ali Baba attached to it, but this Target Margin show, directed by David Herskovits, approaches “The One Thousand and One Nights” from another angle, focusing on a wily servant girl. The cast includes Caitlin Nasema Cassidy, Sophie Laruelle, Anthony Vaughn Merchant, Anish Roy and Isuri Wijesundara. 212-352-3101, targetmargin.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ at Greenwich House Theater (previews start on March 26; opens on April 8). The Mad Ones, creators of some of the richest and most carefully observed devised theater, make a show about making a show. This latest play centers on a 1970s children’s television program, with Phillip James Brannon, Brad Heberlee, Carmen M. Herlihy and January LaVoy joining Mad Ones regulars. Lila Neugebauer directs. arsnovanyc.com ‘ANASTASIA’ at the Broadhurst Theater (closes on March 31). This Broadway musical, about a possible heir to the Russian throne, takes just a few more journeys into the past. With Christy Altomare in the starring role, a book by Terrence McNally and songs by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, this adaptation of two 20th Century Fox films “trembles nonstop with internal conflicts during its drawn-out two-and-a-half hours,” Ben Brantley wrote. 212-239-6200, anastasiathemusical.com ‘BOESMAN AND LENA’ at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on March 24). Athol Fugard’s apartheid-era drama, staged by the South African director Yaël Farber, treks toward its final performance. Jesse Green argues that the play, about a common-law couple in search of shelter, has metamorphosed into an existential drama, reshaped perhaps by Zainab Jah and Sahr Ngaujah’s “admirable, uncompromising performances.” 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org ‘GLORIA’ at the Daryl Roth Theater (closes on March 31). Audiences have two more weeks to acknowledge the equality and full humanity of women as this biographical play centered on Gloria Steinem draws to a close Off Broadway. Directed by Diane Paulus and now starring Patricia Kalember, the show concludes with a talking circle, which on the night Jesse Green saw it, “took the raw materials of the play and turned them into thrilling community drama.” gloriatheplay.com ‘HURRICANE DIANE’ at New York Theater Workshop (closes on March 24). Madeleine George’s untamed skewering of Euripides’s “The Bacchae,” reset in a suburban cul-de-sac, finishes its run. This tragicomedy about climate change and landscape architecture, directed by Leigh Silverman, stars the inimitable Becca Blackwell as a butch gardener. Jesse Green wrote that Dionysus’s nonbinary energy, as delivered by the nonbinary Blackwell, “unleashes something wild in the play.” 212-460-5475, nytw.org ‘SEA WALL/A LIFE’ at the Public Theater (closes on March 31). The men in sweaters in these twinned one-acts will soon stop wrestling with existence. Tom Sturridge stars in Simon Stephen’s play, while Jake Gyllenhaal delivers Nick Payne’s monologue. Carrie Cracknell directs both. According to Jesse Green, “the performances give you plenty to ponder in showing how we now read life, with or without fate, as everyone’s tragedy.” 212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘SUICIDE FOREST’ at the Bushwick Starr (closes on March 23). Kristine Haruna Lee’s absurdist drama wraps up in Brooklyn. Directed by Aya Ogawa, it intertwines the lives of a suicidal salaryman and an abused schoolgirl with Lee’s own family history. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that, for Lee, “this play is an exorcism. But it is also an embrace.” thebushwickstarr.org",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ANTIBALAS at Brooklyn Bowl (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). This Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band is celebrating 20 years together with a two-night run, during which they will perform the kind of large-ensemble party music — think a vibrant horn section and multiple percussionists — that’s made them so irresistible for the past two decades. Their work incorporates dub, funk and jazz, creating a rich, textured version of the kind of global dance sound that’s become increasingly popular over the course of their career. On Friday, the music collective Innov Gnawa will open, and on Saturday, the hip-hop group Poetic Thrust will kick things off. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com GARY CLARK JR. at the Beacon Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.). As a gifted blues guitarist, this Austin, Tex., native could easily stick to traditional sounds. But Clark continues to make songs that are expansive and forward-looking. He channels his remarkable technical ability toward hard-edge, political and genre-bending music that is nevertheless rooted in the blues, or at least its angst and earnestness. On his most recent album, “This Land,” he tackles racism and American politics through tunes that are anything but easy listening — and all the better for it.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com GUSTER at the Beacon Theater (March 16, 8 p.m.). Since the members of this alternative rock band met during orientation at Tufts University in 1991, they have made consistently upbeat and pleasantly eccentric albums. Their latest, “Look Alive,” is their first release in four years, but their enthusiasm hasn’t dulled — at least if the album’s bright, polished, synth-driven indie-pop track list is any indication. Its sound is as approachable and harmony-rich as that of the songs that earned the still-independent band spots on mainstream soundtracks like “The O.C.” and “Wedding Crashers.”212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HABIB KOITÉ at Le Poisson Rouge (March 15, 8 p.m.). A virtuosic guitarist, Koité has cultivated his own niche within the string-rich musical culture of his native Mali. He uses unorthodox tunings and incorporates a global mix of flamenco and blues into his interpretation of dansa, a traditional form of Malian music from his hometown, Kayes. The resulting sound has reached international audiences and gained fans like Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps best known for his approachable 1998 album, “Ma Ya,” Koité, 61, continues to act as an ambassador of Mali’s music.212-505-3474, lpr.com LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III at Sony Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). You might have already seen this show — it’s the live version of Wainwright’s recent Netflix special, “Surviving Twin,” which itself is the filmed version of a one-man set he’s been performing since 2013. “Surviving Twin” takes its title from a Wainwright song of the same name, which is about the singer-songwriter’s relationship with his father, Loudon Wainwright Jr.; the show, though, is about relationships between fathers and sons more broadly, including Wainwright’s son and fellow performer, Rufus.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com DALE WATSON AND KINKY FRIEDMAN at Union Pool (March 16, 7 p.m.). Two Texas titans visit Brooklyn this week to perform a brand of country music that’s so traditional, it has made them outsiders. Watson favors a polished rockabilly shuffle that sounds straight out of the 1960s, while Friedman tempers his irreverent, occasionally profane tunes with twangy guitar and banjos. Both are beloved for their willingness to buck trends (and any chance of mainstream success) and deftly play country music that transports listeners anywhere — even in Williamsburg — to an old-fashioned honky-tonk. 718-609-0484, union-pool.com NATALIE WEINER CARLA BLEY TRIO at Jazz Standard (March 19-20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Unlike her compositions — a lovable admixture of American folk songs, avant-garde jazz, soft rock and Romanticism — Bley, at age 82, remains a rather inaccessible figure. She doesn’t tour often, and she has long preferred the scholarly remove of a composer’s identity to the more public one of a bandleader. All of which makes this appearance, featuring her longstanding trio (Bley on piano, Steve Swallow on bass and Andy Sheppard on saxophones), something especially worth seeking out.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com MARÍA GRAND at Roulette (March 21, 8 p.m.). A dauntless young tenor saxophonist whose concept and ambition seem to grow broader by the week, Grand is unwilling to accept anything as a given — stylistically, culturally, whatever. This concert, which she has titled “Music as a User’s Manual,” is meant to upend the passive relationship between audience and performance. How will she achieve this? That, presumably, depends on you as much as on her. But we know this: The first portion of the night will feature Grand alone, on saxophone and vocals; she’ll then be joined by Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Joel Ross on vibraphone and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, for a separate set.917-267-0368, roulette.org LARRY GRENADIER at Zürcher Gallery (March 15, 8 p.m.). A leading jazz bassist since the 1990s, when he was a member of Brad Mehldau’s watershed trio, Grenadier recently put out his first solo-bass recording, “The Gleaners.” The album feels like a peek into a private world, as if you’re discovering the poems of a great writer who was known only for his essays. (In actuality, it’s inspired by film: specifically, Agnes Varda’s famed documentary about potato harvesters, “The Gleaners and I.”) For much of the record Grenadier focuses on arco playing, showing great range: He can use the bow to create spritzed, lively rhythms or a luminous, slow immersion. Abstraction would seem inherent to a solo-jazz-bass performance, but there’s nothing dreamlike about this album; his sound is as direct and powerful as it is elegant.galeriezurcher.com THANDISWA MAZWAI AND NDUDUZO MAKHATHINI at the Africa Center (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). Mazwai is an A-list celebrity in South Africa, where she upholds a long tradition of politically engaged pop singing. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as the lead vocalist in Bongo Maffin, a famed group in the kwaito genre (a kind of house music). In the years since she has become known as a solo artist carrying on the legacies of Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie and other vocalists who blended jazz, pop and South African folk music. Here she appears alongside Makhathini, a young pianist with a thriving career as both a sideman and a solo artist, always guided by an attentiveness to music’s potential for healing and renewal. This concert is presented as part of the Salon Africana series, which features performers chosen by the vocalist Somi.salonafricana.com CHARLES TOLLIVER at the Blue Note (March 14-17, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). A trumpeter with a strong, unvarnished attack, Tolliver launched his recording career in 1968 with the release of “Paper Man,” an epochal record reflecting the blend of post-bop, psychedelic rock, salsa and increasingly militant funk being played around New York City at the time. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of the record’s release last year in a triumphant performance at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, and this weekend at the Blue Note he will reprise the reprisal once again. In addition to the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz — who was in the quintet that recorded the original album — he will be joined by the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White.212-475-8592, bluenote.net ‘UNFORGETTABLE: THE MAGIC OF NAT KING COLE’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). The pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole — who died in 1965, at the height of his fame — would have turned 100 on Sunday. In honor of his life and legacy, the svelte and subtly inventive vocalist Sachal Vasandani will interpret songs from Cole’s repertoire with an all-star band: Shai Maestro on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums.718-463-7700, flushingtownhall.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO KAREN O AND DANGER MOUSE at Florence Gould Hall (March 20, 7 p.m.). Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic for The New York Times, hosts an evening of music and conversation with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and the musician and producer Danger Mouse. On Friday, the duo will release “Lux Prima,” their first-ever collaboration. The audience will get to hear a selection of songs from the album during this discussion.timestalks.com",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. BILAL at National Sawdust (March 29, 8 p.m.). A onetime member of the Soulquarians, this Philadelphia-born singer, songwriter and producer is well known as a collaborator: He has won a Grammy for his work with Kendrick Lamar and lent his vocals to the likes of Jay-Z and Mac Miller. Bilal himself took a circuitous path as a solo artist after his sophomore album was shelved in 2006. Disenchanted with the industry, he parted ways with his label and began experimenting with jazz and electronic sounds, rejecting the “neo-soul” billing that has followed him for much of his career. The result, heard on recent albums “A Love Surreal” and “In Another Life,” is fluid and inviting. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org BROADLY PRESENTS EUPHORIA at Villain (March 30, 8 p.m.). This Vice-owned event space hosts a celebration of International Transgender Day of Visibility, organized by the media company’s female-focused internet channel. Following an afternoon fair for transgender-centered businesses, the evening session will culminate with a dance party hosted by the D.J. Bronze Goddess and the House of LaBeija, one of New York’s oldest drag houses. A performance by Big Freedia — the New Orleans-based rapper and an ambassador of the city’s distinctive bounce style, known for her high-profile collaborations with Beyoncé and Drake — is sure to be a highlight.eventbrite.com EARL SWEATSHIRT at Irving Plaza (March 30, 8 p.m.). For years, the rapper Thebe Kgositsile has been fighting against his own founding myth. Kgositsile, who performs as Earl Sweatshirt, got his start with the California collective Odd Future, gaining a following in 2010 as a viral teenage provocateur with an affinity for shock value and gore. Following his first mixtape, Kgositsile’s music started to show more vulnerability. His latest album, an exploratory set titled “Some Rap Songs,” considers family: A standout track, “Playing Possum,” incorporates sampled audio from his mother and recently deceased poet father. Kgositsile’s performance is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market.212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] EX HEX at Bowery Ballroom (April 4, 8 p.m.). Technically skilled and wildly inventive, the rock nomad Mary Timony is routinely held up as a guitar god. With Ex Hex, the Washington-based trio she has led since 2014, Timony’s style pulls back from the experimentalism she embraced as the frontwoman of the riot-grrrl-adjacent group Helium in the 1990s. Rounded out by the bassist Betsy Wright and the drummer Laura Harris, Ex Hex play more straight-ahead garage rock; their second full-length recording, “It’s Real,” is packed with power chords, revved-up guitar solos and layered vocals — perfect fodder for the group’s notoriously fun live show.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com MATMOS AND KEITH FULLERTON WHITMAN at Pioneer Works (April 4, 7 p.m.). Both acts on this double bill work with experimental hybrids of electronic and organic sound. Since coming together in 1997, Matmos — the duo of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel — have obsessed over the materiality of music. They compose by gathering samples from diverse sources, like washing machines, animal cages or amplified nerve tissue; their new record, “Plastic Anniversary,” cleverly comments on the impending environmental crisis by drawing from all-plastic source material. Expect to hear selections from that album at this art center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as well as the highly technical experiments in ambient and drone from the Brooklyn-based performer Whitman.pioneerworks.org DEEM SPENCER at Baby’s All Right (April 3, 8 p.m.). On his earliest releases, this soft-spoken rapper from Queens delivered a sound that might have been described as half-whispered, and half-finished, poetry. Last month’s “Pretty Face” — his first full-length recording — is built on the same melancholy lyricism and lo-fi production that defined previous projects, but it feels more resolute, nudging up the intensity on his heartsick ruminations. Spencer’s performance at this fittingly intimate club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is two milestones in one: his first headlining show in New York and the live debut of tracks from “Pretty Face.”718-599-5800, babysallright.comOLIVIA HORN BACHIR AND MUSTAPHA ATTAR at Roulette (March 30, 8 p.m.). The Master Musicians of Jajouka, a heritage band from a small village in Morocco, have become an influence on the rest of the world thanks to their work with Western stars such as Ornette Coleman, Bernardo Bertolucci and even the Rolling Stones. They’re defined by the sharp scrawl of the ghaita, a double-reed instrument, and the resounding pound of the tebel drum, which is made of goatskin and struck with wooden sticks. Bachir and Mustapha Attar are the sons of Hadj Abdesalam Attar, who led the Master Musicians when they made their first recordings in the 1960s. At this concert, part of the continuing A World in Trance festival, the Attar brothers will perform alongside three improvising musicians based in the United States: the saxophonist and clarinetist Ned Rothenberg; the saxophonist, vocalist and visual artist Arrington de Dionyso; and the percussionist Ben Bennett.917-267-0368, roulette.org BROKEN SHADOWS at the Village Vanguard (through March 31, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). The alto saxophonist Tim Berne, an outré doyen of the New York music scene, writes runic, sharp-edged, fiercely desiccated tunes. They’re a lot of fun if you’re the type who likes to question the entire phenomenology of “tunes” or, better yet, “fun.” Broken Shadows, his new band, which is about to release an album on the subscription-only Newvelle Records imprint, is more immediately rambunctious. This music is easy to sing along with, and to move to, partly because the group mostly plays the compositions of Ornette Coleman, and partly because of the personnel: the underappreciated tenor saxophonist Chris Speed, the wily bassist Reid Anderson and the gallivanting drummer Dave King.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com EDDIE HENDERSON at Smoke (March 28-30, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). In big-band jazz and bebop, a trumpeter was often responsible for adding a flare of percussive energy to the upper reaches of a group’s sound. In later forms of jazz, more heavily influenced by funk and soul, the instrument sometimes played more of a steadying role — holding sultry tones, projecting calm — while the rhythm section addressed questions of impact more directly. Eddie Henderson is comfortable in both circumstances, though he is more commonly associated with the jazz-funk movement of the 1970s, when he was known for work in his own bands and those led by Herbie Hancock. He performs here with Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, Peter Zak on piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Mike Clark on drums — most of whom appeared on “Be Cool,” Henderson’s strong album from 2018.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com SUSIE IBARRA at H0L0 (March 31, 7 p.m.). Ibarra plays the drums with cool precision and a sense of architectural awareness that befits a great composer. After all, she’s that too. Always blazing a new creative trail, she will present at H0L0 a fresh project, “Bird Songs,” featuring original music inspired by bird calls, with Jake Landau on guitar and keyboards and Jean-Luc Sinclair on electronics. The cellist Leila Bordreuil and the vocalist and performance artist Lauren Tosswill will open the show with separate solo performances.h0l0.nyc MARCUS MILLER at the Rose Theater (March 29-30, 8 p.m.). During the 1980s, Miller was the bassist and musical director in some of Miles Davis’s final bands; he wrote and produced almost every tune on “Tutu,” Davis’s Grammy-winning jazz-pop album from 1986. Here Miller will present a concert surveying the panorama of Davis’s electric period, which stretches back to the late 1960s, in an octet featuring Brett Williams on keyboards, Alex Han on saxophone, Marquis Hill and Russell Gunn on trumpet, Vernon Reid on guitar, Alex Bailey on drums and Mino Cinelu on percussion. Each night’s concert will be preceded by a discussion with Miller at 7 p.m.212-721-6500, jazz.org ‘TWO WINGS: THE MUSIC OF BLACK AMERICA IN MIGRATION’ at the Stern Auditorium (March 30, 8 p.m.). The operatic mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran and the pianist Jason Moran, a MacArthur fellow, like to think beyond the idea of multimedia performance. In 2012, with “Bleed,” they transformed a floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art into a zone of convergence and exchange, inviting dozens of performers, scholars and healers to collaborate over a period of days. And on Saturday they will debut “Two Wings,” a community-crafted project that uses the Morans’ own family lore to interrogate the history of America’s Great Migration. The Morans’ fellow performers will include the vocalists Pastor Smokie Norful, Toshi Reagon and Hilda Harris, and the Imani Winds quintet. The historian Isabel Wilkerson will read portions of her definitive account of the Great Migration, “The Warmth of Other Suns.” The concert is part of “Migrations: The Making of America,” a continuing festival produced by Carnegie Hall.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. A-TRAK at Marquee (March 22, 11 p.m.). A touring D.J. for Kanye West in the early 2000s, this Canadian turntablist quickly graduated from trusted collaborator to label boss: In 2007, he co-founded Fool’s Gold, a Brooklyn-based record company that has championed artists like Danny Brown and Kid Cudi. He has also released his own work through the label, including 2016’s “In the Loop: A Decade of Remixes,” a box set compiling a selection of his 200-plus credited remixes (most notably, his version of “Heads Will Roll” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs). A-Trak celebrates his birthday with a guest set at this trendy West Chelsea nightclub. 646-473-0202, marqueeny.com MARIAH CAREY at Radio City Music Hall (March 25, 8 p.m.). Since the early 1990s, this powerhouse has put the full might of her five-octave voice behind radio hits that straddle genres, from the honeyed daze of “Always Be My Baby” to the hip-hop flair of her “Fantasy” remix featuring Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Currently, Carey is on the road touring her 15th studio album, “Caution” — a record graced by collaborators like Ty Dolla Sign and Dev Hynes. It prioritizes a more subdued, of-the-moment R&B sound over the vocal theatrics for which Carey is known. Still, expect the singer to dust off the showstoppers for her hometown crowd. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com FLOHIO at Baby’s All Right (March 22, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,13 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE’ at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). This rapturous exhibition upends Modernism’s holiest genesis tale — that the male trinity of Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian invented abstract painting starting in 1913. It demonstrates that a female Swedish artist got there first (1906-7), in great style and a radically bold scale with paintings that feel startlingly contemporary. The mother of all revisionist shows regarding Modernism. (Roberta Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org ‘LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD’ at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer exhibition highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Holland Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art. The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too.

Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). At the summit the Guggenheim’s spiraling rotunda, this show appears as if the exhibition of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, on the floors below, had suddenly exploded into 28 fragments. Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint’s oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls “chapters.” Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through séances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem. (Martha Schwendener) 212-423-3575, guggenheim.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘VOICE OF MY CITY: JEROME ROBBINS AND NEW YORK’ at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (through March 30). The choreographer of “West Side Story” and “Fiddler on the Roof” was born a little over 100 years ago, but this exhibition is so much more than a centenary obligation; it’s an openhearted, deeply moving showcase of Robbins’s work, notes and diaries, full of the joy and anxiety of postwar Manhattan. Robbins, born Jerry Rabinowitz, made creditable paintings and drawings as a teenager, and in his 20s he hit it big with “Fancy Free,” set to a syncopated score by Leonard Bernstein, and evoked here through original footage and Robbins’s sketches of jumping and prancing seamen. He bullied dancers, and infuriated friends when he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, but his engrossing journals, rich with watercolors and watery notes to self, reveal the intense self-doubt that his choreography obscured. What Robbins loved most was New York, the city that was his muse and his helpmeet — and that has been transformed beyond recognition from the days of Jets and Sharks. (Farago)917-275-6975, nypl.org ‘ANDY WARHOL — FROM A TO B AND BACK AGAIN’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through March 31). Although this is the artist’s first full American retrospective in 31 years, he’s been so much with us — in museums, galleries, auctions — as to make him, like wallpaper, like the atmosphere, only half-noticed. The Whitney show restores him to a full, commanding view, but does so in a carefully shaped and edited way, with an emphasis on very early and late work. Despite the show’s monumentalizing size, it’s a human-scale Warhol we see. Largely absent is the artist-entrepreneur who is taken as a prophet of our market-addled present. What we have instead is Warhol for whom art, whatever else it was, was an expression of personal hopes and fears. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘STERLING RUBY: CERAMICS’ at the Museum of Art and Design (through March 17). Adept at most art mediums, this artist is at his best in ceramics, especially in the outsize, awkwardly hand-built, resplendently glazed baskets, ashtrays and plates and the objects that verge on sculpture in this show. These works actively incorporate accident and aspects of the ready-made, have precedents in the large-scale ceramics of Peter Voulkos and Viola Frey, but may be closest in spirit to the Neo-Expressionism of Julian Schnabel — rehabilitated, of course.

2019,13 Civilians Reported Killed in U.S. Airstrikes in Afghanistan,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — At least 13 civilians, including several children, were killed in American airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan that were carried out in support of an Afghan-led operation against the Taliban, local officials and tribal elders said on Sunday. Members of a C.I.A.-sponsored Afghan strike force called in air support after coming under fire on Saturday as they mounted an assault on Taliban fighters in the district of Hesarak in Nangarhar Province, the officials said. The airstrikes hit two houses in the village of Naser Khil, said a tribal elder, Ruzi Khan Maruf. In one house, the village’s lone doctor, his wife and their five teenage daughters were killed, Mr. Maruf said by telephone. In the other, the doctor’s brother, his wife and their four children — three teenage girls and a boy — reportedly died. The brother was an Afghan soldier, Mr. Maruf said. Shah Mahmood Miakhel, the governor of Nangarhar Province, said an important Taliban commander had also been killed in the airstrikes. The exact number of civilians killed was unclear, he said. A spokeswoman for the American-led NATO mission in Afghanistan confirmed the airstrikes but did not directly address the reports of civilian casualties, saying only that the coalition was looking into the matter. “In self-defense, precision airstrikes were used to support the troops on the ground,” said the spokeswoman, Sgt. First Class Debra Richardson, adding that the Afghans had been targeting a Taliban operations center. “We are fighting in a complex environment against those who intentionally kill and hide behind civilians. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of accuracy and accountability, and we are looking into this.” American commanders say they follow strict procedures to try to ensure no civilians are present before airstrikes are authorized. They also often accuse insurgents of using civilians as shields, as Sergeant Richardson did on Sunday. Afghan strike teams, trained and overseen by the C.I.A., have been an effective force against some of the country’s most brutal militant groups. But they have also been linked to widespread abuses, carrying out torture and killings with near impunity. They operate in parallel with the United States military, but under looser rules. In recent months, the American military has increased attacks against the Taliban, seeking leverage as American negotiators hold peace talks with the militants. Civilian deaths from airstrikes rose 39 percent during the first nine months of 2018, compared with the same period the year before, according to the United Nations. Last month, at least 10 civilians were reported killed in American airstrikes in southern Helmand Province. The issue of civilian casualties was raised in January during the talks between the Taliban and American representatives in Doha, the Qatari capital. Negotiators from both sides are meeting again now, in talks that have gone into a 14th day. In another deadly episode over the weekend, three civilians, including a woman and two children, were shot and killed during a nighttime raid in Wardak Province, said Shafiullah Hotak, a member of the provincial council. A Taliban commander was also killed in the operation, he said.",The New York Times

T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers.

2019,14 Officers Indicted on Assault or Cover-Up Charges in Beating of Black Men,"A Massachusetts grand jury has indicted 12 current and two former officers of the Springfield Police Department who are accused of beating a group of four black men after a barroom dispute or participating in a cover-up of the assault. The announcement by the state attorney general’s office and the F.B.I. on Wednesday is the latest blow to the police force in Springfield, the state’s third-largest city. Last fall, two other police officers in the city were indicted on charges of using unreasonable force while arresting two Hispanic boys. They have pleaded not guilty. Additionally, the Justice Department is investigating whether the Springfield narcotics unit routinely used excessive force and violated residents’ civil rights. Wednesday’s indictments stem from an April 2015 confrontation that began inside Nathan Bills Bar & Restaurant, when one of the black men whistled at a bartender to get her attention. One off-duty officer thought the man was whistling at his girlfriend, an officer who was also off duty at the time, according to a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by the four black men To clarify the misunderstanding, the lawsuit said, one of the men offered to buy the male officer a drink but was rebuffed. The four African-American patrons said they were later attacked by a group of white men down the street from the bar. They were “beaten and kicked and sustained significant injuries as a result of the assault” by six off-duty officers and one of the bar’s co-owners, the attorney general’s office said. Shawn Allyn, a lawyer for one of the six officers charged with assault, said Thursday that his client would be vindicated. “In my 20 years of representing criminal defendants in federal and state courts, I have never seen a case where an attorney general office has gotten the facts so wrong,” he said. “After the local district attorney and the Massachusetts United States attorney declined prosecutions in these cases, Attorney General Maura Healy interjected her office into a barroom brawl for which my client sustained serious bodily injuries and is the victim.” Nine officers as well as two co-owners of the bar are accused of taking part in a cover-up of the assault, the attorney general’s statement said. The co-owners were indicted Wednesday for misleading investigators. The attorney general said that one bar owner misled the F.B.I. during the investigation, and that many of the officers filed false police reports while the investigation was ongoing. They then lied in their testimony to the state grand jury, the attorney general said. In September, the City of Springfield agreed to pay $885,000 to settle the federal civil rights lawsuits brought by the four black men. The city of 155,000 people has about 480 police officers. The dozen officers indicted Wednesday will be suspended without pay, the acting police commissioner, Cheryl Clapprood, said. She said that she would weigh further disciplinary action once she learned more details from the grand jury proceedings. Six officers and one of the co-owners are each charged with four counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon; assault and battery causing serious bodily injury; three counts of assault and battery; and conspiracy. The rest are charged in connection with the alleged cover-up. The Springfield Patrolman’s Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Of the two former officers, one is retired and the other is now a state trooper. The Massachusetts State Police said that it would have a hearing on Friday to determine the status of the former Springfield police officer on its force, though he has been relieved of duty. “I am very disappointed and angry — these are very serious charges,” said Mayor Domenic J. Sarno. “Police officers are held to a higher standard and as I have stated before, must wear their badges, not only bravely, but with honor, integrity and professionalism.”",The New York Times
2019,14 Plays and Musicals to Go to in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater. ‘AIN’T NO MO’’ at the Public Theater (previews start on March 12; opens on March 27). When Donald J. Trump was elected president, a lot of people talked about fleeing to Canada or elsewhere. Few made good on it. But Jordan E. Cooper’s play imagines a world where black Americans prepare to depart en masse. Stevie Walker-Webb directs a satire in which black lives mobilize. 212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘ANYTHING THAT GIVES OFF LIGHT’ at Joe’s Pub (previews start on March 14; opens on March 16). The Highlands of Scotland and the hills of Appalachia unexpectedly collide in this new work presented by the TEAM and the National Theater of Scotland, with music by the Bengsons. Directed by Rachel Chavkin, the play tracks an American woman, who finds herself alone on her second honeymoon in Scotland, and the two men she meets at a pub. 212-967-7555, joespub.com ‘BE MORE CHILL’ at the Lyceum Theater (in previews; opens on March 10). A favorite of some blissfully uncool young fans, this Joe Iconis and Joe Tracz musical about a teenager who swallows a potentially malevolent supercomputer is booting up on Broadway. Reviewing the Off Broadway production, Ben Brantley called it a “high-energy, high-anxiety musical.” Stephen Brackett directs. bemorechillmusical.com ‘HATE____’ at the WP Theater (in previews; opens on March 13). The heart wants what it wants, and sometimes it wants what the brain strongly objects to. WP Theater and Colt Coeur present Rehana Lew Mirza’s play about a literature professor (Kavi Ladnier) and the novelist (Sendhil Ramamurthy) she may or may not detest. Adrienne Campbell-Holt directs. 866-811-4111, wptheater.org ‘IF PRETTY HURTS UGLY MUST BE A ________’ at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on March 10). Tori Sampson makes her Playwrights Horizons debut with a parable of blackness and beauty. Set in the village of Affreakah-Amirrorkah, the play is a collision of Greek drama, Brechtian teaching plays and anguished contemporary comedy. Leah C. Gardiner directs a cast that includes Nike Uche Kadri as the town’s most beautiful girl. 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org ‘KISS ME, KATE’ at Studio 54 (in previews; opens on March 14). Brush up on your Shakespeare and your Cole Porter, too, because the Roundabout is reviving this 1948 musical, a metatheatrical riff on “The Taming of the Shrew.” Under Scott Ellis’s direction, Kelli O’Hara stars alongside Will Chase, Corbin Bleu and Stephanie Styles. Has the show aged poorly or will it be just wunderbar? 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘THE MOTHER’ at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (in previews; opens on March 11). Florian Zeller’s “The Father,” a chilling, brain-addling play about dementia, was on Broadway in 2016. Now this earlier drama, about a middle-aged woman questioning her reality, arrives Off Broadway. Isabelle Huppert stars as a woman suspicious of her husband (Chris Noth) and her son. Trip Cullman directs. 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org ‘SKINNAMARINK’ at the Fourth Street Theater (previews start on March 8; opens on March 13). Before Dick and Jane ran, American children fumbled toward literacy with McGuffey’s Eclectic Readers, a few of which are still in use today. In its new show, Little Lord, the plunderer of cultural memory, revisits these primers and the queasy moral indoctrination they taught alongside proper spelling and grammar. Michael Levinton directs. 212-460-5475, littlelord.org ‘SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY’ at the Clurman Theater at Theater Row (in previews; opens on March 13). At a struggling Newark school, a neglected middle schooler and a lunch lady form a lasting bond. Chisa Hutchinson’s play for Keen Company promises more than the usual R.D.A. of uplift and maybe some cartons of milk, too. Jessi D. Hill directs. Jay Mazyck and Brenda Pressley star. 212-239-6200, keencompany.org ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ at the Helen Hayes Theater (previews start on March 14; opens on March 31). Part constitutional law seminar, part rollicking comedy, Heidi Schreck’s show about her fraught romance with the Constitution finds a more perfect home: Broadway. Jesse Green called the play, which also stars Mike Iveson, Rosdely Ciprian and Thursday Williams, “one of those subversive and eye-opening new experiences.” 212-239-6200, constitutionbroadway.com ‘BY THE WAY, MEET VERA STARK’ at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on March 10). Lynn Nottage’s spiky Hollywood comedy readies for its final close-ups. The play, which ranges from 1933 to 2003, weaving in and out of the life of an African-American actress, isn’t especially tidy, but it’s brainy, fizzy and ultimately wrenching in its consideration of stereotype and erasure. 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org ‘CHOIR BOY’ at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (closes on March 10). Directed by Trip Cullman, Tarell Alvin McCraney’s play about prep-school boys warbling their way toward maturity performs its final encores. Although Jesse Green critiqued the flimsiness of the plot and some of the characters, he wrote that “Choir Boy” is “a script, or at least a production, that is far more powerful than its flaws might indicate.” 212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com ‘MIES JULIE’ AND ‘THE DANCE OF DEATH’ at Classic Stage Company (closes on March 10). Two of August Strindberg’s bad romances, running in repertory, reach the end. Ben Brantley wrote that even though neither Yaël Farber’s adaptation of “Mies Julie,” directed by Shariffa Ali, nor Conor McPherson’s version of “The Dance of Death,” directed by Victoria Clark, kindles Strindberg’s “infernal heat,” each introduces the audience to a “complex and uncomfortable world.” 866-811-4111, classicstage.org ‘TRUE WEST’ at the American Airlines Theater (closes on March 17). Sam Shepard’s tale of brotherly animus and noxious masculinity, produced by Roundabout Theater Company, stages its last showdown. James Macdonald’s revival, starring Ethan Hawke as a drifter, Paul Dano as a screenwriter and several houseplants as their innocent victims, moved Ben Brantley to write, “everyday sibling rivalry has seldom felt this ominous.” 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org",The New York Times
2019,"14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. COLONIZED DREAMS: A MIPSTERZ EVENT at the Knockdown Center (March 9, 6:30 p.m.). Mipsterz, a collective whose name merges “Muslim” and “hipsters,” is led by the filmmaker Abbas Rattani, the illustrator Sara Alfageeh and the musician Yusuf Siddiquee and promotes the work of Muslim artists across genres. For this showcase, the group has curated a lineup of Muslim musicians, writers and artists who are mostly from New York. Humeysha, the musical alias of the Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Zain Alam, blends spacey indie rock with more traditional Indian sounds from instruments like the tabla and puja bells. The D.J. Ayes Cold connects bhangra music with hip-hop and R&B, while the Lebanese-American percussionist Adam Maalouf performs mostly on the pantam, an instrument created from the Trinidadian steel pan and southern India’s ghatam drum. 718-489-6285, knockdown.center MATTHEW DEAR at Elsewhere (March 8, 7 p.m.). A founding artist of the trendy electronic music label Ghostly International, Dear is better known as a bandleader, producer and D.J. whose work is steeped in Detroit techno. He has remixed songs for the likes of the XX and Spoon, and as a soloist, his work has long incorporated nearly equal parts electronic effects and live performance. On his latest album, 2018’s “Bunny,” which features Tegan and Sara and Greg Ahee from Protomartyr, Dear’s voice and songwriting give a more personal dimension to his reliably left-of-center yet dance-floor-ready beats.elsewherebrooklyn.com LITTLE FEAT at the Beacon Theater (March 8, 8 p.m.). At the half-century mark, a number of the musicians behind Little Feat’s best-known songs are still with the group, including the co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, the guitarist Paul Barrere, the percussionist Sam Clayton and the bassist Kenny Gradney. For this celebration of their 50 years onstage, expect a career-spanning retrospective that shows the range of this tricky-to-pin-down band, whose work spans country, funk, R&B and more. Regardless of what they’re playing, though, Little Feat have long been celebrated for their live act. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MEEK MILL at Hammerstein Ballroom (March 12-13, 8 p.m.). This Philadelphia-born rapper’s rise could hardly be more antithetical to 2019’s standard rap narrativeof getting discovered on SoundCloud by a major label, and then steering toward viral fame with the label’s help. Instead, Meek Mill took the long way to the top, first gaining credibility as a battle rapper and flirting with mainstream success, which was derailed by protracted legal battles and stints in prison. The strength of the work from the early years of his career, though — especially “Dreams and Nightmares,” the album cut that has become every underdog’s anthem, and the rapper’s best-known song — helped him push through. Finally, he is back in the world and back on the road. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-279-7740, mc34.com ROBYN at Madison Square Garden (March 8, 7 p.m.). “I was like, I’m not going to write one single sad love song,” this Swedish pop singer told The New York Times of her latest album, “Honey.” “And then when I started writing, it was sad love song, sad love song, sad love song. But it’s in a different way.” Robyn has spent over two decades turning those sad love songs into nightclub gold, in iterations that have made her both a Billboard hit maker (“Show Me Love” and “Do You Know (What It Takes)” and a cult favorite (“Call Your Girlfriend” and “Dancing on My Own”). 212-465-6741, msg.com WEEZER AND PIXIES at Madison Square Garden (March 12, 7 p.m.). These joint headliners offer some of the most enduring indie rock of the 1980s and ’90s — and TV on the Radio, who are opening, will represent the 2000s. Weezer have continued to release albums at a fairly prolific clip and still own a significant chunk of the alt-rock canon, from “Say It Ain’t So” to “Hash Pipe.” Their most recent brushes with the mainstream, though, have been less expected — namely, a viral cover of Toto’s “Africa.” After playing three nights at the comparatively cozy Brooklyn Steel last November, Pixies are bringing their unorthodox noise pop back to one of the city’s biggest stages.212-465-6741, msg.com NATALIE WEINER EZRA COLLECTIVE at Rough Trade NYC (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). Afrobeat from the 1970s, woozy new R&B, dub reggae and classic backpacker hip-hop all help define the sound of this London-based band’s new disc, “You Can’t Steal My Joy,” due next month. They have become something of a sensation, and the album is likely to be one of the year’s most-talked-about releases from Britain’s thriving contemporary jazz scene. The group — which features the brothers T. J. and Femi Koleoso on bass and drums, respectively; Joe Armon-Jones on keyboards; Dylan Jones on trumpet; and James Mollison on saxophone — will play material from the coming disc at this Brooklyn rock club.roughtradenyc.com VIJAY IYER AND CRAIG TABORN at Roulette (March 12, 8 p.m.). Two leading jazz pianists in their late 40s, Iyer and Taborn each have their own specific formulas, but both are built on a mix of studious abstraction and propulsive weight. Next week they will release their first album as a duo, the expansive, richly improvised “The Transitory Poems,” on ECM Records. The crystalline scatter of Taborn’s playing meets Iyer’s slightly thicker articulation in a sympathetic repartee; the pair seem to constantly divert their own path. They celebrate the album’s arrival at this concert, playing on two grand pianos.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘IDENTITY: FREEDOM’ at the Kitchen (March 7-9, 8 p.m.). The nonprofit organization Arts for Art organized this series of concerts to highlight some of free jazz’s most respected elders, all of whom are presenting suite-length original works here. The festival begins on Thursday with “Trail of Tears Continuum (1492-2019),” a 90-minute piece composed by the bassist William Parker (a founder of Arts for Art) featuring singers, poets and a five-piece instrumental group, as well as a film component. On Friday, the pianist Dave Burrell debuts “Harlem Renaissance,” a response to the life and work of the dancer Josephine Baker; Burrell’s sextet will play in conversation with two dancers, Marguerite Hemmings and J’royce Jata. The series concludes on Saturday with a presentation of Andrew Cyrille’s “Haitian Fascination” project, in which this storied drummer fuses the music of Haiti — his ancestral home — with avant-garde jazz.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org MIYA MASAOKA at the Park Avenue Armory (March 13, 7 and 9 p.m.). Masaoka’s style on the koto, a long, stringed instrument from Japan, bespeaks deep equanimity: She is comfortable allowing vast amounts of open space — playing quietly, just a few notes at a time — but within that serene composure she strategically builds a feeling of tensile anticipation. You can lie down and stretch out inside her music, but you can’t ever get completely comfortable. An eclectic collaborator across the worlds of traditional and avant-garde music, at the armory she debuts “The Long Arc of Time,” a work inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhist chants and by the poetry of Tracie Morris. The performance will feature Masaoka alongside fellow Japanese and American musicians and the soprano Kamala Sankaram.212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org OMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Merkin Hall (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). Sosa, a Cuban pianist of great percussive power and fluid grace, released a collaborative album in 2017 with Keita, a Senegalese master of the kora (a West African stringed instrument typically used to create spiraling layers of rhythm), and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. Here the trio will perform some of the pristine, soothing music from that release. All three of these musicians now live in Europe, so a New York sighting is rare — especially featuring all of them together.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org KAMAAL WILLIAMS at Le Poisson Rouge (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). This young keyboardist crafts tightly woven grooves that are equally influenced by the cosmic soul-jazz of the 1970s as they are by the broken-beat and nu-jazz traditions of his native London. Partly thanks to his work in the short-lived but widely acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, Williams finds himself at the front of a crowded pack of young keyboardists on the busy British scene. Here he’s likely to draw heavily on the material from his debut solo album, last year’s Herbie Hancock-indebted “The Return.”212-505-3474, lpr.com MIGUEL ZENÓN at the Village Vanguard (March 12-17, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). One of the most casually prodigious alto saxophonists of today, Zenón devotes most of his creative energy to exploring the music of his native Puerto Rico, always through a vigorously intellectual lens. Last year he released a striking album, “Yo Soy La Tradición,” featuring music sourced largely from Puerto Rican folk traditions, retrofitted for saxophone and string quartet. And later this month, he will join up again with his longstanding jazz quartet to record a new album devoted to the music of Ismael Rivera, a heroic popular vocalist in Puerto Rico during the late 1960s and the ’70s. At this Vanguard run, the group — featuring Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums — will set about breaking in this new material.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO LOU REED DRONES at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (March 13, 6:30 p.m.). Physics and music nerds, unite and rejoice! The moment you have been collectively awaiting has arrived: A handful of Lou Reed’s guitars, curated by his technician Stewart Hurwood, will be arranged against a stack of amplifiers and tuned to create a glorious noise that will morph as you wander about in this acoustically splendid cathedral. Holy feedback! It should be glorious.stjohndivine.org/calendarDANIELLE DOWLING",The New York Times
2019,15 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE’ at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). This rapturous exhibition upends Modernism’s holiest genesis tale — that the male trinity of Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian invented abstract painting starting in 1913. It demonstrates that a female Swedish artist got there first (1906-7), in great style and a radically bold scale with paintings that feel startlingly contemporary. The mother of all revisionist shows regarding Modernism. (Roberta Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org ‘JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT’ at the Brant Foundation (through May 15). The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early 1980s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list by sending a request to ticketsnyc@brantfoundation.org. (Martha Schwendener)212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD’ at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer exhibition highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Holland Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art. The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘R.H. QUAYTMAN: +X, CHAPTER 34’ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). At the summit the Guggenheim’s spiraling rotunda, this show appears as if the exhibition of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, on the floors below, had suddenly exploded into 28 fragments. Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint’s oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls “chapters.” Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through séances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem. (Schwendener) 212-423-3575, guggenheim.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Mr. Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen. (Schwendener) 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org ‘VOICE OF MY CITY: JEROME ROBBINS AND NEW YORK’ at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (through March 30). The choreographer of “West Side Story” and “Fiddler on the Roof” was born a little over 100 years ago, but this exhibition is so much more than a centenary obligation; it’s an openhearted, deeply moving showcase of Robbins’s work, notes and diaries, full of the joy and anxiety of postwar Manhattan. Robbins, born Jerry Rabinowitz, made creditable paintings and drawings as a teenager, and in his 20s he hit it big with “Fancy Free,” set to a syncopated score by Leonard Bernstein, and evoked here through original footage and Robbins’s sketches of jumping and prancing seamen. He bullied dancers, and infuriated friends when he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, but his engrossing journals, rich with watercolors and watery notes to self, reveal the intense self-doubt that his choreography obscured. What Robbins loved most was New York, the city that was his muse and his helpmeet — and that has been transformed beyond recognition from the days of Jets and Sharks. (Farago) 917-275-6975, nypl.org ‘ANDY WARHOL — FROM A TO B AND BACK AGAIN’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through March 31). Although this is the artist’s first full American retrospective in 31 years, he’s been so much with us — in museums, galleries, auctions — as to make him, like wallpaper, like the atmosphere, only half-noticed. The Whitney show restores him to a full, commanding view, but does so in a carefully shaped and edited way, with an emphasis on very early and late work. Despite the show’s monumentalizing size, it’s a human-scale Warhol we see. Largely absent is the artist-entrepreneur who is taken as a prophet of our market-addled present. What we have instead is Warhol for whom art, whatever else it was, was an expression of personal hopes and fears. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org",The New York Times
2019,"15 Claims From Trump’s Speech to CPAC, Fact-Checked","Fact Check President Trump addressed the annual gathering of conservatives for over two hours on Saturday. Here’s a fact-check. What Was Said “When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming to our country. When they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent then 40 percent, and they said to me, ‘We expected somebody would call and say, you can’t nobody called so we just left it.’” President Trump’s account of China’s tariff rates and his role in relation to them is distorted. The United States charges a tariff of 2.5 percent — not “nothing” — on foreign car imports and raised the rate on Chinese vehicles to 27.5 percent over the summer. China previously imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign car imports but lowered that rate to 15 percent in July. As trade tensions between Beijing and Washington escalated, China then increased the tariffs on American cars to 40 percent to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s new tariffs before agreeing in December to temporarily suspend them. What Was Said “The Green New Deal, I encourage it, I think it is really something that they should promote. They should work hard on, it is something the country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it, but I will take the other side of that argument, only because I am mandated to. But they should stay with that. Never change. No planes. No energy. When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric.” Mr. Trump has escalated a previously exaggerated claim to a false one. The Green New Deal is a proposal by liberal Democrats to combat climate change. It was introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. The legislation does not call for eliminating airplanes, though a draft summary of the plan on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s website did refer to getting rid of “emissions from cows or air travel.” Her staff has since retracted the post and said that it was incomplete and published by accident. It is wrong to claim that enforcement of the Green New Deal would lead to “no energy” or no electricity. The legislation calls for the expansion of renewable energy sources, which accounted for about 17.1 percent of electricity generated in the United States in 2018. What Was Said “Then in 1913, they ended tariffs.” The Revenue Act of 1913, or the Underwood Tariff Act, reduced tariff rates to 25 percent from roughly 40 percent but did not eliminate them completely. Tariffs still accounted for nearly one-third of federal revenue in 1915. Rates were then raised in 1922 and 1930, before liberalization became a consistent trend in American trade policy. Tariffs have generated less than 2 percent of annual federal revenue for the past 70 years. What Was Said “So we fired Comey. Schumer who called for his resignation many times. Podesta, I believe that day ... called for his resignation.” Many Democratic lawmakers had criticized James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server before he was fired by Mr. Trump. But the two men the president singled out had not called for Mr. Comey to step down. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said that he had lost confidence in Mr. Comey, but he did not say that Mr. Comey should be ousted. John D. Podesta, the former Clinton campaign manager, called Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation a “mistake” that broke with precedent but specifically declined to press for his resignation. What Was Said “We never have empty seats.” While Mr. Trump does draw large, passionate crowds at events and often fills overflow rooms, seats have been empty on occasion. For example, at a May 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Trump drew a crowd of roughly 9,500 people in an arena that could hold 11,431, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had privately expressed disappointment with empty chairs at an August 2018 rally in West Virginia. What Was Said “I flew to Iraq — first time I left the White House because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.” Mr. Trump visited troops in Iraq on Dec. 26, but that was far from his first outing in months. He traveled to the National Cathedral in Washington on Christmas Eve and went to Arlington National Cemetery on Dec. 15. Other trips took him to the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia on Dec. 8, a law enforcement event in Missouri on Dec. 7, the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina from Nov. 29 to Dec. 1, and campaign rallies in Mississippi on Nov. 26. He also celebrated Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Other claims Mr. Trump also made at least 9 other inaccurate claims that The Times has previously fact-checked: He understated the number of Electoral College votes Mrs. Clinton won as 223. (It was 232.) He exaggerated the United States’ annual trade deficit with China as $500 billion. (It was $336 billion in 2017.) He exaggerated the United States’ annual trade deficit with the rest of the world as $800 billion. (It was $553 billion in 2017.) He misleadingly claimed that the news media would have deemed the level of job creation and reduction in food stamp participation “impossible.” (The numbers are on par with figures reached before he took office.) He falsely claimed military spending had reached levels “nobody’s ever heard of.” (Congress authorized more money for the military several years under President Barack Obama.) He falsely claimed just 3 percent of detained unauthorized immigrants “come back for a trial.” (About 72 percent showed up in the 2017 fiscal year.) He misleadingly claimed Democrats voted to “execute” babies after birth. (Infants are rarely born alive after abortion procedures, and if they are, doctors do not kill them.) He misleadingly claimed “we just got” Veterans Choice. (The health care program has existed since 2014, though Mr. Trump did enact changes.) He falsely claimed “you couldn’t fire anybody in the V.A.” before he took office. (He signed a law that would make it easier to remove bad employees, but the department had been able to fire people before.) Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

Santino Fontana and a bold red wig star alongside Lilli Cooper, Sarah Stiles and John Behlmann. Scott Ellis directs. tootsiemusical.com ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ at the Helen Hayes Theater (in previews; opens on March 31).

This Tony-winning tale about an Arab police band stranded in small-town Israel plays its final gigs. According to Ben Brantley, the show is one of the “most ravishing musicals you will ever be seduced by.” David Cromer’s production, with a book by Itamar Moses and songs by David Yazbek, currently stars Sasson Gabay and Katrina Lenk. 212-239-6200, thebandsvisitmusical.com ‘GLORIA’ at the Daryl Roth Theater (closes on March 31). Audiences have two more weeks to acknowledge the equality and full humanity of women as this biographical play centered on Gloria Steinem draws to a close Off Broadway. Directed by Diane Paulus and now starring Patricia Kalember, the show concludes with a talking circle, which on the night Jesse Green saw it, “took the raw materials of the play and turned them into thrilling community drama.” gloriatheplay.com ‘IF PRETTY HURTS UGLY MUST BE A ________’ at Playwrights Horizons (closes on April 5). Tori Sampson’s fable about beauty and race, directed by Leah C. Gardiner and set in the imagined village of Affreakah-Amirrorkah, prepares for its happily ever after. Jesse Green wrote that this “auspicious professional playwriting debut” succeeds best when “it engages us emotionally in the moral quandary of beauty.” 212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ at the Claire Tow Theater (closes on April 7). Jackie Sibblies Drury’s play, inspired by a famous black Briton and starring Quincy Tyler Bernstine, ends its Off Broadway run.

Ben Brantley called it a “breathless and radiant” drama. 212-239-6200, lct.org ‘SEA WALL/A LIFE’ at the Public Theater (closes on March 31). The men in sweaters in these twinned one-acts will soon stop wrestling with existence. Tom Sturridge stars in Simon Stephen’s play, while Jake Gyllenhaal delivers Nick Payne’s monologue.

2019,16 Civilians Are Killed in Attack on Construction Company in Afghanistan,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — At least 16 civilians were killed Wednesday in a complex attack on a construction company in eastern Afghanistan, officials said. The attack started with an early morning suicide explosion at the entrance of a construction company in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province. After the blast, four armed attackers wearing suicide vests entered the compound and shot employees of the company, prompting a firefight with Afghan security forces that lasted more than five hours, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The office of the company, Entire Builders and Engineers, is close to the provincial airport, where American and Afghan forces are stationed. “All those killed were employees of E.B.E., nine civilians were also wounded in the attack, two of them in critical condition” Mr. Khogyani said. “All five attackers were killed, a vehicle laden with explosives, two suicide vests, rockets and mines were discovered in the scene of attack by security forces.” The Taliban said they were not behind the attack, which came as Americans and the insurgent group continued another round of marathon talks in Doha, Qatar. Nangarhar is the where the Islamic State’s local branch in Afghanistan has established a small foothold. While Afghan and American forces have largely contained the group to few districts, their insurgents have remained resilient. But in a sign that the Taliban were willing to step up the pressure even as they held peace talks, the group launched a daring attack on a fortified Afghan army base in Helmand on Friday that left at least 40 dead. United States Marines also have a presence in a corner of the base, from where they have been advising the Afghan Army. Elsewhere in the country’s north, violence has continued over the last several days. In Faryab Province, 15 members of the Afghan security forces were killed on Friday in the Taliban attacks on their outposts, according to local officials. That same day in Sar-i-Pul Province, 10 other members of the security forces were killed when the Taliban ambushed a military convoy, officials said. In Kunduz Province, 15 soldiers and four police officers were killed on Monday when the Taliban attacked a military base and a local police outpost, said Wali Muhammad Nasiri, a police commander in the district.",The New York Times

Lanford Wilson’s incendiary 1987 drama returns to Broadway with a pair of highly flammable stars: Adam Driver and Keri Russell.

In Lucas Hnath’s alternate-world political comedy, written in 2016 before the election, the pantsuited political candidate navigates the 2008 primaries. Under Joe Mantello’s direction, Laurie Metcalf, who won a Tony for her appearance in Hnath’s “A Doll’s House, Part 2,” stars alongside John Lithgow.hillaryandclintonbroadway.com ‘I MARRIED AN ANGEL’ at New York City Center (performances start on March 20). Encores! ministers this Rodgers and Hart show, in which a cranky Hungarian banker announces that a woman would have to be absolutely angelic to entice him into marriage. Then she appears. Sara Mearns, a New York City Ballet principal dancer, plays the angel; her husband, Joshua Bergasse, choreographs some new seraphic dances. 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org ‘JULIUS CAESAR’ at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (previews start on March 17; opens on March 28). Just after the Ides of March, Shakespeare’s tragedy arrives Off Broadway at Theater for a New Audience. The director Shana Cooper approaches the play, which she first staged at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2017, as a resonant political thriller. Rocco Sisto is Caesar, and Brandon J. Dirden is Brutus. 866-811-4111, tfana.org ‘JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK’ at the Irish Repertory Theater (in previews; opens on March 19). Following a nimble production of “The Shadow of a Gunman,” the Irish Repertory Theater returns to the Dublin slums with this tragicomedy, the second in a season devoted to Sean O’Casey. Maryann Plunkett stars as Juno, a wife and mother, struggling to hold her fracturing family close. Neil Pepe directs. 212-727-2737, irishrep.org ‘NANTUCKET SLEIGH RIDE’ at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (in previews; opens on March 18). Though the title of John Guare’s latest play may sound like an especially racy entry in Urban Dictionary, it derives from a whaling crisis. This new drama centers on Mundie (John Larroquette), a stockbroker who wields few harpoons. He runs into trouble — and a giant lobster — on an outing to Nantucket.212-239-6200, lct.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘OKLAHOMA’ at Circle in the Square (previews start on March 19; opens on April 7). The wind is whistling more sultrily as the director Daniel Fish’s seductive deconstruction arrives on Broadway by way of St. Ann’s Warehouse. Starring Damon Daunno and Rebecca Naomi Jones, this production recalibrates the score for a bluegrass band and is mostly, Jesse Green wrote, “audacious in ways that feel dead-on and delightful.”212-239-6200, oklahomabroadway.com ‘THE WHITE DEVIL’ at the Lucille Lortel Theater (previews start on March 19; opens on March 31). A Jacobean tragedy at its goriest and most amoral, this 1612 John Webster play is revived by Red Bull Theater.

A new Suzan-Lori Parks play is never just background noise. In this new four-character drama, fault lines open up in the relationships among college friends. Then the tremors really get going. Oskar Eustis directs the actors Daveed Diggs, Sheria Irving, Thomas Sadoski and Zoë Winters.212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘BOESMAN AND LENA’ at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on March 24). Athol Fugard’s apartheid-era drama, staged by the South African director Yaël Farber, treks toward its final performance. Jesse Green argues that the play, about a common-law couple in search of shelter, has metamorphosed into an existential drama, reshaped perhaps by Zainab Jah and Sahr Ngaujah’s “admirable, uncompromising performances.”212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org ‘HURRICANE DIANE’ at New York Theater Workshop (closes on March 24). Madeleine George’s untamed skewering of Euripides’s “The Bacchae,” reset in a suburban cul-de-sac, finishes its run. This tragicomedy about climate change and landscape architecture, directed by Leigh Silverman, stars the inimitable Becca Blackwell as a butch gardener. Jesse Green wrote that Dionysus’s nonbinary energy, as delivered by the nonbinary Blackwell, “unleashes something wild in the play.”212-460-5475, nytw.org ‘SUICIDE FOREST’ at the Bushwick Starr (closes on March 23). Kristine Haruna Lee’s absurdist drama wraps up at the Bushwick Starr. Directed by Aya Ogawa, it intertwines the lives of a suicidal salaryman and an abused schoolgirl with Lee’s own family history. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that, for Lee, “this play is an exorcism. But it is also an embrace.” thebushwickstarr.org ‘TRUE WEST’ at the American Airlines Theater (closes on March 17). Sam Shepard’s tale of brotherly animus and noxious masculinity, produced by Roundabout Theater Company, stages its last showdown. James Macdonald’s revival, starring Ethan Hawke as a drifter, Paul Dano as a screenwriter and several houseplants as their innocent victims, moved Ben Brantley to write, “everyday sibling rivalry has seldom felt this ominous.”212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org",The New York Times
2019,19 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. AFFORDABLE ART FAIR at the Metropolitan Pavilion (through March 31). Buying art can sometimes feel intimidating, but for 20 years the Affordable Art Fair has been doing its part to make art ownership more accessible. Contemporary paintings, photographs, prints and sculptures are on offer from more than 60 galleries and are priced as low as $100. The fair’s democratic bent extends even to age: On Sunday, it will host a conversation between Monica Hernández, 23, whose work is featured in this year’s Young Talent Exhibition, and Drew Beattie, a painter and lecturer at Hunter College, about Hernández’s life as an up-and-coming painter in New York. (Peter Libbey)affordableartfair.com ‘HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE’ at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). This rapturous exhibition upends Modernism’s holiest genesis tale — that the male trinity of Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian invented abstract painting starting in 1913. It demonstrates that a female Swedish artist got there first (1906-7), in great style and a radically bold scale with paintings that feel startlingly contemporary. The mother of all revisionist shows regarding Modernism. (Roberta Smith) 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. The show, which includes a wonderful large-scale sculpture, “Bridge Over Tree,” at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29), is well-timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Holland Cotter)212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT’ at the Brant Foundation (through May 15). The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early 1980s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list by sending a request to ticketsnyc@brantfoundation.org. (Martha Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD’ at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer exhibition highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘THE LONG RUN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 5). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). This exhibition is a buffed jewel. In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too.

Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). At the summit the Guggenheim’s spiraling rotunda, this show appears as if the exhibition of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, on the floors below, had suddenly exploded into 28 fragments. Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint’s oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls “chapters.” Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through séances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem. (Schwendener) 212-423-3575, guggenheim.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present.

After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers.

The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen.

It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends.

The choreographer of “West Side Story” and “Fiddler on the Roof” was born a little over 100 years ago, but this exhibition is so much more than a centenary obligation; it’s an openhearted, deeply moving showcase of Robbins’s work, notes and diaries, full of the joy and anxiety of postwar Manhattan. Robbins, born Jerry Rabinowitz, made creditable paintings and drawings as a teenager, and in his 20s he hit it big with “Fancy Free,” set to a syncopated score by Leonard Bernstein, and evoked here through original footage and Robbins’s sketches of jumping and prancing seamen. He bullied dancers, and infuriated friends when he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, but his engrossing journals, rich with watercolors and watery notes to self, reveal the intense self-doubt that his choreography obscured. What Robbins loved most was New York, the city that was his muse and his helpmeet — and that has been transformed beyond recognition from the days of Jets and Sharks.

Although this is the artist’s first full American retrospective in 31 years, he’s been so much with us — in museums, galleries, auctions — as to make him, like wallpaper, like the atmosphere, only half-noticed. The Whitney show restores him to a full, commanding view, but does so in a carefully shaped and edited way, with an emphasis on very early and late work. Despite the show’s monumentalizing size, it’s a human-scale Warhol we see. Largely absent is the artist-entrepreneur who is taken as a prophet of our market-addled present. What we have instead is Warhol for whom art, whatever else it was, was an expression of personal hopes and fears. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org",The New York Times
2019,1919: France Finds Thousands of Telegrams Not Sent During WWI,"International Herald Tribune It is no secret that the French telegraphic service treated the public with scant courtesy during the war, delivering despatches when and to whom it pleased, but the extent of its abuses as elicited by the committee appointed by the Chamber of Deputies to investigate into State contracts during the war will nevertheless astonish everybody. This investigation — the results of which are published in the “Temps” — shows that the Telegraphic Control Section, of which M. Tannery was the head and Captain Ladoux and M. Pierre Lenoir were active members, was responsible for scandalous abuses. For instance, in the course of the investigation M. Tannery recognized that on an average at the Paris Telegraph Bureau 40,000 despatches were held back daily. The majority of them were never delivered and the others were distributed after great delay. The despatches which were retained were in the main thrown into a basket and when the accumulation had become too great they were destroyed. The Control Section never made any inquiry and neither the senders or those to whom the despatches were addressed were ever informed. It must be admitted that these telegraph authorities were no respecters of persons. Telegrams sent by or to foreign sovereigns, princes, and diplomatists were treated like the despatches of Tom, Dick or Harry. In fact, the close attention and all the patience of the Delegation of Foreign Affairs was needed to prevent the systematic holding up of these State telegrams. The Foreign Affairs Department, in support of a protest, stated that the Telegraphic Control Section, unknown to it, stopped all telegrams for Spain, notably those of Ambassadors in Rome and London. Telegrams also from agents of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs were stopped, particularly those from M. Bapst, Minister at Copenhagen. And the Control Section was just as ruthless in regard to the country’s financial interests, for, on the occasion of the last national loan, it stopped or suppressed a considerable number of Stock Exchange orders and stopped despatches of funds destined for the loan. And this is not the limit. The claims of the National Defence received no consideration. The report states that orders of Le Creusot and Firminy were stopped as well as those of other factories working for the war. One of the latter was obliged to close down owing to its inability to forward its demands in the needful time. The report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concludes as follows: “Under its present head, the section of Telegraphic Control is an organ of confusion and disorder, which has engendered extraordinary abuses and risked compromising the Government seriously and hampering its general policy.” As a consequence of these revelations, M. Tannery has been relieved of his functions at the Telegraphic Control. But retaining his post at the Cour des Comptes, he was appointed to the exchange commission by the Minister of Finance and then sent to represent the latter in Alsace and Lorraine. The Premier has removed him from the last position. Captain Ladoux and M. Pierre Lenoir are bring prosecuted on the charge of dealing with the enemy in connection with the purchase of a Paris newspaper, with which Senator Humbert is also the subject of prosecution. This pretty scandal comes as a sorry satisfaction to the newspapers, whose despatches were so often held up, lost, or delivered to their rivals, without the slightest excuse or apology. — The New York Herald, European Edition, March 22, 1919",The New York Times
2019,1962: The Bumbling Beginning,"the first season The Mets won just 40 games and lost 120, the most defeats in a single season in the modern history of baseball. Manager Casey Stengel theatrically pointing the way at the start of spring training in 1962. It’s doubtful Stengel anticipated just how bad his team would turn out to be.CreditCreditAssociated Press The original Mets were created from the ashes of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, both of whom had deserted New York City after the 1957 season. Now, five years later, National League baseball was back, so to speak. For it was quickly apparent that the Mets’ roster, put together mostly from players left unprotected by the other National League teams, was a mess. Left to do the best he could with it was baseball’s most colorful manager, Casey Stengel, who had won seven World Series with the Yankees but had been dismissed after the 1960 season, at the age of 70, because the Yankees felt he was too old. Now, he was even older, but on the Mets that hardly mattered because they had plenty of players past their prime. Stengel, with his amusing, and endless, observations became the perfect narrator for a season of amazingly bad baseball. It began with nine straight losses and by its close, the Mets had won just 40 games and lost 120, the most defeats in a single season in the modern history of baseball. Adding to the absurdity was that the Mets had two pitchers named Bob Miller — Righty Bob Miller and Lefty Bob Miller. And a first baseman known as Marvelous Marv Throneberry, with the Marvelous meant as a joke, not a compliment. On it went right up to the last day of the season, when the Mets managed to hit into a triple play. By then, as Robert Lipsyte of The New York Times put it, they had become an international symbol of incompetence. Following are excerpts from Times articles during the 1962 season: ST. LOUIS, April 11 History was made tonight by the New York Mets. They broke into the expanded National League at long last, but wound up on the short end of an 11-4 score, beaten conclusively by the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. In their first official effort, the Mets unfortunately did much to beat themselves. Despite the 16 hits the Cardinals collected, four ineffective New York pitchers, backed by a loose defense, hurt the Mets immeasurably. The season opener here before 16,147 half-frozen fans saw the Mets commit three errors and permit three stolen bases. Adding to Manager Casey Stengel’s miseries, Roger Craig, the starter and losing pitcher, committed a balk that led to one of two St. Louis runs in the first inning. In addition, the Mets bounced into two double plays. LOUIS EFFRAT POLO GROUNDS, April 13 Civic pride erupted in one lusty ovation after another at the Polo Grounds today as 12,447 baseball fans hailed the return of the prodigal National League. In the eye of the hurricane of hurrahs were the New York Mets — a team conceived in frustration and dedicated to the proposition that this teeming metropolis is a two-league town as well as a summer festival. Murky skies, autumn temperatures and a relentless drizzle kept the welcoming committee from reaching major league proportions. However, what the crowd lacked in numbers it offset with enthusiasm, generously pouring out affection that had found no satisfactory outlet since the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers absconded to the West Coast at the close of the 1957 season. Of those present on this historic Friday the 13th, only the Pittsburgh Pirates extended anything except felicitations and best wishes to Casey Stengel’s Mets. And despite profound cogitation and adroit personnel shuffling by the former Yankee manager, the Pirates won, 4-3. ROBERT TEAGUE CHICAGO, June 8 After 17 consecutive defeats, the New York Mets today emerged from the darkness by beating the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, in the first game of a doubleheader at Wrigley Field. To Mets fans, the fact that the Cubs retaliated with a 3-2 victory in the second game, which was called after eight innings because of darkness, doesn’t matter. Neither does the fact that the Mets’ triumph came on an unearned run in the ninth inning. After 17 losses, a victory is a victory. Jay Hook, who needed last-inning relief by Craig Anderson, was the winning pitcher in the opener. He is the same right-hander who snapped the nine-game losing string with which the Mets opened the season. Not since May 20, when they twice upended the Milwaukee Braves, had the Mets known victory. It was the longest losing streak ever for a New York team in the major leagues. LOUIS EFFRAT POLO GROUNDS, SEPT. 22 Even in the autumn of their pathetic despair, the New York Mets cannot escape history. Each step and misstep seem destined to remain forever in the dusty recesses of major league archives, or at least in corner crevices in the minds of those who care. Today, at the Polo Grounds, there were at least four such footnotes to baseball’s memorabilia. They obscured the Mets’ 116th defeat, a dreary 9-2 drubbing by the Chicago Cubs. The saddest of the four is what Met officials disregard as a “negative statistic.” Al Jackson, one of the two best pitchers on the club, was clobbered for five runs on seven hits during the two and a third innings he pitched. The slim left-hander was charged with his 20th loss of the season in 28 decisions. This is the first time since 1936 that a National League club has had two 20-game losers. Roger Craig, the other one, has a 9-23 won-lost record. The Philadelphia Phillies turned the trick 26 years ago when Bucky Walters lost 21 and Joe Bowman 20. ROBERT LIPSYTE MILWAUKEE, SEPT. 26 Shed another tear for the New York Mets, who bowed, 6-3, to the Braves tonight and wound up with exclusive rights to another record, asterisk, footnote and all. Casey Stengel’s men suffered their 118th defeat. This negative statistic made the Mets the losingest baseball team in modern history. The Philadelphia Athletics of 1916 lost 117 games. The game drew only 3,239 fans, the smallest night-game turnout since the Braves moved to Milwaukee. Play was delayed 42 minutes after the top of the first inning because of rain. With Henry Aaron’s three-run homer off Roger Craig supplying the crusher in the third, and the 23-year-old southpaw Denny Lemaster striking out 10 Mets, this was just another night in a long series of sorry nights for the first-year club. Craig, who departed for a pinch-hitter in the fourth, hung around long enough to absorb his 24th setback. LOUIS EFFRAT CHICAGO, SEPT. 30 It mattered not that the New York Mets won or lost, or even how they played the game today before 3,960 fans at Wrigley Field. For the record, though, the season’s final, for which Casey Stengel asked and obtained volunteers, went to the Cubs, 5-1. It was the Mets’ 120th defeat in this, their initial campaign, and it left them in the National League cellar, 60 games from the top. The season was concluded as it had started — with a setback — after the Mets had been victimized by an eighth-inning triple play. Had the season been fun? “I would have to say no to that one,” Stengel said. LOUIS EFFRAT Editors’ note: The 1962 Mets hold the record for most losses in a season in modern Major League Baseball history.

It was the San Francisco Giants, not the Los Angeles Dodgers.",The New York Times
2019,"1963-68: A Heap of Losses, a Hint of Hope","the lean years The Mets still struggled, but they never again reached the depths of 1962. After Stengel retired, Seaver and Koosman arrived. The Mets were back in the Polo Grounds in 1963 and so were their many fans. Who knows why everyone showed up, or why so many of them brought banners, but some of the fervor was just sheer irreverence, the antiestablishment joy of rooting for a team that was so awful. And for sure, the Mets were terrible again, although this time they managed to win 51 games instead of 40. The nuttiest moment came when Jimmy Piersall ran around the bases backward after hitting the 100th home run of his career. The most exhilarating occurred when tens of thousands of Mets fans invaded Yankee Stadium for a charity exhibition game against baseball’s defending champions, had their banners confiscated and then went berserk anyway when the Mets actually won. A year later, the Mets moved to Shea Stadium, their new home in Queens, and took their ineptitude with them. They went 59-103. They lost their home opener while creating a massive traffic jam. At the end of May, they lost a doubleheader at Shea that went on forever because of a 23-inning second game that lasted 7 hours 23 minutes, a record at the time. Three weeks later at Shea, the Mets were the victims of a perfect game thrown by Philadelphia’s Jim Bunning. In 1965, the Mets were even worse, winning just 50 games while also losing Casey Stengel, who retired after breaking his hip. Without Stengel, the Mets were less entertaining and still stunk. They did move up from last place to ninth in 1966 but then fell right back into 10th a year later. Still, that season the Mets had the rookie of the year in pitcher Tom Seaver. In 1968, the left-hander Jerry Koosman was just as impressive in his first season. The teammates of Seaver and Koosman now included other emerging players, like Jerry Grote and Bud Harrelson and Cleon Jones. And it showed in the Mets’ 1968 record — a 73-89 mark that still wasn’t very good but suggested that maybe something was changing. And something was. The journey from hopelessness to champions of the world without having to pass through mediocrity might have been the miracle, and the devil’s bargain. Mocking the Mets was considered cool in the early days of that ragtag expansion franchise because it concealed our painfully conflicted true feelings. At the same time that we were deeply ashamed at having been stuck with such a lousy team — how could baseball have scammed us like this? — we also embraced a lunatic joy at once more feeling major league. After all those years being the only three-team city in the show, we hadn’t found the Yankees enough for us. So we celebrated the Mets in an appropriately early-1960s way — ironic, self-aware, rambunctious. Rock-ish. The crowds with their made-for-TV bedsheet banners seemed charmingly self-deprecating (“We don’t want to set the world on fire, we just want to finish ninth”) but they also foreshadowed darker times to come (“Pray”). The price of allowing, then encouraging, grandstand populism would eventually be their strident demands. But those two Polo Grounds years were fun. Energized media members were thrilled with their new job and the West Coast trips to visit the Dodgers and Giants that came with them. Writers replated the former Yankee manager Casey Stengel as a madcap guru even as he spoke the truth after yet another loss (“The attendance was robbed, we’re still a fraud”), often with sarcasm (“Come out and see my amazin’ Mets”). A teenager who would never fulfill his hype, Ed Kranepool, was held up as the face of the future. Most notorious of all, an inept first baseman, Marv Throneberry, was extolled as the symbol of the bumbling present. Years later, he told me how miserable he had been as a Met. He had entered the big leagues as a Yankee, Mickey Mantle’s heir, no less, after a sensational minor league career. Being celebrated as Marvelous Marv, the Mets’ fool, broke his spirit. Perhaps the most telling signal that celebrating the “lovable losers” as comforting symbols of “everyman” — just like us! — would be short-lived was the creation of “neggies,” precursors of the Moneyball analytics of today. We needed those negative statistics to prove that the Mets were not merely profoundly second-rate but actually the worst of all time, so gloriously bad that we could claim them as champions, inverted champions to be sure, of games lost, chances bobbled, bases missed, hopes dashed. For the Mets, even mediocrity was a dream deferred. But the founding Mets writers and fans couldn’t paint over the mid-’60s slump in real American life. The glow of post-World War II triumphalism had given way to the Bay of Pigs, the murderous resistance to civil rights activism, mounting Cold War anxiety, the assassination of J.F.K. There was too much dread. Mets fans began to clamor for some wins on their scoreboard. There was a jolt of hope in 1964 when the Mets moved into their home for the next 44 years, Shea Stadium, paid for by the taxpaying fans, named for a wheeler-dealer lawyer. The ballpark was riddled with imperfections. The team was even worse, lurching through five more losing seasons. The Mets couldn’t even claw their way up to mediocrity. The so-called New Breed fans (named and championed by the swaggering, righteous Daily News columnist Dick Young) grew restive. Beyond the ballpark, the riots and assassinations were taking their toll on the public psyche, and the Mets, our safety valve, our comic relief, were becoming just another black hole of despair. And then came Tom Seaver — fresh, ebullient, hard-working, immensely talented. Nothing mediocre here. He was the Mets’ first homegrown superstar and many of us still think the only one. In 1967, he was National League rookie of the year, an All-Star, and a 16-game winner for a last-place club. The next year he again won 16 games, this time for a ninth-place club. But Tom Terrific set the world on fire, not only the top gun of a strong young pitching staff — Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan, Gary Gentry, Tug McGraw — but the anti-Marv. He was the New Breed’s dream of the New Met, a California college boy with a playful cackle who would lead us to the promised pennant in 1969. Was it a miracle? Don’t sports miracles happen suddenly, one hockey game, a shot heard ’round the world, a perfect punch? This miracle unspooled through seven years of suffering as preparation for 100 victories punctuated by Seaver’s 25. Beating the highly favored Orioles was almost anticlimactic: It was truly about the journey from hopelessness to champions of the world without having to pass through mediocrity. Maybe that was the miracle … and the devil’s bargain. In fact, a case could be made — here it comes — that the 1969 World Series is still the high point of Mets history, that nothing in the next 50 years came close. The Mets lost the 1973 Series to Oakland and won in 1986 under morally nullifying circumstances; not only did they win because of a Red Sox error, but a member of that team in his final major league season, at a still serviceable 41, was Seaver. He should have still been a Met. In 1977, a contract dispute with the cartoonishly imperious Mets chairman, M. Donald Grant, was viciously spun by Dick Young into a Desperate Players Wives plot; Nancy Seaver, he claimed, wanted Tom to make more than Nolan Ryan. A man of dignity, Seaver opted out and began an exile’s journey to the Reds, the White Sox, briefly back to the Mets, then the Red Sox and finally to his California winery. The Mets went on to lose the World Series in 2000 and 2015, each by four games to one. Failing against the Yankees in 2000 doomed the Mets to their current fate. Only winning the Subway Series would redeem a history of steady disappointment. Their owners have been lackluster; they have managed a record of 4,362 victories against 4,732 defeats, a .480 average, not to mention involvement with the Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. The closest the Mets ever came to a Seaverish star was the talented, handsome, good-hearted David Wright, unfortunately bedeviled by injuries. Even now, 50 years after what, yes, must have been a miracle, that glory is tinged with sadness. Seaver, a longtime victim of Lyme disease, recently announced his withdrawal from public life because of encroaching dementia. The creator of so many of our most amazin’ memories, is losing his. Pray. Following are excerpts from Times articles from 1964 to 1968. SHEA STADIUM, April 17, 1964 Shea Stadium, the newest major league baseball park, opened for business yesterday with appropriate festivities and colossal traffic jams. A crowd of 50,312, including 48,736 who paid, radiated enthusiasm under sunny skies as the New York Mets fought their way to a typical 4-3 defeat at the hands of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The lack of parking space at the stadium caused massive traffic snarls that started an hour and a half before game time. The congestion was not nearly so bad after the game despite the addition of normally heavy commuter traffic. Traffic Commissioner Henry A. Barnes was in a helicopter over the area trying to unscramble postgame jams. In every respect but traffic control and the outcome of the game, the occasion was declared a rousing success by most of those involved. “At first,” said Casey Stengel, who has been singing the praises of the new stadium all over the country for months, “I couldn’t find out where the writers were and where the broadcasters were, but then I found them and I was in trouble.” LEONARD KOPPETT SHEA STADIUM, MAY 31, 1964 Baseball’s transcontinental archrivals — the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants — battled through 10 hours and 23 minutes of a titanic doubleheader at Shea Stadium yesterday that included the longest game on a time basis ever played in the major leagues. Endurance records, attendance records and performance records fell through nine innings of the first game and 23 innings of the second before the largest crowd of the baseball season anywhere — 57,037. The huge throng saw the Giants win, 5-3 and 8-6. And the 8,000 to 10,000 still on hand when the action ended at 11:25 p.m. saw 41 players struggle for 7 hours and 23 minutes, a record, in the second game. The two teams also played the longest doubleheader in history: 9 hours 52 minutes on the field. They also played the most innings ever played by big-league teams in one day: 32. During and after the games, people lined up outside the stadium to use a telephone alongside the right-field stands. Because of a union jurisdictional dispute, there are no telephones at the stadium. Some potential callers who saw the one phone booth tied up rushed hundreds of yards to the elevated train station. After paying a token, they raced to the phone booths there. Those who wished to leave during the game to make telephone calls were permitted to return. There was some grumbling, however, as the day went on. Mel Ganz of Kew Gardens, Queens, said those manning the stadium entrances “won’t let me in to see my kid — he’s been inside since 10 a.m.” JOSEPH DURSO and GERALD ESKENAZI SHEA STADIUM, June 21, 1964 Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched the first perfect game in the National League in 84 years yesterday when he retired all 27 New York Met batters. The Phils won the contest, the first game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium by 6-0 before 32,904 fans, who were screaming for Bunning during the last two innings. The lanky right-hander became the eighth man in the 88-year history of major league baseball to pitch a perfect game. He is the first man to pitch one in the majors since Don Larsen of the New York Yankees did not permit a Brooklyn Dodger to reach base in the fifth game of the 1956 World Series. In the second game, which the Phillies won, 8-2, the Mets were held to three hits, by a rookie, Rick Wise, and John Klippstein. GORDON S. WHITE Jr. Oct. 5, 1966 As the World Series opens today on the other side of the continent, New Yorkers at least have the consolation of knowing that both their teams made baseball history in the season just past. The Yankees ended up in last place for the first time since 1912, and the Mets didn’t — for the first time ever. It is of mere academic interest that the Yanks actually won more games and finished closer to first place in the American League than the Mets did in the National. What counts is that in the National League, the Chicago Cubs were worse. The Columbia Broadcasting System acquired the Yankees in 1964 as they were winning their fifth straight pennant. The merger of corporate strengths brought fears of unfair competition that the mighty Yankees soon dispelled by sinking to sixth place last year and 10th place this. Now C.B.S. must rebuild a show with failing ratings. They can’t rerun the 1964 club. The Mets, too, will find the way up full of peril. They won intense loyalty from the fans for their first four years in the cellar. Now that they are just another thoroughly professional second-division club, the fans may demand even better performances: eighth place, then seventh — there is no limit to rising expectations. But for the moment, ninth place is the top of the world. NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL SHEA STADIUM April 20, 1967 Tom Seaver, a college student who cost the New York Mets $50,000, began to pay off on the investment yesterday by pitching his owners to a 6-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs. He received eloquent support from Tommy Davis, who hit his first home run as a Met. But in most ways, Seaver’s first major league victory turned into a triumph for the Mets’ Class of ’67 — especially since another rookie, Don Shaw, went to the rescue in the eighth inning and retired the last five Chicago batters. Moreover, in his second game in the major leagues, Seaver outpitched Curt Simmons, who was pitching in his 540th game and who started pitching 21 seasons ago, when Seaver was a 2-year-old tot in Fresno. JOSEPH DURSO LOS ANGELES April 11, 1968 The New York Mets, fresh from their opening-day travesty in San Francisco, made a remarkable comeback when Jerry Koosman defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, 4-0, on a complete-game four-hitter. The 24-year-old rookie left-hander from Minnesota had never seen Dodger Stadium before. He had never won a game in the major leagues, either, and had pitched only 22 innings for the Mets, all of them last season. Koosman gave up two walks and no hits until Tom Haller singled to right in the fifth. Then Wes Parker doubled to left in the sixth, but still the Dodgers were scoreless. The Mets, meanwhile, reached Singer for two runs in the sixth, when Singer suffered from the effects of a bad cold, a pair of troublesome contact lenses and a leadoff triple by Ken Boswell. A pair of walks to Ron Swoboda and Ed Kranepool loaded the bases, then Art Shamsky pulled a two-run single to right. JOSEPH DURSO",The New York Times

And the situation grew only worse. At the end of April, the Mets were 9-11. On May 27, they were 18-23, in fourth place in the National League East. Off in the distance were the first-place Chicago Cubs. But the next day, the Mets beat San Diego, 1-0, in a game in which Jerry Koosman struck out 15 batters. That began an 11-game winning streak that left the Mets — yeah, the Mets — with a record of 29-23. The revolution was on. In early July, the Mets had their first showdown with the Cubs, and Tom Seaver came within two outs of a perfect game. A week later, the Mets took two out of three at Wrigley Field. The Mets were now in second place, just four games out of first. At which point, the Mets flattened out. On July 30, Manager Gil Hodges even went out to left field to pull Cleon Jones from the game. Jones, he felt, was not hustling. Hodges was sending a message, but the Mets kept struggling. By mid-August, they were 10 games out. And then, with Woodstock being staged in the background, the Mets took off. They swept the Padres at Shea in two weekend doubleheaders and began a run in which they would win 38 of their last 49 games of the season, sometimes in stupefying fashion. There was, for instance, the delirious Aug. 30 game in San Francisco in which the Mets threw out runners at home in the eighth and ninth innings along with another runner at third and then won in the 10th on a home run. A week later, Manager Leo Durocher and his swooning Cubs arrived at Shea, and the Mets beat them twice, with fans sarcastically serenading Durocher and with a black cat running in front of the Chicago dugout. The next day, the Mets moved into first. Two days later, they won a 1-0, 1-0 doubleheader in Pittsburgh. The starting pitchers drove in both runs. Three days later, the Mets struck out a record 19 times against Steve Carlton in St. Louis. But so what? They won, anyway, with Ron Swoboda hitting two two-run homers. The Mets were now pulling away with 15 games to go. The impossible had become the inevitable. Following are excerpts from New York Times articles in 1969. SHEA STADIUM, JUNE 3 Scaling new heights again, the New York Mets climbed past the break-even point and into second place in the National League East by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2, at Shea Stadium tonight. Two home runs by Ed Kranepool, a well-placed misplay by the Dodgers, Tom Seaver’s eighth pitching victory and Tug McGraw’s second save marked the historic occasion, which also stretched the current winning streak to six games. No Met team had ever been above .500 beyond the fourth game of a season. In 1966, and again this year, the Mets won two of their first three games; but in 1966, they lost the next five and this year they lost the next four. Never again did they have more victories than defeats until now, when their record stands at 24-23. LEONARD KOPPETT JULY 8 It has taken them 7½ years, 439 victories and 771 defeats, but today the Mets finally begin an important series. At 2:05 p.m. at Shea Stadium, they start a three-game series with the Chicago Cubs, the only team ahead of them in the National League’s Eastern Division. The bumbling players who opened at the Polo Grounds in 1962 and their masochistic fans would be dizzied by the Mets’ five-game proximity to first place. And the New Yorkers have lost only three more games than the Cubs, the most important measurement between two winning clubs. Whether sold out or close to it, Shea should be rocking every minute of the series. The Cubs have lost three straight, the Mets have won five straight and Gil Hodges of the Mets and Leo Durocher of the Cubs have set up their best pitchers for the series. GEORGE VECSEY SHEA STADIUM, July 9 Tom Seaver of the Mets thrilled the biggest baseball crowd in Shea Stadium history tonight by coming within two outs of pitching a perfect game. Jim Qualls, a rookie outfielder of the Chicago Cubs, drilled a solid single in the ninth that disappointed Seaver and the 59,083 fans who were quivering with every pitch. Seaver finished with a one-hitter and a 4-0 victory that narrowed the Cubs’ division lead over the Mets to three games. The Mets have won seven straight and the Cubs have lost five straight. And after the near-perfect game, who knows where these opposite kinds of momentum might lead? The Mets were loose and confident going into the game because their best pitcher was going to work. The 24-year-old, right-handed Seaver, a fine athlete, had won 13 games and lost 3. But two hours later, the Mets and their fans wanted much more than victory No. 14. They wanted perfection and the first no-hitter by a Met, and they cheered madly for every Cub out. The first batter in the ninth was Randy Hundley, the experienced catcher. He tried to bunt a high pitch, but the ball rolled to Seaver’s right and Seaver threw Hundley out at first. The fans, ever sensitive, booed Hundley for having tried to bunt Seaver out of a perfect game. The 22-year-old Qualls, a switch-hitter batting left-handed in his 18th major league game, was the next batter. Seaver wanted to keep the ball outside to him, but the pitch strayed a little too close to the plate and Qualls stroked it solidly to left-center, nowhere near Cleon Jones or Tommie Agee. GEORGE VECSEY July 16 The moon didn’t figure in the conversation — mostly in Spanish — at the Full Moon Bar and Grill at 161st and Broadway. The bar was recently renamed La Luna Llena. It’s owner, Richard Hauseman, was asked why the customers weren’t following the moon shot on television. “What’s there?” he retorted. “Walter Cronkite talking — that’s all.” The television sets were on at most other bars, but not for Walter Cronkite or the astronauts. In Chicago, the Mets were ahead of the Cubs, suggesting a miracle that even Jules Verne did not foresee. A bartender was asked whether his customers were more interested in the Mets or the astronauts. “The Mets, of course,” he said. “Aren’t you?” JOSEPH LELYVELD Aug. 4 The Mets have seen the moment of their greatness flicker, pressing Chicago for the Eastern Division lead before falling back. The fans overreacted, talking World Series, and the national press and broadcasting, who used to come to Shea Stadium to interview the other teams of the National League, trumpeted the emergence of a great new power. Then the Mets lost seven of 11, their first bona fide slump. They also suffered some of the emotional problems of sudden glory. Last Wednesday afternoon, Hodges pointedly removed Cleon Jones, his best player, from the outfield in the midst of a game, apparently for playing a ball too casually. And then Ron Swoboda, the Mets’ best off-season banquet player, publicly chided the tra-la-la attitude of the club, the lack of intensity. ROBERT LIPSYTE SAN DIEGO, Aug. 27 Jerry Koosman pitched the New York Mets to within two games of first place tonight as he overpowered the San Diego Padres, 4-1, with a two-hitter for the Mets’ sixth straight victory. He allowed the two hits in the first inning but no more the rest of the game and he faced only 31 batters — four more than the minimum. The Mets continued past another milestone on their remarkable road several hours after the first-place Chicago Cubs had lost again to the Cincinnati Reds. And by the time the Mets had finished their work tonight, they were all even with Chicago in games lost, and the Cubs’ lead in the Eastern Division rested solely on the fact that they had played — and won — four more times. The victory was Koosman’s third in a row, and the Mets’ 12th in their last 13 decisions, while the Cubs were dropping eight of 10. It also was No. 74 for the Mets this season, one more than the record total they achieved all of last season, and it was their 11th in a row over San Diego. The situation at the top of the Eastern Division was growing so sticky that Ernie Banks even telephoned long-distance to San Diego tonight. JOSEPH DURSO SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 30 The New York Mets survived three hours of thrills — and sometimes terror — and defeated the San Francisco Giants, 3-2, on a 10th-inning home run by Donn Clendenon. The victory ended the Giants’ winning streak at nine games and kept the Mets 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs, who beat the Atlanta Braves, 5-4. Clendenon put the finishing touches to the Mets’ afternoon by hitting a 2-1 pitch from Gaylord Perry over the right-field fence with two outs. But he did it only after the Mets lived through two wild innings in the eighth and ninth, during which the Giants put five runners on base — and the Mets threw two of them out at home plate and one at third base. JOSEPH DURSO SHEA STADIUM, Sept. 9 The New York Mets — the urchins of baseball for the last seven years — shook down the thunder from the sky tonight when they overpowered the Chicago Cubs, 7-1, before 58,436 persons in Shea Stadium. It was the fourth straight victory for the Mets and the sixth straight defeat for the Cubs, and the urchins moved to within a half game of first place in the National League East with three weeks to go. The Mets, who have never finished higher than ninth, made the tumultuous scene last night on the five-hit pitching of their prodigy, Tom Seaver. The 25-year-old Californian allowed four singles, one double and one walk, and achieved his 21st victory in the gaudiest season of pitching in Mets history. He was never behind and rarely was in trouble. And the crowd — which included 51,448 paying customers — spent much of the game on its feet, waving handkerchiefs and serenading Manager Leo Durocher of Chicago with stanzas of “Goodbye, eo.” Leo might have felt like going, too. JOSEPH DURSO SHEA STADIUM, Sept. 10 Stop the season! The New York Mets reached and held first place tonight by sweeping a doubleheader from the Montreal Expos, 3-2 in 12 innings, and 7-1, and it is rank disregard for poetic justice to make them risk this precious attainment through the 21 games that still remain on the schedule. Nevertheless, the ultimate height has been scaled, after seven humiliating years only partially soothed by laughter, and never again can it be said that the Mets have never been on top. “We’re No. 1, we’re No. 1” chanted the 23,512 in Shea Stadium tonight, and that moment can never be taken away from them or from Met supporters everywhere. The moment, actually, was 10:13 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time. This eminence, not even dreamt of for this year when the season began, has been achieved by a four-week hot streak, coinciding with Chicago’s first slump. JOSEPH DURSO PITTSBURGH, Sept. 12 The galloping New York Mets continued their assault on the establishment of baseball tonight by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates twice by identical scores of 1-0 and running their winning streak to nine games. They also added half a game to their lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League’s Eastern Division. The Cubs ended an eight-game losing streak tonight when they beat the St. Louis Cardinals, and they now trail the Mets by 2½ games with less than three weeks to go. Three pitchers limited the Pirates to eight hits and no runs in the doubleheader. In the opener, Jerry Koosman pitched a three-hitter and, in the second game, Don Cardwell allowed four hits for eight innings and Tug McGraw gave up one in the ninth. In both games, the starting pitchers also batted themselves to victory — Koosman with a single off Bob Moose in the fifth inning, and Cardwell with a single off Dock Ellis in the second inning. As a result, the Mets added these features to their high-flying caps with only 18 games left: They won their 24th and 25th games of 31 played since Aug. 13, when they trailed the Chicago Cubs by 10 games; they won their 21st and 22nd shutouts of the season, and their third in a row, and they extended their recent string of shutout innings to 34. JOSEPH DURSO ST. LOUIS, Sept. 15 Steve Carlton of the St. Louis Cardinals set a major league record tonight by striking out 19 New York Mets. But the Mets still won the game, 4-3, on a pair of two-run home runs by Ron Swoboda and extended their lead to 4½ games with 15 to play. Carlton, a 24-year-old left-hander, struck out the side in four of the nine innings as he surpassed the record of 18 strikeouts set by Sandy Koufax, Bob Feller and Don Wilson. He even fanned Swoboda twice, on his first and third times at bat. But on his second and fourth trips to the plate, the Maryland muscleman drove home runs into the left-field seats, both times with a man on base, both times with the Mets trailing by one run. As a result, the Mets swung even higher on their high-flying trapeze with two and a half weeks to play. JOSEPH DURSO",The New York Times
2019,19th-Century ‘Humiliation’ Haunts China-U.S. Trade Talks,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump’s trade team presented Chinese officials with a list of bold economic demands in Beijing last May, one of China’s state-controlled news outlets, Global Times, panned the request and blared a curious headline: “Is it now 1840?” Five months later, China’s national news agency, Xinhua, accused Vice President Mike Pence of lacking knowledge of China’s past after he complained that Beijing was merely paying lip service to opening its economy. Behind the pushback is a long and painful history of China surrendering to Western powers, with origins in what the Chinese news media refers to as a “century of humiliation” that began with the “unequal treaties” of the 19th century after the first Opium War. History has been haunting trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies, which have dragged on for more than a year. While the administration’s requests surrounding forced technology transfer and subsidies of state-owned enterprises remain unresolved, the deepest division centers on the United States’ insistence of an enforcement mechanism that gives it power to impose tariffs if China abrogates its end of a trade agreement. That issue is expected to be front and center on Thursday, when Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, will again try to make headway toward a final deal during a two-day visit to Beijing. Next week, a delegation of government officials from China is scheduled to come to Washington for additional talks. As they work to agree on trade terms, Trump administration officials have outlined various situations for enforcing an agreement. Most recently, negotiators have called for a system in which representatives from both countries would meet to address problems that arise, escalating complaints to the top levels of government as necessary. The Chinese have agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director, vice minister and minister, which would allow the United States to keep tabs on China’s behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices. If China fails to keep its agreement, the United States would respond “proportionally but unilaterally,” Mr. Lighthizer said at a congressional hearing last month. Republican lawmakers, who have been closely tracking the negotiations, say they expect enforcement to be a determining factor in whether a deal is reached. “What we want is the ability to put on unilateral tariffs that can’t be counteracted by a tariff from China,” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday. While Mr. Grassley said he was not sure whether such a request was a reasonable one to make, he said it was the goal of the Trump administration. “We’ve got to have enforcement, one way or the other,” he said, adding that China had a history of breaking promises on trade. But China is resisting the Trump administration’s demand that the United States be allowed to impose tariffs if Beijing fails to keep its promises and that China agree not to retaliate with its own punitive measures. The Trump administration says such a mechanism is necessary to ensure that China lives up to its agreement and does not repeat what it says is a pattern of reneging on past promises. But such disarmament has proved to be unpalatable in China, in part, historians say, because of stinging memories of one-sided treaties from an earlier era. “Every schoolchild in China and every educated Chinese person knows about the ‘century of humiliation,’” said Stephen R. Platt, a historian and author of “Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age.” “There’s a lingering memory of that history from the 19th century that goes a long way to explain the desire in China for a global trading order that works more on China’s terms.” He added, “They have to look strong on trade.” In 1839, the big trade war that gripped the world was between Britain and China’s Qing dynasty. Britain was buying large quantities of Chinese silk and tea, but China was buying little in return, creating an uncomfortably large trade deficit. So Britain turned to smuggling Indian opium, a product that proved hard to resist, into China, and its resistance turned a trade war into a real one. The three-year war ended with the Treaty of Nanking, which gave Britain control of Hong Kong and opened several new trade ports in China. British merchants were allowed to come to China and trade freely with no restrictions. That was just the beginning. By the 1850s, the United States, Russia and France signed treaties with China with the same terms, allowing foreigners to sell goods with low tariffs and giving them privileged status in mainland China. Rather than show respect for the superiority of Chinese culture, China was forced to adhere to the traditions of Western diplomacy. The influx of foreign culture reoriented China’s economy, eventually leading to the dynasty’s downfall in 1912. Some historians, such as William C. Kirby, a professor of Chinese studies at Harvard Business School, argue that the unequal treaties did have benefits for China such as modernizing its institutions and its education system. However, that does not always mean that trade pacts are mutually beneficial. “One should always be cautious that what is good for you, you imagine is good for the other party automatically,” Mr. Kirby said. “It might be, it might not be.” Trump administration officials have tried to make the case that the changes it wants China to make will benefit everyone. “The kinds of things that we’re asking for are not anti-Chinese at all,” Mr. Lighthizer told NPR this week. “In fact, the reformers would say it’s pro-Chinese. It will help their economy, not hurt their economy.” Despite suggesting that their interests are aligned, it has been difficult for the United States to push China to make changes without coming across as bullying or insensitive. After talks stalled in February, Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said that Mr. Lighthizer read the “riot act” to Liu He, China’s vice premier and the country’s top trade negotiator. It has also been hard for the Trump administration to sell the agreement as being two-sided. Mr. Trump has accused China of essentially stealing from the United States for decades and his administration is demanding that China buy more American goods, stop subsidizing its own companies and treat foreign companies fairly. In return, the United States has so far offered to remove some, but not all, of the $250 billion worth of tariffs Mr. Trump imposed last year. “I consider that we’ve rebuilt China,” Mr. Trump said last week at an event in Ohio. “$500 billion a year taken out of our country,” he said, referring to the amount of Chinese goods imported into the United States. China remains skeptical that many of the concessions that Mr. Trump is asking for will really help uplift its economy. While old memories of humiliation might still be fresh in China’s collective mind, its status in the world has changed drastically in the last 150 years. Now the world’s second-largest economy, China has been exerting its own influence around the world. Development programs like China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure investment plan, have drawn criticism from the United States and in parts of Europe for being insufficiently transparent and putting more vulnerable economies in precarious positions. “Chinese policy has shifted from fear of being bullied into unequal treaties into becoming a bully itself and forcing unequal agreements on weaker nations,” said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration. But, Mr. Pillsbury points out, the Chinese do not see things that way when it comes to a trade deal with the United States. The Communist Party was founded nearly a century ago on a promise of putting a stop to humiliation at the hands of foreigners. “The Communist Party was created on a narrative of standing up to, and ending, unequal treaties,” he said.

2019,2 American Children May Be Trapped in the Last ISIS Village,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — As American-backed forces assault the final bastion of the Islamic State in Syria, two American children may be stuck inside, their father fears. “I am praying to my God that they will return to me,” said the father, Bashirul Shikder. “They are innocent. I am just hoping.” Four years ago, his wife fled their Florida home to join the Islamic State and took their two children with her. She was killed in an airstrike, but the children are believed to be in Baghuz, the last village held by the Islamic State in Syria. [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] As the yearslong battle to destroy the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate draws to an end, Western governments have struggled to deal with citizens who joined the terrorist organization. The family of Shamima Begum, who left for Syria as a teenager, has said the British government intends to revoke her citizenship, and President Trump has vowed not to let Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman, return to the United States. But Mr. Shikder’s ordeal raises the question of what happens to children who ended up in the Islamic State through no fault of their own. Mr. Shikder, 38, told his story in phone calls from Iraq and Florida, and two lawyers involved in his case corroborated his account. “Mr. Shikder is a religious Muslim, but he is also very much an American,” said Charles D. Swift, the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, who is helping Mr. Shikder. “He believes in America and in the ideals of America.” Born in Bangladesh, Mr. Shikder moved to Canada as a young man, before immigrating to the United States and becoming a citizen a decade ago. He married a Bangladeshi-born American woman, Rashida Sumaiya, and had two children, Yusuf, a boy, and Zahra, a girl. They lived near Miami, where he works in information technology, he said. He and his wife liked to play chess and badminton and hold barbecues in Miami Beach. But his life was upended in March 2015, when he left for a pilgrimage to Mecca. His wife was supposed to take the children to visit her parents in Orlando, he said. But when she stopped responding to his texts, he began to worry. After days of silence, he reached her parents, who said she and the children were gone, but refused to say more, he said. So he contacted the F.B.I. and returned to Florida, learning that his wife, their children, then 4 and 10 months old, and his wife’s sister, had flown to Turkey to cross into Syria to join the Islamic State. A few weeks later, he received a call from Syria while he was driving on the freeway, he said. A man with a British accent asked him whether he was the father of Yusuf and Zahra. Mr. Shikder said yes and asked where they were. “In the Islamic State,” he said the man told him. He gave Mr. Shikder one month to join them in Syria or said his wife and children would be taken away from him. About a week later, his wife called and told him how she, her sister, and their children had been smuggled into Syria and had their passports taken away, he said. That was the start of an intermittent and painful correspondence between him, his wife, her sister and other members of the Islamic State. Sometimes his wife sent him videos of his children playing and put them on the phone, he said. But he never knew whether they were in danger. “Many times I was very worried because I was seeing fighting, I was seeing airstrikes, I was seeing Assad’s soldiers,” he said, referring to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. “I was seeing people being killed.” Later, he received messages asking him to send money or telling him to join the family in Syria, appeals he was not sure were from his wife or from someone else using her phone, he said. He refused to send money, having been advised that it could violate the American law against providing material support to a terrorist group. In 2016, he received a document from an Islamic State court divorcing him from his wife. The document said his wife had asked for a divorce because Mr. Shikder lived in “the land of disbelief (America),” had refused to move to the Islamic State and had not sent money to his wife. He later learned that his wife had remarried and given birth to a daughter, and sometime later that her new husband had been killed, he said. He last spoke to Rashida in December, he said. He told her that her father had died in the United States, and she spoke of a nearby airstrike that had terrified the children. In January, his sister-in-law told him that his wife had been killed in an airstrike and that the three children had been burned in the blast. The sister-in-law got in touch one more time, on Feb. 4, and said the children’s wounds were healing, Mr. Shikder said. That was the last he heard from her. Last month, Mr. Shikder received word that his children had been found in a refugee camp in eastern Syria, so he flew to northern Iraq, intending to cross the border to retrieve them. But it turned out to be a false report, so he returned to Florida last week. Clive Stafford Smith, a British human rights lawyer who is helping Mr. Shikder, says he has confirmed, through contacts he has with people whose relatives are in the village, that the children are alive and in Baghuz, in the care of a British woman who is reluctant to surrender. Mr. Shikder is an observant Muslim who does not drink or smoke, prays regularly and wears a long black beard with a trim mustache. His own faith compounded his horror at the jihadists’ actions, he said. “I do everything that Islam tells you to do, but my Islam did not tell me to do what they did,” he said. He said he struggled to determine how much his wife had embraced their message. “Sometimes I was feeling that she was stuck,” he said. “Sometimes I was feeling that she was believing what she was doing.” Yusuf is now 8, Zahra is 4, and his wife’s other daughter, Safyah, is about 18 months old. His lawyers believe that she can claim American citizenship through her mother, and Mr. Shikder has offered to adopt her. But it remains unclear whether the children will make it out of Syria. Mr. Smith and Mr. Shikder have contacted American diplomats, law enforcement agents and members of the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that have surrounded Baghuz, hoping to secure safe passage for the children, Mr. Smith said. Heather Fabrikant, a spokeswoman for the United States Consulate in Erbil, Iraq, said the State Department was “aware of reports of an international parental child abduction case in which U.S. citizen children were taken to Syria in 2015” but that she could not discuss details because of privacy considerations. On Monday, Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, wrote on Twitter that they had slowed down the offensive on Baghuz “due to a small number of civilians held as human shields” by the Islamic State. “However, we assert that the battle to retake the last ISIS holdout is going to be over soon.” As he waits, Mr. Shikder prays, and tries to stay hopeful that his children will be saved. “Everything is making me worried,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"2 Days in Congress, 3 Trump Rejections","On Politics With Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] O.K., brace yourself. We might just be having a moment in politics this week. No, I’m not talking about Beto O’Rourke, the telegenic former Texas congressman whose newly launched presidential campaign prompted wall-to-wall media coverage today. I’m talking about what’s been happening in Congress. A quick catch-up: Today, a dozen Republicans in the Senate voted with Democrats to reject President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall. Their rebuke comes just hours after the House — in an overwhelming, bipartisan, 420-0 vote — backed a resolution urging the Justice Department to publicly release the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. And it comes a day after the Senate voted to end support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, an effort seen as a reproach of the president’s defense of the kingdom after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Practically, this all means very little. The House resolution cannot force the Justice Department to release more of the report. And Mr. Trump has made it clear that he will veto the other two measures — a step his opponents don’t have the numbers to override in the Senate. But politically, the trifecta of rejections tells us that Mr. Trump’s grip on congressional Republicans may be loosening. The political ground may be ever so slightly shifting — and with it, the control Mr. Trump has over his party. As we’ve written before, the president remains overwhelmingly popular with his base. There is no groundswell of anti-Trump sentiment in the Republican Party. Two of the most vulnerable Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado, stuck with the president. (Mr. Tillis flipped his position after talks with the White House and rumblings of a primary challenge.) Republican defectors stress that their opposition is not personal but institutional. Spending money and declaring war are foundational powers assigned in the Constitution to Congress. By ceding to the president the right to declare a national emergency, they’d essentially be weakening their own power — and their leverage for the next negotiation with the White House. “I believe the use of emergency powers in this circumstance violates the Constitution,” said Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, in a statement written on lined paper and published on Twitter. But it’s also important to look at these votes in context of this political moment. The White House is under siege from congressional investigations, and the special counsel report is looming. Mr. Trump’s approval ratings hover around 40 percent. With the 2020 campaign well underway, some Republicans may be calibrating their views for their own re-election races in purple states. Others, like Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, may be imagining a post-Trump political world. We don’t know exactly how Mr. Trump, a man who deeply values loyalty, will handle this type of rebuke from his own party. It’s awfully hard not to picture him taking it personally. In the past, Mr. Trump has gleefully taken credit for “retiring” critics like former Senator Jeff Flake and Republican House members who rejected “the embrace” of the White House — losses that cost his party control of the House. But he may find that there’s some power in numbers: Targeting a pack of a dozen Republicans is harder than picking off a few strays.

Earlier this week, we looked at Beto O’Rourke’s unorthodox path to the 2020 primary — the lonely road trips, the Kerouac-like blog posts — and wondered how it would have been perceived if he were a female candidate. Now that he has officially entered the race, we wanted to share some responses that we received this week. “I totally agree with you on the double standard for male/female candidates,” Judith wrote. “Beto O’Rourke is an egocentric and most unappealing potential candidate — I hope he sinks slowly in the west.” “Who cares why Beto O’Rourke spent the last several months on the road? Any effect on his family is between him and his family,” wrote Anne. She said her concern was with his policies (or lack thereof): “‘Not Ted Cruz’ and ‘Not Donald Trump’ and ‘but so many Texans like him’ aren’t sufficient reasons for me to make a decision about whether I’d want to trust him with running this country.” [Here’s a look at where Mr. O’Rourke stands on some of the biggest issues of the 2020 race.] “Unless I completely miss my guess, Beto is a flash in the pan,” Mina wrote. “Had there not been a Donald Trump, a crazy person, following Obama, a well-educated, amazing president, there would be no Beto having the audacity to think he could be president!” “I don’t begrudge Beto’s unorthodox style of ‘campaigning’ and don’t hold against him being male and running for office in that way,” wrote Karen, who described herself as a veteran political activist. “The one thing which Beto has that no other candidate who is running has is that he is genuine and speaks from his heart (not his head).

2019,2 Former Goldman Executives Barred From Banking Industry After Malaysia Fraud Scandal,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday barred two former Goldman Sachs executives from working in the banking industry because of their roles in a multibillion-dollar fraud involving a Malaysian government investment fund. One of the executives, Tim Leissner, who was one of Goldman’s top investment bankers in Asia, has pleaded guilty in a federal criminal investigation of the fraud and has been ordered to forfeit about $44 million. The other executive, Roger Ng, has been charged in the United States with participating in money laundering and bribery, but is in custody in Malaysia. Goldman Sachs helped the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, commonly known as 1MDB, sell more than $6 billion of debt to investors, ostensibly for projects that would benefit the Malaysian people. But federal prosecutors contend that at least $2.7 billion of that money went to fuel the lavish lifestyles of several people close to a former Malaysian prime minister, including the flamboyant financier Jho Low. Prosecutors have said some of the money raised for the fund went toward paying bribes to secure business for Goldman Sachs. Mr. Low, who also has been charged in the United States and Malaysia, attended at least two meetings where Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman chief executive officer, was present. But Goldman Sachs has painted Mr. Leissner, the husband of the fashion designer and model Kimora Lee Simmons, as a rogue operator who bears the responsibility for the bank’s role in the scandal. The bank has said that it took steps to make sure that neither Mr. Low nor any other intermediaries played a role in arranging the 1MDB financing deals. [Read more about Goldman Sachs’s efforts to distance itself from Mr. Leissner.] “Given the Department of Justice’s charges last year, this development is hardly surprising,” said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman. Federal prosecutors and banking regulators have continued to investigate Goldman’s role in the scandal. The bank has said it faced the prospect of a significant fine to resolve the matter. In addition to permanently barring Mr. Leissner from the banking industry, the Fed fined him $1.4 million. The banking authorities in Singapore barred Mr. Leissner from working in that country late last year. A lawyer for Mr. Leissner, who consented to the Fed ban, declined to comment. He is free on bail, which was originally set at $20 million. But the specific terms of Mr. Leissner’s bail were kept under seal when a redacted version of a transcript of his Aug. 28 guilty plea was made public in November. Lawyers for The New York Times asked a federal judge last month to unseal the portions of the transcript that describe the terms of Mr. Leissner’s bail. Mr. Leissner is scheduled to be sentenced on June 28. Mr. Ng’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, declined to comment on the Fed’s action on Tuesday. He previously said his client planned to plead not guilty after he was returned from Malaysia to face the pending charges filed by United States prosecutors in federal court in Brooklyn. Investigators in the United States have said 1MDB was raided by the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and other officials, including Mr. Low, with billions of dollars in siphoned funds used on luxuries including diamonds, designer handbags and fine art, and to help finance the Hollywood film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Mr. Najib was ousted in last year’s election and charged by Malaysian prosecutors with money laundering in August. Mr. Low, who remains at large, is believed to be staying in China.",The New York Times
2019,"2 Russian Military Planes Land in Venezuela, Exacerbating Political Tension","CARACAS, Venezuela — A visit to Venezuela by two military airplanes from Russia, which landed in broad daylight at the international airport in Caracas, has set off alarms that the Kremlin might be acting more brazenly to protect President Nicolás Maduro from the uprising against him. Russian and Venezuelan officials have not disputed the arrival of the airplanes, which were first seen at the airport on Saturday. Such flights ordinarily would be sent to a protected military air base beyond the sight of the public. [Why is Russia helping Venezuela?] The planes brought supplies and technical advisers to Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, according to a Russian state news agency and a Russian diplomat. The visit was related to military cooperation contracts signed years ago between Russia and Venezuela, said the news agency, Ria Novosti, suggesting it was routine. A Russian diplomat in Caracas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the diplomat was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed the Ria Novosti account and said there was nothing unusual. But opposition members said the visibility of the military planes was unusual and had been meant to send a message. The timing showed that both Russian and Venezuelan officials wanted to convert a routine technical stop into a show of strength, said Rocio San Miguel, a Venezuelan security analyst. “They want to make it as visible as possible,” said Ms. San Miguel. “This is a sort of bluff in a strategically important moment for Maduro.” Russia has emerged as Mr. Maduro’s main backer since opposition leader Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself interim president in late January with support of the United States and about 50 other states. Russia has maintenance contracts for weapons sold to Venezuela under late President Hugo Chávez, including air defense systems, fighter jets and tanks, that are worth billions of dollars. Flight tracking websites showed an Ilyushin IL-62 jet and an Antonov AN-124 cargo plane flew from Moscow’s military airport to Caracas’s international airport via Syria. The cargo plane flew back to Syria on Monday, according to flight tracking website bosphorusobserver.com. The arrival of the advisers came as Venezuela activated Russian-made S300 air defense systems last week, according to satellite imagery analysis firm ImageSat Intl. Russia has also recently deployed the S300 in Syria. Members of Venezuela’s opposition have accused Mr. Maduro of escalating the country’s deepening political crisis. They have pointed to widespread irregularities during the last election, consider Mr. Maduro’s government illegitimate and have asked him to step down and to allow them to call new elections. President Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to remove Mr. Maduro, not ruling out military intervention. State Secretary Michael Pompeo told his Russian counterpart in a phone call Monday that the United States will “not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela.” Last week, Venezuelan secret police detained Mr. Guaidó’s chief of staff on terrorism charges, a move that the Trump administration said would be punished.",The New York Times
2019,2 Weeks of U.S.-Taliban Talks End With ‘Progress’ but No Breakthrough,"DOHA, Qatar — Although more than two weeks of talks between the United States and the Taliban ended Tuesday without a breakthrough, two American officials said they were close to a final agreement on one crucial element to a framework for ending the long war: a Taliban promise to not allow terrorist attacks from Afghanistan. The officials also said they had made substantial progress on a second element, detailing a plan for the withdrawal of American troops. The chief American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, was expected to fly back to Washington on Tuesday night to brief Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “My time here was well spent,” Mr. Khalilzad said as he left the talks. “We made progress, and we had detailed discussions to reach an understanding on issues that are difficult and complicated.” The Taliban continued an internal meeting after the American negotiators left the resort in Doha, where the talks have taken place under tight security. “This round of talks saw extensive and detailed discussions taking place regarding two issues that were agreed upon during January talks,” Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said in a statement. “Those two issues were the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and preventing anyone from harming others from Afghan soil.” He added: “Progress was achieved regarding both these issues. For now, both sides will deliberate over the achieved progress, share it with their respective leaderships.” The sides are expected to meet again later this month in the hopes of finalizing a deal. But the lack of a clear breakthrough in talks right before spring, when fighting usually intensifies, raises concerns of another bloody year ahead. The war has taken the lives of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians, more than 100,000 Afghan and Taliban fighters combined, more than 2,400 Americans and more than 1,000 forces from other members of the military coalition that invaded Afghanistan almost 18 years ago. In the negotiations, the Americans have been trying to achieve the United States’ initial goal in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks by Al Qaeda: the prevention of terrorist attacks launched from Afghanistan against the United States and its allies. At the time of the Sept. 11 attacks, Al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan, which was controlled by the Taliban. A senior American official said the Taliban had hammered out a detailed proposal for an agreement on preventing terrorist attacks from Afghanistan, and it had specifically mentioned Al Qaeda — a difficult issue for the Taliban insurgents, who have never denounced the extremist group. Taliban officials suggested they would be walking a delicate line on the language of this clause, trying to reach an understanding that was acceptable to the United States but that would not anger their own fighters or cause division in their ranks. The American side was satisfied with the enforcement mechanisms for such a Taliban pledge, the official said, without offering details. Both sides had also engaged in long sessions over the details of an American timeline for withdrawing its troops, the officials said. But progress on this point was slow, and the negotiators remained far from agreement. While the Taliban have demanded a withdrawal within as little as six months, the American side has been pushing for three years. Several factors slowed progress during the talks, officials said, chief among them an environment of mistrust where each side believed the other could be using negotiations as a distraction to gain advantage on the battlefield. Another impediment was the Taliban’s caution in moving forward, as they have little experience negotiating texts of such magnitude. The presence of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, helped overcome these hurdles and keep the talks going. Mullah Baradar’s first-time participation in talks, after nearly 10 years in Pakistani detention, brought an authority to the Taliban’s negotiating team that was lacking in the past, with negotiators frequently having to wait for answers from the leadership in Pakistan. Mullah Baradar and Mr. Khalilzad met personally to troubleshoot when their negotiating teams hit a wall. The two men met close to a dozen times during the negotiations. The American negotiating team included military experts in logistics and counterterrorism. They were brought in part to help show the Taliban that the Americans were not “padding the time” on the withdrawal, as they contend, and that folding a military presence of 18 years in an orderly way requires time, one American official said. The American official said a substantial conversation had also taken place about reducing the levels of violence, a clear attempt to head off a Taliban spring offensive, which has taken a high toll on Afghan forces in the past. That would also require a commitment by the American and Afghan forces to slow down their air campaign, which they had ramped up over the winter. Even if the United States and the Taliban finalize their agreements, they face an uphill task moving the peace process to the next stage, in which the Taliban would negotiate the political future of the country with the Afghan government. The Taliban have so far refused to meet with the Afghan government, which in turn has been suspicious of the talks. But on Tuesday, the government welcomed the recent round. “We welcome U.S. efforts in the Afghan peace process,” said Haroon Chakhansuri, the spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani. “We hope to witness a long-term comprehensive cease-fire with the Taliban, and hope that direct negotiations of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban begin soon.” Mr. Ghani’s national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, warned the United Nations Security Council on Monday that the peace process must include representatives of “the new Afghanistan” and not be “a deal made between elites.” “If peace is going to belong to and be maintained by Afghans, it must ultimately be owned by Afghans themselves,” he said. Officials from both sides suggested they may try to slowly break the ice in creative ways. That could mean an arrangement where representatives of the Afghan government attend talks with the Taliban as part of a larger group of Afghans, similar to a gathering last month in Moscow where members of the Taliban met dozens of Afghan opposition politicians. Another round of talks, similar to the Moscow meeting between that group and the Taliban, is expected in the second week of April in Doha, officials said. Mr. Khalilzad, in a series of tweets after the talks ended, said when “a withdrawal timeline and effective counterterrorism measures is finalized, the Taliban and other Afghans, including the government, will begin intra-Afghan negotiations on a political settlement and comprehensive cease-fire.” “We will meet again soon, and there is no final agreement until everything is agreed,” he wrote. The sequencing of the elements of a peace agreement is a delicate issue, with Afghan politicians cautioning the United States not to lose its leverage over the Taliban by announcing a withdrawal timeline before the insurgents and the Afghan side have agreed to a political settlement and cease-fire. Ending the fighting would require the Taliban and the Afghan government to resolve major issues, including the formation of a future government, how power will be shared, and how to protect the gains in basic rights over the past 18 years, including rights of women who were confined to their homes during the Taliban’s oppressive years in power. Such negotiations would be an uphill task if they happen when a withdrawal is already underway. On the one side will be a Taliban force running on the high of what it sees as a battlefield victory against the largest military coalition in the world, and on the other an Afghan government feeling that its international partners left it hanging out to dry.",The New York Times
2019,2 Women Living With R. Kelly Denounce Their Parents and Deny Being Brainwashed,"Two women whose parents say they are being held in emotional and sexual captivity by the R&B singer R. Kelly vociferously defended the musician in an interview that aired on Thursday, claiming that their parents are blackmailing him and just out for money. Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23, told Gayle King of “CBS This Morning” that they were “absolutely” in love with Mr. Kelly, 52, who was charged last month in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four women, three of whom were minors at the time. Beyond his criminal case, Mr. Kelly also has been accused of harboring a so-called sex cult, in which he abused women and controlled every aspect of their lives, including when they can go to the bathroom. The interview with Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage, who have stood by Mr. Kelly in court, seemed unlikely to settle questions about what exactly goes on in the singer’s home. While the women’s parents say they are brainwashed and much of the world now sees Mr. Kelly as an unrelenting sexual predator, who has been trailed for decades by accusations of abuse and sex with underage girls, Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage lashed out at their families and said they were happy as Mr. Kelly’s girlfriends. The interview followed the airing on Wednesday of a heated conversation between Mr. Kelly and Ms. King of CBS, in which the singer denied all of the accusations against him. “I have been assassinated,” said Mr. Kelly, who was sometimes shouting, swearing and in tears. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Ms. King said that Mr. Kelly had agreed not to be present for the interview with Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage, but that he entered the room behind them after it began. Ms. King said Mr. Kelly would “cough very loudly,” and that the women were “certainly aware that he was there.” Mr. Kelly, who had been out on bond since last week, was sent back to jail Wednesday night for his failure to pay his ex-wife more than $160,000 in child support. The Detroit Police Department also said on Wednesday that it was investigating allegations that Mr. Kelly had sex with a 13-year-old girl there in 2001. “We have reached out, at the direction of the victim, to her lawyer and we are eagerly waiting to speak to her,” James Craig, the Detroit police chief, said in a statement, adding that they had not yet made contact with her. Ms. Clary said she met Mr. Kelly at one of his concerts when she was 17. “When I first met Robert, my parents told me to lie about my age,” she said. “He thought that I was 18.” She denied having sex with Mr. Kelly while underage, but said her parents had encouraged her “to take photos with him, sexual videos with him” in case “they ever have to blackmail him.” “What they’re doing right now is all for money,” Ms. Clary added. “If you can’t see that, you’re ignorant, and you’re stupid,” she said, adding expletives. Ms. Savage, who met Mr. Kelly when she was 19, backed up Ms. Clary’s version of events. Her parents were “just out here trying to get money and scam, because they didn’t agree on what happened with music,” Ms. Savage said. Both women’s parents have said their daughters were aspiring singers seeking Mr. Kelly’s guidance in music. Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage denied that they wanted to pursue music careers. Their parents, in statements on Thursday through their lawyers, denied ever having asked Mr. Kelly for money. “Sadly, like so many girls before them,” the Clarys said, “Azriel and Joycelyn Savage have been manipulated and convinced by Kelly to lie to protect him from serious criminal charges.” The day before, at a news conference in Atlanta, Ms. Savage’s father, Timothy, said “the only thing we want to do is hear from our daughter and know she’s fine.” Later, the Savage family received what it said was its first call from Joycelyn in two years. “You know that I’m happy,” she could be heard telling them. “You know exactly where I’m at.” Timothy Savage and his wife, Jonjelyn, first spoke out publicly about their daughter’s relationship with Mr. Kelly in a 2017 Buzzfeed article about the women living with the R&B star. The Savages later appeared in the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in January and led to renewed law-enforcement interest in the allegations against Mr. Kelly. The Savages said they had told the F.B.I., as well as the police in Georgia and Illinois, that Joycelyn was “being held against her will” by Mr. Kelly. Representatives for the singer said at the time that the authorities in Atlanta and Chicago had “made ‘wellness’ visits to check on the women in question and have found nothing to cause alarm.” In January, a man identified as a manager for Mr. Kelly, Henry James Mason, was arrested and charged with making violent threats against Mr. Savage; Mr. Mason denied the charges and said that he had in fact tried to re-establish a connection between Joycelyn and her family. Mr. Savage said he had also been threatened by another associate of Mr. Kelly’s — who said he could “ruin him, his reputation, business and family” — before the Lifetime documentary aired. Mr. Kelly, in his interview, had told Ms. King that he loved the women. “We have a relationship; it’s real,” he said. “I’ve known guys all my life that have five or six women, O.K. So don’t go there on me.” He added that he had no reason to hold the women captive. “Why would I?” Mr. Kelly said. “How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out!” CBS said it would air more from the interviews with Mr. Kelly and the two women in a prime time special on Friday.",The New York Times
2019,"2,300 Lawsuits Against Police. One Database to Search Them All.","New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.] It’s Thursday. Weather: A chance of flurries, then partly sunny. Enjoy the flakes while they last. Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 21 (Purim). After Eric Garner died in an officer’s chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, questions were raised about who holds the police accountable. Now a nonprofit group is making public thousands of lawsuits by people who say they are victims of police misconduct in New York City. The group, the Legal Aid Society, unveiled an online database yesterday called CAPstat. But police unions in New York warn that the information includes false allegations. Here’s what you need to know about it: What does the database include? To date, the database contains information about 2,339 lawsuits accusing 3,897 officers of violating the federal civil rights of various plaintiffs. The suits were filed between January 2015 and mid-2018. The website also has disciplinary records for about 1,800 officers accused of misconduct between 2011 and 2015. Why is the database useful? You can look up who has been sued, and why. It’s not just about finding “a bad officer,” but identifying systemic problems, said Cynthia Conti-Cook, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society. In other words, she said, if a pattern was widespread enough, the people held responsible might not just be officers or commanders, but the head of a department — or the mayor. Is there a downside to making information public? The Police Department and the police unions said some of the lawsuits were frivolous, but could be used to undermine officers’ credibility. “This database is clearly to help guilty criminals beat the charges against them,” Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said in an email. What does the data show? Here is information from the CAPstat database. An updated search of court records may yield different results. • Out of 307 lawsuits filed in which the plaintiff was identified as black, 96 were settled for a total of $7.6 million. • Out of 55 lawsuits filed in which the plaintiff was identified as Latino, 16 were settled for a total of $1.2 million. • Out of 238 lawsuits filed in which the plaintiff was identified as female, 74 were settled for a total of $2.2 million. • 72 lawsuits were filed citing “retaliation for recording”; 27 were settled for a total of $711,256. • 48 lawsuits were filed citing the use of a “chokehold”; 21 were settled for a total of $846,001. • 292 lawsuits were filed citing “tight handcuffs”; 106 were settled for a total of $2.4 million. • The 75th precinct, which includes Brooklyn’s East New York neighborhood, was involved in the most lawsuits of any precinct: 91. The settlements totaled more than $9.1 million. Mario Batali gave up his restaurants. The celebrity chef, who was accused of sexual misconduct, is also selling his shares in Eataly.

She was explaining the trends in the craft breweries while I listened silently. Perhaps, too silently. “I bet you I can find you a beer that you are obsessed with,” she told me. It would take a few minutes worth of questioning, “kind of like a psychologist.” I politely declined the questioning, but appreciated the offer.

Today at 4, she will help host the New York City round of the statewide Best Brews of New York competition at Brookfield Place. Five local craft breweries will offer their best beverages. The public will vote, and it will all be “guided” by Ms. Becerra, as the organizers put it. Competing are the Bronx Brewery (the Bronx), Coney Island Brewing Company (Brooklyn), Harlem Brewing Company (Manhattan), Mikkeller (Queens) and Sixpoint Brewery (Brooklyn). The winner will return to Brookfield Place next week to face off against breweries that won competitions upstate and on Long Island. Upstate New York will be represented by Empire Brewing Company of Syracuse, and Long Island by Barrier Brewing Company of Oceanside. Proceeds from the beers sold will be donated to Habitat for Humanity. Last year, Best Brews raised more than $60,000 for New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit organization. Ms. Becerra said the beer world has, at times, overlooked a huge swath of its audience. “If you look at all the advertisements for beer, who major breweries are speaking to, a majority of the time it’s been men,” she said. “But I think that’s changing a lot with craft breweries that are far more flavor-based.” It’s Thursday — taste something new.

2019,2020 Candidates Demand Full and Immediate Release of Mueller Report,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding the immediate public release of the long-awaited report from Robert S. Mueller III, with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump, Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr. Trump and the 2020 race. Former Representative Beto O’Rourke, campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night, told reporters that “those facts, that truth, needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward, whether at the ballot box” or in their discussions with their senators and representatives. Mr. O’Rourke, asked if he supported impeaching Mr. Trump, said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign “at least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracy” and that Mr. Trump “sought to obstruct justice” once in office. “I think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment,” he said. “But whether they do or not, this will ultimately be decided by the American public at the ballot box in South Carolina and in every state of the union.” No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr. O’Rourke as he spoke to them Friday. Indeed, in the hours after the announcement of the report, Democratic candidates reacted over Twitter or in remarks at events rather than in back-and-forth conversations with voters. Several candidates, in calling for the swift release of the report, also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out “petitions” calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department. “The Trump Administration shouldn’t get to lock up Robert Mueller’s report and throw away the key,” Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter, asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails. Such information is often used for future fund-raising solicitations. Within hours of Mr. Mueller’s completing his investigation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full report’s release, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100,000 signatures for its online petition. With no detailed information available about the report, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker — as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris — sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P. Barr would release the full report. “Attorney General Barr — release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,” Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter. [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] Ms. Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: “See you Sunday.” That is when Ms. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her 2020 campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York. Ms. Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released “immediately,” called on Mr. Barr to “publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.” Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand also joined Mr. Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report’s immediate release. Four other candidates — Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; former Representative John Delaney; and Julián Castro — also called for the release of the full report. “As Donald Trump said, ‘Let it come out,’” Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter. “I call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller’s full report public as soon as possible. No one, including the president, is above the law.”",The New York Times
2019,2020 Democrats Import Grass-Roots Activism Into Their Campaign Staffs,"Alexandra Rojas was shocked. So was Waleed Shahid. The two vocal leaders of Justice Democrats, an advocacy group whose uncompromising style has made it a nuisance among Washington traditionalists, had a meeting request from aides to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was fresh into her presidential campaign. As Ms. Warren sought to push the party to the left by proposing expansive liberal policy ideas, her team was prepared to seek counsel from organizations that did the same. “They want us in their court,” Ms. Rojas said. “They know that if they want to win, they need to have the support from the grass-roots energy.” Ms. Warren’s willingness to look outside the traditional pool of political aides underscores the extent to which activism and ideology are shaping the makeup of campaign staffs for Democratic candidates, even at the highest levels. Neither Ms. Rojas nor Mr. Shahid received a job offer, but in a crowded field where candidates are looking to stand out, activists fluent in the language of social movements are gaining value as important allies. Julián Castro hired as his campaign manager Maya Rupert, a campaign novice who made her name in organizing with the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Senator Bernie Sanders has expanded his close-knit group of strategists and tapped Faiz Shakir, the former political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, to run his new-look presidential campaign. As the primary process kicks into full swing, some Democrats are bypassing the kind of experienced Washington “wiseguys” who operated in the caldron of beltway politics — famous strategists like David Axelrod, James Carville and, more recently, Robby Mook. Instead, campaigns are increasingly filling senior positions with a new generation of activist-driven operatives, whose political formation took place in grass-roots movements. The shift has resulted in greater staff diversity than in previous cycles, but it has also influenced strategy, according to campaign officials. New voices are joining with election-cycle veterans to bring fresh ideas and political approaches to the presidential stage. Mr. Castro, for instance, plans to diverge from the traditional early primary state road map in favor of a tour of all 50 states. Ms. Warren has pledged to eschew all private fund-raising, an unheard-of step in presidential politics that was fueled by her campaign’s chief architect, Dan Geldon, who shares Ms. Warren’s distaste for Wall Street and a willingness to take political risks. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Sanders is emphasizing his personal biography more and engaging in more explicit discussions of racial inequality. Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat who has often relied on a trusted group of California advisers, has taken pains to find senior staff members with grass-roots credentials as she attempts to fashion herself as the candidate “for the people.” “The shifts that we’re seeing in the Democratic Party are a lot of folks demanding that their leadership take ideas that have been considered on the fringe and push them to the center,” said Ms. Rupert, Mr. Castro’s campaign manager. “And that’s the way movements operate.” Mr. Castro’s campaign is also paying its interns a $15 minimum wage and said it would support any effort among staff members to form a union. And Mr. Sanders’s campaign announced last week that its staff would become the first presidential campaign work force to be unionized. Kelly Dietrich, the longtime Democratic consultant, said the surge in Democratic voter enthusiasm since President Trump’s election has helped issue-driven activists become more interested in traditional electoral politics. It has also forced campaigns to take new ideas more seriously, he said. [Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] “We’re seeing a lot more people across the spectrum, both in terms of diversity and political agenda, step forward and want to make change,” said Mr. Dietrich, who founded a campaign training organization called the National Democratic Training Committee. They are “fed up or scared; they are frustrated and are ready to fight back.” The Democratic Party needs to bring in these activists, Mr. Dietrich said, “so that five years, 10 years, 15 years down the road, this is the norm.” The shift reflects a growing realization among many Democrats that the party’s most fervent energy resides on its left flank. Democrats swept to power in the House in last year’s midterm elections, and the most popular members of the party’s new class are the women of color who pushed the party even further left, empowered by groups including Justice Democrats. Rather than fight that new energy, some 2020 hopefuls have decided to court it. Richard McDaniel, who helped engineer the surprise victory for Senator Doug Jones of Alabama in 2017, joined Ms. Warren’s campaign as field director. Rebecca Pearcey, formerly of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, an organization that works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, was a surprise choice as Ms. Warren’s national political director. In terms of racial diversity, Ms. Harris has led the way, with 12 senior staff members who are women of color, out of 17 total. That includes Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the activist granddaughter of the labor leader Cesar Chavez. Ms. Rodriguez was instrumental in helping Ms. Harris secure the endorsement of Dolores Huerta, the California labor leader who, along with Mr. Chavez, founded the United Farm Workers. Another member of Ms. Harris’s team is Laphonza Butler, the former president of the Service Employees International Union in California. She said activists were more likely to see electoral politics as valuable in this era because of the moral urgency that Mr. Trump’s administration has instilled among liberals. “We’re asking ourselves these really existential questions about what are we going to be as a nation,” said Ms. Butler, who is a senior adviser to Ms. Harris. “And I had to choose how to best continue the work that I’ve been doing as an advocate for workers and a voice for workers — and working for Senator Harris is a continuation of that.” Mr. McDaniel, Ms. Warren’s field director, said the shift had been building since President Barack Obama ushered in an era of internet-driven, grass-roots organizing. “The rule book went out the door with President Obama, kind of, how you engage communities,” Mr. McDaniel said. “It’s old-school tactics, but you need to have a new mind frame of thinking.” But some in the party have warned that the embracing of activists could be more about optics than an actual shift in political power and that the bulk of decision making will still reside with the political strategy firms that have long been influential in electoral politics. Ms. Harris’s campaign, for example, has deep ties to big political names such as the longtime California consultant Averell Smith, the Democratic strategist also known as Ace who helped her orchestrate several campaigns in advance of her presidential run. “The proof will be in the pudding,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, the political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and a former staff member on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “Like who’s getting to decide the budgets, who’s getting to decide where the candidate goes, who’s getting to decide the targeting? Is that the people of color that they hired?” Ms. Morales Rocketto urged the campaigns to see employees from non-Washington backgrounds as more than just an attempt to “check boxes.” She said one current presidential campaign had explicitly told her recently that it was calling her because it needed a “senior Latina with movement credibility.” “It would be a damn shame if all they did was catch up to the optics,” she added. Heather McGhee, the former president of the progressive advocacy group Demos has not signed onto a 2020 campaign but said she had been contacted personally by Ms. Harris and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey — though she remains a close ally of Ms. Warren’s. Her counsel was particularly valued after Demos’s political arm published a much-lauded 2018 paper on how candidates should fuse analysis of race and class, a key focus of the progressive message. “To see the soul of the new Democratic Party, you can look to the candidate’s advisers and ask whether they came from activism or professional consultant class,” Ms. McGhee said. One new idea was on display when Ms. Harris held a recent campaign rally in Nevada. During the event, aides passed out headsets to Spanish-speaking residents so that the candidate’s words could be translated in real time, a move widely praised as an effective way to reach new voters in the immigrant-rich West. It came from Ms. Butler, who said it was a “no-brainer” from her time in union organizing.",The New York Times
2019,"2020 Democrats Love Small Donors. But Some Really Love Big Donors, Too.","Senator Cory Booker spun through a San Francisco fund-raiser hosted on Friday afternoon by high-tech titans and wealthy venture capitalists, including the investor Ron Conway. That evening, in New York, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand gathered donations at the Upper West Side home of Matthew Mallow, a vice chairman of the investment giant BlackRock. And on Sunday night, Senator Kamala Harris is set to mingle with Hollywood luminaries at the home of the president of the MGM Motion Picture Group, Jonathan Glickman. The race for cash in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary is reaching a frenetic peak this weekend with a dozen fund-raisers on both coasts, as presidential hopefuls rush to vacuum up $2,800 checks — the maximum amount individuals can give for the primary by law — before the first quarterly fund-raising deadline of the campaign at midnight on Sunday. But the candidates don’t want to discuss any of this. They are instead trying to pull off a delicate balancing act. Publicly, the 2020 hopefuls are all about attracting low-dollar donors, trying to prove their grass-roots appeal and populist bona fides by touting large numbers of small donations — an ascendant force in Democratic politics. But privately, most Democrats also badly need the big checks and are still going behind closed doors to woo the wealthy, whose money is critical to pay for campaign staff, travel and advertising. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] As a result, a traditional part of presidential races early on — candidates trumpeting big-money and well-connected contributors as a show of political strength — has gone virtually underground, the invisible primary turning truly invisible. The jockeying for major donors remains as intense as ever, but the usual campaign announcements of powerhouse finance committees and boldfaced bundler lists have all but disappeared. Even some online R.S.V.P. pages for fund-raisers don’t identify the wealthy backers anymore. Amy Dacey, the former chief executive officer of the Democratic National Committee, said the donor dynamics this cycle are “fundamentally different” than before. “Candidates talk more about how many different donors they have and how many states they’re in,” she said. “It’s more about the donor amounts than the dollar amounts.” But, Ms. Dacey added of big donors, “They still need them.” Two prominent candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have disavowed the traditional money circuit entirely — a safe bet for Mr. Sanders, whose online donor network amply funded his 2016 run, but a far riskier gambit for Ms. Warren, who has a far smaller base of low-dollar contributors. Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, began calling some donors to seek support before he entered the race this month, but he is expected to lean heavily on a small-donor network that netted more than 100,000 contributions and $6.1 million in his first 24 hours. He has held no fund-raisers so far and has none planned yet in the future, according to his campaign. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] Unlike in 2016, when the Democratic donor class rallied to Hillary Clinton, or 2008, when givers lined up with Mrs. Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards, many of the party’s wealthiest figures remain firmly on the sidelines, serving as perhaps the biggest check on the role of big money in 2020 to date. That has given an advantage to Mr. O’Rourke and Mr. Sanders, who are banking on small donations. Those two, plus Ms. Harris, who has a strong small-donor network and has been aggressively courting larger contributors, are widely expected to raise the most in the first quarter. Several 2020 hopefuls have spent recent weeks canvassing the country, from Dallas to Miami, Chicago to Los Angeles, to raise the money needed in a crowded primary that is expected to easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars. At fund-raising events, attendees say, most 2020 candidates typically are delivering more intimate versions of their stump speeches, pitching their vision for the country along with a heavy dosage on their political viability and pathway to the presidency, amid caterers circulating with drinks and snacks. Last Tuesday, Ms. Harris was in the tony Washington neighborhood of Kalorama at an event where hosts were asked to raise at least $10,000 (although the price points were not listed on the front of at least one version of the emailed invitation). The Saturday before that, Mr. Booker was feted at the home of Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey as the singer Jon Bon Jovi circulated in the crowd ahead of a three-course dinner that pulled in $300,000, according to a person familiar with the event. And before that, Senator Amy Klobuchar was in Chicago asking for money at the home of a former Goldman Sachs banker who later served as ambassador to Canada, Bruce A. Heyman. In between, donors are hearing from the candidates by phone. A lot. “When I see a 202 number these days, I don’t usually answer it,” said Amber Mostyn, a Houston-based attorney and prominent Democratic fund-raiser, joking about the Washington area code and the number of candidates who have reached out for help. According to several donors as well as invitations obtained by The New York Times, four senators — Mr. Booker, Ms. Gillibrand, Ms. Harris and Ms. Klobuchar — have been particularly aggressive on the national donor circuit. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have been making calls and organizing events, as well. “It takes a lot of time away from what we should be doing,” said John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman and businessman running for president, who is mostly avoiding the money chase by self-funding his campaign. “I guess you’d call it a necessary evil.” Schedules are often constructed, at least in part, around raising money. So while a recent trip by Ms. Harris to Texas drew headlines for her decision to rally in the home state of Mr. O’Rourke, the visit was also about raising money, with a fund-raiser at the Dallas home of Jill Louis, a partner in the law firm K&L Gates. (Ms. Louis is also a trustee of Howard University, Ms. Harris’s alma mater.) Some big donors who remain unaligned are waiting for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Some are holding out for the field to thin. Others are writing checks to a number of contenders without committing exclusively for any one of them. Mitchell Berger, a longtime South Florida fund-raiser and self-described political “dinosaur,” who fondly recalls his work on behalf of a young Al Gore in 1987, rattled off the names of five candidates who had called him. But Mr. Berger said that, while he had given to some, he had not yet hosted events or bundled contributions for anyone because he wants to see how the race will unfold. In April, Steven Rattner and Blair Effron, two prominent donors in New York, are planning a dinner for unaligned donors to discuss how and when to engage in a primary contest that is more unpredictable than any in a generation. “It’s completely different than 2016,” Henry R. Munoz III, the Democratic National Committee finance chair and a longtime Democratic donor, said of the lack of urgency among fund-raisers this year. He added: “Most of my donors are enjoying getting to know the candidates and being courted a little bit.” Some big names have taken sides, according to people familiar with their activities. Laurie Tisch, a wealthy philanthropist, is supporting Mr. Booker and recently held an event for him in New York. Naomi Aberly, the former chairwoman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of American board, is raising money for Ms. Gillibrand and organized a Texas fund-raiser for her already. Wayne Jordan and Quinn Delaney, an influential political couple in Oakland, are backing Ms. Harris. Ms. Warren has essentially abandoned the pursuit of such donors, even though some have raised big sums for her in the past. “This is our chance to run a grass-roots movement, not just to go around the country scooping up as much money as we can,” Ms. Warren said in an interview. But for those Democrats who are seeking cash in big chunks, Hollywood has been, as ever, a deep well. On one night in mid-March, Ms. Harris was hosted at the home of J.J. Abrams, the director of recent “Star Trek” and “Star Wars” movies, with a who’s who list of co-hosts. Across town, Ms. Klobuchar was schmoozing with donors at the home of Jay Sures, the co-president of the United Talent Agency, with co-hosts including the talent agent Peter Benedek and the television producer Marcy Carsey, a longtime Democratic donor. Lawyers have long been another mainstay of the Democratic donor circuit. Ms. Gillibrand got her start in politics raising money while working as a Manhattan attorney; she has three fund-raisers just this weekend at the homes of law firm partners, two of whom she once worked with. One of Ms. Gillibrand’s other events, on Sunday, has stirred some criticism; it is at the home of Sally Susman, a senior executive with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Though Ms. Susman is a longtime friend of Ms. Gillibrand’s, the event has served as a cautionary tale of the potential downsides of fund-raising with industry executives. Still, many veterans of Democratic fund-raising believe that the eventual nominee will have to marry a robust network of small-dollar online givers with a high-dollar fund-raising operation in order to both claim the nomination and defeat President Trump. Notably, Ms. Warren left open the possibility of attending fund-raisers again, should she become the nominee. “I do not believe in unilateral disarmament,” she said of running against Republicans. Julianna Smoot, who ran Mr. Obama’s 2008 finance operation, recalled that the former president raised considerable grass-roots money but also spent hours on the phone building a team of bundlers. “He did a lot of max-out, traditional fund-raising,” she said. “You have to have an integrated approach.”",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | 2020, the Next Phase","Also: The most basic sin of economics journalism. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Almost half of Democratic voters identify as either political moderates or conservatives. And more than half of Democratic voters say they would like to see the party move toward the center rather than the left. If you’ve been watching the early maneuverings in the 2020 Democratic primary, these facts may surprise you. So far, the candidates have mostly been trying to appeal to the more left-leaning parts of the Democratic coalition. I understand why. There’s a lot of energy on the political left these days, and most of it is quite healthy. But I think the Democrats shouldn’t lose sight of the large fraction of voters — a clear majority nationwide — who don’t see themselves as liberals. It’s possible to appeal to these moderate voters while still offering a progressive agenda. There is no need to go all Howard Schultz. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] My column today makes the case that Democrats can be strongly progressive and still pitch themselves to swing voters. I hope — and expect — that the primary campaign is about to enter a phase in which this balance gets some more attention. Inflating reality This weekend, The Wall Street Journal ran a big package of articles celebrating the state of the American labor market, under the headline “The Great American Jobs Machine.” The subhead proclaimed: “This is the hottest labor market in 50 years.” My immediate reaction was skepticism. The very same Wall Street Journal ran an article a week earlier (which I cited in this newsletter) explaining that workers’ share of the economic pie was continuing to shrink and that middle-class incomes were stagnant. So I was curious to see how the new, cheerier story would try to prove its case. The answer was pretty incredible. Two charts showed several steeply rising lines, each meant to depict median weekly earnings since 2007 for a specific demographic group. The lines suggested that weekly earnings had surged by between 15 percent and 35 percent over this period. Sounds great, right? It would be, if it reflected reality. But the charts committed perhaps the most basic sin of economics journalism: They didn’t adjust for inflation. When you ignore inflation, most dollar values look as if they’re steeply rising. But that’s meaningless. In truth, weekly earnings for most groups have risen by only single-digit percentage points since 2007. For some demographic groups — like college dropouts — inflation-adjusted pay has fallen. Bottom line: The current job market remains decidedly cooler than the job market of the late 1990s or late 1960s. I think it’s worth highlighting the Journal package both because of its prominence and because journalism that exaggerates the health of today’s economy is all too common. Why? In part, it’s that journalists enjoy publishing counterintuitive stories. (I’ll confess to having that bias too.) Trumpeting a boom feels counterintuitive these days, because most Americans don’t feel like they’re living through a boom. Sometimes, though, counterintuitive is just another word for wrong. Related: Another part of the explanation is that some of the traditional economic indicators, like G.D.P., unemployment and the stock market, look very good. Unfortunately, they no longer accurately describe the experiences of many households. Better measures are income and net worth — including inflation, of course.

2019,"25 States Are at Risk of Serious Flooding This Spring, U.S. Forecast Says","Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. Vast areas of the United States are at risk of flooding this spring, even as Nebraska and other Midwestern states are already reeling from record-breaking late-winter floods, federal scientists said on Thursday. Nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states will have an elevated risk of some flooding from now until May, and 25 states could experience “major or moderate flooding,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The flooding this year could be worse than anything we’ve seen in recent years, even worse than the historic floods of 1993 and 2011,” said Mary C. Erickson, deputy director of the National Weather Service, in a conference call with reporters. The major flooding this month in Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and elsewhere is “a preview of what we expect throughout the rest of the spring,” she said. Some 13 million people could be exposed to major flooding, making this a “potentially unprecedented” flood season, said Edward Clark, director of NOAA’s National Water Center. And much of the United States east of the Mississippi River, as well as parts of California and Nevada — in total, areas home to more than 200 million people — could see at least some flooding in the spring, the scientists said. The projections were part of NOAA’s annual “Spring Outlook,” though the language of the 2019 report carried greater urgency than usual. That is not surprising, since the basins of the Upper Mississippi and the Red River of the North have already been hit with rain and snow this spring of up to twice normal levels. “We’ve set over 30 records in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota” in the last week alone, said Kevin Low, a scientist with the National Weather Service’s Missouri River Basin Forecast Center. That flooding has devastated farmers and ranchers across the region, put communities like Hamburg, Iowa, underwater, and wiped out roads and bridges in others. Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska put a preliminary estimate of $1.4 billion in damages in his request for a federal disaster declaration, including $439 million in damages to public infrastructure and $85 million to homes and businesses. Above-average rainfall that scientists expect for the spring, along with melting snow, would add to the flooding and extend it through the central and southern United States. NOAA identified the greatest risks for moderate to major flooding in the upper, middle and lower Mississippi River basins, the Red River of the North, the Great Lakes, and the eastern Missouri River, lower Ohio River, lower Cumberland River and Tennessee River basins. The agency’s scientists also predicted that the chemical runoff from the rains would cause above-average hypoxia conditions — “dead zones” of water with low oxygen caused by nutrient pollution that can kill fish and other marine life — in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay. More rainfall in the Midwest is a predictable consequence of climate change, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, which was produced last year by 13 federal agencies. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which comes down as precipitation. The current flooding in the Missouri River basin and beyond has been caused in part by heavy rains, but has been further complicated by other factors, like frozen ground that kept water from being absorbed. Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, said that understanding the role of climate change in weather events like the Nebraska floods required applying the tools of a growing field known as attribution science. “Without doing the analysis, you don’t know what role climate change played,” he said. “Certainly, floods happened before climate change.” However, he added, heavier rainfall events are among the most common conditions associated with climate change. Humans have loaded so much planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that “the starting assumption has to be that climate change is affecting everything” to some extent, he said. “The real question isn’t, ‘Is climate change playing a role?’” Dr. Dessler said. “It’s, ‘How big a role is climate change playing, and what is the role?’” The National Weather Service describes moderate flooding as involving some inundation of structures and roads near streams, with some evacuations; major flooding involves extensive inundation of structures and roads and significant evacuations. By comparing this year’s potential flooding to the seasons of 1993 and 2011, Ms. Erickson was citing some of the worst weather disasters the United States has faced since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. The 1993 flood in the Midwest killed 50 people and caused $15 billion in damages; a reporter for The New York Times called it “a watery rampage by nature like no other.” In the 2011 floods, the Army Corps of Engineers took the extraordinary measure of blowing up 11,000 feet of Mississippi River levee to let water flow into the Birds Point floodway in Missouri, saving the little Illinois town of Cairo but inundating more than 100,000 acres of farmland and homes.

2019,2nd Trudeau Minister Resigns as Canada’s Political Crisis Swells,"OTTAWA — Another minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada quit in protest on Monday over accusations that he and his aides tried to influence a criminal case against a multinational Canadian company accused of bribing the Libyan government. The unexpected resignation, by Jane Philpott, who led the treasury board, inflames a growing political crisis that has already cost Mr. Trudeau his former justice minister and his top aide. “I’ve been considering the events that have shaken the government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of cabinet,” said Ms. Philpott, who was also a former health minister and minister of Indigenous affairs. Speaking to a Liberal party rally in Toronto on Monday night, Mr. Trudeau thanked Ms. Philpott for her service. “I know that Ms. Philpott has felt this way for some time,” Mr. Trudeau said during a speech, which was occasionally interrupted by hecklers. “While I’m disappointed, I understand her decision.” Mr. Trudeau said that the political controversy “has generated important discussion” and added that “there are more questions to be answered and more to be said in the coming days and weeks.” With a federal election looming seven months away, Mr. Trudeau must now not only salvage his reputation as someone who promised an open approach to politics, but may be in peril of losing control of his position as leader of the Liberal Party, which would end his time as prime minister. On Monday, Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, repeated his call for Mr. Trudeau to step down and called on other cabinet ministers to follow Ms. Philpott’s example. In announcing her decision, Ms. Philpott cited accusations that Mr. Trudeau and his aides had exerted improper and excessive pressure on the justice minister and attorney general at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to seek a settlement in the criminal case against the company, SNC-Lavalin. A criminal conviction would have barred the company from bidding on government contracts for a decade, potentially leading to major job losses in Quebec, where it has its headquarters. [You can read more here about the SNC-Lavalin case and how it has entangled Mr. Trudeau.] Ms. Wilson-Raybould resisted the pressure, and quit the cabinet last month. Ms. Philpott was among the few cabinet ministers to publicly side with her. “There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,” Ms. Philpott wrote in her resignation letter to Mr. Trudeau on Monday. Privately, several members of his caucus have said Mr. Trudeau has badly fumbled his handling of the controversy. Publicly, though, they have spoken in solidarity with the prime minister. Royce Koop, a political scientist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, said that might now change. “Philpott was really the talent pool of the Trudeau cabinet, she got things done,” he said. “The question now is do we now start to see the beginning of a caucus rebellion? I haven’t heard that anything is happening. But this is going to shift opinion in the caucus.” But Professor Koop said he’s seen nothing to suggest that Ms. Wilson-Raybould was trying to lead a movement to eject Mr. Trudeau as the party leader and, thus, prime minister. Both Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, who was a doctor before entering politics in 2015, were recruited by Mr. Trudeau to enter politics in the 2015 election. Neither has developed a strong political machine to support their new careers. Both former ministers worked closely together on some of Mr. Trudeau’s signature achievements, including the legalization of medical marijuana and, before that, right-to-die legislation. Both say they intend to remain in the Liberal caucus. Mr. Trudeau’s troubles began nearly a month ago when The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources, said Mr. Trudeau and his aides had improperly pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould to use a newly created law to work out a settlement for SNC-Lavalin that would have seen it pay a substantial fine to avoid a criminal conviction. Canadian authorities have accused the company of paying 47.7 million Canadian dollars in bribes to officials in Libya to win contracts there, and defrauding the Libyan government and its agencies of 129.8 million Canadian dollars. In January, Ms. Wilson-Raybould was moved by Mr. Trudeau from justice minister and attorney general to veterans affairs minister, which many saw as a demotion and a slight to the one remaining Indigenous member of the cabinet. On Feb. 12, she resigned. Last week in testimony before the House of Commons’ justice committee, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described 10 meetings, 10 conversations and a series of email exchanges in which Mr. Trudeau, his senior aides and others, in her view, improperly pressured her to cut a deal with the company. She testified that while no one broke the law they crossed informal lines in Canada that are supposed to isolate prosecutors from politics by mentioning the potential political consequences for the Liberals of shutting SNC-Lavalin out of government business. Mr. Trudeau has said he disagrees with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s characterizations of events. Several senior Liberals have said that many others share his view. Gerald Butts, a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s who quit as his top political aide after the initial news articles about the accusations, is set to testify before a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. Ken Coates, a political historian at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, said Ms. Philpott’s resignation was the most significant act of cabinet revolt in about 50 years. “To have a minister not directly involved in all this stand up and resign — it’s astounding,” Professor Coates said. “We’re now in a new world.” An earlier version of this article misstated the day Jane Philpott resigned from her position in the prime minister’s cabinet. She quit her post on Monday, not Wednesday.",The New York Times

She quit her post on Monday, not Wednesday.",The New York Times
2019,3 Teenage Migrants Are Charged in Malta With Hijacking Ship at Sea,"VALLETTA, Malta — Three teenage migrants have been charged in a court in Malta with hijacking a small commercial oil tanker that had rescued them and others off the coast of Libya, an act that is considered a terrorist crime under Maltese law. The tanker, El Hiblu 1, was hijacked in the Mediterranean this past week. The captain said that rescued migrants had begun to riot and threaten violence when they saw that the ship was returning them to Libya. According to the captain, they forced it to turn north toward Europe. The suspects pleaded not guilty during an arraignment in Valletta, the Maltese capital, on Saturday. One of the accused was identified by the court as Abdalla Bari, a 19-year-old from Guinea. The other two are a 15-year-old from Guinea and a 16-year-old from Ivory Coast, who could not be named because they were minors. A magistrate, Donatella Frendo Dimech, denied a bail request, noting that civilian witnesses, including the captain and crew, had yet to testify and that the accused had no ties in Malta nor any means of paying bond. Strategies to reduce migrants in the Mediterranean Sea may have made the journey more treacherous. The minors told the court that they were high school students, while Mr. Bari, the 19-year-old, said that he had been studying sociology before leaving his country. Under Maltese law, unlawfully seizing control of a ship can be considered a terrorist activity and is punishable by seven to 30 years in prison. The tanker was heading to Libya from Turkey when it was asked on Tuesday to divert its course to rescue nearly 100 migrants in distress, which it did, before continuing on its course. But when the migrants realized on Wednesday that they were headed back to Libya, which they had just left, some apparently revolted and commandeered the ship. The temporary hijacking was described by Italy’s hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, as piracy. Some aid groups, however, called it an act of self-defense against Europe’s immigration policies, which often result in the shipping of desperate migrants back to Libya, where they can face beatings, rape and torture in detention camps. European Union states have been at loggerheads over migration since a surge in Mediterranean arrivals caught the bloc by surprise in 2015, stretching social and security services and fueling support for far-right, nationalist and populist groups. Sea arrivals have fallen from more than one million in the peak year to about 140,000 people last year, according to United Nations data. But political tensions around migration run high in the European Union, especially in the prelude to European Parliament elections in May.",The New York Times
2019,"3 Young Lawmakers Share a Progressive Vision, and a 7-Room Apartment","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] ALBANY — On a recent evening in the state’s capital, three lawmakers were discussing tax exemptions. State Senator Alessandra Biaggi had just wondered aloud at the challenges facing working mothers, leading a Senate colleague, Jessica Ramos, to mention a bill she had introduced to exempt breast pumps from sales taxes. That prompted Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou to interject: “Let’s talk, too, because I’m on the insurance committee.” The conversation, in the middle of the year’s budget negotiations, was hardly unusual. More unexpected was the location: Ms. Niou’s bed, where the three women were perched, in their shared apartment about two miles west of the State Capitol. State legislators have long shared lodging and ideas during their weekly pilgrimages to Albany, often taking adjoining rooms at local hotels or even buying neighboring apartments in a single co-op. Federal power brokers, including Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, have famously shared housing as well, leading to revelations about their nighttime attire (boxer shorts for Mr. Schumer) and stimulating conversations (on grandchildren and Metamucil, according to Mr. Durbin). But the three women in Albany are likely among the first to make a space like theirs: equal parts Ikea catalog, Instagram feed and campaign office. Copies of the Harvard Business Review and Self magazine lay side by side on Ms. Ramos’s bed. A book about “goals with soul” decorated Ms. Biaggi’s bedside table, near a photo of her great-grandmother and her grandfather, Mario Biaggi, a former congressman. Ms. Biaggi said she had recently invited the chancellor of the state university system to her legislative office for the first time, where they discussed the schools in Ms. Biaggi’s district, in the Bronx and Westchester County, as well as the senator’s taste in candles: “She walked in and said, ‘Oh, it smells good,’” Ms. Biaggi said with a laugh. (She keeps a matching, triple-sec-scented one by her bed.) In the apartment stairwell, a trio of campaign posters had been taped to the wall, one for each resident. Traditionally, lawmakers’ half-week stints in Albany have conjured images of noisy bars and cheap hotel rooms. Lawmakers are given $174 for each night they spend in the capital, and they get to pocket what they don’t spend, so they have often crowded into budget hotels to save money. The system has also seen its share of abuses: Several legislators have been convicted of bilking the system. But Ms. Biaggi, Ms. Ramos and Ms. Niou are part of a new class of legislators in Albany, one that is younger and more female than ever before, the result of a front of progressive energy that delivered the Capitol into all-Democratic hands last year. Ms. Biaggi, 32, and Ms. Ramos, 33, are in their first term. Ms. Niou, 35, is in her second. All took over from powerful men: Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos defeated incumbents in the Democratic primary last year, toppling a group of breakaway senators who had long wielded disproportionate influence. Ms. Niou, also a Democrat, won the seat held by former Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver before he was indicted on federal corruption charges. The three met last summer, when Ms. Biaggi called Ms. Niou, who represents Manhattan, to ask for her endorsement. Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos had already been campaigning together for months in an effort to oust their primary opponents; Ms. Niou organized a fund-raiser for the two soon after. “We didn’t have a pipeline,” Ms. Niou said. “This is the only way that anything’s going to shift,” Ms. Biaggi said of electing more women. “It’s so obvious to me.” Ms. Ramos showed the others her Instagram story, where she had shared a clip of an interview she taped with Univision at the Capitol that day. In the video, as Ms. Ramos, who represents Queens, called for more school funding, a young girl standing nearby watched, eyes wide. Their newness was apparent in everything from the recreational — where was the best nail salon in Albany? — to the professional: “We just go on all day. It’s worse than campaigning,” Ms. Biaggi said of the marathon meetings before the state’s April 1 budget deadline. She wasn’t complaining, though: “I, like, love chaos.” Ms. Niou, the nominal veteran of the house, shook her head at Ms. Biaggi’s excitement. “It’s not what she thinks it is,” she said of the grueling budget process. “But trust me, it’s going to be a lot better.” Ms. Niou was referring to not just the new Democratic control of Albany, but also a new optimism that she said stretched beyond partisan politics. “‘This is how it’s always been done’ — people would say that to me all the time,” Ms. Niou said. But not anymore, she added. “There’s a can-do attitude,” Ms. Ramos said. The seven-room apartment costs $1,200 a month, split three ways. The lease is month to month and will end in June, when the legislative session ends. Ms. Niou’s dog, Samson, is another sometimes tenant. Political differences are rare and slight. Ms. Biaggi said she had not decided whether she supported term limits. But she was leaning toward doing so, she added, earning a high-five from Ms. Ramos, a fervent supporter. Of the three, Ms. Ramos is the least chatty, the serene counterweight to Ms. Biaggi’s and Ms. Niou’s sometimes frenetic energy. She sleeps and wakes early; the other two prefer to stay up late and sleep in. (That has helped them divvy up time in their lone bathroom.) Ms. Ramos devotes time each day to calling her sons, who are 5 and 7 years old. “Thank God for FaceTime,” Ms. Ramos said of the iPhone app. Ms. Biaggi, who is getting married this summer, shook her head in admiration. She said she could not imagine balancing a pregnancy with being in office. “Now, if the Legislature had child care …” For now, the women said, they were having trouble even finding time for themselves. On that particular night, three of the apartment’s rooms were completely bare, save a trapeze of ceramic pots hanging from the ceiling. Ms. Niou and Ms. Biaggi had spent the previous night sitting on the floor of their empty study, discussing predatory loans. Plastic-wrapped Ikea pans sat on the stove, untouched. The refrigerator held almond milk, vegetable chips, grapefruit sparkling water and not much else. “What’s missing is the kombucha in my car,” Ms. Biaggi said. One of the women pitched the idea of a housewarming party, before furniture arrived to clutter the living room. The invitation list would include their fellow new young senators, with whom Ms. Biaggi and Ms. Ramos have an active group text message. “Before we have a budget?” Ms. Ramos said with a laugh. Definitely, the others said — they would need a break after so many long days. Ms. Niou interjected. “Well, as long as you guys are helping me clean after.”",The New York Times
2019,30 People Treated at J.F.K. After Flight Hits Severe Turbulence,"For about nine hours, Sead Nikaj’s flight back home to New York from Istanbul was smooth. But as the plane was crossing over Maine on Saturday, it hit a patch of severe turbulence, he said. Mr. Nikaj said he watched the woman next to him fly out of her seat. Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. People banged their heads, screamed and prayed. For about 10 to 15 minutes — but what felt like an eternity to Mr. Nikaj — he thought he was going to die. “I said, ‘God help me,’” he said. The Turkish Airlines plane landed safely at Kennedy Airport, but at least 30 people were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries because of the turbulence, the authorities said. One flight attendant broke her leg, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The rest of the injuries were minor, and included “bumps, bruises and cuts,” Mr. Coleman said. But the turbulence left the plane cabin full of bloodied and shaken passengers. Several ambulances rushed to the airport as the plane landed, in a chaotic scene that Mr. Nikaj said he keeps replaying. He said he would never fly again. “I’m done with it, I’m definitely done with it, experiencing what I experienced today,” he said. In a statement, the airline said it was “deeply saddened by this unfortunate experience” and that it was closely monitoring the health status of the injured passengers. The flight, number 001 and a Boeing 777 plane, encountered the turbulence about 45 minutes before it landed at 5:35 p.m., the authorities said. Mr. Nikaj said he was returning from a trip to Albania, where his parents live. He said that when the plane went through a small patch of turbulence about 40 minutes before landing, passengers were directed to put on their seatbelts. Then a second, larger burst of turbulence seemed to come out of nowhere. “It was crazy, really crazy,” Mr. Nikaj said. “All that time, people are screaming, people are praying. It was like something that I never experienced.” The pilot then announced everything was under control, and 10 minutes later, the plane landed, Mr. Nikaj said. “Until we parked it, I couldn’t believe we were alive,” he said. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the pilot had declared an emergency and reported that several passengers were injured. Several ambulances arrived at the airport, and 30 people were taken to local hospitals, mostly to the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Mr. Coleman said. “It was crazy,” said Sonali Saili, a wheelchair dispatcher who saw passengers being rolled across the terminal floor on stretchers to a line of emergency vehicles outside. “There were people with broken limbs and bandages.” Mr. Nikaj said the people with the worst injuries were let off the plane first. “There were a lot of wounded people,” said Andrew Kotounis, a Terminal 1 skycap who saw people from the flight trickling out through the departures area, most on foot and some on stretchers. He said he heard waiting family members of the Turkish Airline passengers describing frantic phone calls from the plane. Mr. Nikaj said he drove home his wife and children, who had met him at the airport, and then drove himself to a hospital. He thought he had injured his chest trying to help the woman next to him who had flown out of her seat. Turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to passengers and flight attendants, excluding fatal accidents, according to the F.A.A. In 2017, 17 passengers and members of the flight crew were injured in turbulence, according to the F.A.A. In 2016, that number was 44. Since 2002 the highest annual number has been 94, in 2009.",The New York Times

2019,32 Tips for Surviving (and Parenting) Crying Babies on Planes,"Crowdwise CreditCreditGraham Roumieu [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] Flying with an unhappy child is no fun for anyone, everyone knows that. But it wasn’t until I asked you for your tips, tricks and traumatic tales of babies on planes, that I realized I didn’t know exactly how many different victim groups were involved. The kids are in misery. The parents are dying a thousand deaths from shame and frustration. The flight attendants suffer stress. And everyone else on the plane is either irritated or graciously pretending that they’re not. The stories you shared could fill a book, to be shelved under either humor or horror: “I have a four-year-old, which is akin to having a monkey-cat hybrid,” wrote Wren West. During a departure delay, her son became a thrashing wild man. “If it didn’t cost $600, I would have just asked to be taken off the plane right then and there,” Ms. West noted. “I bet all 100 passengers would have pitched in.” Matt Hubbard’s son was on his shoulders at baggage claim as he approached his parents, who had come to greet the flight. “Just as I was able to catch their eye,” he wrote, “my son threw up all over the top of my head, covering my glasses.” On a recent flight, the woman sitting across from Roxann Steinberg “took a urine-soaked cloth diaper off her baby and wrung it out onto the carpeted aisle floor. She then put the ‘dry’ diaper back on the baby and resumed her magazine reading.” Whether you’re a parent, a baby or someone trapped in the same flying metal tube with them, help is at hand. While you’re still in the airport, don’t break out the electronics, Lesley Golkin wrote. “Move around, talk, eat, play games. Don’t sit still until you have to!” And hit the bathroom. “You want brand-new diapers and empty bladders all around,” she said. Many fliers board early, at the “traveling with small children” announcement. Brandon R. Cornuke, however, takes the opposite approach; why endure more time on the plane than necessary? “Wait until the last minute, overhead space be damned.” Or, if you’re traveling with a fellow parent, steal Julie Murrell’s idea: “One parent boards early and stows baggage. The other parent boards last, giving the little ones maximum time to work off some energy.” Oh — and bring balloons. “Uninflated balloons don’t weigh anything and don’t take up any space,” noted Gwen Wong. During one delay at the airport, “we inflated the balloons, and instantly we had a fun game of knuckle volleyball. One of my better ideas.” “A window seat is a must,” wrote Gina Sitaraman. (She undoubtedly means for your child.) Jessie Keyt tries to get the bulkhead (front) seats, “so you can set up a little play area, with a blanket on the floor, out of the way of other passengers.” When Debbie Ettington’s daughter was just old enough for her feet to reach the seat in front of her, “we chose seats that put one parent in front of her and one beside her. It was much easier to be the one whose seat was kicked than to deal with unsympathetic fellow travelers.” Ear pain from the changing cabin atmosphere is a frequent cause of crying or fussiness. Louise Joy’s best trick: “Have a bottle or drink ready — or breast feed — when you are taking off or landing. Drinking helps the baby or toddler clear their ears.” Carry lollipops; the sucking and swallowing relieves pressure problems, too. (And, as Alyson Cahill wrote: “They can also be used as bribes. Yup, I said it.”) Some things to bring on board with babies are obvious, like plentiful snacks. And if your youngsters are explosion-prone, bring extra clothes (for them and for you). But here’s a frequently endorsed suggestion: A time-release goody bag. “I would always buy a few very small gifts, toys, etc. and wrap each one separately. Then I’d give one to my little boy every hour or two. Kept him entertained all the way,” recalled Chrissie Hill. For her two small sons’ gifts, Amy Howard used lots of tape, which, she wrote, “added time to the unwrapping.” (Upon reaching the destination, she’d rewrap the same items but swap recipient sons. Sneaky!) What should these little gifts be? Puzzles, goldfish crackers (Ms. Howard); animal figures, books (Alexandra Matus); games, crayons (Jim and Ria Wallmann); dollar store items, Happy Meal toys (Katie Ryan-Anderson); and Matchbox cars and magnets (Beth Josolowitz) are all good suggestions. Plenty of passengers get peeved at parents when the kids are upset, but here’s a news flash: The parents already know. If you’re that parent, expressing your own self-awareness can work wonders. On a recent flight, a young couple handed, to my wife and other nearby passengers, a baggy containing apologetic tokens like candies and chocolates. A note read: “Hello! We’re twin baby boys on our first flight! We’d like to apologize in advance if we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. We hope you have a great flight!” Similarly, when her daughter was a baby, Amy Adams Harding handed out earplugs. “That simple gesture seemed to diffuse the dismay of those unlucky enough to get seated near a lap child.” Most of your suggestions for surviving toddler transit terror involved supplying distractions. Of course, there are always phones or tablets, but electronics aren’t the only options: Pipe cleaners. “They can be twisted around fingers, pens and other objects to make instant, unique toys that can be straightened and repeatedly recreated,” wrote Vicki Lee. “Fold under the wire ends to avoid sharp pokes.” Ms. Josolowitz brought Cheerios as well. “My son and I threaded the pipe cleaner through the Cheerios to make a (partially) edible bracelet.” Ice cubes. A flight attendant suggested this one to Deborah Fels: Put some ice cubes into a couple of airline cups. “Little kids are usually fascinated with the movement, sound and the visual of ice and clear plastic.” Sticky things. Many of you mentioned the miracle of mild adhesive. Ruth Martins: “Painter’s tape provides endless entertainment (stick it on your nose, make a bandage, create a road for a car), doesn’t leave residue and is disposable.” Victoria Wilson: “Band-Aids.” Her two-year-old “spent at least an hour methodically taking each one out of the box, carefully unwrapping it and then moving onto the next. Worth every penny.’” Lisa Bain: “Post-it notes. Tell your toddler it’s her job to decorate the window, the tray table, the seat back, your face, whatever. Have her scribble something on each note and stick it up.” Ramona Layne: “Bring a sticker book they’ve never seen before.” Soapy things. On one international flight, Megan Wyatt walked her almost-two-year-old to the bathroom. “He pumped the foamy soap, squealed with delight as he lathered up, rinsed and walked back. Walk, lather, rinse, walk back, repeat. For 11 hours.” Beth Martin went with shaving cream. “Hoist him onto the sink and let him finger-paint on the mirror. It worked like a charm and cleaned up easily.” (Speaking of the bathroom: Once Laurel Braun made it there with her hysterically crying son, the engine drone “calmed him right down. It was like magic.” It also makes a superb soundproof booth of last resort.) You, dear readers, seem polarized on the topic of slipping your offspring a sleep-inducing medicine like Benadryl — even when your pediatricians made the recommendation. Apparently, the concern isn’t the moral principle of drugging your child; it’s that Benadryl sometimes makes kids wired, not tired. “Our 18-month-old ‘lap child’ spent the flight running up and down the aisle of the plane,” remembered Carrie Stewart. Dozens of you wrote not of pipe cleaners and shaving cream, but of understanding. “Being supportive to parents in their worst moments, when they have no control over their environment, should be the norm, not the exception,” noted Catherine Pearlman. Indeed, many readers described deriving pleasure from chatting with young seatmates (Dina A. Gamboni); exploring the pictures in the airline magazine with them (Sandra Wilde); playing peek-a-boo through the seat cracks (Barbara Mohon); or making puppets from the airsickness bags (Daria Gideos). Ms. Joy goes even further. “Help the parents out. Watch one of the kids while the parent takes the other to the bathroom. Help with the overhead bin.” Less stressed parents, she notes, often leads to happier kids, too. Dozens of people wrote that they still remember these kindnesses years later. (Regina Ottman, in fact, wishes to post a personal ad here. “If you were on that flight from Vietnam/Korea to Newark Liberty International Airport in June 1999 and offered to hold a tired baby so her parents could rest: We have thought of you often over the years, and we wish you every blessing!”) Finally, one last recommendation for harried parents, supplied by Ariane Le Chevallier: “Have one glass of wine or one cocktail. One takes the edge off. Two makes you leave things on the plane.” In the next Crowdwise: What are some of the wisest — or worst — words of wisdom anyone’s ever told you?

2019,36 Hours in Hoi An,"This ancient town on the Vietnamese coast has charm, history and beauty to spare. It is also budget-friendly, and for foodies, a delight. Situated on the coast of central Vietnam, the former commercial port of Hoi An offers endless wonders, from fishermen launching bamboo basket boats along palm-fringed beaches, to farmers in conical hats harvesting rice in swathes of green paddies. But the marquee attraction is the well-preserved ancient town, brushed mustard yellow and festooned with colorful silk lanterns. Many of the wooden merchant houses and ornate temples and assembly halls — a fusion of styles from China, Europe and Japan — date back to Hoi An’s prime in the 1700s. By the early 1800s, though, the river port was supplanted by Danang to the north, and largely forgotten. Unesco World Heritage site status in 1999 boosted a revival, and in recent years mass tourism has landed hard, with multitudes of tour buses and resorts. Still, Hoi An holds plenty of charm, with budget-friendly prices and a vibrant gastronomic scene. Many of the narrow, two-story shophouses have been repurposed with restaurants, cafes and a glut of tailor and leather shops. But several have been frozen in time and opened to tourists, like the two-century-old Tan Ky house. Start your old town tour here (120,000 dong, or about $5.15, for entry to five of the more than 20 historic sites), and roam its 100-foot length, past intricately carved columns and beams, through the open-roof courtyard, to a wall in the back, marked with the height of fall floods. Next up is Phuc Kien, one of five assembly halls built by Chinese merchants to plot trade deals and honor ancestors. Its sea goddess temple holds an unforgettable life-size statue of an aquamarine-skinned immortal with protruding ribs and bulging white eyes. End up at the Japanese covered bridge, an arched pagoda built in 1593 and later reconstructed by the Chinese and Vietnamese. Its roof is adorned with the town’s ubiquitous alternating rows of yin yang tiles. 2) 3 p.m. Silk row Spinning and selling silk to foreign traders was a thriving business in Hoi An centuries ago. Now the transactions occur inside more than 600 tailor shops. The quality and fit can be hit or miss. (Bring a favorite garment to be copied and allow time for alterations; turnaround is within 24 hours. My wife was thrilled with silk pants, 940,000 dong each, from Le Le Cloth Shop.) If you’re more interested in the silk-making process, stop by Thang Loi for a tour and watch how silkworms munch on mulberry leaves and create cocoons that yield nearly 1,000 yards of thread, woven on a clacking loom. Since he first traveled to Vietnam 27 years ago, Didier Corlou has been on a mission to promote its cuisine through his cookbooks and restaurants in Hanoi. Now the renowned French chef is serving up his passion in Hoi An at Co Mai. Opened last year with his co-chef wife, Hoang Phuong Mai, the restaurant fittingly occupies a former spice house. The tasting menu (395,000 dong) is your best bet for a bounty of “Hoi An on the plate,” as Mr. Corlou puts it. Recently, the fresh and flavorful mains of braised pork, Saigon Marseille curry and barracuda in banana leaf followed starters like banana flower salad with chicken, and fried rolls with mackerel and pork and mushroom. Save room for the dessert tray that includes mango sorbet and banana cake with caramelized cream. The town starts to shut down around 9 p.m., but a few bars stay open late. Watch boat owners coax tourists onto the river from the curbside tables at Shamrock Irish Pub, which features a craft stout from Saigon’s Heart of Darkness brewery, or shoot pool to classic rock at the Dive Bar on Nguyen Thai Hoc street. The closest thing to a speakeasy is Tadioto, a new whisky bar in the French Quarter. It’s hidden behind An Store clothing boutique, which leads to Tadioto’s sushi counter in the stone courtyard and then to the elegant bar in the back. Sip Tadioto’s namesake scotch (180,000 dong) or Suntory’s Hibiki (250,000 dong). Open till midnight. (Nguyen Qui Duc, the owner, is set to open a Japanese grill and beer garden next door in the spring.) Most hotels and home-stays include bikes, so cycle out to the rice paddies between the town and the beach and marvel at acres of green patched with shrimp and fish ponds. Ride along sandy paths under canopies of coconut trees, past lolling water buffalos and farmers ushering flocks of ducks into narrow canals. Pull into the Tra Que Vegetable Village, organic gardens where you can take an 8 a.m. tour and learn how to till the sandy soil and plant red leaf lettuce before sampling just-picked greens at breakfast in the shade of the outdoor cooking school and cafe. The waiters will show you how to assemble a roll of rice-flour-and-egg pancake with mint, lemon basil and lettuce. Tour and breakfast 280,000 dong. A starter kit for escaping into the world. Coffee in Vietnam is a sit-down affair, often on a sidewalk at child-size plastic chairs and tables. For a delightful twist on the traditional condensed milk iced coffee, take a seat riverside at Cong Caphe, with its Communist army décor, for a coconut-milk-and-cream coffee smoothie (45,000 dong). For a more refined coffee break with larger chairs, try Mia Coffee amid a low-slung row of French colonials on Phan Boi Chau street. Le Quang Huy, the owner, sources beans from the mountains of Dalat, roasts them on site and compresses cappuccinos (37,000 dong) and traditional Vietnamese brews (30,000 dong) with a machine from Seattle. Hoi An is known for several local dishes like white rose dumplings and chicken rice. Most emblematic of its multicultural past is Cao Lau — with the flavors of Japan in the thick rice noodles, China in the soy pork and France in the rice flour croutons. Try it at Hoi An Market. Barnlike, it stretches from the river, where a riot of tables loaded with papaya and dragon fruit lead to the raw meat counters inside, then to stalls loaded with incense and spices, and women napping on benches (it opens at 6 a.m.) The main hall is filled with about 60 brightly lit glass hutches stocked with spring rolls and plates of orange shrimp. Perch at the metal counter at No. 50 and plop fresh greens into a bowl of cao lau spiced with red chili paste. Lunch for two 150,000 dong. Take a truncated tour of Vietnam’s ethnic communities at the Precious Heritage Museum, opened in 2017 by the French photographer Réhahn. He spent eight years traveling to 53 of the country’s 54 ethnic groups, photographing villagers and collecting costumes, including a tree bark jacket on display upstairs. The free museum in the French Quarter is also a gallery of Réhahn’s portraits, on sale as postcards for 30,000 dong, up to large, metallic paper prints for tens of thousands of dollars. If he’s there, he’ll share the backstory of his most famous shot, “Hidden Smile,” a close-up of a puckish woman in a conical hat covering her forehead and mouth with her hands. The portrait was presented to President Emmanuel Macron of France by Communist officials last year. On most mornings the subject, 80-year-old Bui Thi Xong, is on the river in Hoi An (near Cargo restaurant) offering rides in her row boat. Even if you didn’t mean to, you may find yourself in one of Trinh Diem Vy’s eight restaurants in and around the old city. Definitely make it to Vy’s Market. Its food-court-meets-street-cart setup has 200-plus traditional dishes, from steamed pig brains to monk fish curry. Try the beef rolled in betel leaves (105,000 dong) and the pumpkin curry served in the gourd (85,000 dong). As tasty as those are, do not miss the squid stuffed with pork (175,000 dong). The meat is minced with mushrooms and spring onions and peppered with spices, and the pan is caramelized by the fried squid skin. After dinner, step into the side street and Hoi An’s main night market. Zigzag through the banana pancake carts and shuffling tour groups, to a row of stalls alight with silk lanterns. Make your way across the footbridge (mind the bikers pedaling through the throngs) to a small square with elevated bamboo huts where locals gather for a sort of singing bingo. On certain nights, you’ll find families curbside at metal drums burning fake money and other offerings for ancestors. Every night, you’ll find touts offering river rides. For 120,000 dong for 15 minutes, step into a little wooden boat, join the flotilla and watch an oil painting come to life, the profusion of lanterns on the boats and river bank reflecting on the dark, crinkled water. Within a half-hour drive of the ancient town, you can ride a basket boat through river channels thick with water coconut trees or climb the steps of the Marble Mountain into caves with towering Buddhas. This being a beach town, why not just relax at Tan Thanh Beach? Not as busy as An Bang Beach to the north, this stretch of sea and sand is mesmerizing with a moderate surf, and view of the Cham Islands on the horizon. You can’t go wrong with a coffee or a smoothie at Salt Pub or Sound of Silence, where you can use the lounges and thatched gazebos and on a clear day see the skyscrapers of Danang in miniature up the coast. Some of the best discoveries are along the narrow walkways off the ancient town. That’s where you’ll find Nu Eatery, just west of the Japanese bridge, in a distressed looking former house with three small rooms and a balcony for dining. Phuc Ngo honed his craft at restaurants in New York City before returning to Vietnam in 2014 to open Nu. He calls it modern Vietnamese, which like American food, is “a mix of everything,” he said. That produces delectable dishes like avocado salad with sweet potato, fried egg and lima beans; vegetarian rice with charred eggplant, mustard greens and mushrooms, and steamed buns with pork belly, pickles and spicy mayo. Lunch for two, 270,000 dong. Through Airbnb you can find a charming room in one of Vietnam’s ubiquitous homestays, where local families open several rooms in their homes for visitors. You can book one with a balcony and en suite bathroom for $20 to $30 a night. Escape the Ancient Town crowds on the edge of farmland north of the town off Hai Ba Trung or along a tributary of the Thu Bon River east of town. Near the sea, where prices are a bit higher, you can’t go wrong at Tan Thanh Beach. Steps away from the historic core, Ha An Hotel mimics the heritage streetscape with double doors, arches and balustrades fronting handsome and cozy rooms decorated with local pottery and prints. Open since 2003, with 24 rooms, doubles start at $65. In a shophouse 200 years old, Vinh Hung 1 Heritage hotel is perhaps the only place where tourists can stay in the ancient town core. But its six spacious, wood-plank rooms will likely be booked months in advance. Doubles cost about $100. For some tropical bliss with stunning views, book a seafront room at the Victoria Hoi An Resort. Built in 2000 between the river and the sea, its breezy main building and 109 ample rooms blend French colonial and Asian architectural styles, with pitched, beamed ceilings and dark wood floors. Doubles start at $140. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE We have a new 52 Places traveler!

2019,36 Hours in Rio de Janeiro,"A weekend in this ever-surprising Brazilian city might include caipirinhas on the beach; capuchin monkeys on a hike; and music, food and history everywhere. To come to this sprawling, dynamic Brazilian city without preconceptions, whether they’re about bikinis or President Jair Bolsonaro, is just about impossible. But Rio constantly finds ways to surprise — whether it’s a friendly resident walking you to a shop you just can’t find; sobering evidence of the city’s slave trade; or the discovery that food tastes best standing on a sidewalk surrounded by the lyrical sound of Portuguese and accompanied by a beer so cold it’ll make your fillings hurt. From beach to museum, church to market, Rio is a city constantly defying its own myths and encourages visitors to join in with unbridled enthusiasm. Brazilian cuisine leans heavily on meat and seafood, so it’s a pleasure to find vegetarian food that’s neither fried nor boring. Naturalie is open only for lunch, and its menu (much of it vegan and gluten-free) makes good use of local produce like manioc and coconut. Salads come with a bright pink beet dressing; there’s a rich stew known as feijoada that replaces meat with tofu; and fresh juices are crammed with passion fruit, hibiscus and goji berries, and — unlike their lunch-counter counterparts — they aren’t full of added sugar. It’s carefully considered, unfussy dining that just happens to be vegetarian. Lunch for two, around 100 reais, or about $26. The South Zone of Rio is home to the tony neighborhoods of Ipanema and Copacabana, which also have the best beaches: stretches of pristine sand bordering gentle waves. Pick up a bathing suit at Blue Man, a decades-old Brazilian brand of swimwear that produces eye-catching bikinis, one-pieces and briefs in colorful parrot and pineapple patterns (prices start around 150 reais). Swing by Osklen, another well-known Brazilian brand, which sells elegant T-shirts in linen and silk. They recently developed a line of clothing printed with images from the work of the pioneering Brazilian artist Tarsila do Amaral (an exhibition of her work was at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City last year). At Monica Pondé, just around the corner, pick up brushed silver necklaces with geometric flair (Ms. Mondé, the designer, studied architecture), and grab a petit noir coffee from the adjacent cafe: the beans are collected from the droppings of the jacu, a native bird that ingests only the very ripest beans, and the resulting coffee is rich and full-bodied. Make a final stop at Toca do Vinicius, a shop for music lovers, where all the vintage records and newly released CDs are bossa nova and samba. Pavão Azul (blue peacock) is an excellent spot to kick off an evening. Packed with an after-work crowd vying for seats or standing around small tables, this place is famous for its pataniscas: fried balls with chunks of cod and slivers of onion, and served with extra-cold beer. If you’re feeling brave, try the vodka-coconut mix poured out of a Smirnoff bottle — it’s made in-house and is equal parts delicious and potent. Then stroll north to Galeto Sat’s, a casual spot with just a dozen tables and, behind the bar, rows of spring chickens roasting on giant skewers over the flames. Start with a basket of the famous garlic bread, buttery and liberally doused with garlic bits, add a plate of juicy, bite-sized chicken hearts, then round off the meal with the roast chicken. Dinner for two, around 120 reais. Bip-bip is coming up on 60 years in spite of the fact that it’s the kind of local bar that seems to be actively discouraging new customers. The only seats are occupied by the musicians and regulars, and the beer — a selection of mediocre Brazilian brands and cans of Heineken — is in a refrigerator in the back from which you have to help yourself. The music, though, is worth twice as much hassle: Expect to find a group of eight or so playing and singing samba and bossa nova with passion. That passion is shared by the onlookers, who dance, sing along (quietly) and snap their fingers in applause. The longtime owner, known to all as Alfredinho, passed away a few weeks ago, but the music plays on. The Santiago Calatrava-designed Museum of Tomorrow (admission, 20 reais) opened with great fanfare in 2015. Inside, the exhibits are mostly virtual — hundreds of towering screens, some with interactive games, and an IMAX-style film — but the content itself focuses more on the nature of community, sustainability and disaster-forecasting than on futuristic imaginings. The exterior and the grounds of the museum are, perhaps, even more impressive. Stroll around the water features, admire the audacious architecture (it’s been compared to everything from a spaceship to a crocodile), and then head to the Museu de Arte do Rio (admission 20 reais) across the plaza. This dynamic museum has a frequently changing collection of work by mostly Brazilian artists. Make sure to visit the roof, from which you can see, across the way, a portrait blasted in stone on the side of a neighboring building by the Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, known as Vhils. Afro-Brazilian history and the slave trade in particular is an integral yet understudied part of the country’s heritage. Spend a few hours exploring its legacy, starting with lunch at Angu do Gomes. This restaurant first opened in 1955, serving angu, a hearty polenta and meat stew with African roots (lunch for two, around 150 reais). From here, walk to Valongo Wharf, a Unesco Heritage Site, which was the arrival point for almost a million slaves, most from West and Central Africa. The wharf itself had been covered over and was only rediscovered amid preparations for the 2016 Olympics. Not far from here is Praça XV. There’s not much to be seen now in this huge space except a boat-ticketing office and some skateboarders, but it was once the site of massive slave auctions. The Instituto de Pesquisa e Memória Pretos Novos (open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., free admission), is a small but sobering museum about the slave trade built atop a cemetery — you can still see bones exposed in the ground. Rather than join the crowds lining up to board the cable cars to the top of Pão de Açúcar, head to the mountain’s base instead. The Claudio Coutinho trail is bordered with steep slopes and trees populated with families of capuchin monkeys on one side, and waves crashing against enormous rocks on the other. After you’ve broken a sweat, stroll in the other direction around the peninsula (or take a short taxi ride) to Bar Urca, a longtime neighborhood landmark dishing out crispy pastries stuffed with meat, bobó de camarão (a creamy shrimp dish), icy beers and fried balls of bacalao (snacks and beer for two, around 130 reais). Take your goodies and join the locals perching on the sea wall across the street, with the water susurrating beneath you and small boats floating nearby. The Leblon neighborhood, home to some of the city’s best bars and restaurants, is getting trendier by the day. Stop in at Mixxing for a pre-dinner drink; the cozy bar usually has both a D.J. and a handful of loyal customers who deeply appreciate that the drinks — many invented by the bartenders and incorporating ingredients like a ginger foam with the texture of heavy cream — are some of the cleverest cocktails in town. Dinner is at Oro, which got its second Michelin star in 2018. Felipe Bronze, the chef, has created tasting menus of modern Brazilian dishes that recently included granulated tapioca with shrimp and chayote, gnocchi formed from cured egg yolk, and a starter of sweet potato bread with smoked catupiry butter. Dinner for two, 670 reais. Stick around Botafogo for the night, strolling from bar to bar. Start with a sidewalk table at WineHouse, a small spot with many local wines on the menu, including a few by the glass (try some Brazilian sparkling wine, which is having a moment). Then head to CoLAB, a hip spot that’s part bar, part cafe and part venue. Expect craft A.P.A.s and wheat beers on draft, live music, and a youthful, talkative crowd at the communal tables. Nearby, Comuna has sandwiches, drinks and chilled-out electronic music perfect for whiling away the wee hours. Each Sunday at 10 a.m., the 17th-century Mosteiro de São Bento (free) welcomes a full house for its mass, which includes impressive Gregorian chanting. Inside, the spectacular church is filled with gold; a series of arches leads to an elevated platform where the monks sing and preach in turn. You can follow along with the Portuguese using the free pamphlet which lays out the program. It’s strange that even in a city with such a racially diverse population, all the statues in the church have light-skinned faces. Spread out along the side of the Paris Park every Sunday morning, the Feira da Glória is one of the city’s best, most colorful food markets. Pick up a late breakfast or early lunch of tapioca pancakes stuffed with melted ham and cheese, a box of sliced pineapple, sugar cane juice or sushi, and stroll down the line of stalls whose owners loudly advertise their colorful arrays of fresh greens, fruit, spices and flowers. At one end there’s pet fish and a secondhand market of old clothes, and live music (that may include a band of highly skilled drummers) is common. Copacabana might be so famous as to be almost a cliché, but it’s still one of the best city beaches in the world. Quiosques, or kiosks, dole out draft beer, caipirinhas and bags of Globos (crunchy rings made from manioc starch) right on the sand, groups of men in tiny swimsuits play hands-free volleyball, vendors sell sarongs emblazoned with the Brazilian flag, and everyone’s there to have a good time. A 10-minute walk south is Arpoador Beach, where you’ll often see surfers floating on the water like sea gulls waiting to catch the perfect wave. If you’re here around sunset, join the groups climbing the rocks at the eastern end of the beach for the best views. There are plenty of Airbnb options in Rio; a one-bedroom is often available for less than $50 a night (depending on the season). Botafogo and Flamengo are central neighborhoods positioned between the southern beaches and the cultural offerings of the northern section of the city. The clean, spare Praia Ipanema (doubles start around 490 reais, including breakfast) is as close as Rio hotels get to the beach, which is just across the road. All rooms have balconies and superior rooms have ocean views. The hotel has a beach stand with free chairs and towels. Halfway between the port area and the South Zone, the funky, Philippe Starck-designed Yoo2 (doubles start at 270 reais, including breakfast) has a prime location for city exploration. The small rooftop pool has great views of the Christ the Redeemer statue in one direction and Botafogo beach in the other. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in St. Augustine,"On northern Florida’s Atlantic coast, the past is present in this centuries-old city, where history, beachcombing and Southern treats like butter pecan milkshakes are celebrated in equal measure. If you think the Sunshine State is all about theme parks and frying on the beaches, you probably haven’t been to St. Augustine. In the oldest, continuously occupied European settlement in North America, visitors get the glorious beaches along with a healthy dose of unexpected delights: Spanish colonial and Moorish-style architecture, interesting museums and history galore. Founded as a Spanish colonial outpost in 1565 — 55 years before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock — the Ancient City feels vaguely European, albeit with better air-conditioning. It’s also a distinctly American place where you can indulge in a butter pecan milkshake; explore the city’s 144-block Historic District on foot or bike; and, if you’re willing to step out of town for a few hours, play the imposing 17th island green that the world’s best golfers will navigate at the upcoming Player’s Championship in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach. The water at the city’s fabled Fountain of Youth might not transport you back to your salad days, but there’s enough magic on St. Augustine’s brick streets to make you a believer. 1) 3 p.m. Magic waters We’ll never know for sure whether Juan Ponce de Léon was looking for the Fountain of Youth when he sighted what he thought was an island north of St. Augustine that he named “La Florida” or “Place of Flowers” on Easter Sunday, March 27, 1513. In any case, you can visit a site near to where Ponce landed that’s been referred to as the Fountain of Youth for more than a century. In 1909, Luella Day “Diamond Lil” MacConnell, a Chicago physician who made a fortune during the Klondike Gold Rush, began to market “Fountain of Youth” water that some maintain was from a well dug in 1875. At first drink, the Ponce de Léon’s Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park might seem kitschy. But the lush 15-acre park overlooking the Matanzas River and St. Augustine Inlet is actually a delightful and informative place to pass a few hours among the majestic live oak trees and preening peacocks. The $2.50 Fountain of Youth spring water bottles sold in the gift shop make a great souvenir, but be forewarned, the “magical” water tastes pretty foul. (Note: what looks like a snack bar in the parking lot is an excellent place for lunch — Smoked Southern BBQ, run by a James Beard-nominated chef.) In 1586, the Englishman Sir Francis Drake and his crew of 2,500 buccaneers raided the city, burning it to the ground. A series of subsequent pirate raids led to the construction of the Castillo de San Marcos, a massive stone fortification (that also happens to be a magical place to watch the sunrise). Continue your history lesson at the easy-to-miss St. Augustine Pirate & Treasure Museum (877-467-5863), tucked away on a side street. It brings to life St. Augustine’s back story, and the stories of pirates like Captain Kidd, who had to be hung twice, because the noose snapped the first time. Founded by Pat Croce, the former president of the Philadelphia 76ers, the museum also includes entertaining tours led by Capt. William Mayhem, an Air Force vet who is a real character ($14.99 adults;$7.99 children; tour included). In the heart of the Historic District, you’ll find The Floridian restaurant, with indoor and outdoor seating on quiet Spanish Street, which is lined with moss-draped live oak trees. Chef Genie McNally specializes in Southern comfort foods and healthier alternatives to the usual suspects. Try the cheddar-and-veggie stuffed cornbread, topped with blackened fish and a chimichurri aioli drizzle. Dinner runs about $20 to $30 without drinks. Tucked away on a side street in the Historic District, tiny Cousteau’s Waffle & Milkshake Bar is a veritable graveyard for New Year’s resolutions. Order a superb, hand-spun butter pecan milkshake with maple syrup, candied pecans and bourbon whipped cream ($6.49) and savor it as you take a long stroll. Pedestrian St. George Street is full of life, but for a quieter look at some beautiful Spanish and British colonial style buildings, venture south of Plaza de la Constitution to Old Town and linger on Aviles Street, the nation’s oldest street, where you’ll find galleries selling local art and handmade crafts. St. Augustine is no place to skip breakfast. For an excellent selection of baked goods and a spot of live bluegrass music, head to the outdoor St. Augustine Amphitheater Farmers Market (8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturdays), where you can pick up everything from seafood to souvenirs and plenty of quick bites, including great vegan and gluten free muffins at Hugo’s. If doughnuts are your thing, hustle over to Swillerbees before they run out of the Hey Shorty, with chocolate frosting, Nutella and crumbled shortbread cookies ($2), or Miami Vice, a cream cheese and guava jelly mess of a treat. For less sweet fare and what may be the best café con leche north of Miami, the Cuban-American La Herencia Café on Aviles Street, serves the Guajiro — an open-faced omelet over Cuban toast, topped with black beans, roasted pork, salsa and Romano cheese, with a side of sweet plantains ($12). Take the 45-minute tour of the opulent Spanish Renaissance-style Hotel Ponce de Léon and admire the grand lobby with its 68-foot domed ceiling and the old dining room’s 79 Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass windows ($12 adults, free for children under 10.) Then walk a block to the Villa Zorayda Museum ($10 adults, $5 children 7-12, free 6 and under.) Franklin W. Smith, a Boston hardware merchant, was a traveler, and his stunning Moorish Revival Style home, a one-tenth-scale reproduction of a portion of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, is dripping with antiquities from around the world. The audio tour is full of great yarns, none better than that of the museum’s Sacred Cat Rug, a 2,400-year-old cat hair rug found by Nile fisherman in the tomb of an Egyptian princess. The rug depicts a large cat that is said to curse anyone who walks on it. According to the audio tour, a dead cat appeared on the doorway after the rug was removed for cleaning several years ago, reinforcing the legend of the curse. The Players Championship is one of the most lucrative golf tournaments in the world. The Players Stadium Course, where the tournament takes place just outside St. Augustine, is a lush green nirvana, even for nongolfers. Outside tournament time, docent “storytellers” will take you on a free golf cart tour around the course. Among other sites, you’ll see the notoriously treacherous 17th hole, with its island green, where more than 120,000 errant balls are retrieved from the lake each year. After the tour, have lunch on the veranda overlooking the 18th hole at 19. Try the grilled grouper tacos ($17) or the delightfully creamy and rich butter chicken ($16). The words “reasonable” and “fresh seafood” don’t coincide often enough near Florida’s beaches, but they do at the Mango Mango’s Caribbean Grill & Bar on St. Augustine Beach. The menu is eclectic, the prices are reasonable and the vibe is pass-the-hot sauce friendly. The stuffed corn cakes are pure magic but save room for the richest, most delectable peanut butter pie you’ve ever had, a bargain at $5.99. Afterward, resist the urge to turn in early, and play air hockey at Sarbez!, a dive bar and grilled cheese sandwich emporium with live music and craft beers aplenty. What started in 1893 as an improvised attraction where tourists waiting at a train stop paid to see locally captured gators, has evolved into one of the country’s oldest zoos: The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park, which claims to be the only one that features all 24 crocodilian species. You can take a zip line over a lagoon habitat, and see an extraordinary array of exotic birds, reptiles and mammals. Save time to become acquainted with Maximo, a beast of a crocodile from Australia who is nearly 16 feet and 1,250 pounds. It took almost a year to convince the farm he grew up on — which raises crocodiles to make handbags — to agree to sell his lady friend, Sydney, but his mood improved considerably once they were reunited in their Florida habitat. Treat yourself to an indulgent Southern brunch on the wraparound porch at Preserved Restaurant in the heart of the Lincolnville neighborhood. Set in a Victorian home once occupied by Thomas Jefferson’s great-granddaughter, Preserved is run by Brian Whittington, a James Beard-nominated chef who transformed a minimarket into one of the city’s best restaurants. The Mayport shrimp and grits, warm scones with jam, and roasted oysters are all outstanding. Expect to pay about $20 for brunch. History buffs should linger in the neighborhood, which was settled by freed slaves and played a significant role in the Civil Rights movement. The first stop (#101, 79 Bridge Street) on the ACCORD Freedom Trail walking/driving audio tour — described as “the first medical/dental office constructed in St. Augustine without racially segregated waiting rooms” — is just a block from the restaurant. (Dial 904-335-3002 and enter each stop number to hear commentary.) Pick up a shark tooth identification guide at one of the many local shell shops and head to Vilano Beach. Anastasia State Park has softer sand and is a better spot for swimmers, but Vilano is a local favorite that’s ideal for surfing. When the tide is turning out, comb the shore for fossilized shark teeth. With a little patience, you’ll go home with the ultimate souvenir. Opened in December 2018, the Embassy Suites St. Augustine Beach Oceanfront Resort is a comfortable resort on a lovely stretch of beach. Children will love the oceanfront pool, and there are plenty of recliners and fire pits, perfect for stargazing during the free nightly cocktail and hors d’oeuvre hour. Rates start at $169 for a double room. In the Historic District, try the uniquely designed Collector Inn (from $189), built on a cluster of nine landmark buildings dating to 1790, or the Casa Monica (from $193), a luxury hotel in an extraordinary Moorish Revival style building built in 1888 by Franklin W. Smith, the owner of Villa Zorayda. If you’re looking for a vacation rental, check for listings near the beaches, particularly in St. Augustine Beach and Vilano Beach, where rates start at $100 a night for no-frills cottages and go up from there, depending on size, proximity to the beach and season.

2019,36 Hours in St. Barts,"This tiny Caribbean paradise has almost fully rebounded from a devastating hit by Hurricane Irma; for visitors, that means endless beach-going, eating, drinking and shopping. Arriving in St. Barts can feel like a near-death experience: A pilot’s hand tugs an overhead lever and the puddle-jumper noses down sharply, the crest of a hillside dotted with red-roofed villas suddenly visible through the open cockpit door. Moments later, the plane sails just above the tourists perched on the ridge below, and then lands, with a thud, in paradise. The reward for this harrowing flight — usually from Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico or nearby St. Martin — is a craggy-but-lush oasis ringed by white sand and turquoise water. Too rugged for large-scale agriculture, the longtime French possession was a colonial afterthought, flipped to Sweden in 1784 for trading privileges in the port of Gothenburg. Returned to France nearly a century later, the island is more Marseille than Malmo, with the ruins of Fort Gustaf overlooking the main harbor among the few reminders of the island’s Scandinavian past. St. Barts recently survived a near-death experience of its own. In 2017, Hurricane Irma roared in with sustained winds just shy of 200 miles per hour, racking up €800 million, or about $900 million, in insured damage — a staggering average of €80,000 per resident. But with help from famous interlopers like Jimmy Buffett as well as its own funds, St. Barts started getting on its feet within months. Now, nearly all of the hotels are back online, with two luxurious stragglers — Eden Rock and Le Guanahani — set to reopen by the end of the year. With renovated restaurants, reconstructed roads and a rotating cast of festivals celebrating everything from movies to music to boats, this island gem has regained its luster. The Mini Cooper has replaced the venerable Mini Moke beach buggy as the vehicle of choice here, so rent the convertible version at Sixt’s airport counter (about €90 per day with insurance) and take a loop of the island. At just under 10 square miles, that can be accomplished in under an hour. So pick up a straw hat (and, perhaps, crafts that range from beaded bracelets to carved turtles) at the Black Swan boutique in the quartier of St. Jean. Then follow the harrowingly narrow main road to the wild east side, making a pit stop for foie gras frites (€12) at the cliffside hotel Le Toiny, where you can lounge poolside and soak up views that stretch a few dozen miles to St. Kitts and Nevis on a clear day. Watch for speed bumps as you cruise the main road that edges the coast past the rocky beaches of Grand Fond, and over the central hills to the harborside town of Gustavia. For a sense of history and colonial architecture, visit the tiny Wall House Museum, where a recent exhibition explored the island’s Swedish heritage. The building itself is a stony colonial relic; inside its centuries-old confines, artifacts on display range from traditional costumes to sailors’ sextants. The promenade parallel to Rue de la Republique in Gustavia, which feels more like a collection of oversized dollhouses than an actual city, is perfect for a sunset stroll. St. Barts has no sales tax, which might make a shopping expedition to places like Dolce & Gabbana a viable option. Move along to nearby Shell Beach, a favorite both for champagne-sipping adults and conch-crazed children. Then head to Bonito, which feels like a combination French bistro and Peruvian cevicheria set on an East Hampton veranda. Spend dusk at the bar — perhaps the island’s best perch for yacht-watching — and try the Beauty & The Beast (€24), an old-fashioned that’s wrapped in a dry ice science experiment, and the guacamole-laced crispy tuna ceviche (€31). Forget the Caribbean caveats: You’ll have a tough time finding a better restaurant than Orega anywhere. There’s delight in every detail, from the fuzzy white wash cloths that spring like caterpillars from a platter when you’re seated to the jaunty curve of the wine glass that contains your yuzu lemongrass palate cleanser. Spring for the omikase menu; the highlight is a decadent toro uzu topped with truffle, caviar and gold leaf. Expect to pay about €150 for dinner. A less extravagant alternative sits across the street — the fishy favorite Eddy’s Ghetto, where for about one-third the price, you can dine on beef or wahoo (ask to sit in the garden). Many in St. Barts say Jimmy Buffett, who has kept a home on the island for decades, wrote his song “Cheeseburger In Paradise” about the indoor-outdoor saloon Le Select; the singer, a frequent patron, recently told The Times otherwise. Regardless, what claims to be the oldest bar in St. Barts is a favorite of local dominoes players and tourists alike, with offerings from Heineken by the can (€2.50) to Moët by the bottle (€60). The €4.50 burgers are among the best values on the island. The billionaire steel magnate Roman Abramovich paid a reported tens of millions of pounds for a 70-acre spread overlooking Gouverneur Beach on the island’s south side. His view can be yours for €50 per hour with a guided hike from St. Barth Essentiel’s Hélène Bernier (stbarthessentiel@yahoo.fr). She’s gotten permission to roam the private land with the freedom — and agility — of a mountain goat. Try to keep up with her as you clamber to a ridge with sweeping views of St. Barts and its neighbors; along the way, she may introduce you to peeling red “tourist trees,” a joke on sunburned visitors. Afterward, take a dip on the beach, a blissfully uncrowded arc of white sand. Don’t let fumes from the main road deter you from dining at Jojo Burger, adjacent to Lorient Beach. Grab the signature sandwich (€17; €22 with Pat LaFrieda beef), and try not to get tired of the repeating reggae cover album soundtrack. For a musical reset, walk across the street to the flower-festooned cemetery that serves as the final resting place of Johnny Hallyday. The “French Elvis” owned a home on St. Barts and died near Paris days after Hurricane Irma. Drive 10 minutes from bustling Lorient over the spine of St. Barts and you’ll arrive at an untamed treasure: Saline Beach. At the top of the rocky path from the parking lot, you’ll be greeted by a carpet of white sand tumbling down the dunes into the sea. Bookended by rock walls on either side, Saline offers few signs of civilization — perhaps that’s why many tend to enjoy the beach au naturel. Respite from the sun can be found at Grain de Sel, an unpretentious beachside cafe a few minutes away by foot. Snack on fish or goat stew for about €20; your server may surprise you with vanilla or ginger-infused rum. Once a bohemian oasis where visitors were welcomed by an aggressively friendly parrot named Cooky, Tamarin has been reimagined as a swank cocktails-and-dinner spot. Warm wood and backlit palm trees give the place a vaguely Polynesian feel — drop in for a burrata plate (€29) or a Fleur De Paradis cocktail (€16), and have a quick rally at perhaps the island’s only proper Ping-Pong table. Cooky, a little mellower these days, may serve as umpire. For an elegant seaside supper, try Maya’s, whose Martiniquan namesake and her American husband launched the restaurant in 1984. Don’t be surprised if either shows up to recite the menu, which changes every night, but always includes dishes with a seafood tilt. A recent meal included a mango and tomato appetizer and delectable dorade for about €50. (The restaurant is only open for dinner, but lunch enthusiasts can snag picnic snacks during the day at Maya’s To Go, possibly the world’s most opulent bodega; across the street from the airport, the shop offers lobster pasta (€100 per kilo) and 2009 Cristal champagne (€270 per bottle). Part restaurant, part club, part cabaret, Le Ti St. Barth feels like the rum-drenched love child of Cirque du Soleil and “Pirates of the Caribbean.” Skip the table service, come early and snatch a free table by the bar. Order a €24 martini that comes with a champagne shot and tastes like cotton candy Pop Rocks. Should you find yourself needing to match the performers’ elaborate costumes, orange-feathered headdresses can be procured at the gift shop. Start your day the French way, with a café and pain aux chocolat (€1.30) at La Petite Colombe. There are two locations on the island — the one in the west hills is generally less crowded and offers a thin slice of sea views — other pastries include a plump caramel tartlet (€5) and the chocolate éclair (€3.80). Colombier Beach, a white-sand gem with perfectly clear water, is only accessible by boat (from Gustavia) or by a mountainous footpath. During the steep hike, you’ll find ample shade and, if you’re lucky, families of wild goats frolicking among the cactus. Bring snorkeling equipment and meet the striped fish zipping around the rocks on the east side of the beach. (If you want to swim with sea turtles, try Grand Cul de Sac Beach on the other side of the island). If you’re still sweaty from the Colombier return trip, stop by Flamands Beach for a quick dip. You can show up in a bathing suit at Chez Rolande, a Creole joint where scrumptious menu items flicker in and out of availability. Don’t be fooled by the laid-back vibe: From conch gratin (€25) to minced beef (€24), you’ll find some of the island’s best food here. This is as good a place as any to try a local favorite: the banana flambée (€8). Several years ago, local opposition forced hotelier André Balazs to abandon plans for an eco-lodge near Saline Beach. Travelers yearning to stay near the wild strip of sand can still enjoy jungly seclusion at Salines Garden Cottages (Route de Saline; 590-690-419-429; salinesgarden.com; summer from €110, winter from €200). Operated by a retired pro surfer and his wife, the tiny hotel is a series of standalone studios with surfing themes. Wrapped around a communal pool, living room and outdoor breakfast nook, it’s a mercifully flat walk from three restaurants and the beach. Hotel rooms on St. Barts can run €1,000 per night or more, but reasonable luxury can be found at Le Village (St. Jean; levillagestbarth.com/contact-inquiries; summer from €185, winter from €280). Founded in 1968, the hillside hotel is just a five-minute walk from St. Jean Beach and has attracted guests from the Vanderbilts to Greta Garbo. There is an on-site pool, exercise center, spa and Le Patio, a converted restaurant that now serves as the hotel’s private breakfast porch. While half of the island’s 800 villas are controlled by the local outfit Wimco Villas, options are also available via Airbnb and VRBO. You can book a two-bedroom for around €500 per night in convenient Gustavia or seaside Flamands. But there’s a wide variety online, from €160 per day for a one-bedroom bungalow in the central hills to €14,500 for a Gouverneur estate with six suites, a fitness room and Hermès toiletries.

2019,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. BOB & WRAY: A HOLLYWOOD LOVE STORY at Film Forum (March 15-April 2). A companion series to a new book, “Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir,” by Victoria Riskin, this retrospective honors the author’s famous parents. The screenwriter Robert Riskin gave us an abundance of Frank Capra classics, including “It Happened One Night” (on Friday, Saturday and April 1), “Lost Horizon” (on Saturday, Sunday and March 28) and “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town” (showing Sunday through Tuesday). Fay Wray’s beauty killed the beast in the 1933 version of “King Kong” (on Saturday and March 23-25) — an impressive feat considering that in the same year she faced other frightful circumstances in “The Mystery of the Wax Museum” and “The Vampire Bat” (showing together on March 24 and 29). Most films will play as double features, and Victoria Riskin will introduce select screenings. 212-727-8110, filmforum.org CARIBBEAN FILM SERIES: A 5TH ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL at BAM Rose Cinemas (March 14-17). The subject matter of this year’s series encompasses both the Caribbean itself and the Caribbean diaspora. The Brooklyn-set “Panorama: Jamming to the Top” (on Saturday) trails members of a steel-pan band as they practice for an annual competition. “Being Blacker” (on Friday) follows Blacker Dread, who opened a music store that became an important local institution for Londoners of Afro-Caribbean descent. 718-636-4100, bam.org CRISPIN HELLION GLOVER at IFC Center (March 18-19). Perhaps still best known for playing Marty McFly’s awkward dad in “Back to the Future,” Glover spent the 2000s refashioning himself as an outsider auteur, with the result being these two unclassifiable curiosities. “What Is It?” (on Tuesday), which is substantially cast with actors who have Down syndrome and features blackface and apparently unfaked snail killings, is calculated to offend and completely unwatchable. But the subsequent “It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine” (on Monday), written by Steven C. Stewart, who appears in “What Is It?” as a man being sexually pleasured in a clamshell, at times has a sensitive undercurrent. Borrowing its structure from “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” it depicts the sexual fantasies of a man (Stewart) with cerebral palsy — fantasies that sometimes end in murder. Staying far away is an understandable response, but Glover, who will present what he calls the “Big Slide Show” at each screening, doesn’t let these otherwise-unavailable U.F.O.s out often.212-924-7771, ifccenter.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] INFRASTRUCTURE ON FILM at Anthology Film Archives (through March 28). While this retrospective may not have the sexiest title — and, yes, it does feature documentaries on the construction of the autobahn (“Reichsautobahn,” on Friday and March 22) and the interstate highway system (“Divided Highways: The Interstates and the Transformation of American Life,” on Friday) — it offers a heady collection of movies that concern the social, political and economic implications of how humanity moves. The minimalist filmmaker James Benning observes trains across the United States in “RR” (on Saturday); Bernardo Bertolucci’s documentary “The Path of Oil” (on Wednesday and March 23) traces its journey from the Middle East to Europe; and Frederick Wiseman’s “Canal Zone” (on March 24) is an essential chronicle of incongruities during the United States’ control of the Panama Canal Zone. 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org",The New York Times
2019,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. BAM AND TRIPLE CANOPY: ON RESENTMENT at BAM Rose Cinemas (through March 28). The theater collaborates with the magazine Triple Canopy for this brief but wide-ranging exploration of antipathy onscreen — and in particular, movies in which anger boils over into rebellion. The theme is explored through the lenses of domestic discord in Iran (“A Separation,” on Saturday), an allegorical boarding-school uprising (“If ….,” on Sunday), poverty and worker mistreatment in the Philippines (“Manila in the Claws of Light,” on Sunday), the Maze prison hunger strike in Northern Ireland (“Hunger,” on Monday), and race-based violence in a dystopian version of Britain (“Welcome II the Terrordome,” on Tuesday). 718-636-4100, bam.org HARMONY KORINE at the Metrograph (March 22-31). Korine was only 22 when Larry Clark’s “Kids” (on Monday and Tuesday), for which he wrote the screenplay, became a cultural flash point because of its depiction of sex and H.I.V. among New York City teenagers. He was only 24 when Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, declared his feature directorial debut, “Gummo” (on Sunday and Monday), the worst film of 1997 (with two and a half months to spare). Whether Korine should be seen as a juvenile troll or a bold fringe artist has continued to be a subject of debate, with “Trash Humpers” (on Friday and Saturday), a VHS-shot provocation that chronicles the antics of a group of wrinkle-masked mischief makers, offering the best evidence for both positions. The delightful “Spring Breakers” (on Friday and Saturday) opened a path to mainstream appeal, a direction Korine heads further down with his new stoner comedy, “The Beach Bum,” starring Matthew McConaughey and opening on March 29. 212-660-0312, metrograph.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MADE IN HARLEM: FILMS OF MADELINE ANDERSON at Shepard Hall, City College of New York (March 28, 6:30 p.m.). For women’s history month, the Maysles Cinema and the Documentary Forum, a center at City College, will present three short films by Anderson, who will participate in a Q. and A. after the screening. “Integration Report 1” (1960) examines the state of school integration in three cities; “A Tribute to Malcolm X” aired on TV two years after the civil rights leader’s assassination; and “I Am Somebody,” from 1970, documents a strike in 1969 by workers at a Charleston, S.C., hospital. 212-537-6843, maysles.org WHAT THE FEST!? at IFC Center (through March 24). This newish festival highlights contemporary movies that have a focus on horror and other outré happenings. Emma Tammi’s “The Wind,” showing on Friday and scheduled to open on April 5, is not, as cinephiles have speculated, in any meaningful sense of a remake of Victor Sjostrom’s 1928 silent masterpiece “The Wind,” but a horror film that nevertheless — like that Lillian Gish classic — foregrounds a female protagonist (Caitlin Gerard) against an unforgiving landscape. There are also recent selections from the Sundance Film Festival: “Greener Grass” (on Friday) was received at that event as an off-kilter sendup of suburban living, while “Hail Satan?” (on Sunday) is a very funny documentary on the philosophy and political activity of the group that calls itself the Satanic Temple.212-924-7771, ifccenter.com",The New York Times
2019,4 Stops for a Women-Focused Visit to Seoul,"trending A tragic death and the #MeToo movement have sparked an increase in dialogue about women’s issues in the South Korean capital. International Women’s Day has taken on a new significance in South Korea, as the country in recent years has seen a groundswell in activism geared toward improving women’s rights. A brutal murder of a 23-year-old woman three years ago, as well as the #MeToo movement, touched off a national dialogue aimed at breaking down a traditionally male-dominated society. These events also galvanized a new generation of activists — many of whom are now leading protests and building safe spaces for women to gather and speak freely in Seoul. For women planning a visit, or visitors interested in women’s issues in Korea, here are some destinations that offer a dose of history and contemporary culture along with an urban stroll or cup of coffee. Most Seoulites might direct you to the famous Seodaemun Prison to learn about the Korean independence fighter Yu Gwan-sun. But a lone monument at the Itaewon Village Shrine Historic Park honors her memory in a significant, albeit understated, way. The monument, established in 2015, explains in brief the role Yu played in a peaceful 1919 demonstration against Japanese colonial rule, later known as the March 1 Movement. Yu died one year later, from suffering injuries in prison, and is often seen as a martyr for Korea's independence. As the Itaewon Public Cemetery holding her plot was destroyed by Japanese colonists in 1921, and this year marks the 100th anniversary of the protest, there’s no better place or time to pay homage to a young woman whom many compare to Joan of Arc. Itaewon Village Shrine Historic Park, in the Yongsan-gu district, is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It also overlooks the neighborhood of Itaewon and offers a panoramic view of the city. The War and Women’s Human Rights Museum shares the history of the Korean comfort women, the women and girls forced into sexual slavery by Japanese forces during World War II. Depending on where you’re standing, a mandatory audio guide may play back narrated anecdotes from survivors, or provide history lessons on the women’s fate or the societal pressures that kept them from speaking out. The museum also makes efforts to address crimes against women internationally, including those against Vietnamese comfort women by the Korean military during the Vietnam War. A particularly memorable exhibit within the museum is “The Wall of Appeal,” a memorial of bricks inscribed with personal messages from the women expressing dreams and despair. One brick reads, “I want to be a hope for women suffering from the same pain to mine.” The War and Women’s Human Rights Museum was established in 2012 by The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, with support from other civil-liberty groups. Located in Seongsan-dong, Mapo-gu, the museum is open Tuesday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. The library, gallery, cafe and counseling center called Doing is the realization of a decades-long dream for its founder, Ryeoil Kim. Ms. Kim, 52, was inspired by a Korean feminism wave of the 1980s and is unique in today’s community of activists, who are much younger. In the wake of the murder in 2016, when a young woman was killed in the Seoul neighborhood of Gangnam, Ms. Kim believed that an environment was needed for women to have a chance to gather and speak safely. She opened Doing in 2017, and welcomes everyone in the community. “Once you become a feminist, everything is exhausting,” she said. “I want to make sure people can rest here.” Events at Doing range from serious to lighthearted. The venue hosts weekly debate clubs, monthly seminars and film screenings and the occasional party. Doing, located in Samseong-dong, is open Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. At the Woolf Social Club, coffee drinks and niçoise sandwiches are served and lively debate is welcomed. The owner Jina Kim said she first read Virginia Woolf’s “A Room of One’s Own” as a student, but it resonated differently after the death in Gangnam. “When I was younger, I never truly understood what Woolf meant by a woman’s need for 500 pounds and a personal space,” she said. “Rereading the novel, I realized how necessary it is for a woman to have her own space.” With feminist books on display, the cafe hosts several discussion groups monthly, focusing on women’s issues in Korean society. Ms. Kim describes the cafe as “a space where women can comfortably raise their voice, feel safe and eat delicious food.” The Woolf Social Club, located in Yongsan-gu, Hannam-dong, is open most days from noon to 10 p.m. It is closed Wednesdays.

2019,4 Tips to Fly a Budget Airline Without Hassle,"Travel Tips Budget airlines often trade space and even basic amenities for crowded planes and cheaper tickets. With these four tips however, you can save some cash and even enjoy the trip. I’m a recent convert to budget airlines, even though I may have once thrown a tantrum at the Ryanair check-in counter when they charged me 40 euros for forgetting to print out my boarding pass. Frequent fliers may turn up their noses when they hear I’ve traded miles toward Delta Platinum status to fly airlines that have suggested charging passengers to use the bathroom while flying at one point, possibly removing seats to make passengers strap up and stand for the duration of the flight, and the ever-evolving hidden fees on others. For the most part however, low budget international carriers like Norwegian Air and Wow Air have managed to work out the kinks, in my view, to make flying low budget worthwhile. Here are some tips to fly on a budget and deplane with your sanity intact. Budget airlines don’t fly year-round to the same locations. Instead they open up chunks of time when you can book a flight to certain destinations. That also means people looking for a deal to a specific place all have to book — and travel — at the same time. Twice a year, I travel to Cork, Ireland to see family. It had become expensive to take two trans-Atlantic trips with multiple legs. So, once those March to October Cork flights on Norwegian Air opened up, I booked a $300 dollar leg from Rhode Island immediately for a July visit. It was a couple hundred dollars more to book a flight from Georgia to Rhode Island. If you’re looking for similar deals, do some research on when the “high season” is in the place you’d like to visit. That same flight, also five hours longer because of the longer layover and flying past Ireland to Amsterdam for the connection, was nearly $1,400 dollars on KLM. If peak flight and travel season for, let’s say, Iceland is May to September, look out for $99 Wow Air flights for January. Reykjavik, or any new location, is fun, no matter the time of year. Just bring extra sweaters. No one wants to stand in front of the check-in counter shifting headphones and chargers from the carry-on to your backpack, then to your checked bag just to avoid weight or size limits. Just pay for the bag. (Or read the fine print before you book, and be prepared to travel light!) If you’re traveling with someone, though, remember that budget airlines usually charge you for baggage on each leg. That means one person can pay for a checked bag or carry on, while the other books an economy seat with no add-ons. That’s at least a hundred dollars in baggage fees saved. But what that also means is that one of you, the person who didn’t pay for a carry-on or checked bag, sometimes will have to pay a little extra to sit next to your flying partner. For example, JetBlue doesn’t charge you to choose an economy seat. Spirit Airlines charges begin at $5 per leg. Norwegian Airlines begin at about $12 dollars. Most of the time, it costs about $6 to $15 dollars to choose your seat with this basic price, and you two can choose seats simultaneously and end up next to each other on the flight. Most people automatically associate budget airlines with uncomfortable seats. Sure, they may not be as plush as airlines with bigger planes and more amenities, but I haven’t been on an uncomfortable budget flight in a long time because I keep an eye on the seats. Here’s what I mean: When you first book, book toward the back of the plane. It may sound counterintuitive, but because everyone always seems to want to be up front (maybe they think it’s quicker to get on and off the plane, even though it usually isn’t), even though the seats are all the same. Plus, unlike bigger airlines, I haven’t been on a budget flight leaving the United States in a long time that was booked completely and sold out. Where are those empty seats, you ask? In the back, with me. Also, if you’re traveling with someone, book the window and the aisle. No one likes the center seat, so your odds are higher someone just won’t book it — and if they do, you can always offer them the aisle or window so you can sit together. Who would refuse? Budget airlines are much smaller operations than their large, international counterparts. Reaching someone via Twitter direct message or Facebook message can be pretty easy. No one answered my question via email on an overnight flight to Europe, so before we took off I sent a message to the airline on Twitter. By the time I landed, I had the information and confirmation number for the shuttle transfer I needed upon arrival. Khushbu Shah is a freelance journalist.

2019,40 Stories From Women About Life in the Military,"At War Across the armed services, women made up 16 percent of the active-duty military as of 2017 — by branch, that number ranged from 8.4 percent within the Marine Corps to nearly 20 percent within the Air Force. Their representation is small and growing only marginally — in 2007, women in uniform made up 14.4 percent of the force — and their stories tend to be ignored in favor of legacies left by men who have shaped the narrative of service to country. Despite being overlooked, servicewomen are forging new career paths for themselves and the next generation as they enter jobs that were once closed to them. Consider pioneers like Capt. Rosemary Mariner, who was one of the first female Navy pilots in the 1970s and the first woman to lead a naval aviation squadron. She died in January from ovarian cancer, and her memory was honored last month with a flyover using all-female pilots. Or First Lt. Marina A. Hierl, who in 2018 became the first woman in the Marine Corps to command an infantry platoon. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] For International Women’s Day, The Times asked servicewomen and veterans to send us the stories that defined their experiences in the military. We left it to them whether to share their accomplishments, the challenges they faced or something unforgettable from their time in the military. Below is a selection of the more than 650 submissions we received. Chief Petty Officer Stella Sierra-Chierici, Navy, 1999-Present I am a jet engine mechanic on the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Not many women or men will ever get the opportunity to do what I do. It’s been tough at times throughout my career to have men tell me they will not work for me because I’m a woman. I say to them: “That’s O.K. You don’t have to follow me, but I will bring you along.” Melissa R. Grayce, Air Force, 1988-98 When I was stationed in Germany, I was part of a group that wanted to use a recreation center to hold meetings for Wiccans. My letter to the editor, printed in Stars and Stripes, began a journey in which I became a representative for witches’ rights in the military. I still have my dog tags, which indicate my religion as Wiccan. J Gayle Gaymon, Navy, 1972-75 I decided to enlist during the Vietnam War. My cousins, who were also my close friends, were being drafted and volunteering for other branches to avoid the Army draft. I was afraid that they would not return. So I decided that if they were going, I was going too. Petty Officer First Class Liberty Law, Navy, 2004-Present In 2006, a male shipmate got into my barracks room and placed a camera in my bathroom and set it to record. I found it only after getting out of the shower. I took the camera to my male chief, whom I had known for only about a month. He assured me that he would get to the bottom of it. By lunchtime, the strange looks from everyone became obvious. Another shipmate told me that everyone in the company office had passed the camera around and saw the video of me naked, getting into and out of the shower. Staff Sgt. Ruth Navarro, Army, 2006-Present I come from a Hispanic family and am the only woman in my family to have joined the Army. I didn’t tell them I was enlisting until the day I left. I was very young and was afraid they would try to talk me out of enlisting. I know I deeply hurt them, but thankfully, they’ve since come to support my decision. Rear Adm. Wendi Bryan Carpenter, retired, Navy, 1977-2011 As some have said, if we put on our flight boots, we were often becoming a “first” at something. I was the first female Navy pilot to instruct in the T-44 Pegasus trainer for the advanced maritime prop pipeline. I was one of the first female instructors in the EC-130 aircraft for “Take Charge and Move Out” squadrons. I was also among the first mission commanders and maintenance check pilots. I was among the first female aviation assignment officers. I was the first female naval aviator to be promoted to the rank of one-star and then two-star admiral in the Navy. I was the first woman to command the Navy’s Warfare Development Command. Staff Sgt. San Juanita Escobar, Texas Army National Guard, 2007-Present I am currently Mrs. Texas Galaxy. When I was a National Guard recruiter, I came across many young women who said they couldn’t join because they were too “girlie.” So I started to compete in beauty pageants again to prove that you can still be and feel beautiful and follow any career path you want. Petty Officer First Class Jean Coriat, retired, Navy, 2004-18 In 2004, I had orders to be stationed on the U.S.S. Fitzgerald, which at the time was stationed in San Diego. When my ship finally pulled in, I found out I was the first female enlisted sailor to ever be stationed onboard. They didn’t even have a place for me to sleep. [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Capt. Ja’Mia Rowland, Army, 2003-Present I have served for 16 years in the National Guard, Reserves and on active duty, and I have become accustomed to being the only person in the room who looks like me. My greatest accomplishment was taking command and deploying over 125 troops into combat and bringing them all home safely to their loved ones. I don’t think there is anything that will ever compare to that. Nicola Hall, Army, 2000-5 In early 2002, I deployed to Afghanistan with the 21st Military Police Company (Airborne). The infantry was facing issues running combat patrols because the local women were hiding intelligence, weapons and high-value targets. It would have been cultural warfare for the male infantrymen to search these women. They needed a “high-speed female” to go on combat patrols and missions with them — and I was selected. My unit treated me no differently because I was a woman. I was referred to as “Hall.” I was a leader, a paratrooper and I smoked the hell out of some of those men. Lesley-Anne Crumpton, Army, 2010-18 In 2015, I assisted with the integration of women into Ranger School for the first time in history. These efforts helped to change the combat exclusion ban on women in direct ground combat and ushered in the opening of all positions for women in the armed forces. My job was very controversial. I was part of a group of servicewomen attached to the three phases of Ranger School and walked the lanes with the Ranger students. Three women completed the course, and I personally got to watch one of them ace her leadership patrol and lead the pack like it was second nature. Florence Shmorgoner, Marine Corps, 2014-Present In 2015, I was sexually assaulted, and I waited until 2017 to report it because I was scared that I would not be believed or, worse, that I would be deemed a “troublemaker” in my platoon. It took about a year for the whole process to end. I was fortunate enough to go to counseling and see a psychologist and was found to have depression, anxiety disorder and PTSD — all stemming from the assault. I struggled with my self-worth more than I would like to admit. Many days, I contemplated suicide. Not because I felt like a burden but because the pain I felt every day was nearly unbearable. To this day, I still have nightmares of the assault. But I have found peace, which I have learned is all that matters. Julie Ballard Squires, Navy, 1982-94 The day I re-enlisted, my daughter, Jessica, who was not quite 2, was in attendance and decided that she did not want to sit with my friend. My commanding officer told me to bring her up, so I did. We re-enlisted together, which was wholly fitting because I had recently gotten divorced, and Jessica was the reason I chose to stay on active duty. Sgt. Joelene Schwebke, Army, 2012-Present After graduating from college in 2008, I really wanted to serve in the military. Unfortunately, this meant I would have to hide that I am a lesbian. At the time, being openly gay in the service was forbidden. In 2011, my recruiter called me back and told me that the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy had been repealed. I joined the Army in late 2011, and I was fortunate to have a wonderful drill sergeant, who made me feel comfortable during basic training and didn’t treat me differently. He made a point to let me know he wouldn’t tolerate any discrimination toward me. Mary-Elizabeth Pratt, Coast Guard, 2015-2019 After Hurricane Maria, I was deployed to do recovery operations in eastern and central Puerto Rico. The amazing resilience of the Puerto Rican people couldn’t compare to anything I had ever seen before. There was a woman about my age (I was 22 at the time) with a very young baby. I asked her how old she was, and she said the infant was about 4 weeks old — meaning she had been born either during or in the days after the hurricane. I can't imagine having a baby without a doctor, running water or electricity. But there she was, showing me her beautiful baby girl. Staff Sgt. Kate Cole, Army, 2008-Present I served in the Army for nine years as someone else. About two years ago, I was able to start serving openly as a transgender woman. I’ve faced discrimination since I’ve come out and lost some friends, but it has been worth it. I’ve gained a lot personally and professionally and have become part of a community that is open and willing to embrace change. I’ve had several soldiers tell me I’ve changed their views on not only transgender service members but also female service members being in combat arms. Kristi Farmer-Hudson, Air Force, 2002-14 I deployed to Afghanistan for eight months when my first child was only eight months old. My family was stationed in Germany at the time, and because my husband was also active duty, he had to take our daughter to the United States, so our family could care for her. Our daughter spent four months in Georgia with my husband’s family and then five months in New Jersey with my parents. My mother brought her back to Germany when she was 18 months old. Shanon Lavin, Navy, 2014-18 While I was a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, I founded the first official dance team. The team has since doubled in size and performs at N.C.A.A. football and basketball games. Sgt. Virginia Jones, Marine Corps, 2014-Present Despite being recognized as one of the best Marines in my unit, I’ve been stalked, harassed, doxxed and assaulted. Still, I’ve volunteered to teach young Marines early in their careers about how to treat all Marines with respect. I am very vocal about bringing awareness to the misogyny that is rampant within the military, especially the Marine Corps. I love Marines, but I do not love everything that myself and other Marines have been through. Tech. Sgt. Holly Ward, Air Force, 2006-Present On all three of my overseas deployments, I was the only woman on my team. I lived separately, usually farther away from daily meeting points. I was left behind on major movements, forgotten about and asked to form up over an hour before my male colleagues, simply because I was a woman and lived elsewhere. On one deployment, my team forgot to notify me that we were leaving the country the next day. It turned out the announcement had been made in the male barracks only. I made the flight, but it still stung that I learned the information secondhand. I chose at that moment to dedicate my career to fighting for better inclusion. Megen Schlesinger, Army, 2008-19 I took company command within the Army Special Operations community, and many of the men under my command had never worked with a female soldier before. On my first day, I had to tell my new battalion commander that I had found out the day before that I was pregnant with my first child. Rather than make me feel obligated to apologize for the “inconvenience,” he congratulated me, without hesitation. As I navigated pregnancy and new motherhood, my team was supportive and embraced me as a member of their brotherhood. When my command came to a close, my command sergeant major, who has over 15 years in Special Forces, made a point to tell me, “Ma’am, you’ve changed the way I feel about women in the Army.” Michelle Sacco, Coast Guard, 2006-Present I originally wanted to be a rescue swimmer, but I was told by my recruiter that I was too small and wouldn’t be able to save anyone, despite my swimming abilities and career as a lifeguard before I enlisted. I was then misled into taking a job I didn’t want to do. After five years with no guidance or mentorship, I switched to an entirely new profession within the Coast Guard and started over. I am now preparing to take the test to make chief petty officer — a goal that I almost gave up. Micki Duran, Marine Corps, 2006-17 I cherish my time in the Marine Corps, but there were many challenges, especially as the first female officer at my first unit. Once, during a meeting about a fun physical-fitness event we could put on for Marines, someone insinuated that I could be a “cheerleader.” Another time, I sent a researched and thoughtful email to my peers about how to address a group consisting of many men and one woman. Later, at an alcohol-fueled unit event, a peer and his wife both yelled over the bar noise that despite that email, I wasn’t a “bitch” after all. Anne Krause, Air Force, 1990-99 I graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1990. Every time I met a woman who graduated from the academy in the previous decade, I thanked her for paving the way for me. It never really dawned on me that I was helping to blaze the trail for others until I went to an air show with my family many years later. I sought out the Thunderbirds’ executive officer (the position I once held) to say hello. The first thing she said to me was, “Thank you for paving the way for me.” That remark caught me by complete surprise. I remain inspired to climb with one hand while extending the other to help another woman up. Sgt. First Class Winnie Moore, Army Reserve, 1999-2003; Army, 2003-5, 2007-Present I remember one day my company all took the Army’s physical-fitness test and a few people failed it. One woman could not do a single push-up or sit-up, but she passed the run. Usually these types of failures are sent home. As a drill sergeant, I asked for her to be placed in my platoon and said I would work with her. She went from zero to 25 push-ups and 65 sit-ups. I truly felt like a proud parent. Sgt. Ashley Romaniello, Marine Corps, 2013-Present I was originally kicked out of the Marine Corps for being openly gay. I returned in 2013 after the “don’t ask, don't tell” policy was repealed, and I redid recruit training all over again. I was part of the second class of women to graduate as an infantry rifleman. I choose to live and work in a very open and honest way, so I can pave the way for other L.G.B.T. service members. If I can protect even just one, I’ve done something meaningful. Capt. Helen Perry, Army, 2011-16; Army Reserve, 2016-Present I remember dropping my phone when they called to tell me that my husband, Matt, an active-duty Marine, had a seizure and his heart had stopped — the result of a traumatic brain injury he received in Afghanistan. I remember the first time I watched him seize and the color of his lips as they turned an ominous shade of blue. I held his hand, despite the fact that he couldn’t remember my name, or his name, or the year, or his family. The doctors told me his memory would come back (it never did). I remember the feeling of resentment as my senior leader advised me to get a divorce when I asked for a compassionate reassignment, so that I could get Matt to a hospital capable of taking care of him. I remember the frustration I felt as the Department of Veterans Affairs told me I didn’t qualify for the same benefits as civilian spouses do because I was active duty. I remember the feeling of desperation when I was so burned out and depressed that I didn’t think I could handle another day. I remember the feeling of victory when I made it through that day, and then the next, and all the hard days after that. Lt. Col. Kimberly Ford, retired, Air Force, 1990-2016 I was the first African-American woman to fly the C-17 Globemaster in the Air Force. I earned the Air Medal for support of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo. The biggest challenge I faced was being among the fewer than 1 percent of Air Force pilots who are African-American women. I had mentors from all walks of life throughout my career who have supported me and encouraged me, including Lt. Col. Bill Holloman, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed African-American aviators from World War II. Staff Sgt. Nakita Goad, Marine Corps, 2010-Present Sept. 14, 2012, will always be a day I remember because my base, Camp Bastion, was attacked and every Marine dropped their wrenches, grabbed their rifles and brought the fight to the enemy. I’ve never been more proud of those Marines than I was on that day. After that, it seemed as though we all had this unbroken bond that we would be able to talk about only with one another. It’s not much, but it’s something I won’t forget. Susie Spriggs, Air Force, 1973-75 I was in the first wave of female aircraft mechanics to arrive at Fairchild Air Force Base. One of my biggest regrets in life is getting out so soon. I was only a mechanic for a year when they phased out the aircraft I was trained on, so I went into administration. Kristi Anthony (Simonis), Marine Corps, 2010-14 I unfortunately didn’t accomplish much in the military. I was treated pretty terribly in my unit. Hazing and predation were prevalent. Being a woman in the military is basically signing a sexual assault/harassment contract. It will be constant. You will be mistreated, judged, harassed or assaulted because you have a vagina in a world full of penises. One “mistake” can take away years of work that you’ve put in. I say “mistake,” in quotation marks, because that “mistake” could be reporting sexual assault that actually happens. Then you’re labeled a snitch. The man who assaults you gets to brag about it, while you’re the liar. Gunnery Sgt. Elizabeth Inglese, Marine Corps, 2000-12; Marine Corps Reserve, 2013-Present I was the sole graphic designer for the 100th anniversary commemoration of the Marine Corps Reserve. My design work appeared across the United States, including in Times Square, in the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, at the Navy Memorial Museum in Washington, as a permanent exhibit installed at the Pentagon and as the official donation box design for the 2016 Toys for Tots campaign. Maj. Sharon Waddell, retired, Army, 1983-2003 At my first duty station, I was told that I shouldn’t be there and that I was taking a slot from a man who was trying to support his family. A wife once yelled at me not to sleep with her husband when we were in the field. I wanted to tell her not to worry — had she seen how disgusting her husband was when he was in the field? At times I had to thwart the advances of senior officers and others, while also fighting the perception that I was a lesbian. When I reported a commanding officer for sexually harassing a soldier in front of the entire company, I was removed from my job, while the offender received a letter of concern in his restricted file. I still felt it was my duty to do the right thing, no matter the consequences. Col. Janet Holliday, retired, Army, 1998-2018 I enlisted in the Army in 1988 as a broadcast journalist and was commissioned as an officer in 1992. I served both in the Signal Corps and the Adjutant General Corps. I was the first female commander of the garrison at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania and the first female commander of the Army’s Marketing and Engagement Brigade at Fort Knox in Kentucky. In Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2012, I met my future spouse, Col. Ginger Wallace of the Air Force. At the time of our marriage in 2015, we were the highest-ranking dual-military couple to enter into a same-sex marriage. Ashleigh Bryant Byrnes, Marine Corps, 2004-11 I was embedded with Marines in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as a combat correspondent in August 2009. As we were about to head into a town to start patrolling and clearing compounds, a young lieutenant walked up to me and said, “You know, women don’t belong in combat.” I remember thinking: “Wow, what an awesome time to bring this up. How about we just all focus on doing our jobs?” I put it behind me and did what I was there to do, putting down my camera and picking up my rifle when the need arose. Michelle Kuranishi, Marine Corps, 2000-12 I was one of six female bomb-disposal technicians in the Marine Corps. On my first deployment, I was pulled off my team because, as I was told, “Ramadi is too dangerous for a woman.” I was reassigned to Al Taqaddum, which didn’t turn out to be that much safer. The technician and corpsman on the team I was pulled off were killed in a blast. Then, about three weeks later, my own partner was killed. We’d been working on disarming a roadside bomb when it detonated and destroyed our robot. My partner went to disarm it, and a second blast killed him. Four days after that, our security team leader was killed. I completed that tour, devastated and traumatized, then returned a year later as a team leader myself. That deployment was blessedly uneventful. Tenley Lozano, Coast Guard, 2009-14 I served in the Coast Guard for five years, first as a shipboard engineer and then as a deep-sea diver. My first unit conducted counternarcotic missions in the Eastern Pacific. I was the first American citizen to go onboard a Colombian narcotics submarine and evaluate its safety, because of my proven willingness to fit into tight and dangerous spaces. Standing in the entrance, I realized there was no way of seeing what was happening outside the sub once the watertight hatch above was sealed. I began to understand why the four men had locked themselves inside the vessel the night before, believing that the Coast Guard boarding team was actually a group of competing drug smugglers that had come to kill them. The boarding team would later remove one bale of cocaine from the narco-sub. The vessel was then sunk with most of the estimated six tons of cocaine onboard, so it wouldn’t be a hazard to navigation. Suzanna York, Navy, 1996-2001 While I was in the Navy, my orders changed because the ship I had been assigned to had no female berthing. I instead was sent to a squadron on Guam, where I met my husband of 21 years. First Lt. Elizabeth Elliott, Army, 2016-Present I grew up watching my sister, an Air Force pilot, constantly deploy to dangerous places. I wanted to do my part in serving my country, but I never knew how. I earned my bachelor’s and master’s in music performance and conducting, and I ended up being invited to audition in Washington and won the audition. I’m now the fifth female commissioned music officer in the Army. Lt. Kimberly Herm, Navy, 2009-Present I was deployed to Kunar Province, Afghanistan, in 2012. As a civil engineer, my job was to oversee construction projects like schools, roads, bridges and canals. Sometimes we would visit the schools while classes were going on, and the girls would be scared and try to hide. When this happened, I would take off my helmet and sunglasses so they could see I was a girl too. Their reaction would immediately change, and they would all focus on my every move, looking away, laughing and blushing if I looked at them. I have always hoped that my presence there, as a female engineer trying to improve their schools, had a positive impact on these young girls.

2019,42 Years of Friendship,"puzzle making Pencils are sharp, solvers are ready and Will Shortz opens another American Crossword Puzzle Tournament STAMFORD, CONN. — The first thing you notice is the hugging. There is a lot of hugging at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, something that you wouldn’t see at many other annual competitions. You probably wouldn’t see it among, say, competing Super Bowl teams. Of course, if you are not into such exuberant welcomes, there is also the option of a handshake, or even a cheery “hello!” Even the fiercest of competitors greet each other warmly, however, because for the solvers who regularly attend the A.C.P.T., the tournament also functions as a family reunion of sorts. There are people from the crossword world who have attended every year since it began in 1978. That doesn’t mean that new competitors aren’t welcome. For the past 21 years, the Friday night Cru dinner has served to welcome rookies to the tournament, to make new friends and dine with veteran attendees. “It’s a low-key way for people who don’t know anyone going into the tournament to meet like-minded people,” said Mike Alpern, a former teacher from Long Beach, N.Y. who has hosted the dinner for nine years. “And for people who are regulars, it’s a way to relax before the competition begins.” After the dinner, Mr. Shortz made an appearance to sign New York Times puzzle books that were given to first-time attendees. If attendees weren’t feeling welcome quite yet, hordes of solvers and constructors gathered in the Stamford Marriott’s bar. For those who were hankering to solve, there were also Friday night activities, which included a puzzle by Wall Street Journal crossword editor Mike Shenk with audio clues, a “Pick Your Poison” event where solvers could choose from a cryptic crossword, and Puns & Anagrams puzzle or an acrostic. A wine and cheese reception capped the evening. Some retired to get a good night’s sleep before the competition starts on Saturday morning, and the night owls in the group continued the party in the bar. All of them will have to be awake and at their best on Saturday morning, when the real fun begins. Most people attend the A.C.P.T. to test their solving prowess against the champions. But many of them are here to come home. Stay tuned for further coverage of the 2019 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament.",The New York Times
2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things to Help Get Rid of Distractions,"You and your phone need a break. If you want to reclaim your attention and not be so dependent on the highly addictive device in your pocket, you’ll need to be proactive to come up with ways to untangle yourself from smartphone dependence. The average person spends approximately four hours on their phone every day, according to Catherine Price, author of “How to Break Up with Your Phone.” Apps like Screentime, Moment and OFFTIME measure and track your phone usage. And installing a website blocker like Freedom can limit distractions from stealing your productivity. These tools evaluate how your time on your phone is spent and help break long-held habits and establish healthier patterns. “I can’t tell you how upset it makes me to walk down the street and see everyone around me — especially parents and kids — with their faces buried in their phones,” said Ms. Price, who founded Screen/Life Balance, which aims to help people create a healthier balance between their online and offline lives. Instead of using your phone as part personal assistant and part personal court jester, pare your usage down to just the essential functions. Coming up with better alternatives will reset your relationship with your devices and aid in reclaiming your time, energy and focus. With that in mind, in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) items to help you spend less time on your phone and eliminate distractions. USB wall charger Removing phones and tablets out of your bedroom is one of the best things you can do to reduce distractions from your life. The fabulous thing about the Anker’s PowerPort 4, Wirecutter’s pick for USB charger, is that there are four USB outlets so you can charge several smartphones and tablets at once (far away from where you’re resting). It’s powerful, too; it allows connected devices to draw the advertised amount of power, something not every charger can claim. Alarm clock I know using your phone as an alarm clock seems like a convenience — the alarm function is built in — but it’s better to use an actual alarm clock so you’ll reduce the temptation of picking up your phone first thing in the morning and losing time monitoring your social media feeds. Wirecutter recommends the reliable RCA RCD30 alarm clock. It’s easy to read, a cinch to set, dimmable and very affordable. Noise-canceling headphones If you want to immerse yourself in what Cal Newport calls deep work, slipping on a pair of noise-cancelling headphones should help reduce distractions. Anker Soundcore Space NC wireless headphones are Wirecutter’s budget pick. They’ll block out ambient sounds — 93 percent of low frequency and up to 96 percent of high frequency sound, to be exact — so you can focus on your tasks at hand (and not your co-workers conversations, incoming notification dings or other intrusions). They also fold flat for easy storage, which is great for those who travel for work. Bare-bones MP3 player If I want to stay focused on my workout, I need a dedicated MP3 player, otherwise I’ll compulsively whip out my phone to check my email every few minutes. Wirecutter recommends the durable, no-frills SanDisk Clip Sport Plus. This bluetooth-enabled, water-resistant MP3 player is equipped with an FM radio, clips onto your clothes and stores up to 4,000 songs. Paper planner If you’re serious about cutting down reliance on your phone, you should invest in a paper planner so you don’t have to reach for your smartphone every time you need to see what’s on your to-do list. (If you’re not convinced, read our case for paper planners here.) Wirecutter recommends the versatile Traveler’s Notebook. It’s a great fit for most people because it’s entirely customizable. You can purchase refill notebooks of various styles: lined paper, grids and blank sheets. They also offer daily, weekly and monthly diary sets as well. Whether you’re doodling, brainstorming or planning your day, having a dedicated tool will not only keep your focus, but it can unlock your creativity, too. Can We Get Better at Forgetting? Some things aren’t worth remembering. Science is slowly working out how we might let that stuff go. How to Talk to Dogs Use your normal voice (except for with puppies). Maintain eye contact. Heal Me With Plants Gentle gardening helps patients at some hospitals relax and recover. The Burden of ‘Parent Homework’ This is not about a parent helping with homework. It is work given from teacher to parent, passing directly over a child’s head. Love Your Hotel Room? Take a Piece of It Home Your hotel experience is typically defined by time spent away. But increasingly, hotels and vacation rentals are eager to insert themselves into your regular routine back home. Protecting Your Internet Accounts Keeps Getting Easier. Here’s How to Do It. There are many tools for setting up two-factor authentication, a security mechanism that prevents improper access. These four methods are the most compelling. Wellness lifestyle is more and more alcohol-free, what’s become known as sober curious. The workout stink isn’t getting out. No matter what. Try these methods. Just a few ways to keep from vacay-shame. If you’re so miserable at work, then change your circumstances. Leaving emotions out of your finances can improve spending goals.",The New York Times

2019,5 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. AMOUR OR LESS: A BLIER BUFFET at the Quad Cinema (through March 21). Imagine “A Clockwork Orange” as a screwball comedy, and you would be pretty close to Bertrand Blier’s “Going Places” (on Friday, Tuesday, Thursday and March 16), which stars Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere as thugs who drift across France stealing money and cars and assaulting women, usually without consequence. Was Blier celebrating their behavior? Critics disagreed. Pauline Kael called the film an “explosively funny erotic farce,” while Roger Ebert said it was “the most misogynistic movie I can remember.” In the Quad’s career-reviving Blier series, “Buffet Froid” (on Friday, Sunday, Tuesday and March 21), first shown in 1979, holds up better. A pitch-black comedy that borrows heavily from Luis Buñuel and Albert Camus and perhaps looks forward to “After Hours,” the movie casts Depardieu as an unemployed man who may or may not have knifed an accountant in the subway, a murder that — like all the others in this movie — is treated as no big deal by his neighbor, a police inspector (the director’s father, Bernard Blier). “Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,” which won Blier an Oscar in 1979, will get a full run beginning on March 15.212-255-2243, quadcinema.com CANADA NOW 2019 at IFC Center (through March 10). This annual sampling of movies from our neighbor to the north always reflects the diversity of Canadian cinema. “Edge of the Knife,” screening on Saturday, is set in 19th-century British Columbia and is said to be Canada’s first Haida-language feature, with an all-Haida cast reviving two near-lost indigenous dialects for the film. Other titles such as the documentary “Hugh Hefner’s After Dark: Speaking Out in America” (on Friday), about two TV shows the Chicago-born Playboy magnate spearheaded, are Canadian productions in disguise.212-924-7771, ifccenter.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘EMPIRE’ at the Whitney Museum (March 9, 1 p.m.). In a cinematic career known for offscreen intimations of oral sex (“Blow Job”) and movies with Edie Sedgwick in her undergarments (“Poor Little Rich Girl,” “Beauty #2”), Andy Warhol made what is perhaps his most notorious film in “Empire” — which simply captured Empire State Building from shortly after 8 p.m. until nearly 3 a.m. one night in July 1964. (Jonas Mekas, who died in January, was part of the small crew who helped film the movie from the 41st floor of the Time & Life Building.) “Empire” treats time itself as a variable: According to the Museum of Modern Art, when projected, the film is meant to be slowed down so that it runs slightly more than eight hours. The Whitney is screening “Empire” this Saturday as part of its exhibition “Andy Warhol — From A to B and Back Again,” which includes a large sampling of Warhol’s moving-image output.whitney.org/exhibitions/film ‘GIRL 6’ at Alamo Drafthouse (March 11, 7 p.m.). This 1996 feature from Spike Lee, with a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows a struggling actress (Theresa Randle) who takes work as a phone sex operator. Currently unavailable to stream, the film was not one of the director’s biggest hits critically or commercially, but even mixed reviews suggest it has its upsides. “Bold colors, a dance track of Prince songs, a parade of wild costumes, good-humored sexual teasing and warmly inviting cinematography by Malik Sayeed all contribute to this comedy’s high-energy party mood,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.718-513-2547, drafthouse.com/nyc SEE IT BIG! COSTUMES BY EDITH HEAD at the Museum of the Moving Image (through March 10). The museum’s retrospective on the legendary costume designer closes with a weekend of Hitchcock. Grace Kelly and Cary Grant don their best (and Grant, his cat-burglar suit) on the French Riviera for “To Catch a Thief” (on Friday), while Tippi Hedren is impeccably well dressed for both the avian attacks in “The Birds” (on Saturday and Sunday) and for safecracking in “Marnie” (on Saturday and Sunday), in which Head’s tailoring is just one element of the sophisticated color scheme in Hitchcock’s depiction of repressed trauma.718-784-0077, movingimage.us",The New York Times
2019,"5 Great New Shoe Lines, One Common Denominator","Browsing The labels may be fresh on the scene, but the founders aren’t. Before introducing their namesake labels, Vera Wang was a design director at Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan was head of design at Anne Klein, and Tom Ford, of course, was the creative director at Gucci and YSL. Hone your craft at a major brand, then start your own shop — it’s a familiar fashion narrative, and one that happens with accessories too. And lucky for us that it does. Consider, here, five of the buzziest new shoe lines. While their aesthetics run from frilled pastel stilettos to no-nonsense black flatforms, the labels have one common thread: They were founded by industry vets — and it shows. Origin Story: As the former head of design at Public School, Heesung Choi, the Seven All Around founder, was well versed in the cool-kid aesthetic long before striking out on her own in 2018. Current Narrative: You probably wouldn’t be able to tell at first glance, but Ms. Choi prizes practicality. The sandals are engineered with just the right walking-all-day pitch (neither too high nor too flat), and the ankle boots feature soft cork padding. It’s coolness without sacrificing comfort. Seven All Around boots made of recycled yarn with a coral design embroidered in metallic yarn, $795, and mesh boots in recycled yarn and vegan leather, $425, at sevenallaround.com. Origin Story: Mercedes Castillo was the footwear design director for Donna Karan International before heading to Tory Burch to start its shoe line. In 2017, she introduced her namesake label. Current Narrative: Ms. Castillo’s line is already stocked by retail giants (Net-a-Porter, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks), and it’s easy to see why. The shoes — think pearl-embellished mules, white mesh loafers — make everyday footwear fun. Mercedes Castillo satin slip-ons with pearl detail, $475 at mercedescastillo.com. Origin Story: Before introducing their line in 2018, Stephanie Roy-Heckl and Danilo Giordano, the Dahlia Selva founders, met at Ralph Lauren, where Ms. Roy-Heckl worked in wholesale and Mr. Giordano was vice president for footwear design. Current Narrative: Pink and red and satin and grosgrain are in heavy rotation, and an exaggerated ruffle serves as the signature detail on many styles. Dahlia Selva lace pumps with hand-finished suede ruffle, $795 at nordstrom.com Origin Story: After designing shoes for 10 years at Rag & Bone (including that best-selling Newbury ankle boot beloved by 20-somethings from West Hollywood to the West Village), Lauren Bucquet left the company in 2016, then introduced her Labucq line in the fall of 2018. Current Narrative: Labucq stresses the importance of its direct-to-consumer model, allowing the label to sell its footwear at more accessible prices (mules for $195, ankle boots for $350). Labucq patent leather sandals with block heels, $325 at labucq.com. Origin Story: Fabrizio Viti, a former head shoe designer at Gucci and Prada, introduced his own label in 2016. In 2019, Mr. Viti designs his namesake label and serves as the head shoe designer for Louis Vuitton. Current Narrative: An eye-catching range of styles, as diverse as daisy-covered sandals and knee-high drawstring boots in electric orange. Fabrizio Viti kitten pumps, $849, and denim boots, $645, at fabrizioviti.com.",The New York Times
2019,5 New Gems to Read,"“Today people are looking for books that are more than just a reproduction of jewelry,” said Suzanne Tise-Isoré, editorial director of Flammarion’s style and design division. “They want something that is beautiful to touch and beautiful to look at and is something more of an experience.” As books fight for shelf space — and compete with Instagram, here are some examples of recent volumes on jewelers, a jewelry house and a museum. For the first time the Hong Kong-based jeweler Michelle Ong has encapsulated her career since she started the Carnet label in 1998 in a book, “Carnet by Michelle Ong,” by Vivienne Becker, scheduled to be published by Thames & Hudson in Europe on April 11 and in the United States June 11 ($95.00). It published in Asia earlier this month. “I wanted to see how the jewelry had developed and how the brand has grown,” Ms. Ong said, “and it’s good to take a step backwards to see the inspiration, designs and craftsmanship.” The 272-page volume took two years to produce, partly because she had to borrow most of the pieces from clients to have them photographed. Helping Ms. Ong to select jewels for the work was her mentor and friend Joel Rosenthal, better known as the Paris jeweler JAR — “because,” she said, “I am so involved and don’t see how the pieces look and how they come together.” Mr. Rosenthal also wrote the foreword. Oriental themes from flora to patterns form the book’s structure as, Ms. Ong said, “it’s easier to see how I do the East-West fusion.” It’s an aesthetic that has defined her career from the start, such as her 1998 jadeite dragonfly brooch with black, brown and white diamonds. The book’s large photographs make her designs look like art pieces, and the inclusion of preparatory gouaches alongside images of the finished pieces allow “this book to be different from other jewelry books, and surprise people,” she said. “It’s like having a baby,” the Taiwanese jeweler Anna Hu said about producing her color-drenched “Symphony of Jewels: Opus 2,” with text by Sarah Davis. “I have to think about every stage — like the gold cover, which took me two months to decide.” (The gold cover is underneath the book’s jacket.) Published by Vendome Press on Feb. 14 in Britain and March 12 in the United States ($75), the book charts her work over the last five years, from butterflies with diamonds, black opals and other stones to contemporary art pieces such as a 8.54-carat sapphire Petales d’Amour cuff with Paraiba tourmalines, colored sapphires and green garnets. Ms. Hu’s love of color leaps off each page, making this one of the most vibrant jewelry books. The display in each chapter has a different theme, like the ballerina designs on floral patterns or the sets on a white background “to present the jewels in a crisp, sharp way,” she said. And there are unusual treatments, like a laser-cut page that, she said, “shows how the stones of my pieces are set.” Work on the book (which is intended to be part of a 10-book series) also prompted some additional designs. Case in point: the ballerina flowers that became an 11-piece collection, she said. The book, she said, also has made her sales process more efficient, as clients can look at it before they meet with her, “before they tell me what they want and before I tell them what I design.“ Maharajas’ turban ornaments with diamonds and feathers, gold anklets, bejeweled daggers, as well as a jade hookah base feature among the more than 150 pieces included in a new take on the Al Thani collection in “East Meets West: Jewels of the Maharajas from the Al Thani Collection” by Martin Chapman. Published by Prestel last November in Europe and last December in the United States ($39.95), the book reflects the exhibition of the same title at the Legion of Honor museum of San Francisco, which ended in February. The Al Thani collection is no stranger to a book or an exhibition: It was staged at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2014, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London in 2015 and the Doge’s Palace in Venice (where some pieces were stolen in 2018). Yet this book and exhibition offered a fresh take, said Mr. Chapman, by looking at the collection through two themes: Exploring how the East and West influenced each other’s jewelry traditions, and gender, such as the “wearing of jewelry by the great rulers of India and the female wearing of similar jewelry in the West in the 20th century,” he said. The themes were mentioned in “Beyond Extravagance,” the 2013 book on the collection, but, Mr. Chapman said, “I pulled them out to the front in order to make the exhibition and book different.” he said. The book also has extra information on gemstones and jewelry making techniques, as, for example, “people don’t necessarily know what a spinel is, although they are hugely valuable in the market,” he said. The Mumbai-based jeweler Farah Khan is celebrating her 25-year career with “Farah Khan: A Bejewelled Life,” edited by Paola de Luca, scheduled to be published worldwide by Rizzoli on April 2 ($125). “A lot of people ask me what inspired you, how do you design,” Ms. Khan said, “and saying it in words wasn’t enough and I wanted to say it pictorially because that’s the way I think.” The book, the first about the jeweler, includes photographs of creations like a floral choker of yellow gold, accented with pearls, rubies and diamonds, and a rose gold knuckle ring with rubellites and kyanites, but it also is a revealing account of her life. (She even recounts the 2011 legal battle with a former business partner to keep the rights to her name.) Personal touches proved to be innovative elements, such as Ms. Khan’s iPhone photos of seascapes and quotes from writers that she relates to her jewelry. Consider her Infinite Horizons 18-karat yellow gold earrings with carnelian, tanzanite beads, pearls and diamonds, which she paired with the line: “Where the sun meets the sea, is where you will find me,” from the song “Where the Sun Meets the Sea,” by the contemporary Christian duo Jason and deMarco. “When I looked at the jewelry,” Ms. Khan said, “it looks like a sunset.” She said she hopes that the book will prompt people to see her “as a creative person, which will help me go into other areas of design.” Cartier’s color heritage — and the haute joaillerie collection it introduced last July — are the focuses of “Coloratura: High Jewelry and Precious Objects by Cartier,” written by François Chaille. The collection was named after the word for an elaborate operatic melody, and derived from the Latin word colorare (to color). The book evolved alongside the collection, taking a year to produce as “we had to wait for each piece to come out of the workshop to be photographed,” said Ms Tise-Isoré of Flammarion, which published the book in February ($125). Each chapter focuses on the jewelry of a particular color or color combination: from the house’s emblematic red to its 1920s-era signature blue and green, including a platinum Panthère Impérieuse necklace with a 41.06-carat cabochon-cut Ceylon sapphire and two diamond- and sapphire-studded panthers with emerald eyes. Artworks related to the color themes introduce each chapter “to link the book to something more than the jewelry and have a real context,” Ms. Tise-Isoré said. For example: Dan Flavin’s white fluorescent tubes, which show that white is a color.",The New York Times
2019,5 New International Series Visit 5 Far-Flung Crime Scenes,"Critic’s Notebook Looking at the new international series that have arrived on American television and streaming services over the last few months, so many of the standouts were crime shows that we gave in and made this an all-crime international roundup. From murder in London to regicide in medieval Korea to fraud on the Côte d’Azur, here are five series presented in order of quality, starting with the very best, that should satisfy your needs for both deduction and exploration. Acorn TV, starting Monday The hit of the year in Britain so far (and the ITV network’s highest-rated new show since “Broadchurch” in 2013) is this low-key, straightforward and economical (2 hours 15 minutes) mini-series about the hunt for a serial killer. Based on an actual case in the London suburbs, the story is heavily procedural — it takes place almost entirely within the investigation, and nearly all the major characters are police officers — and if you like that kind of story, it’s tremendously satisfying. Martin Clunes, as the detective assigned to manage the case, plays a variation on his long-running role in the medical dramedy “Doc Martin”: highly capable but awkward, quarrelsome and unsure of his position at the Met (better known to Americans as Scotland Yard). Netflix Expanding the borders of the true-crime documentary, this chilling two-part series re-examines the disappearance of 43 young men in southern Mexico in 2014. (The Spanish langugage title translates as “The Days of Ayotzinapa,” referring to the teachers college the victims attended.) Part 1 recreates the night of the disappearance, carefully delineating a chaotic and terrifyingly violent series of events spread across the small city of Iguala. Part 2 recounts the investigations and cover-ups that followed, weighs the different theories and offers a thorough indictment of the Mexican state — the federal and local governments, the military and the police. The series is presided over by the writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II and features passionate testimony from the journalists Paula Monaco and Anabel Hernández. Its most indelible characters, though, are the parents of the 43 missing — no bodies have ever been found — tirelessly protesting, advocating and chanting, “They took them alive, we want them back alive.” Netflix This rousing South Korean series covers a lot of bases — zombie horror, contagion thriller, palace intrigue, horseback action, social satire — but it starts with a crime, or the question of whether a crime has been committed. Is the king alive, dead or somewhere in-between? And how does that play into his young second wife’s attempt to steal the throne from his first son? A Netflix original adapted by Kim Eun-hee from her web comic “The Kingdom of the Gods” and directed by Kim Seong-hun (“Tunnel”), “Kingdom” has the rich production values you expect from a South Korean historical drama (episodes reportedly cost close to $1.8 million each) but in many ways it feels as if it were made with an international audience in mind. The humor is less broad than usual, the acting more naturalistic, the flashbacks fewer and easier to follow, the family relationships less complicated. Most noticeably, the episode count is kept to six. (That’s a bit of a bait and switch, though — the season ends on a precipitous cliffhanger and a second season is already in production.) As the crown prince (Ju Ji-hoon) leads a small band of allies (including a doctor played by the international star Bae Doo-na) trying to keep vampiric zombies from overrunning the country, Korea’s traditional class stratification comes in for a strong comedic critique. It’s hard to keep all the corpses from reawakening, for example, when the rules allow you to burn peasants but not the nobility. Hulu In Season 1 of this elaborate mystery series, five Israelis — all apparently civilians, with no connections to one another — were accused of working together to kidnap an Iranian official. Season 2, added to Hulu last month, distills the formula: This time three seemingly unconnected, unexceptional Israelis are charged with sabotaging a pipeline. “False Flag” exercises the license provided by Middle Eastern reality to combine the most extreme elements of the police procedural and the conspiracy thriller, and its hairpin turns give “Homeland” a run for its money. The cast of Shin Bet officers who must uncover the missing connections and find the real culprits carries over to the new season, led by Mickey Leon as the sad-faced Eitan. The new group of suspects, and their bewildered family and friends, include Hanna Azoulay Hasfari and Moran Rosenblatt, excellent (and funny) as an Orthodox woman and her unorthodox daughter. Like other Israeli thrillers, “False Flag” has learned a lot of its moves from American models (the better to perfect them and send them back), but it can be distinctively different in its details. When was the last time an American bad guy managed to escape by grabbing an assault rifle, sitting down next to a schoolboy on a minibus and pretending to be the hired security guard? Ovation, Saturdays; streaming at Sundance Now Money laundering and art forgery. Niçoise villas and “To Catch a Thief” corniches. A relentless assassin who claws a microchip out of her chest with her fingernails. “Riviera,” currently halfway through its American cable run, has all the ingredients of the international melo-thriller, and because it’s a Neil Jordan project, it’s more voluptuous than most (if no more coherent or plausible). Julia Stiles stars as a Midwestern expat whose billionaire art-collector husband (Anthony LaPaglia) is blown up on a Russian yacht; the great Swedish actress Lena Olin livens things up as the formidable first wife.",The New York Times
2019,"5 Popes, 150 Papal Trips and One Stern Lecture for Bishops","The Saturday Profile ROME — On the flight back to Rome after a papal trip to the United Arab Emirates last month, the Mexican journalist Valentina Alazraki got an unexpected surprise. As the pope’s customary news conference with the reporters was winding down, a large square cake was wheeled into the cabin and placed next to him. “They told me we’re celebrating Valentina’s 150th birthday,” he said with a laugh, adding: “She doesn’t look so mummified to me.” The celebration was actually for a milestone that even the most seasoned Vatican correspondents rarely reach: It was the 150th papal trip for Ms. Alazraki, who has covered Italy and the Vatican for Televisa, Mexico’s largest media conglomerate, since 1974. After cutting the cake, she offered the first piece to the pope, but he declined, saying, “It will make me get fat.” Then the pope — and the cake — were whisked away. That was the last Ms. Alazraki saw of the cake. She did not get one nibble. Even Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican’s spokesman, was unable to clear up the mystery. “I hope it was good,” he joked. Not three weeks later, Ms. Alazraki was again sharing the stage with the pope, this time during a Vatican meeting on the clerical abuse of minors, where she delivered a stern dressing-down to the 200 or so prelates in the audience. Presenting herself as a journalist, a Roman Catholic lay woman and a mother, Ms. Alazraki warned the clerics that unless the church began to come clean and publicly admit its sins, getting ahead of the scandal instead of covering up or “playing ostrich,” the faithful and public opinion would become ever more unforgiving. And reporters, she said, would take no prisoners. “If you do not decide in a radical way to be on the side of the children, mothers, families, civil society, you are right to be afraid of us, because we journalists, who seek the common good, will be your worst enemies,” Ms. Alazraki said. Pope Francis had called the meeting to drive home the message to the world’s bishops — in particular those who continue to dismiss the scandal as a problem of the West — that there in no room in the church for abusers or for those who look the other way. Ms. Alazraki insisted that reporting abuses was the only way forward “if you want us to believe you when you say, ‘From now on we will no longer tolerate cover-ups.’” Journalists, she concluded, “are not vicious wolves,” but rather potential allies of bishops “against the real wolves.” Her remarks drew applause in the plenary hall and from colleagues watching the speech on screens in the Vatican media room. “It was a totally courageous speech,” said Philip Pullella, a correspondent for Reuters who has known Ms. Alazraki for nearly four decades. “Only a woman could have done that, and not every woman could have done that. She spoke as a loving, Roman Catholic mother — and then she proceeded to read them the riot act.” Ms. Alazraki was born in Mexico City in 1955. Her parents — an Italian actress and a Mexican screenwriter and film and stage director of Turkish descent — divorced when she was a toddler. Though she has spent more of her life in Italy than in Mexico, she proudly considers herself “absolutely Mexican.” “My husband says that I transform when I am in Mexico and when I am with Mexicans,” she said. “I am a different person.” She said she admired Mexican people, particularly Mexican women, some of whom she got to know doing research for a book about violence against women for a Catholic foundation. “They react with great strength in very difficult situations,” she said. Only when cooking does her Italian side predominate. “It’s my passion, and I am a very good cook.” She was a cub reporter for Televisa when Pope Paul VI died in 1978, and she helped cover the 33-day papacy of John Paul I. Her big break came when she famously ambushed Pope John Paul II shortly after his 1978 election, and before his first trip to Mexico, by jumping out from behind some potted plants to present him with a sombrero. “If I think about it now, I was crazy,” she laughed. “But it worked.” The pope was amused, and they exchanged a few words. It was “not a Pulitzer-worthy interview,” she said on a recent afternoon, but she made an impression; when she started reporting from the Vatican, she was one of two women who traveled on papal trips. Giampaolo Iorio, who covered the Vatican for Italian news outlets and has worked as a contributor for The New York Times, recalled a time when reporters who worked at the Vatican could be counted with one hand and a finger or two. “Women came much later,” said Mr. Iorio, who is now retired. “And Valentina was one of the first.” Ms. Alazraki became one of the reporters closest to John Paul II. “It was a strange role,” she said. “Yes, as a journalist, but also as a small bridge between him and Mexico, a country that he loved, and that loved him very much.” In 1988, during her stint as president of Rome’s Foreign Press Association, she persuaded the Polish pope to visit the association (he is still the only pope to have done so). She also asked the pope to invite foreign correspondents and their families to his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, “because it was bigger,” she laughed. He did. Three decades later, she was called as a witness to testify on the virtues of John Paul II, the first step toward the sainthood that the church acknowledged in 2014. (The reporter in her came out when she noted, in her speech to the bishops, that the pope’s memory was tarnished by his protracted support of Marcial Maciel, the Mexican founder of the ultraconservative Legionaries of Christ, who was later found to be a pedophile and womanizer.) Even now, she thinks that when people stop her on the streets of Mexico or in St. Peter’s Square, it is not because she’s a television personality but because they associate her with John Paul II. (She has also written several books about him). “For 26 years, if the pope was on TV they’d hear my voice, so there’s this instant pairing,” she said. “They want to thank me for being a connection with the popes. It’s not fame, it’s fondness.” She pulled the surprise sombrero trick on Pope Francis when he went to Mexico in 2016. “The photographers are happiest when the popes put on the sombrero. It’s a tradition now,” she said — though she spared Pope Benedict XVI because he is more reserved, “and I thought it would embarrass him.” Francis sat down for an hourlong interview with Ms. Alazraki around the second anniversary of his papacy, one of only a few such interviews he has granted. Ms. Alazraki said that her great privilege as a journalist was “tied to the sensation of having touched history with my hands.” She cited watching John Paul II with Fidel Castro in Cuba, with Mother Teresa in one of her homes for the neglected, and with Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid. She cited the visit of Benedict XVI, a German pope, to Auschwitz, and a meeting in Cuba between Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. “These moments stay with you,” she said. After giving her own presentation to the bishops last month, Ms. Alazraki returned to the Vatican media room and was greeted with sustained applause by the reporters present. “I hope I represented you well and that you’re not angry with me,” she said. Mr. Pullella joked that he was retiring early “to be her agent.” Other journalists gathered around her to offer praise. But she did not give them much time. “Thanks all,” she said. “But now I have to go to work.”",The New York Times
2019,5 Students Among 8 Killed in Brazil School Shooting,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — At least five students were killed in Brazil on Wednesday when two assailants, both former students, broke into a school and opened fire, police officials said. The attackers also killed two employees at the Professor Raul Brasil school in Suzano, a satellite city of São Paulo, and injured at least nine other students. The police said the assailants fatally shot the owner of a nearby car rental outlet on their way to the school. The attackers killed themselves after their rampage. The police said the students killed were all about 15 years old. “It’s the saddest scene I’ve witnessed in my whole life,” the São Paulo governor, João Doria, said after visiting the school. He declared three days of mourning. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, expressed his condolences via Twitter, calling the attack a “monstrosity and cowardice without comparison.” The police identified the assailants as Luiz Henrique de Castro, 25, and Guilherme Taucci Monteiro, 17, who was enrolled as recently as last year. Officials said they were still investigating possible motives. Security video footage showed the attackers pulling up to the front gate of the public school, which has more than 1,000 students. The assailants entered the campus about 9:30 a.m. local time, when students would have been on a snack break. According to the police, the assailants most likely did not arouse suspicions because they were both former students. The attackers wore masks during the attack and were armed with a handgun outfitted with an automatic reloader, a crossbow, a hatchet and fake explosives, the police said. “This is an incredibly sad episode for the families, for Suzano and São Paulo and all of Brazil,” the state secretary of public security, Gen. João Camilo Pires de Campo, said at a news conference. While gun violence is common in Brazil, school shootings are relatively rare. One happened in 2011, when a former student shot and killed 12 children at a school in Realengo, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Critics of Mr. Bolsonaro, Brazil’s new right-wing president, pointed out that Wednesday’s attack came as he has made it easier for Brazilians to have firearms. Amateur video of the attack posted on social media showed bodies on the ground and students screaming and running. One distraught mother told Globo News, a Brazilian television network, that her 12-year-old daughter called her in the middle of the shooting. “She said, ‘Mom, come quick. There’s been a lot of shooting. People are injured, people are dead.’” A school cook serving snacks said she hustled about 50 children into the kitchen as soon as she realized what was going on and pushed the freezer in front of the door. “We had to remain calm because we had children inside with us,” the cook, Silmara Cristina Silva de Moraes, told Globo News. “But it was nerve-racking because there was a lot of shooting, a lot, and a lot of panic.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the title of João Doria. He is the governor of São Paulo State, not the mayor of the city of São Paulo.",The New York Times
2019,"5 Ways to Value Your Collection, Whether It’s Fine Wine or Shrunken Heads","Wealth Matters Bentley Meeker had amassed 4,500 bottles of wine by 2009 when the recession began to affect his lighting and event business. So, as painful as it was to part with some of the finest wines in his collection, he began selling them. “I had to liquidate all of my good stuff,” he said, estimating he sold some 1,500 bottles. But he has no regrets. “What started out as a passion project kept my company afloat for easily a year,” he said, estimating that he netted $200,000 to $300,000. “We raised the cushion we needed to get through the recession, and I held on to key staff.” Collectible assets include wine, spirits, coins, trading cards as well as more unusual items, like lighters, belt buckles and even shrunken heads. These collections cost money and time to assemble and certainly have a value to their owners, but can they be considered legitimate investments? That depends on the market. For many collectors, the only option to buy, sell or even value these assets is through online auction platforms like eBay or enthusiast sites, but for others, their possessions are treated as fine art. But the market for collectibles, which are often valued in the millions of dollars, may not always be so easy to weather. It can experience sudden surges that put desired items out of the reach of true collectors or it can collapse, wiping out the gains speculators thought they had made. In an economic slowdown, how these investments are treated depends on supply and demand as well as unpredictable forces like fashion and popularity. This is the third column in a series on how owners of passion investments — those in which investors follow their heart as well as their wallet — should consider those assets when the economy softens. Previous columns looked at art and cars, and the next two will look at private equity and real estate. Collectibles can be broken into categories determined by provenance, rarity and even a moment in time. Here are five issues to consider when weighing the investment potential of your collection. Leading the pack are high-quality items that have broad name recognition. In the past five years, for example, the value of Burgundy wine has increased by 105 percent, according to Liv-ex, a wine indexing company. That far outpaced a broader index of 1,000 wines, which rose by 42 percent over the same period. Whisky has had a solid run since the 2008 recession, according to auction reports, but one of the top brands is Macallan, a single-malt whisky from the Speyside region of Scotland. A bottle of 60-year-old Macallan sold last year at auction for $1.1 million; it was priced at $27,000 after it was bottled in 1986. “The Macallan has seen steep growth that levels out,” said Isabel Graham-Yooll, auction and private client director at Whiskey Auction. “Each time there’s a raised eyebrow and questions about whether it’s sustainable. And then it goes up again.” Macallan is a known, high-end whisky for sure, but like the Ferraris I wrote about last week, it is well marketed and managed by the distillery. But stars aren’t limited to spirits. This week, a trading card featuring the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady from his 2000 rookie season sold for $401,000. The sale set a record for a football trading card and beat last year’s $250,000 price paid for a similar Brady card from the same set, said Brent Huigens, chief executive of PWCC, a marketplace that maintains an index of trading card values. The Brady card is an outlier in the indexes that PWCC has created, which are typically led by baseball cards. Other exceptionally rare cards include a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner that has been in a private collection since 2007 when it sold for $2.8 million. Still, Mr. Huigens pointed to a steady increase of the PWCC 500, a diversified portfolio of the 500 best cards that trade frequently. The index is up 165 percent since January 2008, while the S&P 500 is up 71 percent. Nick Fiorella, who owns an insurance company in Stuart, Fla., won the Brady card at auction, but it wasn’t even his biggest card purchase that week. He also bought a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle for $450,000. Mr. Fiorella said he considered cards like that as long-term investments. He buys newer cards to turn a quick profit, using an approach similar to a portfolio strategy. For example, he paid $50,000 for a set of cards depicting Ronald Acuña Jr., the Atlanta Braves outfielder named 2018 rookie of the year. “I could sell that for five times right now, but if he breaks his leg in spring training and never plays again, I’ve just lost $50,000,” he said. The same is true for other collectibles, like whisky. Ms. Graham-Yooll said bottles from distilleries that had closed could jump in value. The lower supply creates greater demand. But there are risks: The whisky might not be that great in the first place or the distillery might not have been able to afford the best casks to age the whisky. “You could say, ‘Yes, it’s worth buying,’ but what price is it worth buying at?” she said. Colored gemstones have dominated the auction market for jewelry. A vivid pink diamond of nearly 19 carats sold for $50 million last year, topping all jewelry sold at auction. A pearl owned by Marie Antoinette came in second, at $36 million. But jewelry is not an investment, said Susan Abeles, head of jewelry for the Americas at the auction house Phillips, because the market is driven too much by changing fashion. “We guide our clients to make intelligent purchases,” she said, “but we can’t guarantee this is an investment.” She said that the auction prices were indicative of popularity, but that clients who needed to raise money often opted to sell their jewelry privately. The world’s largest collection of shrunken heads is valued at $13 million for insurance purposes. It’s certainly rare, but what is it really worth? “It’s hard to put a value on it,” said Ronald Fiamma, global head of private collections for A.I.G.’s private client group, which insured the heads. “And it’s pretty rare since they’re not making any more of them anymore. At least, I hope they’re not.” Another of the company’s clients has an extensive collection of Barbie dolls dating back decades. Mr. Fiamma said the insurer established the value of esoteric collections like these by using third-party appraisers. But insurance companies like A.I.G. value these collections by their replacement value, not by the price someone would pay for them. Would an owner actually be able to sell a collection of shrunken heads for $13 million? That depends on finding a buyer, which could take time. It’s more likely that a collection of that kind is donated to a museum. Whether it’s shrunken heads, 1,000 bottles of wine or sheets of trading cards, a ready buyer may not be available — or may want to pay much less. Mr. Meeker said his collection of wine was probably worth close to $1 million at its peak but had fallen to $400,000 by the time he started selling it off. After that experience, he lost interest in collecting — and now just enjoys the wine he has left. Mr. Fiorella said he would look at trading cards as if they were any other asset if a recession hit his business and he needed to sell. He said he would assess the collection over all, as he would any portfolio, with an eye on keeping the ones that were likely to rebound. “The legacy of Jackie Robinson isn’t changing,” he said. “There are only so many 1948 rookie cards out there.”",The New York Times
2019,"50 Years of Affirmative Action: What Went Right, and What It Got Wrong","On cold mornings, Les Goodson shows up early outside the University Club, on a wealthy stretch of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and races two panhandlers he has nicknamed Catman and Pimp-the-Baby for a warm spot in front of a steam vent. He launches into “Take Five” on his saxophone, leaving his case open for bills and coins. In a good week, it’s a living — enough to pay the rent on his railroad flat in Harlem and put food on the table. A few times, he has seen a former classmate, Gregory Peterson, bound into the social club without so much as a nod. Mr. Goodson, 67, and his classmate were among a record number of black students admitted to Columbia University in 1969. Columbia and other competitive colleges had already begun changing the racial makeup of their campuses as the civil rights movement gained ground, but the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, and the resulting student strikes and urban uprisings, prompted them to redouble their efforts. They acted partly out of a moral imperative, but also out of fear that the fabric of society was being torn apart by racial conflict. They took chances on promising black students from poor neighborhoods they had long ignored, in addition to black students groomed by boarding schools. A look back through the decades shows what went right in the early years of affirmative action in college admissions, but also what can go wrong even with the best of intentions. Those who were able, through luck or experience or hard work, to adapt to the culture of institutions that had long been pillars of the white establishment succeeded by most conventional measures. Others could not break through because of personal trauma, family troubles, financial issues, culture shock — the kind of problems felt by many white students as well, but compounded by being in such a tiny minority. And universities at the time, they said, did not have the will or the knowledge to help. “I think it’s a fair question to ask: Did we really understand or know what we were doing, or could we have predicted what the issues would be?” said Robert L. Kirkpatrick Jr., who at the time was dean of admissions at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., which was part of these early efforts. “The answer is no. I think we were instinctively trying to do the right thing.” Columbia — an Ivy League campus right next to Harlem — was a particularly revelatory setting. Perhaps nowhere else were the divisions more striking between the privilege inside university gates and the troubles and demands of black people outside them. The New York Times tracked down many of the nearly 50 black students in Columbia’s Class of 1973, who arrived on campus as freshmen in 1969. Some of them have remained close friends and helped locate others from directories and photographs. The number of black students admitted to Columbia more than doubled in 1969 from the year before. About half of those who enrolled received their degrees four years later. Many, like Mr. Peterson, went on to comfortable lives and professional success. His classmate, Eric H. Holder Jr., rose from a strivers’ neighborhood in Queens to become the first black attorney general of the United States. There were future doctors in the class, future executives and lawyers. Others, like Mr. Goodson, strayed from prescribed paths. The debate over race in college admissions only intensified. By the late 1970s, colleges began emphasizing the value of diversity on campus over the case for racial reparations. Today, Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are facing legal challenges to race-conscious admissions that could reach the Supreme Court. The Trump administration is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants at Harvard and Yale. University officials who lived through the history fear that the gains of the last 50 years could be rolled back. One of them is Lee Bollinger, the current president of Columbia, who first arrived on campus as a law student in 1968. “In that time, there was a sense, pure and simple, that universities had to do their part to help integrate higher education,” Mr. Bollinger said. “We are still on that mission, but the sense of purpose and urgency and connection to the past have dissipated.” Mr. Goodson sits on a plastic milk crate covered by a clean, brightly colored cushion. He is wrapped in layers of flannel shirts, sweatshirts, a canvas jacket, and wears stylish suede shoes. A watch cap and a graying goatee hide his face. He resents it when people assume he is homeless and plop down bags of food next to him without even asking. He is more forgiving of the police officers who routinely ask him if he would like to go to a shelter. He jokes: No thanks, he has a place at Trump Tower, across the street. (His apartment is a short subway ride away, not far from the jazz club where he plays a weekly gig.) Mr. Goodson grew up in a housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and in those days he was known as Ervin. His mother was a housekeeper for a wealthy family on Park Avenue; his father was a tailor and owned a dry-cleaning shop for a time. He took an early liking to music, learning to play the viola from Cora Roth, his fifth-grade teacher at Public School 46 in Brooklyn, now a painter in Los Angeles who still remembers him as “a pure soul.” A number of programs sprang up at the time to find talented students from tough neighborhoods. In junior high school, Mr. Goodson was chosen to spend three summers in enrichment classes at Hotchkiss, a Connecticut boarding school, where he read incessantly. He was accepted to New York’s Stuyvesant High School, which at the time was mostly white. Now Stuyvesant is mostly Asian-American, and under attack for its test-based admissions. This year, seven black students were offered admission out of 895 slots. When a racially fueled teachers’ strike broke out during Mr. Goodson’s senior year, his parents managed to transfer him to the Wooster School, another boarding school in Connecticut. He had been a middling student at Stuyvesant, but vaulted to the top of his class in private school. An English teacher drove him to Columbia for the admission interview, and he remembers feeling “a little bit phony” as he answered questions. He was also accepted at Dartmouth, but chose Columbia because it was closer to home. In college, Mr. Goodson realized that he could reinvent himself, and began going by Les, his middle name, instead of Ervin. He wanted to be a photographer, and took pictures of B.B. King, Amiri Baraka and the band Sha Na Na with his Miranda camera. He made some rash decisions, once spending $600 of a $1,500 student loan on a Karmann Ghia sports car. Not much in the course catalog spoke to him. “If you go back and look at that blue book, all the courses — I would say 95 percent — were Eurocentric,” he said. “I remember they had a few black courses, and all the black students would take them because they were known as cushy courses, because they were easy to pass.” The only black professor he can remember was Charles Hamilton, a political scientist who collaborated with Stokely Carmichael, the civil rights leader, to write about the Black Power movement, which Mr. Goodson said influenced him. Columbia’s first black department chair, Elliott Skinner, in anthropology, would not be named until 1972 — the year Mr. Goodson dropped out. After his freshman year, Mr. Goodson was asked to take a leave for bad grades. He lived surreptitiously on campus, crashing in friends’ dorm rooms. He got a student at Barnard, Columbia’s sister college, pregnant, and his daughter was born in August 1971. After three years, he left Columbia for good. “Nothing stopped me from finishing,” Mr. Goodson said. “I just did something else.” While civil rights leaders pressed colleges to admit more black students, the big push came after the assassination of Dr. King on April 4, 1968, followed by uprisings in more than 100 cities and student strikes. “I don’t see how you can understand it apart from the upheavals on campus, racial upheavals in the larger society, the general upheavals around the world,” said Jerome Karabel, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a historian of college admissions. Later that month, students occupied several buildings in protest of what they saw as Columbia’s complicity in the Vietnam War and a plan to build a gym in a Harlem park. The standoff ended with a violent clash with the police. The radical politics of 1968 came too late to affect the admissions decisions that fall, as acceptance notices had already gone out. But in 1969, the number of black students recruited and admitted to Ivy League universities and their sister schools rose sharply from the year before, in many cases by more than 100 percent, according to statistics published in The Times in April 1969. From 1968 to 1969, according to archival data provided by Columbia this year, the number of students recorded as black who applied rose to 220 from 121, the number who were admitted rose to 130 from 58, and the number who registered rose to 48 from 31 out of a total class of about 700. (All of them were men; Columbia College did not begin admitting women until the 1980s.) Some black students in that class resisted being cast as emissaries of racial understanding. Gregory Peterson, the classmate Mr. Goodson has seen going into the University Club, did not see himself in any racial framework. “I shied away from anything that was like a ‘black’ group,” he said, “because I didn’t grow up that way.” He and his twin brother, Maurice, were in advanced classes in predominantly white schools, although they were part of the black middle class in East Elmhurst, Queens. Their father owned a barbershop; their mother was a teacher. When Mr. Peterson was in high school, the mother of a white friend took him to a cocktail party where he met a white intellectual who had gone to Exeter and Harvard. He became a mentor, encouraging Mr. Peterson’s ambitions to apply to Ivy League universities. At Columbia, Mr. Peterson was an English major, and mixed with white students. He discovered his gay identity, though he remained closeted. He did experience racial discrimination in college. A Southern white Barnard student apologized to him for not being able to invite him to a party back home. An older man at a reception once assumed he was on the basketball team. But race took a back seat to his sexuality. “I was so busy having problems being gay that I didn’t notice being black,” he said. After graduating in 1973, Mr. Peterson spent a few years in the arts before “the rational side took over,” and he went to Columbia Law School. He went on to become a corporate lawyer. His brother, who also graduated from Columbia, owns a spa. Mr. Peterson and his husband now live on a high floor of a prewar building at 72nd Street and Riverside Drive, a prime Manhattan location. The light-filled apartment is crammed with his art collection. A portrait by Paul Hodgson of Mr. Peterson in a formal suit, looking cerebral and commanding, hangs on one wall. A while back, as Mr. Peterson got out of a cab on his way to the University Club, he was greeted by a street musician. “Hey, Gregory, it’s Lester — from Columbia,” the musician said. The sounds of a saxophone had often filtered into the club gymnasium through the steam vents, but Mr. Peterson had never known who was playing it. He had not stopped before because he had not recognized his classmate. “I tell you, I just totally flipped out,” Mr. Peterson said. He did not know enough about Mr. Goodson’s life to judge him, he said. But the encounter made him conscious of his own good fortune. In July 1972, Eldridge McKinney, a black sophomore at Columbia, shot the dean of students several times with a .38-caliber handgun. Mr. McKinney had been suspended for bad grades, and was angry that he was not reinstated, the police said. By one news account, he shouted “racist bastard” at the dean, who was white, before opening fire. The dean, Henry S. Coleman, was badly wounded but returned to work. (Mr. Coleman had been caught up in campus turmoil before, when students occupied Hamilton Hall and took him hostage in 1968.) Mr. McKinney’s fall from grace was steep. He arrived at Columbia in the fall of 1970, a year behind Mr. Goodson and Mr. Peterson, as an overachiever: a Boy Scout leader; the valedictorian of his high school on the South Side of Chicago; a member of the band, school newspaper, yearbook, and the math, chess and Spanish clubs, according to The Chicago Tribune at the time. But at Columbia, something changed. After the shooting, Mr. McKinney’s mother and Roy Innis, the civil rights leader, publicly pleaded with him to turn himself in. Charged with attempted murder, he disappeared. Classmates remember the jarring sight of his face on wanted posters at the post office. His friends believe that he has been living under an assumed name and identity for nearly 47 years. Mr. McKinney, nicknamed E, became something of a legend. Some black students quietly cheered him on, understanding his rage. “E was sort of like a semi-hero at the time, because apparently he got away with it,” Mr. Goodson said. “And every once in a while, I’ll ask somebody, ‘Yo man, you ever hear from E?’” Darryl T. Downing, a black classmate of Mr. McKinney’s, stepped forward to defend him in 1972. He told The Times back then that Mr. McKinney wanted to be a lawyer, but found Columbia to be a hard adjustment. “Columbia is not the situation we’re used to,” Mr. Downing, who went to a neighborhood public school in New York City, said then. “But we felt we were lucky to be here, so we got together to adjust.” Mr. Downing now lives in a high-rise project in Harlem, where he answers the door warily; for many years, he said, the police or the F.B.I. would knock on his door asking if he had heard anything from Mr. McKinney. Mr. Downing said he had been constantly looked on with suspicion at Columbia, as if he did not belong. Security guards would demand to see his identification every time he walked in, even though they knew who he was and did not demand the same of white students. Soon after the dean was shot, when the campus was “on high alert,” Mr. Downing said he was brought up on disciplinary charges for fighting with a white student who barged into his dorm room uninvited. He said that Dr. Skinner, the black anthropology professor, interceded on his behalf. “Instead of just going to school and just having an experience, the experience was survival,” said Mr. Downing, who is now an events promoter. In his last semester, he “just walked away.” Black and Hispanic alumni from those days recall forming tight bonds because they were so few. They studied together. They went to their own parties and listened to different music. Mr. Downing recalled that his black friends preferred rhythm and blues, while his white classmates listened to Jimi Hendrix. “We had massive — massive — study groups, where everybody would pile into a black lounge,” Mr. Downing said. Many black students felt pulled in two directions — assimilation or resistance. “I think that’s still an open question in some people’s minds: Are you expected to stay with your ghetto identity and the world has to adapt to you?” said Julius Gonzalez, the son of Cuban factory workers in West Harlem, and a member of the Class of 1973. “Or do you make a few adjustments and adapt more to the outside world?” Despite how hard it could be to adapt, there were many success stories among the black students in the Class of 1973. Mr. Gonzalez, whose factory-worker parents had grade-school educations, got an M.B.A. from Harvard and became a financial officer in energy ventures abroad. He is now retired and living in Florida. Gary Friday, son of a beer distributor in Philadelphia, became a neurologist. Eric Coleman, whose widowed mother straightened and curled hair in her kitchen and took in laundry, is a state judge in Connecticut. But many names disappeared from the class directory between freshman and senior years. “Sometimes I look through a list of people who actually graduated,” Dr. Friday said. “A lot of people are missing.” About half the students recorded as black in the class — 25 of the 48 — received diplomas in 1973, according to the data provided by Columbia. Seven more got their degrees later, and one, a student from Tanzania, graduated early. The common perception that professors made allowances for minority students was false, Mr. Gonzalez said. If anything, being black invited tougher scrutiny. “Some of these guys smirked and looked at you and said, ‘What are you doing here? You misspelled a term,’” he said. “You had to prove them wrong.” Within a few years, universities stopped taking as many gambles. The early press coverage was celebratory: “Colleges That Recruit in Ghetto Find Effort Benefits All Concerned” read a headline in The Wall Street Journal in 1968. But it soon became more skeptical. Thomas Sowell, a black professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in The Times in 1970 that white college administrators, out of misguided “romanticism,” were admitting unqualified “‘authentic’ ghetto types” and setting them up to fail, while overlooking “intellectually oriented black students.” A 1973 New York Times Magazine article by Martin Kilson, a black Harvard professor of government, caused a furor by arguing that students had imported a culture of black separatism that was dysfunctional in academia. It was the dawn of a series of bitter battles in the Supreme Court over allegations of “reverse racism” against white students, beginning with Marco DeFunis, a white student rejected by the University of Washington Law School in 1971. The high court found the DeFunis case moot in 1974 because the plaintiff was graduating. David L. Evans, associate dean of admissions at Harvard, acidly complained that because of the DeFunis case, alumni believed that “semiliterate blacks are being accepted at the expense of white geniuses,” according to The Harvard Crimson in 1975. Since then, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right of colleges to use race as one factor in admissions. Now Harvard is fighting a claim that it is manipulating the admissions process to exclude Asian-Americans. But what happened 50 years ago changed admissions forever. In some ways, affirmative action has become more sophisticated over time, as diversity has become an established principle, and schools — barred by law from using racial quotas — have sought an ideal mix of students that is more reflective of society. Colleges often turn to private schools to find even poor black and Hispanic students, because “they have the cultural and social capital to succeed on campus,” said Anthony Abraham Jack, a professor of education at Harvard and author of “The Privileged Poor.” Mr. Gonzalez said he saw the difference among the younger generation of black and Hispanic students at reunions: “They act like, ‘Yeah, I belong here.’” After dropping out, Mr. Goodson worked a variety of jobs, from junk hauler to taxi driver to furniture refinisher. In a late-life bid for middle-class stability, he returned to college with renewed zeal for learning, and received a bachelor’s degree in history from Lehman College in 2003, then completed most of a master’s degree. He lasted only briefly as a high school social studies teacher, unable to abide students who addressed him as “Dawg” and freely used racial slurs among themselves. His daughter, Dara, graduated from Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore. She and her husband, both teachers, have three children. A few years ago, Mr. Goodson was rejected from a Columbia Ph.D. program. The blow was softened by the interest that one professor, Eric Foner, an expert in the Reconstruction era, took in his proposal to study the 13th Amendment’s exception clause and its connection to black incarceration. (“When he proposed to study this subject, it was a very original project,” Professor Foner wrote in an email.) Mr. Goodson has not strayed far from the Columbia orbit. Every Wednesday night, his four-piece band, the Les Goodson Intergalactic Soul Jazz Band, performs at Paris Blues, an old-fashioned dive bar just a 15-minute walk from campus. What he whimsically calls his “penthouse,” a fifth-floor walk-up in central Harlem, is a few blocks farther. The apartment is a revelation. It is narrow, stylishly appointed. He has decorated the walls with art and photographs that he made himself. One painting is splattered like a Jackson Pollock. A homage to Miró features a big blue flying saucer; floating window bars were inspired by Chagall. He has stacked sheet music on the floor under a well-buffed antique wooden table that is a testament to his refinishing skills. A violin hangs on the wall. Scattered about are dismembered bits of saxophone, an instrument he first picked up some 50 years ago, in a classmate’s dorm room. “Columbia,” he said, “it changed my whole life.” Doris Burke and Alain Delaquérière contributed research.",The New York Times

In the droll modern-Shakespeare riff “Hamlet Goes Business” (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), the melancholy Dane fits right into Kaurismaki’s universe, while in “Ariel” (on Friday), a miner (Turo Pajala) loses his job and stays stoic through an unceasing parade of misery before coming out on, well, the other side of hope.212-660-0312, metrograph.com SCREENTIMES: ‘THE BEST OF ENEMIES’ at Florence Gould Hall (April 3, 7 p.m.). Melena Ryzik, a New York Times culture reporter, will host an advance screening of this new drama, followed by a Q. and A. with its stars, Sam Rockwell and Taraji P. Henson, and its writer-director, Robin Bissell. Based on a true story, “The Best of Enemies” centers on the extraordinary relationship between Ann Atwater (Henson), a fearless and outspoken civil rights activist, and C. P. Ellis (Rockwell), a local Ku Klux Klan leader, and how they initiated school desegregation in Durham, N.C., in 1971. Bissell will discuss his directorial debut and Henson will share the timely relevance of this pivotal moment in civil rights history.timestalks.com",The New York Times
2019,6 Reasons to Visit the Antiquarian Book Fair,"The 59th edition of the fair runs through Sunday at the Park Avenue Armory. Fans of contemporary art will be crisscrossing Manhattan this weekend, visiting fairs on Midtown’s Far West Side, an East River pier and points in between. One should not live by art alone. Consider this: The New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, which is running through Sunday at the Park Avenue Armory (which hosted another art fair — the Art Show — just last week). [Read Roberta Smith’s guide to surviving this week’s fairs.] This weekend visitors to the Armory can review a cinema memorabilia collection that shines a light on L.G.B.T.Q. performers in Hollywood’s early years and a Bible containing details about the tragic fates of slaves on a South Carolina plantation. This wide-ranging fair is a vivid reminder of, among many things, the importance of history and the hardships humans have endured. Here are six highlights from the dealers’ inventory. Booth C26 Walter Reuben, who owns an eponymous cinema-memorabilia gallery in West Hollywood, Calif., has a collection of photographs and paperwork about L.G.B.T.Q. performers, directors and writers, and gay-themed productions. The collection (priced at $95,000) contains 1920s and ’30s publicity shots of actors, like William Haines, whose careers came to an abrupt end after they were outed, as well as Elton John in concert regalia in the 1970s and stills from Lily Tomlin’s 1980s films. Mr. Reuben has also acquired photographs, scripts and advertisements for early films and shows with L.G.B.T.Q. characters who were open about their sexuality, including “The Boys in the Band.” Mr. Reuben said he hopes to find a buyer who will keep the archive intact, in order to foster research in a lesser-documented aspect of film history. Booth A18 A 19th-century linen map ($25,000) marked with French officials’ plans for carving up Vietnam’s central coast is on offer at Geographicus, a map dealer in Brooklyn. In the 1810s, Vietnamese cartographers used black ink on the cloth to outline riverbanks, rice fields, villages, roadways and the serrated perimeter of the Great Wall of Vietnam, which has been uncovered in recent archaeological digs. In the 1890s, French colonists used brown ink to add notations about property borders for potential seizure and subdivision. There’s a sense of foreboding in the contrast between the invaders’ dense lines of inventory notes and the original Vietnamese mapmakers’ flowing land contours. Booth A42 In 1914, the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky signed the insole of a cream-colored leather ballet slipper that he had barely worn. He had just married a Hungarian dancer, Romola de Pulszky, which enraged his former lover, the ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. A few years after he signed the shoe, Nijinsky’s life and career were derailed by mental illness, and his wife was left to tend to their two young daughters. Tamino Autographs, a dealer based in Manhattan, is offering the footwear ($29,500), which has loose threads along the toe where a sparkling ornament had originally been stitched. Tamino also has a signed copy of Romola’s 1935 biography of her husband ($400); in it, she recalled how, in his prime, his wiry feet had destroyed several pairs of shoes during each ballet performance. Booth A12 American slave owners typically kept minimal records of enslaved people’s lives, aside from listings of births, deaths, sell-offs and escapes. Read’Em Again Books, a dealer in Montclair, Va., has an early 19th-century Bible ($30,000) in which the Wilson family, owners of a plantation near Darlington, S.C., detailed some of their slaves’ tragic fates. Physicians in the family apparently had coroner-level interest in the subject. A girl named Caroline was fatally injured when she fell under wagon wheels, but with “little injury to bone.” An enslaved man named Stephany died after fracturing his skull “in a fall from the second to the first floor.” The Wilsons’ former plantation has largely disappeared, and it is not known yet whether traces remain of the slaves’ cabins and graves. Booth E25 In the early 1900s, the inventor Nikola Tesla imagined networks of transmission towers that would power millions of pocket-size, wireless communication devices. He was widely mocked for his ideas but kept experimenting. In a 1908 letter now for sale at Schulson Autographs ($19,500), based in New Jersey, he asked a close friend, the engineer Bernard A. Behrend, to send him a 220-volt motor for a machine in progress. (It is not clear which one.) Tesla’s stationery depicts the domed tower that he had just built in Shoreham, N.Y.; it was a financial flop and never activated. Its adjoining laboratory is now being converted into a science center. Booth C7 A lightly worn copy of the National Woman Suffrage Association’s 1876 Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States is for sale ($37,500) through Whitmore Rare Books in Pasadena, Calif. No one knows which original owner may have folded it in her purse for safekeeping; a handful of other examples are known to survive in institutional collections. The text warns that “woman’s degraded, helpless position” and disenfranchisement violated America’s founding governmental principles. Activists handed out the flier in Philadelphia during the Centennial Exhibition. At a ceremony in Independence Hall, politicians accepted a copy in “respectful silence,” an eyewitness noted. Among the signatories are familiar suffragists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, as well as the minister Olympia Brown, who lived long enough to legally vote.

2019,7 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead. PIOTR ANDERSZEWSKI at Alice Tully Hall (April 2, 7:30 p.m.). Anderszewski is something of a specialist in Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations: He has been associated with it at least since his brilliant release on Virgin Classics in 2001. Here the eccentric pianist prefaces the Beethoven with preludes and fugues from the second book of Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (March 31, 5 p.m.). One of the Chamber Music Society’s more enticing programs this season pairs a Bach cantata, “Ich habe genug,” with Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Our Savior on the Cross.” The Orion String Quartet performs the Haydn and is joined by the oboist Stephen Taylor, the bassist Timothy Cobb, the harpsichordist Paolo Bordignon and the bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green for the Bach. 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org CHOIR OF KING’S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, at St. Thomas Church (April 1, 7:30 p.m.). There is a symbolic passing of the baton here, or at least of the vestments. Stephen Cleobury has been the director of music at King’s College, with its famed boy choristers, since 1982. On this, his final tour before retirement in the fall, he and his choir stop at St. Thomas, where his successor, Daniel Hyde, is currently director of music. The program sprawls, from Monteverdi, Tallis and Byrd to Britten, Howells and Vaughan Williams. 212-757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org ‘LA CLEMENZA DI TITO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 30, 8:30 p.m.; April 3, 8 p.m.; through April 20). Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s production returns, and with it comes the prospect of Joyce DiDonato singing the role of Sesto. Joining her are Matthew Polenzani as Tito, Ying Fang as Servilia, Elza van den Heever as Vitellia, Christian Van Horn as Publio and Emily D’Angelo as Annio. Lothar Koenigs conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org ‘DIARY OF ONE WHO DISAPPEARED’ at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (April 4-6, 7:30 p.m.). In association with the Flemish opera company Muziektheater Transparant, the inimitable Ivo van Hove directs a much-anticipated staging of Janacek’s raw song cycle, with added music by Annelies Van Parys. Singers include Andrew Dickinson and Marie Hamard. 718-636-4100, bam.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] REBECCA FISCHER at Miller Theater (April 2, 6 p.m.). Formerly the first violinist of the Chiara String Quartet, Fischer performs a free pop-up concert of seven works by female composers, including Gabriela Lena Frank, Lisa Bielawa, Paola Prestini, Jessie Montgomery, Shih-Hui Chen, Missy Mazzoli and Suzanne Farrin. 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com MITSUKO UCHIDA at Carnegie Hall (March 29, 8 p.m.). If there is a finer Mozart pianist alive than Uchida, I have yet to hear one. Her most recent, self-recommending recordings of selected piano concertos on Decca saw her leading the Cleveland Orchestra from the keyboard. Here she directs the Mahler Chamber Orchestra in Piano Concertos Nos. 19 and 20. In between, the orchestra plays three pieces from Berg’s “Lyric Suite.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org",The New York Times
2019,7 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice A few weeks ago in this space, we highlighted some books devoted to the theme of crime and punishment. In the time since then — surprise! — nobody has solved the problems of the justice system, or the inherent contradictions of law and order and human chaos. Here, then, Round 2: a couple of books about men who spent decades wrongly imprisoned before they were exonerated and freed (“Solitary” and “Good Kids, Bad City”) and another about Chicago residents living in perpetual fear of violence and gunfire (“An American Summer”). If these stories hold out hope, it’s partly in the fact that they’re being told at all rather than buried or overlooked. Elsewhere, global warming is fodder for a couple of books, one of them fiction (“The Wall,” a climate dystopia) and one of them non (“The Uninhabitable Earth,” also a climate dystopia). We round things out with a historical novel grounded in Cherokee culture and a fun oral history, entirely invented, of a fictional 1970s rock band. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles SOLITARY: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope, by Albert Woodfox with Leslie George. (Grove, $26.) For a crime he didn’t commit, Albert Woodfox spent more than four decades in solitary confinement at Angola, the notorious maximum-security prison in Louisiana. “Solitary” is the story of how he survived. It is an “uncommonly powerful” memoir, our critic Dwight Garner writes. “If the ending of this book does not leave you with tears pooling down in your clavicles, you are a stronger person than I am. More lasting is Woodfox’s conviction that the American justice system is in dire need of reform.” THE UNINHABITABLE EARTH: Life After Warming, by David Wallace-Wells. (Tim Duggan Books, $27.) Two years ago, David Wallace-Wells, a deputy editor of New York magazine, wrote an article for the magazine on climate change that went viral. This book, an expansion of that article, depicts in meticulous and terrifying detail the possible future that awaits the planet should we continue to add carbon to the atmosphere and fail to arrest global warming. “Wallace-Wells avoids the ‘eerily banal language of climatology’ in favor of lush, rolling prose,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “The sentences in this book are potent and evocative.” AN AMERICAN SUMMER: Love and Death in Chicago, by Alex Kotlowitz. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $27.95.) Kotlowitz’s detailed account of reckless brutality in Chicago’s poorest neighborhoods probes the damage stemming from exposure to violence. He interviews an expansive cast of characters, including ordinary people whose lives have been shredded by bullets and guns. Our reviewer, Eric Klinenberg, calls it “a powerful indictment of a city and a nation that have failed to protect their most vulnerable residents, or to register the depth of their pain. … Kotlowitz aims to tell unforgettable stories about the afterlife of homicide, how it penetrates the minds, bodies and communities of those it touches. He succeeds.” GOOD KIDS, BAD CITY: A Story of Race and Wrongful Conviction in America, by Kyle Swenson. (Picador, $29.) Swenson’s reporting for The Cleveland Scene, an alternative weekly newspaper, led to the exoneration of three men who served decades in prison after they were wrongfully convicted of murder in the 1970s. Here he expands that account to take in the larger circumstances behind their arrest. “It’s the story of a grave injustice, whose long-overdue correction delivers a strong emotional punch when it finally arrives,” Alec MacGillis writes in his review. “More broadly, it’s a story about negligence, about all the ways in which residents of cities such as Cleveland have been left abandoned by government and society at large. There’s so much talk these days about the great urban rebirth that the persistent struggles of non-superstar cities are too often overlooked. Swenson does a service simply by capturing the daily demoralization of existence in such a place.” THE WALL, by John Lanchester. (Norton, $25.95.) After an environmental disaster renders much of the globe uninhabitable, Britain — largely unscathed — barricades itself inside a massive concrete barrier. Alec Nevala-Lee, reviewing Lanchester’s dystopian novel, calls it a “gripping” story, especially as it progresses: “The last hundred pages are full of tense action and sudden reversals that are mercifully unburdened by any allegorical significance,” Nevala-Lee writes. “The novel gathers momentum as it goes, and few readers will stop until they reach its final page.” DAISY JONES & THE SIX, by Taylor Jenkins Reid. (Ballantine, $27.) This stylish and propulsive novel, presented in the form of an oral history, explores the ascent of a (fictional) hard-partying, iconic 1970s rock band. It reads like the transcript of a particularly juicy episode of VH1’s “Behind the Music.” Our reviewer, Eleanor Henderson, calls it “a mockumentary without the mocking,” and applauds it as Reid’s “most sophisticated and ambitious novel. … It’s easy to fall under the musical spell of these voices, which shift fluidly from speaker to speaker as the characters hand off the microphone. Reid has a great ear, both for the way people talk in interviews and for the music they describe.” CHEROKEE AMERICA, by Margaret Verble. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27.) Verble, a voting member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, explores her heritage in this historical novel, a sprawling family saga that opens in 1875 and includes subplots about murder, politics, romance — and, always, Cherokee culture. “The pacing of the novel mimics the rhythm of a Cherokee neighborly visit,” Melissa Lenhardt writes in her review, and offers the same “joy and satisfaction in spending time with friends and family. That’s how you will feel about Check and the other characters by the end of the novel. You’re invested in them, their culture, their life. Verble has given historical fiction lovers a real gift: ‘Cherokee America’ is an excellent illustration of how diverse books enrich literature, and the minds of those who read them.”",The New York Times
2019,7 Smart Ways to Stay Organized While Wedding Planning,"Staying organized while planning a wedding is no small feat. Forty-seven percent of engaged and newlywed couples said the process was so stressful they considered eloping or getting married at city hall, according to a 2018 survey of 500 engaged and newlywed couples by Zola, a wedding planning and registry website. Fifty-six percent reported elevated anxiety, 37 percent difficulty sleeping, and 10 percent loss of sex drive because of wedding planning stress. Clearly, wedding planning can be a mentally and physically taxing job, which may explain why one in three couples (29 percent) who married in 2018 hired a professional wedding planner, according to The Knot. Of course, not everyone can afford a professional planner, whose services cost, on average, $2,002. But by implementing a few smart organization strategies, you can plan your own wedding without losing too much sleep. Get rid of paper contracts and go digital. Though many wedding vendors still use paper contracts, wedding planning binders are outdated, said Alyssa Meeks, a Houston wedding and event planner. A better way to keep track of contracts, invoices and other important paper documents, Ms. Meeks said, is by storing them on Google Drive or iCloud. This way you’ll be able to access the files from your smartphone when you need them. If you don’t have a scanner at home, you can upload papers using a mobile app like Scanbot or Genius Scan. Leverage Pinterest, but don’t go overboard. Pinterest can be a treasure trove of ideas for invitations, cake design, table centerpieces and other wedding needs. A survey commissioned by Pinterest and published two years ago noted that its user base conducts 378 million wedding-related searches on the website each year. Megan Hiltbrand, a wedding and event planner in Syracuse, suggests that instead of pinning a ton of photos to a master board (which many people do), you should curate your favorite photos by creating boards for each wedding category — like hair and makeup, flower arrangements, specialty cocktails. By having your photos organized in this fashion, and selecting no more than six photos for each category, Ms. Hiltbrand said, you’ll be better prepared to present your ideas to vendors. Photographers, decorators, florists and other vendors can also gain a better understanding of your vision for the wedding by viewing your pared-down Pinterest boards. There’s one caveat. “Many of the images shared around on Pinterest are either from high-end events or styled photo shoots, where it’s really cost prohibitive to replicate for a 200-plus- guest wedding,” Ms. Hiltbrand said. “By looking at the individual attributes of the images, you can single out elements of them — a certain flower, gold flatware, wooden chairs or taper candles — to incorporate that gets you closer to the image you pinned without blowing up your budget.” Use this fast and easy way to collect guest addresses. Rather than spending hours texting and calling wedding guests to get their mailing addresses, you can save yourself time by using Postable.com, Ms. Meeks said. The website will create a customized link that you can email to your guests that allows them to add their mailing information directly into a digital address book that only you can access. The site will also let you export the addresses to Excel, which is a nice feature considering a number of wedding invitation companies require couples to provide addresses in an electronic spreadsheet. Create an email account for wedding-related communication. “You will send and receive an unbelievable amount of emails with regards to your wedding day during the planning process,” said Alyssa Thomas, a wedding planner in Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio. She advises couples create an email account that’s strictly designated for wedding planning (like JohnandJaneWed2019@gmail.com), such as email correspondence with vendors. “Having one inbox solely dedicated to this project will save you time and unwanted stress,” she said, meaning that email chain with your caterer won’t get lost in your personal or work email account. “You can take this one step further and also create specific folders in this email account related to your wedding vendors and design elements, so you can file and find all communication quickly,” Ms. Thomas added. Design your seating chart online. Deciding where everyone is going to sit can be overwhelming, especially when planning a large wedding. Ms. Meeks says one way to simplify the process is by creating a seating plan online, such as on All Seated. The website offers a free seating-arrangement tool that lets you choose from a wide range of table arrangements, or upload a customized floor plan. In addition to assigning seats, the site lets you log each guest’s meal information, giving you a seating chart that you can then provide to your caterer. Set up automated payments with vendors. Many caterers, photographers, bands, florists and other wedding vendors use a fee schedule, where couples pay a deposit upfront and then pay the remainder of the balance closer to the wedding (say, 30 or 60 days out). However, when you’re juggling dress alterations and finalizing the wedding menu, among many other tasks, it’s easy to forget when payments are due. Instead of setting calendar reminders (and risk late payments), you can give vendors permission to keep your credit card or bank account information on file and process payment when it’s due. (Most vendors will offer this option, because it insures they’ll be paid on time.) Note: Some vendors charge additional service fees for credit card payments, so find out if there are any surcharges in advance and adjust your payment method if needed. Create an inventory checklist for the big day. After months of planning, your wedding day is finally here. It’s a joyous occasion, but there are still a lot of moving pieces that have to be assembled to make everything run smoothly. Rachel Slauer, a wedding and event planner in Atlanta, suggests creating a “day-of inventory checklist that shows what supplies you need to bring to your wedding and who is responsible for bringing each item” such as wedding programs, photo booth props, and other essentials. She offers an inventory list on her website (slauerevents.com).",The New York Times
2019,7 Takeaways From New York’s $175 Billion Budget,"The budget takes up thousands of pages and billions of dollars, and will change the way New Yorkers vote, shop, commute and more. Here is a look at what’s included, what’s not and who is responsible. [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] ALBANY — After months of frenzied lobbying, bitter infighting, late-night bill drafting and secretive negotiating, New York’s $175 billion state budget is finally here. You could call it the budget of progressive priorities. It’s the first budget in a decade to be negotiated between all Democrats — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democrat-led State Senate and Assembly — and it will turn many long-neglected liberal priorities into reality. But you could also call it the budget of compromises. Even as activists cheered the inclusion of certain issues, they also said some measures did not go far enough, or delivered on certain promises in name only. Here’s your guide to the deals that will shape life in New York this year and beyond. The idea of charging drivers of vehicles that enter the busiest parts of Manhattan had been around for decades. But lawmakers from outside Manhattan always shot it down, worrying that their constituents would pay a price without reaping benefits. But now the subway crisis has reached a tipping point. Mr. Cuomo, who has been hammered by political opponents over the transit system that he controls, made congestion pricing a must-have in negotiations. Democrats campaigned on a promise to fix the subways, and even many legislators from outside Manhattan rallied behind the plan as a way to help the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “We’re at the point where the Assembly members understand the need to fund the M.T.A.,” Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said last week. Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had pushed instead for a tax on the wealthy, agreed that congestion pricing was the only viable way forward. New York City will become the first city in the country to introduce congestion pricing. The pieces seemed to be in place this year for legalizing recreational marijuana. Mr. Cuomo, who had long been skeptical of what he called a gateway drug, finally announced his support for legalization in December. And Mr. Cuomo is known for getting what he wants in Albany. But it quickly became clear that people had wildly different visions for legalization. Well-financed medical marijuana companies wanted a stake. So did progressive black lawmakers, who opposed any bill that did not guarantee returns for their communities. Some suburban legislators did not want legalization at all — they worried about public safety and health effects. Even though activists made a huge last-minute push — hundreds of people walked through the Capitol last week, chanting loudly for legalized marijuana — it was ultimately not included in the budget. There’s still a chance that it could be passed separately in the remaining months of session. But it may be harder to force a vote without a looming budget deadline. And while there’s always next year, 2020 is an election year and few lawmakers are keen on taking controversial votes while up for re-election. One of the most striking outcomes of last year’s election was the number of incumbents who were unseated, in spite of deeper pockets and, in many cases, party support. The challengers who replaced them vowed to push for a small-donor matching system, which would elevate the voices of everyday New Yorkers over megadonors, and could encourage more upsets in the future. That predictably unnerved some longtime politicians. After all, why would anyone want to change a system that had allowed them to win? Mr. Heastie said earlier this month that he wasn’t sure he had the votes to push through public financing. Hence the compromise: The budget guarantees a small-donor match system but leaves the details to a newly created commission, which would determine key details like the ratio of the match and contribution limits. The commission could create a program like New York City’s, which matches donations 6 to 1. That would make New York the first state in the nation to have an active, robust matching program. Or it could create a toothless program that effectively keeps the old system in place. ""It's possible the commission could create a successful program,"" said Jessica Wisneski, co-director of Citizen Action of New York, a grass roots group. Or, she said, ""It could be a cynical attempt to kill reform."" After Kenneth C. Griffin, a hedge fund billionaire, bought a $238 million penthouse in Manhattan — the most anyone had ever paid for a home in the United States — simmering anger around income inequality turned into sudden momentum for a pied-à-terre tax, which would tax ultraluxury second homes above $5 million. But the powerful real estate industry, which has funded many officials’ campaigns, sprang into action. They especially opposed the recurring nature of the tax, which developers warned would devastate the high-end market. Tax experts also said that the proposal would be difficult to implement on top of the city’s antiquated property tax system. So a compromise emerged, yet again: Instead of a recurring pied-à-terre tax, the state will raise the so-called “mansion tax” and the real-estate transfer tax on multimillion-dollar properties. Those taxes will be one-time fees and raise a combined $365 million. That’s less than some people had predicted a pied-à-terre tax would raise. But it also sends a clear message that those who can afford to pay will be expected to do so. In other words, real estate showed again that it has power in Albany. But maybe less than before. Mr. Heastie, the first black Assembly speaker in state history, memorably said in January that he would have “been a failure as a black man if we did not reform the criminal justice system.” On Sunday, he could celebrate some major changes. While cash bail will not be abolished entirely, as some had wanted, it will end for all but certain violent felonies. Mr. Cuomo’s office estimated that 90 percent of people charged with a crime would no longer be jailed before trial. Prosecutors will also be forced to reveal possibly exculpatory evidence to the defense far earlier in the discovery process, and speedy trials will be guaranteed. These are all major victories for advocacy groups and public defenders, who have noted that New York’s discovery laws had previously ranked fourth worst in the nation. Rebecca Brown, director of policy at the Innocence Project, called Sunday’s package “transformational.” When it comes to describing how Mr. Cuomo felt about the sudden collapse of the plan to bring Amazon to New York City, rage might seem too gentle. He called the deal’s opponents “ignorant” and “superficial.” He blasted them as politically motivated and insincere. He even suggested that the Senate Democrats had engaged in a form of “government corruption” by nominating a vocal opponent of the deal, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, to a board with possible veto power over it. And he continued to make his anger known on Sunday, through a provision of the state budget that gives him “full discretion to immediately remove” a member of the board that Mr. Gianaris was nominated for, if the governor found that member was “acting, or threatening to act,” in any way that went beyond just fiscal analysis. “It was never, ‘You come and you use your political wisdom.’ There was a very limited legal role,” Mr. Cuomo said on Sunday. “And a person who is acting outside their legal role should not be in that role.” Everyone (except perhaps the Republicans) was declaring victory on Sunday. And to a certain extent, everyone could. Mr. Cuomo could claim victory on almost every priority he had outlined in his State of the State budget in January. He got a permanent property tax cap, a (limited) plan to publicly finance campaigns and bail reform. He could also tout another timely budget, a special point of pride. The Senate and Assembly majorities could credibly claim to have made those policies possible, after years of being waylaid by a Republican-led Senate. They also were most likely not upset by the $10,000 pay raise that comes with a timely budget (though what “timely” means is a matter of some debate.) Liberal activists, who had spent the frenzied last week of the budget negotiations pacing the Capitol’s halls, meeting with legislators and hosting raucous rallies, could point to concrete outcomes. But Albany’s longtime power brokers didn’t leave empty-handed either. They successfully talked legislators out of the pied-à-terre, and a fully formulated public financing program. Full-fledged ethics reforms to address pay-to-play scandals and strengthen freedom-of-information laws went unaddressed. “It’s a mixed bag,” said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group. “A more open, lengthier process probably would have given us a stronger result. “But I don’t want to undercut the fact that we’re at least talking about these things and at least moving some reforms.”",The New York Times

Now the headquarters of the Henry Street Settlement, this Lower East Side tenement was once the residence of Lillian Wald (1867-1940), a nurse and pioneering social reformer who moved there to carry out a program of home health care for the neighborhood’s indigent immigrants. “The House on Henry Street,” the settlement’s new permanent exhibition on immigration and activism, is usually open only on weekdays, but this Sunday it will be the site of a free celebration of Wald’s 152nd birthday — at least 50 of the first visitors will get cake — during which the historian Katie Vogel will give family tours of the show. From 2:30 to 4:30 p.m., children can also color pages of drawings that are based on historical photographs, while Vogel shows and discusses the real images. (Online R.S.V.P.’s are encouraged.)212-766-9200, henrystreet.org ‘RADIUM GIRLS’ at the Provincetown Playhouse (March 7-9, 8 p.m.; March 10, 3 p.m.). Thanks to multiple books and an Oscar-nominated film, many people know of Karen Silkwood’s efforts to expose the risks American workers had been subjected to when handling radioactive materials; Grace Fryer’s struggles have received far less publicity. One of the so-called radium girls, Fryer painted luminous dials on watches for the United States Radium Corporation, a job that caused many of those performing it to develop radiation sickness in the 1920s. In this play for young audiences, D. W. Gregory focuses on Fryer’s story and the lawsuit she and several other young women filed against their employer. Presented by the educational theater program of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development at New York University, the show examines a conflict between corporate profits and worker safety that is far from resolved.212-998-4941, tickets.nyu.edu [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ST. PATRICK’S OPEN DAY at the Irish Arts Center and the Police Athletic League’s William J. Duncan Center (March 10, noon-4 p.m.). Anyone who has tried to navigate Manhattan streets on St. Patrick’s Day should welcome an early celebration of the holiday. And what better organization to arrange the festivities than the Irish Arts Center? Taking place at the center’s Midtown building and the Police Athletic League’s center next door, this annual free open house (reservations are encouraged but not required) will immerse families in Irish music, dance, literature, film and food. Highlights will include the Irish Arts Center’s resident ceili (social) band; Cul an Ti, a series of cartoons incorporating Irish songs; a performance and lesson by the Niall O’Leary School of Irish Dance; demonstrations in baking soda bread; and chances for children to try out Irish instruments, like the tin whistle and the bodhran (a type of drum).866-811-4111, irishartscenter.org STEM NIGHT: WOMEN IN STEM at the New York Hall of Science (March 8, 5:30-7:30 p.m.). Friday is International Women’s Day, and this event will honor it by highlighting the international need for more women to embark on careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). Intended for students in middle school, high school and college (those younger than 14 must attend with an adult), the free evening will allow them to meet female professionals in these fields, ask questions and investigate opportunities while enjoying light refreshments and a visit to this Queens museum’s newest exhibition, “Bionic Me.” Partners in the event — admission requires online registration and a student ID — include regional colleges and universities as well as organizations like Girls Who Code, Queens STEM Girls and BEAM (Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics).718-699-0005, nysci.org ‘A WAY WITH WORDS: THE POWER AND ART OF THE BOOK’ at the Children’s Museum of the Arts (through April 29). Books can do more than conjure new worlds in the minds of readers; they can also yield the unexpected in the hands of artists. This museum, which regularly exposes children to the work of creative adults, proves the point with this show, in which 11 artists demonstrate that books — torn, cut, molded, pasted and otherwise transformed — can be innovative physical as well as intellectual material. Doug Beube and Long-Bin Chen sculpt busts whose features and hair come from fanned and shredded pages. Mike Stilkey uses stacked books as canvases, painting long human figures on towers of volumes. Lisa Kokin deconstructs self-help guides, making wall hangings in which individual words gain new contexts. Young visitors can also wander through Rachel Marks’s separate site-specific installation “Naturae Liber,” in which book spines form tree trunks, and pages bloom as vegetation. Bibliophiles shouldn’t blanch: Many of these books were deteriorating discards that have gotten new happy endings as art.212-274-0986, cmany.org",The New York Times
2019,7 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. CHILDREN’S DAY at the Center for Jewish History (March 17, 11 a.m.-1 p.m.). While some religious holidays are serious and somber, Purim isn’t. Commemorating the foiling of a plot against the Jews in ancient Persia, this 24-hour observance (starting this year at sundown on Wednesday) calls for dramatic skits, happy feasting and boisterous celebration — all of which young visitors can look forward to in some form at this free Purim-themed event. Presented by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the fun will include a singalong of Yiddish folk tunes (lyrics will be provided), a magic show by Shane Baker, festive treats and a performance of “Lyzer the Miser,” a puppet adaptation from Great Small Works of a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer. In the tale, a clever man outwits a stingy one, a plot very much in keeping with the spirit of the holiday.212-246-6080, yivo.org JUST KIDDING: ‘JEDI ACADEMY’ at Symphony Space (March 16, 11 a.m.). Although Obi-Wan Kenobi is no longer around to teach aspiring Jedi masters, David Engel has taken up the sword — or, rather, the lightsaber. Appearing as Panniken Moonjumper, Engel offers a show that combines broad comedy, lots of movement (for young audience members as well as himself), “Star Wars” lore and, of course, lessons in lightsaber technique and in using the Force. He encourages all aspiring Jedi knights to come to the performance dressed as a favorite character from one of the films. (Tickets are limited.)212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org ‘OLIVE & PEARL’ at BAM Fisher (March 15 and 18, 10:30 and 11:45 a.m.; March 16-17, 11 a.m.). Grandmothers don’t get much spryer than Pearl. She twirls about the stage, does the jig, builds fires and embarks on an imaginary trip to the moon with her granddaughter, Olive, in this presentation from Treehouse Shakers, a company specializing in dance theater for the young. Written and directed by Mara McEwin and choreographed by Emily Bunning, the show welcomes its intended audience — those ages 2 to 5 — into an intimate, homey environment that’s also populated by puppets, among them a mouse, a fish and fairies. (The company will offer an hourlong family puppetry workshop, which requires a separate admission fee, at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday.) Incorporating Anthony Rizzo’s live Irish fiddle and bluegrass tunes, the production offers relaxed performances (Friday and Monday at 11:45 a.m.) for children on the autism spectrum or with other disabilities.718-636-4100, bam.org/oliveandpearl ‘SHENANIGANS! IRISH CELEBRATION’ at the Actors Temple Theater (March 16, 3:30 p.m.; March 17, 11 a.m.). These are the kind of shenanigans in which children 10 and younger can safely participate. Combining shamrocks, superheroes, spying and a smidgen of feminism — March is Women’s History Month — this production from Funikijam World Music features the company’s first female lead, Ashton Parrack. She portrays Captain Jam, head of an espionage team on a St. Patrick’s Day mission. Written by Brian Barrentine, the creator of Funikijam, which offers world-music classes and programs for children, the hourlong show promises Celtic lore and song, as well as fancy footwork from the Aherne Sheehan School of Irish Dance.347-913-5267, funikijam.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] TAP EXPLORATIONS: ‘REMEMBERING MABLE LEE’ at the American Tap Dance Center (March 16, 5 p.m.). Children don’t have to know who Mable Lee was to get a kick — or probably many kicks — out of this program. Part of Tap Explorations, a new family series from the American Tap Dance Foundation, this event will celebrate Lee, an extraordinary performer who died last month at 97 — and was happily hoofing as recently as July. The series, which incorporates film clips, discussions and demonstrations by artists like the Tap City Youth Ensemble, also includes audience participation, so wear your dancing shoes. (An R.S.V.P. is requested.)646-230-9564, atdf.org TILT KIDS FESTIVAL at various locations (through March 31). If this monthlong event hasn’t already given your children new angles from which to view the world, they still have time to dive in. Presented by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the French Institute Alliance Française, the festival this year focuses on inclusion and tolerance. Witness “Adaku’s Revolt,” at the Abrons Arts Center, which plays on Fridays at 6:30 p.m., Saturdays at 3 and 6:30 p.m., and Sundays at 3 p.m., through March 24. Commissioned by the French Institute from the Nigerian-American MacArthur fellow Okwui Okpokwasili, who also stars in it, this drama chronicles a black girl’s rebellion against Western concepts of beauty. Adaku, whose name means “one who brings wealth to the family” in the Igbo language, views her unstraightened hair as a form of cultural richness. Designed and directed by Peter Born, the show celebrates her individuality without minimizing the struggle it entails. The Tilt agenda also includes more theater (March 23-31) and a free program that is offered in English but seems quintessentially French: Philosophy for Kids (March 24). tiltkidsfestival.org ‘THE UGLY DUCKLING’ at the Borough of Manhattan Community College Tribeca Performing Arts Center (March 16, 11 a.m.). The titular character of this Hans Christian Andersen adaptation positively glows — and not just because he eventually discovers that he’s really a beautiful swan. Lightwire Theater, the show’s production company, builds puppets from recycled materials like aluminum rods, skateboard wheels, fishing rod and fabric, and defines these sculptures’ outlines and features with electroluminescent wire. Dancers manipulate the battery-powered creations in total darkness to music that ranges from classical to pop. The result is a kind of neon ballet.212-220-1460, tribecapac.org",The New York Times
2019,7 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ‘ARE YOU ALICE: A NEW WONDERLAND TALE’ at the Tank (March 24, noon and 7 p.m.; March 28-29, 7 p.m.). At one time or another, everyone in the cast of this show can answer yes to the question posed by the title. Presented by Permafrost Theater Collective, in partnership with the Chameleon Fools Theater Troupe, this workshop production features multiple Alices as it explores episodes from Lewis Carroll’s original works and, according to the publicity material, “repurposes” them. Incorporating dance and puppetry, as well as music by Thomas Burns Scully, the staging offers encounters with the Jabberwock, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, as well as less familiar characters like the Walrus and the Carpenter and the White Knight.thetanknyc.org BROADWAY PLAYHOUSE: LYNN AHRENS AND STEPHEN FLAHERTY at Merkin Hall (March 24, 11 a.m.). This series from the Kaufman Music Center is well named. It serves as both a showcase for Broadway hits and as an opportunity for children ages 4 through 11 to play — to participate in theater games, sing songs and even go onstage — as they learn about composers and lyricists and watch an abbreviated musical. The focus this time is the work of Ahrens and Flaherty, the creative team involved in such Broadway shows as “Seussical,” “Once on This Island” and the current “Anastasia.” The pair won’t appear themselves, but young audience members may well leave humming some of the tunes these writers have produced.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org FAMILY CONCERT: ‘WHO IS MILES DAVIS?’ at the Rose Theater (March 23, 1 and 3 p.m.). Children may not be familiar with cool jazz, but they know what cool is, and the trumpeter and composer Miles Davis epitomized both. Presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center, this narrated program will introduce them to Davis’s life and music, emphasizing the many influences that helped shape his signature sound. Sean Jones, also a trumpeter, will lead the concert, which will feature a variety of jazz musicians and a special guest: the drummer Jimmy Cobb, 90, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master who played on several of Davis’s recordings, including the landmark 1959 album “Kind of Blue.”212-721-6500, jazz.org INSPIRING WOMEN IN SCIENCE at various branches of the Queens Library (through March 30). Although female scientists have often toiled far from the limelight, the Queens Library is letting them shine this month. Its Inspiring Women in Science initiative offers dozens of family programs that both demonstrate these pioneers’ accomplishments and encourage young participants to pursue their own research. The activities include bingo and trivia games on women’s achievements; My Next Great Big Invention, a workshop that promotes scientific creativity; and the Code for Equality Challenge, in which children and teenagers can learn about computer coding. The library is also offering films, labs, demonstrations and presentations. This week’s speakers are the television meteorologist Stacy-Ann Gooden, the astrophysicist Moiya McTier, the chemistry professor Tirandai Hemraj-Benny (all appearing on Saturday) and the materials science and chemical engineering professor Miriam Rafailovich (Thursday). Locations and a full schedule are on the website.queenslib.org/womeninscience2019 [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS: LOST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM’ at the Borough of Manhattan Community College Tribeca Performing Arts Center (March 23, 11 a.m.). Who needs a NASA rocket when you’ve got the Magic School Bus? TheaterWorksUSA, an excellent producer of musicals for young people, has adapted one of the books in Joanna Cole’s series about the intrepid science teacher Ms. Frizzle, her curious students and the bus that is so much more than an ordinary vehicle. In this hourlong show, by Matthew Lee and Marshall Pailet, the class blasts off into outer space, where Ms. Frizzle becomes separated from her pupils. To bring everyone safely home, the kids have to learn to navigate not only the solar system but also the complexities of their own relationships.212-220-1460, tribecapac.org ‘UNDERNEATH A MAGICAL MOON’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 24, 2:15 p.m.) and the Leon M. Goldstein Performing Arts Center (April 14, 2 p.m.). This musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan” differs from most theatrical stagings. It uses no harnesses and wires to simulate flying, has a cast of only three and updates the action to the present. (Expect hip-hop pirates and mermaids who act like middle school mean girls.) But perhaps the biggest departure is that it tells the entire story from the viewpoint of Wendy Darling. Written by Mike Kenny, with a score by Ivan Stott, this acclaimed British production from the companies Tutti Frutti and York Theater Royal will bring Neverland to Queens on Sunday and to Brooklyn in April. (To encourage reading as well as theatergoing, Flushing Town Hall will offer discounted tickets to anyone arriving at the box office with a “Peter Pan” book.) 718-463-7700, ext. 222; flushingtownhall.org718-368-5596, onstageatkingsborough.org ‘WHAT’S SO FUNNY ABOUT MATH?’ at the National Museum of Mathematics (through March 31). You could call this statement an axiom: For many young people, algebra, geometry and trigonometry do not add up to laughs. But those students may change their minds — or at least chuckle — if they go to this exhibition of math-related cartoons, which even offers visitors a contest: Write the best caption for a sketch that’s lacking one. Curated by Bob Mankoff, the cartoon and humor editor at Esquire (and the former cartoon editor at The New Yorker), the show consists of 20 witty examples by illustrators like Dana Fradon, Roz Chast, Pat Byrnes, Nate Fakes, Dan Reynolds and Mankoff himself. In addition to their comical musings, the display includes a comment on each cartoon by a mathematician, scientist or other expert. (One wryly points out an error in the artist’s math.) Perhaps because I’m a word nerd, my favorite exhibit was Nick Kim’s drawing of alienlike beings, their bodies inscribed with mathematical formulas, bowing before one another and uttering polite phrases like “After you.” The caption? “Deferential equations.” 212-542-0566, momath.org",The New York Times
2019,8 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead. THOMAS ADÈS AND KIRILL GERSTEIN at Zankel Hall (March 13, 7:30 p.m.). This noted composer and the pianist he has entrusted with his newest concerto join forces for this four-hand concert. Along with a recent piece by Adès, a two-piano concert paraphrase on his early opera “Powder Her Face,” there’s music by Debussy, Stravinsky, Lutoslawski and Ravel. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (March 13, 7:30 p.m.; through March 19). Manfred Honeck returns to the Philharmonic’s podium, one from which he has consistently impressed as one of the orchestra’s most important guest conductors. The program is all Mozart, with the Piano Concerto No. 27 performed by Richard Goode, before a special take on the Requiem, framed by the Masonic Funeral Music and “Ave Verum Corpus.” The vocal soloists are Joélle Harvey, Megan Mikailovna Samarin, Ben Bliss and Matthew Rose, backed by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. 212-875-5656, nyphil.org PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (March 8, 8 p.m.). Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts Schubert’s Symphony No. 9, Nico Muhly’s “Liar” (a suite from his opera “Marnie”) and Mendelssohn’s Piano Concerto No. 1, with Jan Lisiecki at the keyboard. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PHILHARMONIA BAROQUE at Alice Tully Hall (March 12, 7:30 p.m.). This esteemed San Francisco period-instrument ensemble, led by Nicholas McGegan, is joined by the singers Anne Sofie von Otter and Anthony Roth Costanzo for Handel arias, a suite from Purcell’s “The Fairy Queen,” music by Arvo Part and even a world premiere from Caroline Shaw. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA at David Geffen Hall (March 10, 3 p.m.; March 11, 8 p.m.). As part of his takeover of the San Francisco Symphony, Esa-Pekka Salonen will give up his post as the principal conductor of this London ensemble — but what a productive partnership it has been. On Sunday they perform Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7. On Monday the main event is Salonen’s own Cello Concerto, with Truls Mork as the soloist, in between Sibelius’s “The Oceanides” and Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers BEATRICE RANA at Zankel Hall (March 12, 7:30 p.m.). If you’re surprised that this immensely talented young pianist has waited this long to have her New York recital debut, then that makes it all the more anticipated. Chopin’s Op. 25 Études are on the bill, as well as Ravel’s “Miroirs” and Agosti’s transcriptions from Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘DAS RHEINGOLD’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 9, 1 p.m.; March 14, 8 p.m.). The Met has worked hard to improve Robert Lepage’s production since it was last seen in the house, in the hope that technical improvements might ameliorate its other woes. See for yourself in these two performances of the first drama of Wagner’s “Ring.” There are potential high points among the cast: Norbert Ernst and Gerhard Siegel will likely be ideal as Loge and Mime; Günther Groissböck excels in everything he sings, including Fasolt; and there’s the prospect of Jamie Barton’s Fricka, too. Greer Grimsley is Wotan; Tomasz Konieczny is Alberich. Philippe Jordan, an experienced Wagnerian, conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org ‘SAMSON ET DALILA’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 13, 8 p.m.; through March 28). Darko Tresnjak’s “inert, old-fashioned new production” of Saint-Saëns’s opera — as my colleague Anthony Tommasini called it — returns after its run at the start of the season, but this time it has the all-conquering mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili to liven it up. Aleksandrs Antonenko is Samson to her Dalila, with Laurent Naouri returning as the High Priest, Tomasz Konieczny as Abimélech and Günther Groissböck as the Old Hebrew. Mark Elder is on the podium. 212-362-6000, metopera.org",The New York Times
2019,8 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. A.I.M. at N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (April 4-6, 7:30 p.m.). Pinocchio always wanted to be a real boy, and the choreographer Kyle Abraham is wondering what that even means today. In “Live! The Realest M.C.,” Abraham uses the children’s tale as a starting point to dissect gender roles and black masculinity in the context of hip-hop culture. Costumes comprising track suits and spangled tops illustrate the opposing aesthetics of athleticism and glamour, both of which are staples of Abraham’s movement. That mix of strength and smoothness, applied to questions of identity, has made Abraham one of the most acclaimed dancemakers working today. 212-998-4941, nyuskirball.org LAUREN BAKST at the Chocolate Factory (April 3-6, 8 p.m.). Autofiction is a literary genre that describes fictionalized autobiography — essentially memoir with a license to invent. “More Problems With Form,” a new solo work by Bakst, takes a similar approach but through performance. With text, videos and purposeful gestures, Bakst analyzes her life over the past year. She enlists her lover, her mother and members of her therapy group (all of whom appear onscreen) to help scrutinize the various roles she plays — wife, woman, dancer, among others — and confront the broader challenge of finding a cohesive sense of self. 718-482-7069, chocolatefactorytheater.org AYODELE CASEL at various locations (April 3-13). As part of New York City Center’s new initiative “City Center on the Move,” Casel, a tap dancer and a Bronx native, will visit each of New York’s five boroughs. She will perform “Rooted,” which she created with her dancers. They will be joined by the Grammy-winning jazz musician Arturo O’Farrill on piano, his son Zack O’Farrill on drums and Amanda Ruzza on bass. The free shows begin on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. at the Brownsville Recreation Center in Brooklyn. 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org ELLEN CORNFIELD at the 92nd Street Y (March 29, 8 p.m.; March 30, 4 and 8 p.m.). In its 25th year, the Harkness Festival continues its celebration of what would have been Merce Cunningham’s 100th birthday. To illustrate the lasting effects of his influence, the festival is showcasing companies founded by Cunningham alumni. This week, Cornfield, who danced with Cunningham from 1974 to 1982, will present two repertory works by her company, Cornfield Dance, as well as a new piece called “Portal,” which plays with the relationship between the commonplace and the extraordinary.212-415-5500, 92y.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY at the Joyce Theater (April 2-3, 7:30 p.m.; April 4, 8 p.m.; through April 14). A century ago, the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, was submitted to the states for ratification. In honor of that anniversary, the Graham company presents the EVE Project, a robust collection of work from several generations of female choreographers, spread over a half-dozen programs. There are Graham classics, like “Herodiade,” “Errand Into the Maze” and “Chronicle,” as well as pieces by Annie-B Parson and Lucinda Childs. Two new works will be introduced, too: one by Pam Tanowitz and one by Maxine Doyle and Bobbi Jene Smith. 212-242-0800, joyce.org NATALIA OSIPOVA at New York City Center (April 3-4, 7:30 p.m.; through April 6). Few contemporary ballerinas have the clout to carry a solo show and tour it internationally, but Osipova, a principal with the Royal Ballet, has been a global fan favorite for years. This is because of her ability to fuse fearlessness with vulnerability and apply it to classic and contemporary work alike. For this program, she has recruited David Hallberg, a cherished partner, with whom she will dance the United States premiere of Alexei Ratmansky’s “Valse Triste,” which takes its name from Sibelius’s well-known waltz, and “The Leaves Are Fading” by Antony Tudor. Additional works on the bill — some Osipova will do with other partners; some Osipova and Hallberg will perform solo — are by Iván Pérez, Kim Brandstrup, Roy Assaf and Yuka Oishi.212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org RACOCO PRODUCTIONS at Abrons Arts Center (March 29-30, 7:30 p.m.; March 31, 2:30 p.m.; April 2-6, 7:30 p.m.). The set designs of the shows put on by this company can sometimes seem like characters unto themselves. A case in point is “Tilt,” an inventive reimagining of the tale of Don Quixote, which gives physical form to that famous dreamer’s internal delusions. The choreographer and director Rachel Cohen, performing with four other cast members and the tap dancer Heather Cornell, makes clever use of wood planks to build and dismantle worlds, construct and disassemble armor, and bring puppets to life. 866-811-4111, abronsartscenter.org KOTA YAMAZAKI/FLUID HUG-HUG at New York Live Arts (April 3-6, 7:30 p.m.). Tatsumi Hijikata, who helped pioneer butoh, referred to the startling performance art as a “dance of darkness.” Yamazaki, a New York-based butoh artist, probes that idea and pays homage to Hijikata in his “Darkness Odyssey” trilogy, the last part of which debuts this week. “Darkness Odyssey Part 3: Non-Opera, Becoming” features six dancers from different dance genres and cultural backgrounds who join Yamazaki in examining the multiple selves that make up a person, looking to the body as a black hole that absorbs its surroundings. 212-691-6500, newyorklivearts.org",The New York Times
2019,8 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. BALLET HISPÁNICO at the Joyce Theater (March 26-27, 7:30 p.m.; March 28, 8 p.m.; through March 31). This troupe offers three works: Along with the return of “Sombrerísimo,” Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s exploration of identity — with hats — that has an all-female cast this season, the program is rounded out by two premieres that look at issues of migration, immigration and assimilation. “Homebound/Alaala,” by the Filipino-American choreographer Bennyroyce Royon, takes on topics that include female resilience and overcoming hardship, and Edwaard Liang’s “El Viaje,” set to music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, focuses on the Chinese diaspora. 212-242-0800, joyce.org BATSHEVA DANCE COMPANY at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (March 27-30, 7:30 p.m.). The Israeli company returns to New York with Ohad Naharin’s “Venezuela” — his first trip back to BAM since stepping down as the artistic director at Batsheva. Divided into two 40-minute acts and set to Gregorian chants, tango and rap, the esteemed Naharin explores what freedom of choice means today as he explores movement and the content it represents. One thing is certain: Gaga, Naharin’s rich movement language, will be front and center. 718-636-4100, bam.org ANN CARLSON AND RIRIE-WOODBURY DANCE COMPANY at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University in Montclair, N.J. (March 28-29, 7:30 p.m.; through March 31). As part of Peak Performances, Carlson, a choreographer and performance artist, teams up with Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company for her evening-length “Elizabeth, the Dance.” In this poetic, humorous tribute to modern dance, Carlson looks at the history of the art form, as well as the layers of information that a dancer holds in her or his body, to delve into the theme of homage. 973-655-5112, peakperfs.org DORRANCE DANCE at City Center (March 28-30, 8 p.m.). Michelle Dorrance presents her vibrant tap company in three different two-act programs featuring works not only by Dorrance, but also by the clown and actor Bill Irwin (“Harlequin & Pantalone”) and the veteran choreographer Brenda Bufalino (“Jump Monk”). Selections by Dorrance include a reimagining of “SOUNDspace,” originally created in 2013 at Danspace Project at St. Mark’s Church; “Jungle Blues,” set to music by Branford Marsalis; “Three to One”; and a yet-to-be-titled premiere. Clearly, she’s not one to rest, and we’re the better for it. 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] JUILLIARD SPRING DANCE at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater (March 27-29, 7:30 p.m.; through March 30). The dance department, led by the newly appointed Alicia Graf Mack, presents its spring program featuring Martha Graham’s “The Rite of Spring,” Bill T. Jones’s “D-Man in the Waters (Part I)” and Alejandro Cerrudo’s “Little Mortal Jump.” The former Graham company members Terese Capucilli and Christine Dakin staged and directed the primal and powerful “Rite” (1984) for this showcase. Jones’s “D-Man in the Waters,” named after the dancer Demian Acquavella, who died of AIDS in 1990, is a celebration of resiliency and hope. And Cerrudo offers a contemporary work set to music by Philip Glass, Max Richter, Tom Waits and the band Beirut, among others. 212-769-7406, juilliard.edu AKIKO KITAMURA at Japan Society (March 22-23, 7:30 p.m.). This Japanese choreographer presents “Cross Transit,” a multimedia dance work created in collaboration with the Cambodian visual artist Kim Hak, who contributes video, photos and narration. The piece looks at how Cambodia’s past can be preserved through the body. In this dance for six — the performers are from Cambodia and Japan — Kitamura incorporates contemporary dance, street-dance-inspired choreography and traditional martial arts to probe the future of Asia. 212-715-1258, japansociety.org STREB at Streb Lab for Action Mechanics (March 23, 5 p.m.; March 24, 3 p.m.; through May 12). Elizabeth Streb presents “Sea II: More Singular Extreme Actions,” a continually evolving one-hour show of several short works in which dancers, with the help of the choreographer’s precision equipment, defy gravity and physical limits. (She calls her company Streb Extreme Action for a reason.) Staged in an open setting with no separation between the viewers and the performers, the production is set up to encourage the audience to move as the action changes. 718-384-6491, streb.org NI’JA WHITSON/THE NWA PROJECT at Danspace Project (March 28-30, 8 p.m.). This Bessie Award-winning interdisciplinary artist and writer unveils “Oba Qween Baba King Baba,” which is inspired by Whitson’s experience as a child of a preacher and as a current practitioner of the Yoruba orisha tradition. Named after the Yoruba word “oba,” a genderless term that means “a king,” the work will be viewed from the balcony of St. Mark’s Church, where Danspace is based; at one time, this section of the church was set aside for congregants who were slaves. The production is presented by Danspace and Abrons Arts Center and uses movement, poetry, jazz, textile and video art to investigate how masculinity has influenced religion over time. 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org",The New York Times
2019,8 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice Among this week’s suggested titles are several that challenge conventional wisdom. In “They Were Her Property,” the Berkeley historian Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers dissects the unacknowledged ways that white women were avid participants in (and beneficiaries of) the American system of slavery. In “Empires of the Weak,” the Cambridge political scientist J. C. Sharman argues that Western supremacy has been a mere blip in the history of civilization, which has in fact been dominated by Asia and will be again. And in “Mama’s Last Hug,” the primatologist Frans de Waal builds the case that animals have emotional lives every bit as complex and rich as those of humans. If the intersection of science and culture and emotions piques your interest, you’ll also like William Davies’s “Nervous States,” which takes a wide-angle lens to our political moment and its attendant anxieties. We also recommend Toni Morrison’s nonfiction collection “The Source of Self-Regard” and three novels: one set in Korea, one set in Syria, and one that hopscotches (in one heroine) from Elizabethan England to New York City in the early 2000s. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles THEY WERE HER PROPERTY: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South, by Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers. (Yale, $30.) The full role of white women in slavery has long been one of the “slave trade’s best-kept secrets,” writes Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers. Her book examines how historians have misunderstood and misrepresented white women as reluctant actors. It is a “taut and cogent corrective,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Jones-Rogers puts the matter plainly. White slave-owning women were ubiquitous. Not only did they profit from, and passionately defend, slavery, but the institution ‘was their freedom.’” NERVOUS STATES: Democracy and the Decline of Reason, by William Davies. (Norton, $27.95.) Davies covers 400 years of intellectual history, technological innovation and economic development to examine how we’ve landed in our particular fraught and divisive political situation. He argues that we live in a state of profound uncertainty and heightened alertness. Hence the title of his book — referring not only to the anxiety that attends political life these days, but to the actual nervous system that mediates between body and mind. His work is “wide-ranging yet brilliantly astute,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Davies is a wild and surprising thinker who also happens to be an elegant writer.” MAMA’S LAST HUG: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves, by Frans de Waal. (Norton, $27.95.) De Waal argues that we make a grave mistake when we pretend that only humans think, feel and know, and cites neurochemical studies to conclude that feelings like love, anger and joy are widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Our reviewer, Sy Montgomery, calls “Mama’s Last Hug” a “game-changing new book” that “surprises us on almost every page.” By examining emotions in both humans and animals, Montgomery writes, de Waal “puts these most vivid of mental experiences in evolutionary context, revealing how their richness, power and utility stretch across species and back into deep time.” THE WHITE BOOK, by Han Kang. Translated by Deborah Smith. (Hogarth, $20.) In this latest novel from the author of “The Vegetarian,” a Korean writer wanders the city of Warsaw, haunted by her family’s losses — and her country’s. “Resurrection is a theme throughout Han’s work, one that is tied up in political and collective memory,” Katie Kitamura notes in her review. “Among other things, ‘The White Book’ is an urgent plea for the ritual power of mourning — for its significance in terms of both personal and historical restitution.” THE SOURCE OF SELF-REGARD: Selected Essays, Speeches, and Meditations, by Toni Morrison. (Knopf, $28.95.) Spanning four decades of Morrison’s illustrious career, this collection includes a stirring eulogy to James Baldwin, a prayer for the victims of 9/11 and insights into “Beloved” and her other novels. Reviewing it, James McBride writes that Morrison, who won the Nobel Prize in 1993, “has given every iota of her extraordinary American-born talent and intellect to the great American dream. Not the one with the guns and bombs bursting in air. The other one, the one with world peace, justice, racial harmony, art, literature, music and language that shows us how to be free wrapped in it. Morrison has, as they say in church, lived a life of service. Whatever awards and acclaim she has won, she has earned. She has paid in full. She owes us nothing. Yet even as she moves into the October of life, Morrison, quietly and without ceremony, lays another gem at our feet.” DEATH IS HARD WORK, by Khaled Khalifa. Translated by Leri Price. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) Khalifa’s fifth novel, about siblings reunited by their father’s death during Syria’s current war, wrestles with themes of societal demise and rejuvenation on a tableau every bit as haunted by violence as the swamps and red-clay roads of Faulkner’s South. “As the three siblings journey from Damascus to Anabiya,” Elliot Ackerman writes in his review, “we witness a terrain blighted by violence, but it’s also a terrain blighted by an accumulation of resentments, the millions of indignities suffered by a society forced to live under the scourge of authoritarianism and, now, civil war. At every checkpoint, every rest stop, every halt in traffic, there is another reminder of all that Abdel Latif’s family has endured.” THE HEAVENS, by Sandra Newman. (Grove, $26.) This novel, which explores notions of time travel, romance and mental stability, features a heroine who comes to believe she lives simultaneously in Elizabethan England and 21st-century New York, with events in one period affecting life in the other. “In the end, there is no simple resolution to the way Kate has experienced her life,” Laura van den Berg writes, reviewing it. “The book is, blessedly, not about offering a diagnosis or unknotting the riddle of how Kate understands time; rather it is about illuminating the riddle itself. … This choice allows the novel to dwell in the luminous wilderness of the unsolvable. I woke from ‘The Heavens’ as I hope to emerge from any work of fiction: moved and unsettled, a new and intoxicating set of questions alight on the mind’s horizon.” EMPIRES OF THE WEAK: The Real Story of European Expansion and the Creation of the New World Order, by J. C. Sharman. (Princeton, $27.95.) Taking in 1,000 years of history, Sharman makes the provocative case that European supremacy is a mere blip in mankind’s narrative, which is in fact dominated by Asia. It also argues that we are “on the cusp of a return to a more regular state of affairs, where the large states of Asia will again be the globe’s hegemons,” Alan Mikhail writes in his review. “As a critique of prevailing modes of thinking about global politics, ‘Empires of the Weak’ succeeds admirably. The history of international relations has focused too much on the most unrepresentative period of the last millennium — the century and a half in which Europe dominated the world. This weighting of the scales has skewed our understanding of global politics and the importance of the West. Sharman’s is a far richer story and one that perhaps more accurately reflects today’s global rebalancing.”",The New York Times
2019,8 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ‘THE ADVENTURES OF ALVIN SPUTNIK: DEEP SEA EXPLORER’ at the Clark Studio Theater (March 30-31, 2 p.m.). This one-person play simultaneously evokes the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and pressing 21st-century concerns about climate change. Winner of an outstanding solo show award when it ran at the New York International Fringe Festival in 2009, the production, from the Australian company the Last Great Hunt, takes place in a future in which the oceans have risen so steeply that the only habitable places are atop mountains and skyscrapers. LC Kids, Lincoln Center’s series for young people, has revived this work, which was created by Tim Watts, as part of its expanded offerings for theatergoers 12 and older. Incorporating animation, puppetry and music, the show follows the titular character on a volunteer mission into the ocean depths, where he hopes both to find a hospitable environment for humans and to reunite with the soul of his dead wife.212-721-6500, kids.lincolncenter.org ‘ANIMANIACS IN CONCERT!’ at the Loft at City Winery (March 31, 7:30 p.m.). Many children have never seen Rob Paulsen, but they may well have heard him. A talented voice actor, he has performed such memorable animated roles as Pinky in “Pinky and the Brain,” Yakko in “Animaniacs” and Raphael in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” (for which he now does the voice of the new character Foot Lieutenant). At this show, he will appear with Randy Rogel, the composer for “Animaniacs,” to perform songs from that 1990s series alongside screenings of some of its classic episodes. And though it’s a school night, just remember that those cartoon numbers can be really educational.212-608-0555, citywinery.com BRICK FEST LIVE at the New York Hall of Science (March 30-31, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.). Imagine being surrounded by more than 100,000 Lego bricks. Now here’s the good news: You won’t have to pick them up and put them away. This Queens museum becomes a giant play space at this event, which invites children to view huge sculptures made from these popular building toys — like Darth Vader of “Star Wars” and Woody of “Toy Story” — and to fashion their own Lego creations. The construction areas include Neon City, featuring glow-in-the-dark bricks; Floorsaic, a collaborative place to make a 20-foot-by-20-foot mosaic; Nerdy Derby, an arena to engineer and race Lego cars; and Duplo Junior Builders, designed especially for preschoolers. (Although advance tickets are sold out, the museum will offer admission at the door.) 718-699-0005, nysci.org KIDS ’N COMEDY: ‘MOODY AS MARCH’ at Gotham Comedy Club (March 31, 1 p.m.). Parents know that adolescents’ volatile emotional states are no joke, but tweens and teenagers themselves will mine the subject for plenty of laughs in this stand-up show. Produced by Kids ’N Comedy, an organization in which experienced comics teach young people how to write and perform, the presentation features the most talented students, who gear their material toward audience members 9 and older. The rules forbid profanity and crudity, but sophisticated humor is welcome — and expected. (Reservations are required.)212-877-6115, kidsncomedy.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘LAST STOP ON MARKET STREET’ at the Linda Gross Theater (March 30, 10:30 a.m.; March 31, 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.; through April 13). Although this buoyant musical takes its title from a bus route, it focuses on a more expansive journey: how CJ, a sheltered, self-absorbed boy, learns not just to open his eyes to urban life but to open his heart to the rest of humanity. Presented by Atlantic for Kids, a division of the Atlantic Theater Company, the show follows CJ, played by a young adult (the appealing Jaevon Williams), as he visits his grandmother (a no-nonsense Kara Green) in an unnamed city, where he encounters the disabled, the homeless and a host of others different from himself. While “Last Stop,” adapted by Cheryl L. West from Matt de la Peña’s Newbery Medal-winning picture book, occasionally veers toward sanctimony, there’s no arguing with the power of its score, which includes rap, R&B, gospel and Latin influences. Written by the Motown master Lamont Dozier and his son Paris Dozier, these songs insist that life demands more than just going along for the ride. 866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org ‘THE LIGHTNING THIEF: THE PERCY JACKSON MUSICAL’ at the Beacon Theater (March 28-29, 7 p.m.; March 30, 2 and 7 p.m.; March 31, noon and 4:30 p.m.). Percy isn’t a typical sixth grader: He happens to be a son of the Greek god Poseidon, with some unusual powers that such a status confers. Yet he also copes with problems familiar to ordinary mortals, like dyslexia, impulse control and difficulties at school. Young audiences can watch him grapple with both sides of his identity in this revival of an acclaimed rock musical that TheaterWorksUSA adapted from the first novel in Rick Riordan’s best-selling series. With a book by Joe Tracz and music and lyrics by Rob Rokicki, the show chronicles Percy’s quest to retrieve Zeus’ stolen lightning bolt and avert a war among the gods.866-858-0008, beacontheatre.com LIVING HISTORY: WOMEN, THE EXTRAORDINARY SOLDIERS OF THE CIVIL WAR (March 30, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.) and LIVING HISTORY: DEBORAH SAMPSON (March 31, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.) at the New-York Historical Society. This museum is ending Women’s History Month by saluting American female patriots who did more than cook, clean, sew and spy for the men at the front: They actually took up arms. On Saturday, a program presented by “Reenactress: The Battles of Jennie Reb & Betty Yank,” a coming documentary about female Civil War re-enactors, will feature historians portraying and discussing some of the women — thought to be as many as a thousand — who fought in the conflict (usually in disguise), as well as those who served as surgeons or uniformed vivandières (field nurses and other volunteers). On Sunday, Judith Kalaora, founder and director of the organization History at Play, will appear as Deborah Sampson (1760-1827), who enlisted in the American Revolution by pretending to be a man. (When wounded in the thigh, Sampson treated the injury herself.) Young visitors on both days can get in on the action by learning and practicing historical military drills.212-873-3400, nyhistory.org",The New York Times
2019,8 Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality,"On Friday, all 28 players on the United States women’s soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, an escalation in their increasingly public battle for equality. The players have said that they play more games than the men’s team — and win more of them — yet still receive less pay. They said “institutionalized gender discrimination” affected not only their paychecks, but also where they played and how often, how they trained, the medical care and coaching they received, and even how they traveled to matches. They are not alone in their fight for fairer pay and better treatment. Here are eight times in recent memory when women fought for equality in sports. Experts claimed for years that distance running was damaging to women’s health and femininity. In 1967, women weren’t allowed to officially enter the Boston Marathon, so Kathrine Switzer entered that year as “K.V. Switzer” to hide her gender. Two miles in, an official tried to eject her from the course, a moment captured in dramatic photographs. She finished anyway, becoming the first woman to complete the race as an official entrant. “We learned that women are not deficient in endurance and stamina, and that running requires no fancy facilities or equipment,” Switzer wrote in The New York Times in 2007. Women were officially allowed to enter the race in 1972. Women’s marathoning joined the Olympics in 1984. The year 1973 was a big one for Billie Jean King, the trailblazing tennis star. She founded the Women’s Tennis Association. She led a movement for female players to earn equal prize money in tournaments that featured players of both sexes. And, on a September night at the Astrodome in Houston, she epitomized her crusade for gender equality when she handily beat Bobby Riggs, a self-described male chauvinist pig, in the Battle of the Sexes. King went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for her work championing the rights of women and gay people. She is considered to be one of the most important athletes of the 20th century. “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs,” King once said. “I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.” Chris Ernst is a two-time Olympic rower. But in the spring of 1976, she was the captain of Yale University’s women’s crew team — and sick of not having proper showers to use after practice. She led 18 teammates in an eye-catching protest at Yale’s athletic office. The athletes stripped to their waists, revealing the words “Title IX,” which had been drawn in blue marker on each woman’s back and breasts. The Times ran an article in the next day’s paper, and a photograph of the history-making event also ran in The Yale Daily News. Within two weeks, the female rowers had new locker rooms. And, across the country, educators began viewing Title IX — which had been in effect for just four years — as a law that required compliance. In 2007, after pressure from the tennis great Venus Williams and others, Wimbledon announced that women’s tennis players would receive prize money equal to the men’s. Williams had made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she won the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed essay in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” “Have you ever been let down by someone that you had long admired, respected and looked up to?” she wrote. “Little in life is more disappointing, particularly when that person does something that goes against the very heart of what you believe is right and fair.” After the policies changed in 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her fourth Wimbledon victory, the same amount as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey, the sport’s national governing body, did not increase the women’s wages. “It’s hard to believe that in 2017, we have to fight so hard just to get equitable support,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women.” They put their careers on the line, but the risk paid off. Less than two weeks later, the team reached a four-year deal with U.S.A. Hockey. It provided the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. The team also received the same travel and insurance provisions that the men’s national team did, and a pool of prize money to be split each year. Four prominent female big-wave surfers, Bianca Valenti, Andrea Moller, Keala Kennelly and Paige Alms, spent years fighting for equal pay in the largely male sport where they regularly risk their lives. Last July, the Committee for Equity in Women’s Surfing, an organization formed by six women, sent letters to the California Coastal Commission arguing that by treating women unequally, the World Surf League was in violation of state civil rights law. Months later, in September, Valenti and other female surfers earned a victory when the World Surf League announced it would offer equal prize money to men and women. Valenti, along with Sabrina Brennan, the president of the San Mateo County Harbor Commission, and Karen Tynan, a labor lawyer, also successfully pushed for women to be included in the Maverick’s Challenge, a big-wave surfing competition that had traditionally invited only men. “Some people would tell me that by trying to get the (prize) pie redistributed I was ruining it for everyone,” Moller said in December. “But I would just say: ‘That’s wrong. We’re fighting for the industry. People love watching women surf big waves, so the whole sport will grow.’” In the world of professional basketball, pay disparities are well-documented: In the N.B.A., a multibillion-dollar industry where players often make millions, the minimum starting salary is about eight times what the average W.N.B.A. player makes. And female players are speaking up, on social media and on TV. Skylar Diggins-Smith, the W.N.B.A. All-Star who plays guard for the Dallas Wings, recently appeared in a commercial to raise awareness about pay inequity. The commercial, by the investment adviser Wealthsimple, contrasts the paths of two young players, a boy and a girl. Each lists their basketball dreams and accomplishments, but only one will grow up to receive a multimillion-dollar rookie contract. A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the first overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, has also weighed in: “must. be. nice,” she wrote about LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “We over here looking for a M but Lord, let me get back in my lane.” Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, was expected to earn about $6.8 million in his first year playing for the Phoenix Suns. Ada Hegerberg, a 23-year-old Norwegian, was recognized as the best female soccer player in the world last year when she became the first person to win the women’s Ballon d'Or, a prestigious individual honor in soccer that had previously been reserved for men. Despite the big award, she has decided not to play on the biggest stage of all, the Women’s World Cup, in France this summer. Hegerberg quit the Norwegian national team in 2017 in protest of what she said was a lack of support for women’s soccer in her home country. “I was quite clear with them about what I thought needed to be better,” she said in an interview after winning the Ballon d’Or. “I gave them the reasons. I wish my national team all the best. I love my country. I wish I could play for them. In this case, I had to move on.”",The New York Times

Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (March 13-14, 7:30 p.m.; through March 17). In 1974, Alvin Ailey formed this company as a bridge to the professional world for dancers at the Ailey School. Its artistic director, Troy Powell, shows off the current group of 12 in two programs: One contains all new works; the other features repertoire. The premieres are choreographed by members of the Ailey family, past and present: Uri Sands; Robert Battle, the main company’s artistic director; Bradley Shelver; and Powell. The program of returning dances, all from the 2017-18 season, includes Darrell Grand Moultrie’s “Road to One,” Juel D. Lane’s “Touch & Agree” and Renee I.

As part of “A Feast of Cunningham,” the Harkness Dance Festival welcomes Dunn, who was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1969 to 1973. The focus in “Crag,” a new work, is on couples: Its 10 dancers relate through continually shifting variations in tempo, rhythm and space. As the piece progresses, new pairings are formed, including one with Dunn and Grazia Della-Terza, his wife. The costumes are by Andrew Jordan, and the composer Steven Taylor performs live. 212-415-5500, 92y.org SILAS FARLEY at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (March 8, 2 and 7 p.m.; March 9, noon, 2 and 7 p.m.; March 10, 11 a.m. and 1:30 and 3:30 p.m.). MetLiveArts Performances hosts “Songs From the Spirit,” a site-specific ballet created by Farley, a choreographer and director. During this production, audience members will follow dancers into three galleries as Farley explores ideas revolving around history, spirituality, freedom and the inherent need to create art. The dancers — including Farley, a member of New York City Ballet — are accompanied by traditional spirituals and new songs created by inmates at San Quentin State Prison, courtesy of the Radiotopia podcast “Ear Hustle.” 212-570-3949, metmuseum.org/performances HANNAH KAHN DANCE COMPANY at the Mark Morris Dance Center (March 8-9, 7 p.m.). With “Seven Dances,” Kahn, a Juilliard graduate who relocated to Denver, returns with her company’s first performances in New York City since 1988. The choreographer Mark Morris performed in her company during his early years, so it’s fitting that her concert will grace his Brooklyn space. The program features several works, including Kahn’s dark, psychological duet “Inside Out” (1992); the athletic septet “Possibilities” (2006), set to excerpts from Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence”; and “Orchid” (1979), a trio that originally featured Morris himself. hannahkahndance.org/performances [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] NEW YORK THEATER BALLET at Danspace Project (March 14-16, 8 p.m.). Diana Byer, the group’s founder and artistic director, unveils a repertory program of works by Richard Alston (“The Seasons”), Matthew Nash (“The Elements of Style”) and Merce Cunningham (“Scramble”). “The Seasons,” Alston’s second commissioned work for the company — he is its resident choreographer for the next two seasons — is dedicated to the memory of the writer David Vaughan. Its score, by John Cage, was created in 1947 for Lincoln Kirstein and was also choreographed by Merce Cunningham for Ballet Society. Alston’s piece will likely pair well with Cunningham’s “Scramble,” from 1967, presented in conjunction with the celebration of the choreographer’s centennial birthday. 866-811-4111, nytb.org NOCHE FLAMENCA at the Connelly Theater (March 8-9, 8 p.m.; March 10, 3 p.m.; March 12-14, 7:30 p.m.; through March 31).

The piece transforms poems written by children in refugee camps into song and dance. The program also features the latest iteration of “La Ronde,” which is inspired by Max Ophüls’s 1950 film and spotlights the talents of a guitarist, a vocalist and a solo dancer.866-811-4111, soledadbarrioandnocheflamenca.com OKWUI OKPOKWASILI at Abrons Arts Center (March 14, 4:30 p.m.; through March 24). This choreographer, performer, writer and MacArthur Fellow presents the premiere of “Adaku’s Revolt” at the Tilt Kids Festival, which offers a collection of multidisciplinary works that seek to open up the world of performance for younger audiences. Created with the designer and director Peter Born, Okpokwasili’s work is for those ages 7 and up and, like many in this year’s festival, explores a theme of acceptance: A young black girl challenges conventional beauty standards by opting for natural hair. In the Igbo language spoken in Okpokwasili’s native Nigeria, the name Adaku means “one who brings wealth to the family.” Here, the character Adaku discovers the richness of her hair. tiltkidsfestival.org WORK UP 5.2 at Gibney (March 8-9, 8 p.m.). This shared evening features choreography by Aye Eckerson, Emily Winkler-Morey and Javier Padilla, all artists selected for Gibney’s professional development program for early-career artists. In “Fields (Intro),” Eckerson presents a solo, which relies on fiction, dreamscapes, theory and personal history as a way to heal ancestral wounds. The program continues with Winkler-Morey’s “SomeBody Stories,” an autobiographical dance and spoken-word piece, and Padilla’s “Paraíso,” which is described on Gibney’s website as “a love letter to times that were and places that truly exist.” 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org NETTA YERUSHALMY at New York Live Arts (March 14-16, 7 p.m.; through March 17).

With a cast of 20 dancers and scholars, she presents deconstructed installments of works by Vaslav Nijinsky, Martha Graham, Alvin Ailey, Merce Cunningham and Bob Fosse, as well as a response to George Balanchine’s “Agon.” The event scrutinizes the modern tradition and asks questions such as “How do issues of authority, race and feminism play into classic choreography?” In her extensive quest, Yerushalmy is re-examining the canon. 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of Richard Alston’s work for New York Ballet Theater. “The Seasons” is Alston’s second commissioned piece for Ballet Theater, not his first.",The New York Times
2019,"9 Fund-Raisers in 1 Night: Democrats Vow Reform in N.Y., but Money Still Flows","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] ALBANY — When a group of young Democratic insurgents helped their party take over the State Senate in November, they vowed to push through far-reaching campaign finance and ethics reform, hoping to change a back-scratching culture that had long tainted Albany. But here was the scene the other night around the Capitol: Nine fund-raisers were taking place at the same time, all within walking distance. The price of admission ranged from $250, for a chance to rub elbows with Senator Jessica Ramos, a Democratic newcomer from Queens, to $1,000 for Senator Kevin Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the Senate’s Energy Committee. Mr. Parker’s event was at the Fort Orange Club, a popular venue where three fund-raisers were held that evening. Lobbyists seamlessly shuttled between his event, held in a candlelit room on the first floor, and a gathering upstairs for State Senate Republicans, where the minimum donation was also $1,000. About four blocks away, supporters paying $500 could wish Assemblyman Harry Bronson, a Rochester Democrat, a “happy birthday,” according to a psychedelic-themed flier for his birthday fund-raiser at the Renaissance Hotel. A donation of $750 would make it “a very happy birthday.” For $1,000: the “best birthday ever.” It was just another night in the state capital of New York, as donors paid for the right to mingle with lawmakers after working hours, bringing up important legislative issues, from legal marijuana to casino gambling. State officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders past and present, have long talked about the need to revamp campaign finance laws and to limit the influence of lobbyists, but little has changed. A bill has been introduced repeatedly for nearly two decades to ban fund-raisers from the capital when the Legislature is in session. It has gone nowhere. In at least 29 states, including Colorado, Connecticut and Wisconsin, it is against the law for lobbyists or those who hire them to make campaign contributions while the state legislature is in session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some states, like Texas and Florida, even go further and prohibit contributions from any source during the legislative session. The goal, in most cases, is to avoid what is commonplace and legal in New York: Elected officials spend their day meeting with lobbyists in the Capitol to discuss pending legislation and the budget, and then spend their night collecting checks from many of the same people. Yet that two-step is part of the culture in Albany, especially in the weeks before a new state budget is officially ironed out, when opportunities to win influence are abundant. The scene is on repeat — 10 one night, eight another. Political veterans in Albany call it “the circuit.” “You’re up there, the potential donors are up there, the room is available and it’s just an easy thing for people to put together,” said Rory I. Lancman, who represented neighborhoods of Queens in the State Assembly, and now does so in the New York City Council. “For a lot of people, it’s probably the easiest, quickest way to raise some money.” Although legislators may not so much as discuss their fund-raisers in the Capitol, they can hold fund-raising events in the Albany Room, a private venue virtually inside of the Capitol. Just pass through the security turnstiles into an underground concourse and it’s a few steps away. With almost always another fund-raiser to get to, the food and drink at these events are mostly ignored; if a lobbyist spends more than 15 minutes at an event, that likely means a missed opportunity elsewhere. “I’m not on the circuit; I’m just at one party,” James E. McMahon, a lobbyist with the nickname Cadillac, insisted, as he milled about an event for the Senate Republican Campaign Committee at the Fort Orange Club. “It’s like the Grand Hotel: people come and people go, but nothing ever happens.” He added: “I’m just here for the friendships.” Lobbying is indeed alive and well in New York, where 7,444 people had registered to lobby as of the latest report from the state last June, nearly four times as many as registered in 1990. Well over $200 million a year has been spent on lobbying in recent years by those trying to influence the state budget, which could reach $175 billion in 2019. Mr. Cuomo, a prodigious fund-raiser himself, included a reform proposal in his budget this year. “We’re always willing to consider additional proposals,” said a Cuomo spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, when asked if the governor would support an Albany fund-raising ban. Assemblywoman Sandy Galef, a Democrat from Ossining who has sponsored the bill to ban fund-raisers within 15 miles of the Capitol during session, said it made no sense to give lobbyists paid access to lawmakers during session. “We’re voting on all the things that lobbyists care about,” she said. “Do we have to have a fund-raiser up here at the same time?” So far she’s gotten little support for her efforts from her colleagues or major lobbyists. “Obviously,” she said. If there’s a must-stop venue on the circuit, it is the Fort Orange Club, a wood-paneled 1880s clubhouse still used by many Republican legislators as their home away from home. On the night where three fund-raisers took place there at the same time, the only issue appeared to be parking. “As the club will be very busy tonight, additional parking will be available across the street,” read an email sent earlier in the day and warning attendees of crowds. Inside, arriving guests were almost immediately plotting their next move. “I’m doing Parker,” a man said into a cellphone hurrying past a ticking grandfather clock. “I’ve got like three or four of them.” In the club’s large, green-walled President’s Room, scores of men in suits traded gossip and nibbled on cheese. Newcomers checked in at a table to drop off checks and to be sure their contributions — $1,000 minimum — had been recorded. All the regulars seemed to be there: lobbyists from the biggest firms representing interests as varied as school funding and labor relations. Some of the more seasoned lobbyists kept their coats on their arm, as if to facilitate a quick getaway to the next fund-raiser. “Typically, these are not open to the press,” said Scott Reif, the spokesman for the Republican Senate minority, after being alerted to the presence of a reporter amid the swirling cocktail party. Down the hall, Pamela Helming, a Republican state senator, greeted a smattering of supporters in the club’s dark wood library for her $300-minimum fund-raiser. A fireplace roared. “This room is always a hundred degrees,” a man complained on his way out. Downstairs, those who came to support Senator Parker were treated to subdued lighting, candlelight and a carving station with the choice of roasted turkey or prime rib. Few could be seen eating; many could be seen lining up around Senator Parker, the new chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Telecommunications. “We took over the governor’s office and the Legislature; now we’re taking over the venues!” Brian Early, the legislative director for a Staten Island assemblyman, Charles D. Fall, said, remarking on Democratic dominance in Albany and the club’s traditional association with Republicans. Then he turned his attention to the door. “The teachers just walked in,” he said, indicating a representative of the New York State United Teachers near another from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By contrast, a half-block up Washington Avenue, a fund-raiser for Assemblyman Walter Mosley, a Democrat from Brooklyn, did not draw nearly the numbers necessary to make a dent in the hot food offerings. A bartender stood idly with no one to serve. More of a party atmosphere could be found in two Democratic fund-raisers held in downtown bars on the other side of the Capitol. Supporters of Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat who represents Albany, could sample an assortment of craft beers on tap for the price of admission ($350). Nearby, Senator Ramos of Queens had a throng of men in suits waiting to talk to her on the second floor of the City Beer Hall (minimum donation $250), where a song by the Strokes could be heard playing and a wooden sign advertised a weekend drink known as the Dirty Hipster (a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon and shot of Jägermeister). Several people gripped cans of Miller Lite. On this night, Senator Ramos, who unseated a more centrist incumbent Democrat, stood near the bar listening to pitches from the line of people coming up to her. Not all of them she liked. “I kicked someone out,” she said, referring to a person who had made a contribution but was from a firm that helps companies resist union organizing. She would return the check, Senator Ramos said.",The New York Times

2019,9-Year-Old Girl Was Detained at Border for 30 Hours Despite Being a U.S. Citizen,"A 9-year-old United States citizen was detained at a Southern California border checkpoint for more than 30 hours this week while the authorities said they worked to verify her identity. The girl, identified by NBC 7 San Diego as Julia Isabel Amparo Medina, had been making her daily commute from Tijuana, Mexico — where she and her 14-year-old brother, Oscar, live — to school in San Ysidro, Calif., on Monday, the news station said. Because traffic was moving slowly, Julia and Oscar opted to walk across the border rather than wait in the car and risk tardiness, according to NBC 7, which first reported the story. In an email on Friday, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman said two children arrived at one of the San Ysidro port of entry facilities for pedestrians at 10:15 a.m. on Monday. The children, whom the spokesman did not identify, presented a C.B.P. officer with United States passport cards, according to the spokesman, Ralph DeSio. [Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.] “The younger child provided inconsistent information during her inspection, and C.B.P. officers took the 9-year-old into custody to perform due diligence in confirming her identity and citizenship,” Mr. DeSio said. He did not elaborate on what information was inconsistent, saying only: “Some specifics of our techniques for determining the true identity of a person crossing the border are law enforcement sensitive information. In addition, some details of this case are restricted from release due to privacy concerns.” A federal official with knowledge of the case who was not authorized to speak about it said the 9-year-old had provided inaccurate information to border agents, which prompted a series of protocols that agents were required to conduct. The need to go through that process and ensure that the girl was not a victim of human trafficking contributed to the length of her detainment, the official said. Eventually, border agents confirmed that the teenager was a United States citizen and he was permitted to enter the country, Mr. DeSio said. Then, around 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the 9-year-old girl was admitted to the United States and released to her mother after the authorities confirmed her identity and her citizenship, Mr. DeSio said. “C.B.P. prioritizes the safety of the minors we encounter,” he said. “It’s important that C.B.P. officials positively confirm the identity of a child traveling without a parent or legal guardian.” The episode involving the children came as the agency is being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit last month on behalf of two American women who were stopped by a border agent who said he was asking for their identification because he had heard them speaking Spanish. The cases have highlighted concerns over the power of Customs and Border Protection, whose agents have come under increased scrutiny as the Trump administration has sought to keep immigrants from crossing the country’s southern border. Thousands of people travel through the Tijuana-San Ysidro crossing every day for school or work. Julia’s mother, Thelma Galaxia, told NBC 7 that while Julia was detained, agents accused her of lying about her identity, saying that her passport photo did not look like her. Julia told NBC 7 that the authorities accused her of being her cousin rather than herself, and said she was told that if she would admit that she had lied about her identity she would be released. “I was scared,” Julia told NBC 7. “I was sad because I didn’t have my mom or my brother. I was completely by myself.” The children also told the station that agents had accused Oscar of smuggling and other crimes. The federal official with knowledge of the case declined to comment on the specific allegations made by Ms. Galaxia and her children but said that, in general, a person who appears to be lying to Customs and Border Protection officers is subject to increased scrutiny. Attempts to reach Ms. Galaxia on Friday were unsuccessful. In a statement, the Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego said that it “gave prompt assistance; in this regard, we supported the child’s mother within the framework of our consular protection programs, in observance to the protocols of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.”",The New York Times
2019,A 1970s Japanese Novel Leading the Way to Ferrante,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. TERRITORY OF LIGHT By Yuko Tsushima At first glance, “Territory of Light” seems part of the same cultural moment that has produced recent novels exploring, with unapologetic honesty, the raw interior of the female psyche. Could the Japanese novelist Yuko Tsushima have been inspired by the works of Jenny Offill and Elena Ferrante, whose protagonists — young mothers negotiating life in the wake of marital betrayal — mirror that of Tsushima’s own book? The answer is no. Tsushima, who died in 2016, first published monthly installments of what would become “Territory of Light” a full four decades ago, when she too was a single mother struggling to eke out an existence in Tokyo. The fact that the novel, which has been elegantly translated into English by Geraldine Harcourt, seems to be in direct dialogue with contemporary novels of motherhood, however, suggests both its deep prescience and the enduring relevance of its insights. Tsushima chronicles one year in the life of a young mother and daughter, beginning on the evening when the unnamed narrator is forced to look for an apartment after her husband leaves her. She finally chooses a building named “Fujino,” which is also her husband’s surname and causes her to be “constantly mistaken for the proprietor.” This is not exactly a coincidence, the narrator admits: “It is possible that the building’s name evoked the closeness of my ties to my husband and that I impulsively yielded to that sensation.” The sensation seems to envelop the narrator, as if in a thick fog, through which she feebly tries to find her way. Apprehension of her new life feels like “an invisible, rickety, misshapen mass that not only kept its precarious balance but was actually sending out roots and even tentative new shoots.” It grows to consume and paralyze the narrator, who staggers through daily chores, barely able to keep herself from dissolution. “Why were children the only ones who ever got to melt down?” she seethes. Fury gives way to darker fantasies. Sleep-deprived and tending to her wailing toddler daughter in the middle of the night, she wonders if maybe some part of her wished the child — who, after all, resembles her father — were dead. In another moment, she embraces her daughter’s body, amazed “that the blessing of my daughter being alive had been granted to the likes of me.” To the narrator, divorce is, at first, the kind of cataclysmic rupture that confirms profound personal failing. “Nothing goes right for a woman on her own,” an elderly male professor counsels. Her husband owes her money and seems unlikely to ever pay child support. The insidiousness of masculine entitlement is such that Fujino, an unpredictable lout, still plays the victim while she shoulders the bulk of domestic responsibilities, acting as both mother and father. Tsushima writes in prose so bare and vivid that even banal details acquire a visceral vibrancy: Summer leaves give off “tiny gleams that flitted like insects” and the narrator’s dreams succeed one another, “dim as magic lantern slides.” Throughout the novel, she plays with light and dark, as if grappling with the question of what should be illuminated in a society in which the grotesqueries of patriarchy are half-hidden, open secrets that become the dark condition of existence. What emerges is a story that searchingly inhabits the lives of women without sentimentality or self-pity. When the narrator declares that she wanted to give herself a pat on the head for “having managed to protect my daughter from the upheaval around her with the quantity of light,” it is as if Tsushima herself has momentarily taken up the voice of the narrator in order to announce herself. In putting pen to the blank page, she has opened up a territory that feels, in some small way, like a bright room of her own.",The New York Times
2019,"A 7-Hour, 6-Mile, Round-the-Museum Tour of the Prado","On the year of the Madrid museum’s bicentennial, our writer visits every gallery, vestibule and passageway to see if he had missed anything on his previous 200 visits. He had. ""Las Meninas,"" by Diego Velázquez, in Gallery 12 in the Prado Museum in Madrid.CreditCreditEmilio Parra Doiztua for The New York Times It’s often said that we don’t appreciate what we have until it’s gone. In the early 19th century, Spain’s royal family had time to ruminate on that axiom when they lost not only their throne to Napoleon’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, but also hundreds of priceless paintings and other treasures, which had been stripped from Spanish palaces, monasteries and churches, and carted off to Paris by the French army. With Napoleon’s defeat in 1814, both the throne and the artworks were returned to the restored Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VII, who had used his time off as ruler to hatch a plan for safeguarding his collection for future generations. Spurred by his culturally enlightened second wife, Maria Isabel de Braganza, Ferdinand created the Royal Museum of Paintings in Madrid in 1819. Beginning with about 300 masterpieces from the so-called Golden Age of Spanish painting in the 16th and 17th centuries, the museum grew to include art from across Europe. Today, vastly expanded and known as the Prado, the museum is one of the world’s great repositories of Western art. To honor its bicentennial, the museum has organized a yearlong celebration, starting last November with three days of “puertas abiertas” (free admission) that drew nearly 30,000 people. There are special exhibitions in the museum galleries, in parks and plazas around Madrid, and in museums across Spain. The Prado is even recreating the painting and furniture arrangement of “their Majesties’ retiring room,” complete with Ferdinand’s personal toilet. Most apparent to visitors is that the museum’s largest masterpiece — its stately neoclassical building designed by the architect Juan de Villanueva and begun in 1785 — has been almost completely enveloped in a crazy-quilt shroud composed of details from paintings inside. Later this year, the monumental birthday present will be unwrapped to reveal a pristinely restored facade. But for me, the Prado experience is personal. I moved to Spain from New York City in 2002, and the Prado was absolutely part of the reason I chose to live in Madrid over Barcelona or Seville. My first assignment as a journalist was a story on the Prado’s expansion, designed by Rafael Moneo, though I would have to wait five years to write it as legal battles and construction delays pushed the opening to 2007. Later, I followed Gabriele Finaldi, currently the director of London’s National Gallery, but then deputy director of the Prado, on the whirlwind 45-minute highlights tour he often gave to visiting heads of state. And whether they want it or not, visiting family and friends are subjected to my own highlights tour of the Prado. But this year, amid the hoopla surrounding the anniversary, I found myself wondering if, after 17 years and more than 200 visits to the museum, was I — like the pre-Napoleon Ferdinand VII — so accustomed to the highlights that I took everything else for granted? I decided to celebrate the bicentennial by renewing my knowledge of the entire museum — every gallery, vestibule and passageway in which art is displayed. Fast forward to 10 a.m. on a chilly Tuesday in January. Even as I stood amid the morning rush at the Prado’s entrance, scanning a floor plan with the nearly 120 galleries I would navigate, I never expected I’d be in the museum for seven hours. In fact, I envisioned myself home by 2 p.m., enjoying some leftover albondigas (meatballs) and a siesta before making the school run to fetch my kids at 4 p.m. Madrid Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas Museo Naval Thyssen-Bornemisza Paseo del Prado Prado parque de El retiro Royal Botanical Garden CaixaForum Madrid Reina Sofia 1/4 mile By The New York Times But once inside, circumstances quickly intervened — and by circumstances I mean lingering in galleries I typically breezed through; resting on a bench while surreptitiously listening to elementary school children decide which baby is Jesus (he’s the one with the halo in “The Adoration of the Magi,” by Rubens); getting to know a slew of sexy Greek and Roman mythological figures, some of whose names and heroic attributes were a revelation to me; and discovering some new (again, to me) Spanish artists of astonishing talent. So, albondigas be damned, there I was at 3 p.m. in the museum cafe, scarfing down a wedge of tortilla española and frantically arranging for someone else to pick up my children, before wandering back to the galleries where I’d remain — thirsty, hungry and exhausted, at times, but blissfully happy — until 5 p.m. There is no one designated route to follow through the Prado and the numerical order given to the galleries doesn’t help much as Gallery 1 connects to Galleries 4, 24 and 42, but not to Gallery 2, so visitors can expect to occasionally double back to move on. I began my tour in Gallery 75 on the ground level in the 19th-century galleries. In the art world, there is not much love for Spanish 19th-century painting after the great Francisco de Goya, who died in 1828. But the galleries handily illustrate the period of the museum’s founding, starting with a regal portrait by Goya of a distrustful-looking King Ferdinand VII. Known as “el Rey Felón” (the Felon King), he was something of a retrograde despot who, as crown prince, conspired against his father, and as king, abolished Spain’s first constitution. If the Prado was his great gift to Spain, then perhaps Goya’s great gift to posterity was the ability to convey Ferdinand’s devious character in a portrait that the king himself would approve. Though she died a year before the museum opened, Ferdinand’s wife and pro-museum influencer, Maria Isabel de Braganza, is here as well, sculpted in marble in the style of a Roman empress by José Álvarez Cubero. And there’s a marvelously large 1787 wooden architectural model of the Prado itself that looks like an elaborate royal toy. Neighboring galleries display pastoral landscapes, portraits of bourgeois matrons, and melodramatic history paintings that may not appeal to everyone, but certainly reveal the exquisitely descriptive manner of 19th-century Spanish painting. On my visit, a group of high school students sat on the floor in front of Goya’s “The Second of May, 1808,” discussing the swirling street battle depicted, while others tried to decipher his enigmatic “black paintings”: images of witchcraft and raw human brutality painted in the turbulent aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. After those unsettling works, Galleries 71 through 74 provide a welcome intermezzo of gleaming Greek and Roman sculptures. Though it’s little known, the Prado displays more than 250 sculptures, including several purchased in Rome by Velázquez on behalf of King Philip IV in the 17th century. Heading back toward the center of the museum, the tour takes on more chronological coherence, starting with the Italian Renaissance. With wealth pouring in from the American colonies from the 16th century onward, Spain’s rulers had deep pockets for buying art. The first Hapsburg emperor, Charles V, and his son Philip II had the taste to match their resources, and acquired the best of the best. Exploring Gallery 49 and 56B is like stepping into a textbook of Italian Renaissance and Mannerist art with no fewer than seven glorious Raphaels, as well as works by Mantegna, Fra Angelico, Botticelli, Correggio, Andrea del Sarto, Bronzino and Parmigianino. There’s even an anonymous version of the “Mona Lisa,” likely painted by one of Leonardo da Vinci’s pupils, in the same room at the same time as the Louvre’s most famous painting. With so many beloved masterpieces, it’s easy to just ricochet from painting to painting. Under Charles V, the Flanders region also became linked to the Spanish crown as cities like Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp were important financial centers and the heart of a thriving art market. One work not to be missed is Rogier van der Weyden’s “Descent from the Cross.” Instead of revealing a window into another realm, the artist’s shallow pictorial space pushes the nearly life-size figures taking Christ’s body off the cross into our world, making the pathos — translucent tears stream down several faces — all the more powerful. It’s so moving that people often drift away from it without noticing that hanging nearby are paintings by artists like Robert Campin and Hans Memling that would be stars in any other museum. While the school groups slipped off for lunch, the throngs of grown-ups in the Flemish galleries were thickening. Since I love art but hate crowds, I didn’t get into the melee in front of Hieronymus Bosch’s famous triptych “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” a cinematic and fantastically freakish portrayal of the fall from paradise to hell, but went instead to his other works, such as “The Haywain,” and those by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Albrecht Dürer and Joachim Patinir, the latter a painter of luminous landscapes with scarcely a penitent saint or writhing sinner in sight. It was 1 p.m., my iPhone had already clocked 7,600 steps and I still had two floors to go. At this point, I would typically have headed to the main level where the art shifts gear to the dramatic Baroque of which Spanish masters were among the standard bearers. On this day, however, I had promised to first reacquaint myself with the Renaissance in Spain at the building’s far northern end. Recent Prado exhibitions have successfully “resurrected” some 15th- and 16th-century Spanish artists, including Luis de Morales and Bartolomé Bermejo. New to me was the artist Juan de Juanes, whose six exquisite panels created for the altar of Valencia’s Church of St. Stephen are now given pride of place in recently reinstalled galleries. Considered the finest painter in Valencia of the 16th century, his “Portrait of a Knight of the Order of Santiago” reveals how subtly and skillfully he blended Italian concepts of courtly portraiture with sumptuous surface detail. One flight up from the Spanish Renaissance galleries is Gallery 1, displaying a single work: Leone Leoni’s imposing 1551 bronze sculpture, “Emperor Charles V and the Fury.” The emperor’s exquisitely made suit of armor comes off to reveal a heroic nude beneath. Leoni was a favorite of the Hapsburgs, and sculptures of other family members (though none that bare it all) are displayed in the cloister gallery of the Jeronimos wing. From Gallery 1, the masterpieces come fast and furious. Galleries 40 to 44 reveal, in sometimes overwhelming abundance, the sensuality and lush colors of Giovanni Bellini, Lorenzo Lotto, Veronese and other masters of the Venetian School of painting. The Prado has more paintings by Titian, the godfather of Venetian painting, than any other museum — most of them emblematic works like “The Andrians,” “Venus and Adonis” and “Virgin Dolorosa,” which influenced generations of artists. The Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens came to Madrid in the 17th century as both a diplomat and an artist, frequently copying works in the royal collection by Titian and others. He also painted works of his own for the Spanish kings. Many of them line the 367-foot-long central gallery that forms the spine of the Prado and creates a visual nexus, revealing the links between the great masters of Spanish painting — El Greco, Ribera, Zurbarán, Maíno, Velázquez and Murillo — and their Italian and Flemish forebears. Strolling the gallery, one feels the tug of creativity across a golden century. But halfway through it I felt pangs of hunger. It was 3 p.m. and I needed a break, a bite and someone to collect my kids from school. I ran to the museum’s cafe, though on another day I would have headed to one of several worthwhile restaurants nearby, such as Café Murillo, a local joint that is popular with both stylish madrileños and Michelle Obama (who’s been twice), or Trattoria Sant'Arcangelo, a cozy Italian spot that often serves as the cantina for senior Prado staff. In warm weather the museum has a lovely outdoor cafe with yummy sandwiches and yummier sangria that might have kept me from going back inside to finish my mission. When I did venture back in, I was lucid enough to focus on my quest for surprises. Several presented themselves in the form of a gallery with more than a dozen paintings by the French painters Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain that I never knew existed here. Ditto for another gallery of paintings by Anthony Van Dyck that I had somehow walked past for 17 years. “Velázquez alone is worth the whole trip,” wrote the French painter Édouard Manet of his Prado visit in 1865. Velázquez, he noted, is the “painters’ painter,” so little wonder that the likes of John Singer Sargent, Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon would make similar pilgrimages to study the works displayed in Galleries 7 through 18. Artists of the Spanish “golden age” in the 17th century seemed to delight in manipulating paint on the canvas to create dazzlingly realistic effects, such as the light shimmering on silk gowns in Velázquez's ""Las Meninas,"" or the churning clouds in the apricot-and-lavender skies of El Greco. Spanish ‘naturalism’ — painting objects and people as they actually appear — can have a deeper emotional impact, as seen in the candor and humanity of Velázquez's portraits of buffoons or the austerity of Zurbarán’s nearly all black-and-white paintings, like “Agnus Dei,” which conveys the solemnity of Catholic Spain. These galleries are the heart of my own Prado highlights tour, and even with my legs begging for rest, I spent more than an hour there. By the dawn of the 18th-century, Spain had a new ruling dynasty, the Bourbons, but the pace of royal collecting and commissioning remained apace. The Prado’s large collection of Goya’s portraits — including one of King Charles IV and his family that features his already devious-looking son Fernando — remind me that the artist’s canny ability to reveal a subject’s hapless or sinister character speaks across the centuries. Before heading to the third floor to delight in the frolic of Goya’s tapestry cartoons, I got a whiff of fresh coffee and, sensing I’d cut myself calorically short with that wee omelet for lunch, I followed my nose into the tiny new Café Jonicos and cookie shop tucked behind the central gallery. Sipping and chewing in surprising proximity to Rubens’s “Three Graces,” I mused on how much had changed since I had arrived in Madrid, when the Prado was among the most old-school of the world’s big-name museums, with surprisingly limited weekend and holiday hours, endless lines and a lackluster shop and cafe. Today, it’s a model of accessibility, open a minimum of nine hours a day (two of them with free admission), online ticket sales, hands-on exhibitions for the vision-impaired, a guide for the L.G.B.T. community, free online courses available to anyone, and now a coffee and cookie bar. More impressive still is what’s grown up around it — not just in my time, but in the 200 years since it was founded. Once on the edge of the city, the Prado, which means ‘meadow,’ is now the heart of one of the world’s most vibrant and diverse art districts — with the Reina Sofia Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, the Royal Botanical Garden, National Museum of Decorative Arts and the CaixaForum Madrid art space, not to mention the extraordinary Naval Museum, literally steps away. And at least 100 galleries, design and antiques shops line the surrounding streets. While no one needs to spend seven hours in one building, it would be easy to spend several days indulging in art appreciation in the neighborhood. After nearly 12,000 steps (about six miles), my final stop was a new, almost vault-like gallery tucked under the eaves in the North Tower, showcasing one final surprise: a collection of nearly 150 exquisite hardstone-and-rock-crystal goblets, platters and other objects adorned with gold and silver and known as the Dauphin’s Treasure. Maybe I was delirious at this point, but these stunning and delicate objects displayed next to the extraordinary padded leather cases that perfectly mimic the shape of the objects they carry — and are also centuries old — provide a fitting metaphor for the Prado itself: artistic perfection inside and out.

2019,"A Bar for Spain’s Radical Right, Run by a Chinese Immigrant","Madrid Dispatch MADRID — Step into Bar Oliva, a cafe in a southern suburb of Madrid, and you step back 44 years. Gen. Francisco Franco, the far-right dictator, died in 1975, but his spirit lives on at the bar, where portraits of him hang from the walls, his bust stands behind the counter, his face peers from the labels of wine bottles and a map of his victorious campaign during the Spanish Civil War droops above a table. “Franco presente!” a sign beside the door declares. “Franco is here.” And so are the far right. The flag of a disbanded far-right party is draped above the television. Several customers say they’ll vote in the coming general election for Vox, a xenophobic party that is likely to become the first far-right group in four decades to enter the Spanish Parliament. And the bar is one of 12 marked on a map of fascist-friendly establishments in Spain that is being circulated among Vox supporters. “People come from across Spain to see this place,” the owner said on a recent Saturday night. “They come to the Valley of the Fallen,” the memorial west of Madrid where Franco was buried, he said. “And then they come to me,” added the owner, Xianwei Chen. Mr. Chen, as his name might suggest, is something of a surprise. The owner of a bar festooned with Spanish flags and frequented by xenophobes is, in fact, Chinese. And this is an irony not lost on his regulars. “We used to joke to him,” said Jesús López, a 51-year-old truck driver. “If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.” Nevertheless, Mr. Chen has done his best to ready himself for a Franquist resurrection. He has played host to Franco’s descendants at the bar; a group photograph of the meeting hangs on the wall opposite the civil war map. Until his neighbors complained, he flew the flag of Franco-era Spain from his apartment balcony, which overlooks the cafe’s southern front. His 4-year-old son, meanwhile, is named Franco-Xi. Though Franco banned all independent political parties and trade unions, censored all newspapers and oversaw the deaths of hundreds of thousands of captured opponents after his coup in 1936, Mr. Chen finds much to admire in the former dictator. “People say that in Franco’s time, people had no freedom — but it was a different time,” said Mr. Chen, 41, by way of breezy explanation. “Look, thanks to Franco, Spain was not involved in the Second World War. Thanks to Franco, Spain has social security. And he built the reservoirs, without any other country’s help.” Mr. Chen’s path to Francophilia has been an unlikely one. Born in China, he spent more than half his life in Qingtian, a coastal county near Shanghai that has sent hundreds of thousands of emigrants to Italy and Spain. In 1999, Mr. Chen joined them, beginning work at a Spanish plastics manufacturer run by a cousin. Gradually he moved into the hospitality business and, in 2010, bought Bar Oliva. To start with, he ran it as a regular bar. But after learning more about Franco, and liking what he learned, Mr. Chen decided in 2013 to turn the place into a monument to him. His goal was, in part, to rehabilitate the Caudillo’s reputation. “People talk a lot about Franco,” Mr. Chen said, “but they don’t know him.” To Franco’s critics, Mr. Chen is right — but not for the reasons he intended. Many Spaniards have yet to acknowledge Franco’s brutality properly, said Antonio Maestre, a prominent leftist journalist. Bar Oliva, positioned on a major crossroads and accepted as part of the fabric of the local community, is a symptom of that failure. In a country where Franco’s name has been removed from many street signs, and his statue pulled from most public spaces, Bar Oliva can be framed as an oddity. But it is equally emblematic of a Spain in which Franquist politicians were allowed to retain prominent roles in public life, and Franco-era crimes remain not only unpunished but unacknowledged. Despite efforts to disinter Franco’s body, his grave continues to be a site of pilgrimage, while thousands of his victims remain in unmarked mass graves. The bar’s “mere existence,” said Mr. Maestre, highlights the “total acceptance of this culture of exaltation of the dictatorship” within contemporary Spanish society. The revulsion of a family of leftists who walked into the bar by mistake suggests this acceptance is not universal, though. “It’s the first time I’ve come here, and it’s the last time I’ll come here,” said Valeria Martínez, a gardener sharing some Spanish ham with her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend. “We’re just staying for the ham.” But the attendance of 12 uniformed police officers at the bar that night, unconcerned by what their presence suggested about their political preferences, seemed to underscore Mr. Maestre’s wider point. The officers, who left their cars parked illegally outside, came in and out of the bar all evening, seemingly using it as a kind of common room. The 23 police and army caps hanging above the counter — all donated to Mr. Chen by serving officers, he said — showed that their attendance was no aberration. And in general, business seems to be up, Mr. Chen said. The rise of Vox, and the Catalan secession crisis, has drawn more customers to his pub, he reckoned. “A lot of people who had this nationalist feeling inside them have lost their fear,” he said. “They’re not scared of expressing themselves.”",The New York Times
2019,A Beef Feast From Vietnam Gets a New York Showcase,"Restaurant Review 9 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The main attraction at Madame Vo BBQ, now two months into its run on Second Avenue in the East Village, is a seven-course dinner on the theme of beef. This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you’d expect if you’ve eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo. Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple’s new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram puréed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef — bo la lot — are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan’s own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ’s menu. But once you’ve tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the sautéed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn’t taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they’d arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that’s rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

2019,A Beloved Restaurant Where Fried Chicken Achieves Its Highest Form,"THE 212 Charles Gabriel has been serving up sublime soul food for decades in Harlem, even as many of the neighborhood’s most cherished restaurants have closed. Fried chicken, bathed overnight in buttermilk and seasoned with Charles Gabriel’s secret spice mix, with sides of mac and cheese and collard greens.CreditCreditNina Westervelt In this series for T, the author Reggie Nadelson revisits New York institutions that have defined cool for decades, from time-honored restaurants to unsung dives. A February night in Harlem, 7 in the evening, and at Charles’ Country Pan Fried Chicken, a faint aroma wafts out on the cold night air. At 132nd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, Charles’ is a storefront restaurant; nothing fancy, it’s jammed in the middle of a block and has an orange awning featuring a chicken dressed up as a chef. Inside the long narrow room, the fluorescent lighting does not flatter, and there are only seats for about 15 or so, but who cares? You’ve come for the fried chicken. It’s a busy night. Charles Gabriel, chef and owner, is still downstairs in the kitchen frying up chicken pieces in one of the dozen black cast-iron skillets he prizes, sending up fresh batches one at a time. There are historians who claim that fried chicken came from Scotland first. But for most Harlemites it came from the South and some of the best by way of Charles Gabriel, who’s been cooking it up for decades, first from a food truck, then at a restaurant on 151st Street and now at the current location. Nostalgia can be a sweet poison, but old traditions like Charles’ make New York worth living in. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] This is the Platonic ideal of fried chicken, the essence of a bird, moist, tender, mouthwatering in its crispy delicately seasoned crust, every batch seasoned three times, constantly turned, gently pan-fried in soybean oil, low in saturated fat — in case you’ve been reading health columns that say fried chicken can kill you; anyhow, this is chicken I’d die for. Apparently so would regulars Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Wesley Snipes. On the most recent Super Bowl Sunday, Charles sold 2,000 pieces of chicken. Coming up from the kitchen with freshly fried chicken, Charles greets an older woman by name, kisses a little girl in a pink winter jacket. “Harlem has a lot of love for Charles,” says Karen Murray, a friend and occasional eating pal who is otherwise a singer and voice-over actor. With her husband Curtis Archer, she’s come to meet me for dinner. The little girl in pink announces that she “loves the chicken.” She knows what she’s talking about. In 2018, Charles was a semifinalist in the James Beard Awards. “The chicken is seasoned to perfection, a component often missing in fried chicken,” says Karen, as we consider our first pieces with lust. To tell the truth, she and I have both been on no-carb diets since New Year’s, but one bite of the chicken and we’re both lost to it. The skin, as it slides off, has a lovely crunch; the juicy flesh gives way in your mouth. People still waiting in line eye us enviously. You get a couple of sides with your chicken: Karen’s working on mac and cheese, I have yams, and there’s okra, collard greens, black-eyed peas, white rice. Charles serves smothered pork chops, oxtail and barbecue, but most people go for the chicken. “Just a buttermilk-and-egg wash overnight,” says Charles. “Dip it in A.P. flour, salt and pepper, then a few secret extras,” he adds, with a faint smile. While he’s frying the chicken, he turns it over and over and seasons it three times. “That’s all,” he says, as if anyone could do it, but no one else has invested a lifetime of history, passion, bad times and good in making it perfect. Born in rural North Carolina, one of 21 kids, Charles learned to cook from his mother. His own two sons live in the South now and both cook. I ask him if he might go back. “I have memories,” he says plainly. “We lived on a plantation. My parents were sharecroppers. When I was 6 or 7, I got up at dawn to go to the cotton fields and help with the picking.” He walked four or five miles to school and by 12 he was milking cows. At 20, he followed his brother to New York and he arrived in the middle of the 1965 blackout. “I was always cooking,” he says. “Before I had a restaurant, I had a table in the park, then I had a food truck.” His original restaurant on 151st Street was a gathering place; people often tell Charles they ate there as kids. Rising rents and a bad landlord forced him out. He struggled to survive. “The new Harlem food landscape has been changing since around 2000 when new eateries started opening and the historic landmarks started to shutter,” says Curtis, who works for the Harlem Development Corporation. “Harlem was the black capital and had a lot of people from the South. After a long night of partying, friends would all gather to break bread, often at soul food restaurants. This was comfort food,” he says. With all the new apartment buildings going up, fancy restaurants opening and millennials swooping in for the neighborhood’s cool, things have changed for Charles as well. “A lot of young people now want to grab and go,” he says. The sides he cooks are now all vegetarian, a concession to some of the new young Harlem crowd. As it gets late, Charles and Curtis shoot the breeze about the Harlem they knew once, the people they knew, the places they ate. Wilson’s, Copeland’s, Flash Inn; all gone, Curtis says. “It wasn’t just about food but community,” says Curtis. The talk invests the meal with a sense of loss and survival. But, then, this is New York. This is Harlem. For dessert, there’s the homemade peach cobbler and rich banana pudding — Charles makes his own custard. Karen, like me, when it comes to that diet, has now completely fallen. With a sigh, she puts down her spoon and says, “It’d be great to see Charles’s business expand,” adding, “I don’t believe the quality would ever suffer. As mild-mannered as he is, I can’t see Charles tolerating that for one second!”",The New York Times
2019,A Better Way to Break Up Big Tech,"The Shift AUSTIN, Tex. — Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation — besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters — was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways. The first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other — sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace — but not both. “You can be an umpire or you can own teams,” she said. “But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game.” Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates. Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials. But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written. Ms. Warren’s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I’d offer a few edits. Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren’s plan — and it’s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules — is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems. Lawmakers don’t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That’s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard. Instead, Ms. Warren’s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces — a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google — and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.) The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers. The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries. Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision. Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google’s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing. Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush. The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn’t giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete? Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies — each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own — gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse. For example, let’s imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company’s streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix’s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon’s streaming-video team should copy. To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon’s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address. An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both. Get rid of the “app tax.” Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers. At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the “Apple tax”: a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google’s mobile app store charges similar fees.) These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms’ strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple’s App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition. Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors. Don’t get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren’s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook’s ability to “shut down a debate” over its power. The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook’s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be “Facebook’s official quiz game” or whatever. But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship. “She’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,” Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter. One problem with the debate over the tech companies’ power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook’s shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz’s unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for “neutral platforms.” The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship. The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies’ power, while leaving their fortresses intact.",The New York Times
2019,"A Billionaire’s Housewarming Party for 13,000 Fancy New Yorkers","The rich and famous came out for the V.I.P. opening of Hudson Yards. And a grueling film about a terrorist attack at a hotel. 10 Photos View Slide Show › Stephen M. Ross, the billionaire developer, was taking a victory lap at last week’s V.I.P. opening of the Shops and Restaurants at Hudson Yards, a day before the $25 billion neighborhood-in-a-box opened to the Instagram masses. “It’s the largest project ever done in America,” Mr. Ross, the chairman of the Related Companies, said on the red carpet, with evident satisfaction. “What I’m wondering is, I’m 78, what can I do next?” But what of criticism that the gilded precinct, with its multi-million-dollar penthouses and mall full of luxury boutiques and pricey restaurants, is affordable only to fellow billionaires? “When you’re building something new, of this quality, obviously it’s not for those. …,” said Mr. Ross, choosing his words carefully. “It obviously takes a high income to afford it.” An estimated 13,000 members of the New York gentry stepped out of their carriages and attended the private opening, including, Coco Rocha, Anne Hathaway and Dylan Sprouse, waggishly nursing an unlit cigarette. Inside Neiman Marcus, Liza Minnelli and Charli XCX performed for a crowd that included Karlie Kloss, Vera Wang, Diane von Furstenberg and Katie Holmes. At Estiatorio Milos, a nearby Greek restaurant known for its exotic seafood market, diners included Marla Maples, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen. Everywhere amid the chaos — it felt like a Black Friday shopping spree for the 0.01 percent — stores and waiters were feeding the multitude with tapas, oysters, sushi, charcuterie and endless refills of wine and liquor. Considering the scale, it all went off rather smoothly. Back on the red carpet, those who stand to profit from Hudson Yards were insisting how affordable it was. “It’s not that expensive to live here,” said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, which is handling the sale of approximately $1 billion worth of real estate at the development. “The entrance price at Hudson Yards was just under $3 million.” You don’t consider $3 million for the cheapest one-bedroom apartment exorbitant? “Yes, it’s expensive,” Ms. Liebman added. “But it’s not billionaire expensive.” There was chaos of a different kind in “Hotel Mumbai,” a docudrama directed by Anthony Maras about the 2008 terrorist attacks at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel and other landmarks in India’s commercial capital. The two-hour film is gripping enough by itself. But the Sunday night screening at the Museum of Modern Art, coming just days after the terrorist attacks in New Zealand, was particularly challenging. “It’s unfortunately timely,” said Armie Hammer, who plays a fictional American caught up in the incident. “The message of the film is the humanity present within an attack like this. In the face of abject terror, all of these people were able to put aside their differences to try and survive something hellacious.” His onscreen wife, played by Nazanin Boniadi, said: “The film is about extremism, which can take hold in any ideology. And how important we recognize that this isn’t confined to any country or faith.” The after-party took place at another hotel, Ian Schrager’s recently opened Times Square Edition, where fellow cast members, including Dev Patel, Anupam Kher and Jason Isaacs, were joined by Damian Lewis, Ryan Eggold, Clive Davis and Katie Couric. Mr. Hammer voiced his support for Will Connolly, a.k.a., “Egg Boy,” the 17-year-old Australian who became a viral sensation last week for smashing an egg against the head of an anti-immigration politician. “That kid is my hero, we need more of that,” Mr. Hammer said. “This guy” — meaning the Australian senator who blamed the recent terror attack on Muslim immigration — “deserved it. We’ve had enough of this isolationism and xenophobia.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Bite-Size Square of Canada’s History, Culture and Craving","How the Nanaimo bar, a three-layer no-bake treat from British Columbia, conquered a nation’s palate. The Canadian city of Nanaimo, in British Columbia, has been a scrappy outpost of the Hudson’s Bay Company, a coal mining center and a timber town. But its place in history may be forever entwined with its culinary namesake, one of the world’s sweetest treats. The Nanaimo bar (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) is a three-layer no-bake square that for the last seven decades or so has been a steadfast source of comfort to Canadians at weddings and funerals, birthdays and bar mitzvahs. Across the country, you’ll find the sugary bars for sale at small-town gas stations and supermarkets, where they compete with Nanaimo bar baking kits. In 2017, the Tim Hortons restaurant chain created a filled doughnut with the flavors of the Nanaimo bar for the nation’s sesquicentennial, a nod to its status. Even its name is proudly Canadian. “I like to call it the Kardashian of Canadian desserts because really, if it had been named anything else, I don’t think it would have lasted,” said Lenore Newman, the author of “Speaking in Cod Tongues: A Canadian Culinary Journey.” “But it’s the Nanaimo bar, so of course people make it.” The square looks something like a geological cross section. Its base is sedimentary: coconut and chopped walnuts bound together by a buttery silt of cocoa and crushed graham crackers. A middle layer of yellow buttercream teeters on the brink of liquefaction. And its top crust of chocolate, hard and brittle, thaws like the Arctic tundra the longer it lingers at room temperature. “It’s that balance of sweetness and texture that makes it just so appealing, and it looks pretty,” said Anna Olson, a pastry chef and the host of the Food Network Canada show “Bake With Anna Olson.” “For the home cook, it’s an attractive dessert: It doesn’t look sloppy, it doesn’t look crafty.” The Nanaimo bar’s story begins with the so-called dainty recipes of the mid-20th century, treats engineered to be whipped up for unexpected company from pantry staples. “The base layer was one of these 1950s recipes that circulated among housewives in mill towns all around the British Empire,” said Dr. Newman, a geography professor at the University of the Fraser Valley, in British Columbia, who also noted that a New Zealand dessert, the caramel slice, has a similar base. Dr. Newman believes that the women of Nanaimo added the middle and top layers. The first mention that she and a student, Shea Wind, could find was in a 1953 recipe in The Vancouver Sun for London smog bars, which stated that they were also called Nanaimo bars. The use of custard powder — an instant custard mix, which was a pantry staple of the empire, devised for those with egg allergies — gave their new dainty its distinctive yellow belt. Around the same time, bakers in Canada’s prairie provinces were serving up a similar creation, also called the smog bar, which Jean Paré, 91, learned how to make from her mother, Ruby Elford, in Irma, Alberta, a town of 250 about 110 miles southeast of Edmonton. “I forget how many do’s I went to before I finally found that they were called Nanaimo bars by other people,” she said in a phone interview, using an old-fashioned term for a gathering. Mrs. Paré (pronounced Perry) is a well-known Canadian cookbook author whose “Company’s Coming” books have sold by the millions. She included Nanaimo bars in her first book in the series, “150 Delicious Squares,” in 1981. Before she wrote cookbooks, Mrs. Paré catered events. Nanaimo bars were almost always on the dessert-square tray, which would make an appearance anytime a sweet snack was required, often at the “midnight lunch” served after the dinner and dancing at Albertan wedding receptions. “I didn’t have to bake them, and they froze so well,” she said. Only once, she said, did she decide to sub out the Nanaimo bar, and people asked for them by name: “So that was the last time I ever tried that.” Susan Mendelson was a university student in Vancouver in the 1970s when she started making the bars and selling them at a local theater, using a recipe from a classmate. They were a hit, and she opened a catering company, the Lazy Gourmet, with a friend. She published the basic recipe in her first cookbook, “Mama Never Cooked Like This,” and variations in subsequent ones, including the official cookbook of the 1986 world’s fair in Vancouver, which Dr. Newman credits with helping to spread the bar’s fame. Ms. Mendelson’s version of the bar was so good that the novelist Margaret Atwood included it in her “Canlit Foodbook,” which compiled writing and recipes from Canadian authors. And the city of Nanaimo finally took notice of its well-traveled square. A mascot, Nanaimo Barney, turned up at public functions, and a contest was held in the 1980s to find the ultimate Nanaimo bar recipe. Joyce Hardcastle, a widow with two children, pulled a recipe, provenance unknown, from her recipe box and decided to enter Nanaimo’s contest. Allergic to walnuts, she swapped in almonds. And she made the bars with European-style unsalted butter, rather than the salted butter that was often used. “I really think that the city didn’t want peanut butter in them, or mint or liqueur,” Ms. Hardcastle said. “I think they just wanted something basic, and that’s what I did — the really basic Nanaimo bars — and that’s what won, to my surprise.” She has since sold tea towels and aprons printed with her recipe, and has made so many bars that she can tilt her baking pan so the molten chocolate forms a topping as smooth as freshly Zambonied ice. Nanaimo, for its part, has designated local restaurants and cafes where people can try the bars, in the spirit of the food-tourism trails that two regions in Ontario have created for that other signature Canadian dessert: the butter tart. Despite all the variations on the Nanaimo bar — versions exist made with peanut butter, mocha and cranberry — there are still rules to be followed, said Ms. Olson, the pastry chef. “You’re allowed to change it and alter it, but you still have to respect the crust, filling, chocolate topping,” she said. “You can still call it a Nanaimo bar by changing up the flavors.” The buttercream takes well to flavorings, and you can experiment with the nuts in the base layer. (Though Ms. Atwood, a purist, prefers walnuts.) If you do change up the nuts, you want a tender choice, like almonds or pecans. “A hazelnut might show its texture and be too crunchy,” Ms. Olson said. Custard powder may be one reason the Nanaimo bar hasn’t spread farther south. While it is available online and at some specialty stores in the United States, it remains a relatively obscure ingredient to Americans. Some recipes say instant vanilla pudding can be used as a substitute, but that makes the buttercream clumpy, and the finished bar lacks that essential yellow hue. “I have a container of Bird’s Custard Powder that sits in my pantry because its only function is for Nanaimo bars,” Ms. Olson said. “I wouldn’t use it for anything else. I make my own custard for any other situation.” Recipe: Nanaimo Bars Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,A Black Man Spent 7 Years in Prison. Then a Court Changed the Rules on Racial Bias.,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Otis Boone insisted he was innocent from the time he was accused of two robberies in 2011, when he was 19. But the two victims who had their cellphones snatched by a knife-wielding man picked Mr. Boone out of separate police lineups. Though there was no physical evidence, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Mr. Boone, of Brooklyn, took his appeal to New York’s highest court, where a majority of judges ruled that the jury should have been told that witnesses often struggle to identify strangers of a different race because mistaken identifications are a major factor in wrongful convictions. Mr. Boone is black; the victims were white. The Court of Appeals granted Mr. Boone a retrial and made it mandatory going forward for judges to explain what psychologists call the “cross-race effect” to jurors whenever a case involves a witness identifying of a suspect of a different race. At his second trial last month, public defenders presented evidence that Mr. Boone was a mile away from one of the robberies five minutes before it occurred. He was acquitted on March 1, after spending seven of the last eight years behind bars. Mr. Boone, 27, wept at the verdict. Some of the jurors hugged him and his fiancée. One juror said the panel had reached a decision in under five minutes. “To be serving someone else’s time is a hardship,” Mr. Boone said in an interview. “It was many times that I wanted to give up.” Mr. Boone’s ordeal illustrates a shift in how the state’s criminal justice system handles witness identifications. They were once considered strong evidence of guilt, and they remain a persuasive tool for prosecutors. But psychologists who study memory have long warned that witness identifications are often shaky after a crime because of factors like stress, the short duration of the incident and the presence of a weapon. Identifications can also be influenced by a witness’s biases and by subtle cues from the police and prosecutors. “Because memory is so full of holes and flawed, as a witness gets exposed to a suspect, their memory of the case moves toward the suspect,” Nancy Franklin, a psychology professor at Stony Brook University, said. She testified for the defense at trial. “I think the Boone case presents a powerful example of the sorts of issues that my field has uncovered that lead to false convictions.” About 70 percent of the 364 convictions overturned with DNA evidence in the United States since 1992 involved witnesses who identified the wrong assailant, and nearly half of those mistaken identifications involved a witness and suspect of different races, according to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that seeks exonerations. The 2017 decision by the Court of Appeals in Mr. Boone’s case made New York one of only a handful of states with a cross-race effect rule. (New Jersey and Massachusetts are among those with similar rules.) In New York, some defense lawyers refer to it as “the Boone rule.” Previously, the instruction was required only if the defense requested it after an expert testified at trial about witness testimony. Now, judges are required to give the instruction upon request, unless neither side disputes the identity of the suspect. The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, supports the new rule, but prosecutors have said they remain convinced Mr. Boone is guilty. “We believe the evidence supported his guilt, and that the jury in the second trial should have been allowed to hear evidence regarding the high degree of confidence the witnesses expressed in their identifications within days of the incidents,” the spokesman, Oren Yaniv, said. Some prosecutors say the new rule is unfair because it suggests a racial bias on the part of a witness without any context from experts or testimony about the witness’s life. One Court of Appeals judge on the seven-member panel said his colleagues went too far in making it mandatory. John Wixted, a psychology professor at the University of California, San Diego, said the Court of Appeals erred in focusing the rule on race instead of on the witness’s confidence in making the initial identification. Witnesses who are highly confident when identifying a suspect almost always pick the culprit, regardless of race, he said. He testified at Mr. Boone’s trial for the prosecution. “It’s confidence that tells you what you want to know, not race,” he said in an interview. “You’re not going to get a lot of high-confidence identifications with cross-race, but when you do, they’re highly reliable.” In nearly all wrongful convictions where the authorities have made note of witnesses’ confidence, he added, witnesses signaled they were not sure about whom they picked, but the police, prosecutors and judges failed to understand what that meant. Mr. Boone has filed notice that he plans to sue the city for false arrest and malicious prosecution. Bess Stiffelman, the trial lawyer who represented him for the Legal Aid Society, said the authorities showed “a shocking disregard for the risk of false identification here and for whether or not they may have arrested an innocent suspect.” A spokesman for the Law Department declined to comment. Phillip Walzak, a deputy commissioner and spokesman for the Police Department, said the claim was under review. The lead investigator, Maureen Sheehan, testified at Mr. Boone’s trial that she had not reviewed the case notes before administering the lineup and that she did not know detectives had recovered one of the victims’ phones and returned it to him. The victims in Mr. Boone’s case were a teenager and a man in his 20s who were robbed 10 days apart in February 2011 in Midwood, an enclave for Orthodox Jews. Each time, the assailant asked for the time, prompting the victims to pull out their phones, which he then snatched. The victims said they had only a short time to see the attacker’s face, which was partially covered in the second incident, and that he had a weapon — factors that psychologists have said undermine witness identifications. Two weeks passed between the second robbery and the police lineup, which Mr. Boone’s defense said was unfair. He was on the end, standing four inches taller than the man next to him. Three of the five men used to fill out the lineup had visibly long hair, even though the witnesses said their assailant’s hair had been short. The younger victim picked Mr. Boone only after hearing him say, “What time is it?” A state policing panel recommended new guidelines for conducting lineups and photo arrays in 2017 aimed at making them fairer, and Mr. Walzak said the Police Department had adopted some of them. For instance, the officer administering the test is not allowed to know who the suspect is, a practice that helps avoid steering witnesses to the suspect. Witnesses are also asked to describe how confident they are after identifying a suspect. The protocols help to ensure the lineups and photo arrays are not “unduly suggestive,” Mr. Walzak said. By the second trial, Mr. Boone’s defense team had found evidence supporting his alibi: government records showing two transactions on his public benefits card that took place a mile away from the second robbery about five minutes before it occurred. The prosecutor tried to make the case that Mr. Boone had taken a four-minute bus ride to commit the robbery, but jurors did not believe that. “It just seemed wildly unlikely,” Meredith Coffey, one of the jurors, said. She noted that Mr. Boone had moved to Brooklyn only a couple of weeks before the first robbery occurred. Ms. Coffey, 32, of Park Slope, said she had been willing to convict based on witness testimony alone, but that she did not find it compelling in this case. The cross-race effect instruction from the judge confirmed her doubts about its reliability, she said. Mr. Boone was freed from prison in January 2018, but the experience left him struggling to trust anyone. The long wait for a retrial cost him a job because he missed so much work to appear in court, he said. There was a time when he wanted to be a police officer like one of his uncles, but now he said he had lost faith in the criminal justice system. “I want things to change,” he said. “I want justice.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Black Woman Will Soon Lead Chicago,"President Trump treats Chicago like a punching bag, but its next mayor will break boundaries. Ms. Moore is a journalist in Chicago. CHICAGO — Few voters imagined two black women would win the most votes in last Tuesday’s crowded mayoral primary race. A former police board president, Lori Lightfoot, will face a county board executive, Toni Preckwinkle, in a runoff on April 2, inaugurating a new era for the city’s racialized political landscape and notorious Democratic machine. Chicago will soon have its first black female mayor. An open seat for mayor, with no incumbent or preordained winner, is rarer than 80 degrees and sunny here in February. Voter turnout was low, at 34 percent, but the civic engagement and discourse around this election was robust. Chicago, my beautiful, darling city, is full of grit and resilience. Yet the decades of entrenched racial and economic segregation means the city is ready to combust. Residents live and breathe inequality. They see cranes downtown and too much disinvestment in their neighborhoods. A shrinking middle class reflects a city getting richer on one end and poorer on the other. Public schools suffer from inequity. Distrust of the police in black and brown communities remains constant. For national politicians, President Trump in particular, “Chicago” is shorthand for broken parts of this country. He loves to tweet about crime here without offering any meaningful solutions. My city is a punching bag. It needs help, and this election can change how outsiders see us. Last fall, Mayor Rahm Emanuel stunned many people when he announced he wouldn’t seek a third term. There was a mad scramble to replace him. By Election Day, the field had dwindled from 21 mayoral hopefuls at the peak to a still-astonishing pool of 14 candidates. They represented a mix of interests, geography, ideology, experience and race. For months, the electorate challenged candidates. Every week, multiple groups held mayoral forums on broad and niche issues — early childhood education, food justice, arts and neighborhood development. One forum billed itself as “plans not platitudes.” Engaged voters demanded answers. I’ve long lamented that elected officials neither acknowledge nor work to dismantle segregation, the defining nature of Chicago. That is slowly starting to change. One community group put together a guide in which candidates answered questions, selected by voters, on racial equity. Half the candidates answered. They fielded questions on whether they supported rent control, raising the minimum wage, reopening mental health clinics, creating green jobs in black and brown communities, replacing the police in schools with wraparound services and ending tax breaks for wealthy corporations. And voters, activists and organizers are primed to command accountability by whichever black woman takes the keys to City Hall. Money didn’t completely determine the outcome. The candidate with the biggest war chest — William Daley — had a familiar last name. His brother and father served as mayor for four decades. And the richest person in Illinois, Ken Griffin, who recently bought the most expensive home in the country, a penthouse in New York, donated $2 million to William Daley. Yet Mr. Daley still placed third. So it is indeed historic that the sun may have set on the Daley dynasty. The state of black politics in the city is changing, too, and complicates for some the idea of who a black candidate is and represents. Ms. Lightfoot and Ms. Preckwinkle won by harnessing votes across racial lines, not just by capturing the black vote. How the chips fall will be based on their message, political baggage and appeal. Ms. Preckwinkle is the Cook County Board president and a seasoned elected official on the South Side who supports criminal justice reform. She has a political base. She’s derided by some as “Queen Sugar” for having cast the tie-breaking vote for a sweetened-beverage tax in 2017 to balance the county budget. Taxpayers recoiled; the backlash was so severe that it was repealed within months. Ms. Preckwinkle also faces criticisms for being too cozy with people in office tied to corruption. Enter Ms. Lightfoot, who could also become the city’s first openly gay mayor. A powerful TV commercial presents her as an outsider, uninterested in smoke-filled, back-room deals. She was the head of Mr. Emanuel’s police reform task force that called for impressive and sweeping changes. But some people can’t reconcile her image as reformer with her past. She’s a corporate lawyer and former prosecutor, and she sat on a now-disbanded police disciplinary agency criticized for not firing bad police officers. Over the next several weeks, I imagine the two pragmatic women will compete to see who is a real progressive. The first female mayor was Jane Byrne, a white woman elected in 1979. Harold Washington was the first black mayor elected in 1983. In these first few days of the 2019 runoff, I’m already cringing at comments about Ms. Preckwinkle and Ms. Lightfoot that sound sexist — based on neither policy nor legitimate critiques. I hope regressive racial and gender politics don’t undermine this race. Black women know this double-edged sword all too well. We have a front-row seat to how black women in the public eye are treated — whether it’s not believing black girls who survived sexual abuse or questioning a woman’s blackness or her love of country. I hope that, this year, a woman leading Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, will symbolize something else. Not a proxy punching bag for the city. Natalie Y.

2019,A Boeing 737 Max Makes an Emergency Landing in Orlando,"A Boeing 737 Max 8 plane being flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing in Orlando on Tuesday afternoon after reporting an engine problem shortly after taking off, the airline said. The plane — the same type that crashed in Ethiopia earlier this month and in Indonesia in October — had a two-person flight crew but no passengers on board. It was being flown to California for “short-term storage” after the United States ordered the grounding of all 737 Max planes following the two crashes, which killed hundreds of people. The engine problem was unrelated to an automatic system on the plane designed to help it avoid stalling, which is being investigated in connection with the two crashes. “The crew followed protocol and safely landed back at the airport,” Southwest said. The Max 737, Boeing’s best-selling plane, has come under intense scrutiny after the two deadly crashes. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia. It was the first fatal accident involving a 737 Max. One hundred and eighty nine people died. On March 10, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, involving the same Max jet model, also crashed minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating Tuesday’s emergency landing.",The New York Times
2019,"A Bounce Goes Liverpool’s Way, but Rest Assured: There Will Be More","On Soccer LIVERPOOL, England — Mohamed Salah’s name flashed up on the scoreboard. It rang out of Anfield’s public address system. It rolled and roiled down the stands and washed onto the field and into the sky, infused with jubilation and wonder, with relief and belief. It was, though, wishful thinking. The last-minute goal that had given Liverpool an ill-deserved and scarcely explicable 2-1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, the strike that restored Jürgen Klopp’s team to the top of the Premier League — until Wednesday, at least — and that ensured Manchester City still cannot, technically, afford even one slip did not belong to Salah. Deep down, everyone in the stadium knew the truth: the goal, if it belonged to anyone, belonged to chaos. There is a tendency, as seasons draw to a close and prizes begin to be claimed, to imbue certain moments with particular importance, to believe that specific games and specific goals were not just decisive but defining: when trophies were won and lost, the fulcrum on which the whole season turned, the proof of the gray hand of destiny at work. Fans do it. Managers do it. Journalists and commentators do it, without fail, pretty much every Monday, obsessive saturation coverage demanding that no sooner have events ended than conclusions are drawn, that no weekend must pass without one thing or another having been decided or proved or finished. It is sport’s nod to Thomas Carlyle: a great moment theory of history. It is a comforting idea. By appointing certain moments as key, the long, exhausting stretch of a season comes to seem — even if only in retrospect — somehow more ordered; a structured, coherent whole seems to bloom from a morass of happenstance. It allows us to apportion merit, and blame, and to establish the parameters and boundaries of success. It means we can make sense of the randomness. It is, though, a myth. Seasons are, by definition, collections of moments; discerning which one is the one on which everything hinged, which one is more important than all the others, is an impossibility. For Liverpool this season, there have been half a dozen, at least. Daniel Sturridge’s late equalizer at Chelsea, way back in September, the goal that maintained an unbeaten start to the campaign; Divock Origi’s freakish winner in December’s Merseyside derby; the late penalty missed by Riyad Mahrez in October that ensured Manchester City did not win at Anfield; Origi’s miss, deep into injury time, against West Ham in February (for a reserve who has barely played this year, Origi seems to have been identified by fate as a person of immense interest). It is the same, of course, for City. The defending Premier League champion has seemed, at times, almost to breeze through much of the season, sweeping inferior opponents aside with little fuss and considerable style, but there are instants City will remember, too: the missed chances in defeat to Chelsea, perhaps, or Ricardo Pereira’s late winner for Leicester City; the shot from Sadio Mané that, somehow, did not cross the line when Liverpool visited the Etihad Stadium; the shot from Leroy Sané that, later on that evening, very much did. These are all the moments on which the season turned; not all of them can be worthy of that title. There were two alone in the final 10 minutes of Sunday’s game. First, Moussa Sissoko burst clear for Tottenham, only Virgil Van Dijk and Alisson Becker standing in his way, the chance not just to inflict untold damage Liverpool’s title hopes in his grasp. Van Dijk forced him to shoot; his effort rose and rose, flying high over the crossbar. Anfield breathed again. And then, with just a minute left to play, Trent Alexander-Arnold lifted in a cross — first time, too high, more in hope than expectation — and Salah, ghosting in at the far post, managed to meet it. His header was soft, and straight at Hugo Lloris; the moment seemed to have gone. For reasons that remain unclear, Lloris fumbled the ball. It fell onto Toby Alderweireld’s foot, and dribbled, in comical slow motion, across the line. Salah wheeled away in celebration, claiming the goal as his own, as if he only needed to believe it to make it so. It was not his goal, though. It was Alderweireld’s, if it was anyone’s, but really it was a strike against the idea that, even at this most rarefied level, there is a navigable structure to events. It was a reminder that not everything happens for a reason, that there is no overarching narrative, other than that which will be retrofitted with the benefit of hindsight; that sometimes, everything is chaos. The consequence is that, as the Premier League enters its final stretch, Liverpool has a two-point lead, but Manchester City has a game in hand. The former has the greater pressure, a three-decade wait for a league championship bearing down on a group of players who have never won a trophy together. The latter has the greater workload, with a game roughly every three days between now and mid-May, should progress be assured both in the Champions League and F.A. Cup. City is the favorite. Liverpool, as Klopp has said on several occasions, refuses to go away. The test now, perhaps, is how well Pep Guardiola’s team can cope with its hectic schedule as it chases glory on four fronts, and how well Liverpool can manage its nerves. The closest Premier League title race since 2012 will be settled by whichever frays first. Nothing, ultimately, is finished yet. All of those moments have come and gone. All of them have felt significant, seismic, in their immediate aftermath, little shafts of clarity in the overwhelming mood of uncertainty that descends on a situation this tight, this tense. There are six weeks to play, a handful of games, and there is still only one slip, one failure of concentration, one poor performance, in it. None of those moments has proved decisive: ultimately, irrevocably decisive. That is, as of now, still to come. It is April, and the season has not yet turned.",The New York Times
2019,"A Brief History of the Golan Heights, Claimed by Israel and Syria","With a midday tweet on Thursday, President Trump voiced his support of Israeli control over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of American policy. The move thrust the Golan Heights — a fertile plateau beside the Sea of Galilee that has been one of Israel’s quieter frontiers for a half-century — back into international headlines. The area covers under 500 square miles and offers expansive views over Syria and Israel, giving it strategic military importance. It was seized by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967, and since then, it has been claimed by both countries. [The Golan Heights was once an Arab rallying cry. Not anymore.] The Six-Day War of June 1967 ended in decisive victories for Israel, which seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Syrian forces began a failed attempt to reclaim the territory in 1973. That war ended with an armistice that left most of the Golan Heights in Israeli hands. In 1981, Israel passed a law that effectively annexed it. 40 Miles SYRIA LEBANON GOLAN HEIGHTS Mediterranean Sea ISRAEL Tel Aviv WEST BANK JORDAN Jerusalem GAZA STRIP By The New York Times But that move was never recognized internationally, and a United Nations Security Council resolution that year said that “the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.” There have been halting negotiations over the Golan Heights, but in 2011 the conflict in Syria introduced new tensions to the area and effectively shut down those efforts. The Golan Heights is not densely populated. According to some estimates, there are around 50,000 people, with Israeli Jewish settlers making up nearly half. The rest are mostly people of Syrian ancestry who are Druze, a religion that has been described as an offshoot of Ismaili Islam. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about conflict and consequence.] Druze residents of the Golan Heights have largely resisted obtaining Israeli citizenship and have maintained a strong connection to Syria for decades. Despite the proximity — megaphones and binoculars have connected people in the Golan Heights with friends across the border — that connection has been tested by the devastating conflict in Syria. But over all, life in the Golan Heights has been relatively tranquil compared with other places on Israel’s frontiers. For decades, the United Nations and the United States refused to recognize Israel’s seizure of the Golan Heights and the West Bank in 1967, arguing that the contours of Israel must be negotiated diplomatically. But President Trump tweeted on Thursday that “it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel’s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” adding that it was of critical importance to Israel and stability in the Middle East. His tweet came after pressure from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and it could help shore up support for Mr. Netanyahu in the embattled leader’s bid for a fifth term in hotly contested elections scheduled for April 9. But in an interview on Thursday afternoon with Fox Business Network, Mr. Trump said that he had considered recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel “for a long time” and that his decision was not meant to boost Mr. Netanyahu’s electoral chances. Mr. Trump’s tweet was not entirely out of the blue. He has already recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv and cut aid to Palestinian refugees. In November the United States voted for the first time against a symbolic resolution that the United Nations issues annually condemning Israel’s presence in the Golan Heights. Since 2011, Israeli officials have expressed relief that the Golan Heights has acted as a sort of buffer for the conflict in Syria, whose president, Bashar al-Assad, is supported by Iran. “All of you can imagine what would have happened if Israel were not in the Golan,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Wednesday during a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “We would have Iran on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.” Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Hussam Edin Aala, warned on Wednesday against Israel’s “malicious attempts to exploit the situation and the latest developments in Syria and the region to consolidate the occupation” of the Golan Heights, the Syrian state news agency, SANA, reported. But critics of Mr. Assad have noted that although he and his government have frequently talked about “liberating” the Golan Heights, they have taken little action to do so in decades. On its own, Mr. Trump’s tweet is not likely to change things in the Golan Heights. There is no negotiation underway on the area’s status, nor any expectation that Israel is going to withdraw from it. But the announcement was the latest in a series of steps under the Trump administration that have reshaped the United States’ role in conflicts between Israel and its Arab neighbors, to the benefit of Israel’s right-wing government.",The New York Times
2019,A British Interior Designer’s Tricks for Staying Organized,"In her bustling London office, Beata Heuman labels liberally, files in an antique cabinet — and still finds a place to watercolor. The interior decorator Beata Heuman perched on an antique teak step inside her Ravenscourt Park studio and showroom. CreditCreditDylan Thomas “Keeping things tidy makes me very happy,” says the interior designer Beata Heuman, seated in her homey, open-plan office in West London. The bright, vaulted space has served as the studio and showroom for her five-person team since last summer — and is a testament to the Swedish decorator’s desire to both beautify and meticulously organize her world. Heavy antique trays are neatly set with swatches of fabric, wallpaper samples and trims are lined up for clients; deep cabinet drawers are filled with files pertaining to each of the room schemes that currently fall under her careful watch. Altogether, it’s a visual itinerary of thousands of bespoke objects and furnishings. Flanked by banks of windows to the north and south, the only interruption to the prevailing sense of order and calm is the somnolent hum of passing tube trains. “People tend to think that interior design is just choosing the right cushions,” says Heuman from her desk, where a ceramic lamp with a marbleized shade sits beside a well-thumbed Fabriano Artist’s Journal and a resin sample created for a client during the nine years she worked with the British decorator Nicky Haslam. “But it’s as much about logistics as it is about creativity. I love admin. It gives me a real sense of achievement to pull everything together in an efficient way.” Heuman’s forensic eye for detail, offbeat palettes and playful irreverence — perhaps best exhibited at the Farm Girl Cafes in Chelsea and Notting Hill, as well as a growing stream of international homes — has seen her become one of England’s most beloved young designers since launching her business in 2013. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] In contrast to the Ludwig Bemelmans-inspired murals and bold, bespoke wallcoverings that decorate the 35-year-old’s nearby Hammersmith home, Heuman’s work space features cork floors and walls painted in Farrow & Ball’s Strong White. On a circular dining table in the center of the space, copies of books by Steven Gambrel and David Hicks — decorators who have long inspired her — are stacked around a terra-cotta pot planted with katsura flowers. It’s here that Heuman often sits to paint watercolor renderings of her whimsical schemes and creations. Once general practice in the world of interiors, she uses this charmingly old-fashioned brush-to-paper approach to better communicate ideas to clients. In fact, it perfectly chimes with her peculiarly English aesthetic: With a keen sense of the past, Heuman effortlessly blends periods and styles to create harmonious, vibrant spaces that are just maximalist enough. In the office, there are Matisse cutouts and haunting prints by the photographer Robin Friend alongside Dodo Egg lights and lion-footed velvet armchairs of Heuman’s own design (part of her elegant but offbeat collection of furniture, fabrics and lighting), which cleverly elevate the bank of Ikea desks that inhabit one side of the space. But no matter how eccentric Heuman’s vision, it’s always offset by a certain crisp orderliness. “I wanted to create a fun environment that’s an uplifting place to work,” she says. “We spend so much time here, it’s important for everyone’s happiness.” Here, she offers advice on how to keep interiors fresh — and stem the constant tide of clutter. When Heuman shifted her business’s headquarters from the basement of her Hammersmith home to the nearby Ravenscourt Park, the first thing she did was invest in a labeling machine. “The reality is that this is a very creative office, and we’re working on things and pulling samples out all the time, so it might not always be super tidy or in perfect order, but you know where everything is,” she says. Now, fabric swatches that were once stacked up in boxes are housed inside an antique haberdashery cabinet, whose generous glass drawers are labeled by pattern and finish — from velvet to mohair to printed cotton and linens. “I got a bit obsessive with it,” she admits. “I took it home and started labeling everything from my decanted shampoo bottles to jars of grains and polenta flour to my children’s clothing drawers. At times, my husband thinks I have gone too far.” Not only is it tidier, but in a shared space, it’s the perfect way to communicate where things should be stored. “Nowadays, there aren’t many professions that involve much filing, so I look to the past for storage,” Heuman says of the pair of tall, cast-iron lockers in dark green that flank the haberdashery cabinet. Their top shelves are often reached using a teak step that handily folds out into a table. “With interiors, there are so many swatches and samples, and so much stuff that I get to really indulge my habit,” she smiles. Heuman takes a twofold approach to storage solutions, mixing modern Ikea desks and furnishings in cream, white or navy with utilitarian pieces from the architectural reclamation experts at Retrouvius that bring personality to the space. Heuman’s mantra is to streamline, streamline, streamline. The only way to stem the tide of detritus, she says, is to have constant clear outs. She instigates fortnightly office “streamlining sessions,” continually sorting through her own papers and questioning her team about the buildup of boxes or packages. “It’s amazing how much stuff you accumulate,” she says. “Staying on top of it all is hard work. But I can concentrate so much better when there’s no paperwork to do and the space is clear.” “It’s always important to make sure everything has its place, but that’s especially true when a space is decoratively more maximalist,” says Heuman. “It gets all too heavy otherwise.” When designing for clients, Heuman begins with the furniture layout, forensically thinking through the natural home for everything from mops to tea towels to baby bottles. In her view, inspiring her clients to tidiness is the key to a scheme’s lasting success. “Our aesthetic is colorful and layered, but it always has a cleanness to it,” she says. Heuman applies Marie Kondo’s rule of thumb when deciding what to display and what to conceal in the home. “I try to hide as much as possible, as a space can get clogged up with stuff so quickly,” she says. “But if an object sparks joy, then have it on show.” In the kitchen of her home, Heuman pours dishwashing soap into pretty glass bottles for display and dry goods into glass jars, which she stores in her cupboard. When designing kitchens from scratch, she’ll often include glass fronted cupboards so that ceramic and glassware, or even attractively packaged food stuffs, can be shown off. “People often forget about using the full height of a room,” she says. She stashes suitcases and other items that aren’t needed regularly on top of high cupboards. In her office, stock from her burgeoning line of products is stowed on elevated alcove shelving, which she reaches using her antique step ladder. If you’re investing in joinery, build cupboards right up to the ceiling (as well as in the dead spaces such as under the stairs). This has the added advantage of bringing a sense of height to the room. Buy beds with drawers or removable mattresses for storing linens, towels or suitcases. Heuman also recommends regular wardrobe purges. “I clear out my clothes three or more times a year,” she says. “I really enjoy doing it. When it’s not so crammed you can actually see what you have.” She’ll systematically stash out-of-season clothes in boxes at the top of her closet. Her advice is to simply ask yourself whether you really use or need each item. If you’re unsure, and have an attic, stow it awhile to see whether or not you miss it. This process of constantly sorting has the added advantage of inspiring new outfits such as the buttoned-up, gray vintage dress that she’d bought some five years ago and now pleasingly teams with a white shirt and Charlotte Olympia trainers. Once the purge is complete, though, it’s essential to stay on top of things: “The more you clear out, the better you get at keeping it tidy because you know what it means to start again from scratch,” she says. “It only takes a few seconds to put things away neatly.” It’s never too early to get organized. At home, even Heuman’s 2-year-old gets involved in cleaning up. “We do it together,” she says. They divide her daughter’s toys into baskets according to category. “She’s already able to understand the concept of organizing. Even for her it feels good to have some order. It’s healthy for the brain to compartmentalize things and to get into the tidying habit early.” Rather than storing shoes in boxes, Heuman has a deep drawer in the wardrobe of her bedroom at home where pairs are stacked one on top of the other in V-shaped racks. “It doubles the storage and means you can easily see what shoes you have,” says the designer, who also invests in shoe trees for special pairs — part of a wider effort to buy less, but better, then make things last. “If you look after them, they’ll last forever.” Beyond the confines of her footwear drawer, there’s a strict one-in, one-out policy. “If I have more than a single pair of shoes by the front door, my husband takes them upstairs in a rage,” she says. “It sounds a bit nuts, but if he wasn’t like that maybe things would spiral a bit more. Tidying is a never-ending process, but to us, for now at least, it’s worth it.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Brooklyn Artist Finds Inspiration, and Refuge, in Puerto Rico","Artist’s Questionnaire As he prepares for a new solo exhibition in New York, Angel Otero looks back to his childhood home. Dressed in all black, in contrast to the radiant colors that surround him, the artist Angel Otero emanates warmth as he stands in his studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn, right off the high-spirited Avenue of Puerto Rico (also known as Graham Avenue). His expansive high-ceilinged work space is currently occupied by a group of sprawling mixed-media paintings — made partly from collaged cutout pieces from his earlier works — that will soon depart for his coming exhibition, “Milagros,” at Lehmann Maupin gallery in Manhattan. The artist, too, is about to set out for a journey. Known for his visceral abstract oil paintings, Otero, 38, who has lived in New York for almost a decade, will open a second studio in his first home, Puerto Rico, early this summer. “I want to see what can happen if I am physically there, working and engaging with people,” he explains. “I’ve always been a loner and introvert while making art, and I want to break this habit there, and maybe even bring people into the studio to make art together.” He’s hopeful about the revitalization of the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. He believes good can come out of catastrophe, and adds: “A lot of young people are bringing amazing things back to the island. I want to be a part of this moment.” Otero left his home in Puerto Rico in 2003 to pursue a master’s degree in fine arts at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He has lived in the mainland United States ever since, but his upbringing in a large family in San Juan helped form his compelling visual language of bold colors, vibrant abstract forms and autobiographical cues, leading to solo exhibitions at institutions including the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia. In his new work, Otero delves into both his physical and mental inventories, reusing pieces from his discarded paintings and domestic objects he has collected from thrift stores over the years, as well as memories of Puerto Rico. Perched on a salvaged chair in his studio, he answered T’s artist questionnaire. What is your day like? How much do you sleep, and what’s your work schedule? I don’t sleep too much. I usually come to the studio at 10 a.m. and work until 6 p.m. If I am here at night, I don’t necessarily make work, but read and write down notes. I like reminiscing about that day. What’s the first piece of art you ever made? I made my first piece of artwork after seeing a neighbor of mine when I was 6. She was a little older than me and kept making drawings of a cartoon just by observing the image. I asked her to teach me how to reproduce an image the same way. She did, and I made a drawing of my dad. Later, I jumped into bigger challenges, such as comic books. What’s the worst studio you ever had? I didn’t have a worst studio as a professional artist, but my weirdest studio situation was when I was 15. My dad was living with his second or third wife at a house close to the mountains, where there was an abandoned shed. He let me use this place with no electricity. I loved it. I put my own decorations in it and spent time there. What’s the first work you ever sold? For how much? In my first year of college in Puerto Rico, I was in a group show, where I showed a watercolor drawing of a female figure. I sold the work for $40. I still keep that money in a little box. When you start a new piece, where do you begin? The first step is following a formal intuition, cutting shapes and playing with them. The whole thing starts with a spark, and this could be an accident, leading to another body of work. Then, I follow the direction it’s going in. How do you know when you’re done? I don’t think about it much. When the work feels resolved is a direct answer, but I can always continue working. How many assistants do you have? Do you hire from Puerto Rico? I have three people. They have been with me for 10 years. I hired from Puerto Rico in the beginning of my career. What music do you play when you’re making art? Bossa nova, mostly. When did you first feel comfortable saying you’re a professional artist? I don’t think there was a specific moment I expressed that. I say it now when people ask what my job is. I worked as an insurance agent in Puerto Rico, after my dad obligated me to find an income and follow his path in the insurance business. I eventually quit and started pursuing art. Is there a meal you eat on repeat when you’re working? Just a lot of coffee. What’s the weirdest object in your studio? I have this piece of wood from a construction site from my neighborhood as a kid. I used to sell those pieces, but now I keep one of them for inspiration. I enjoy having pictures of inspirational artists and artworks around me. The exhibition’s title, “Milagros,” ties to my grandmother and little charms she inherited from her great-grandmother. They’re wooden religious figures people carved as tokens of promise. If the promise came true, which was considered a miracle, they would go to a man to recreate the object in metal. I relate the works in this exhibition to that idea of re-creation. How often do you talk to other artists? Rashid [Johnson] is a good friend. His studio is down the street. How do you get your news? On my phone. What do you do when you’re procrastinating? Read the news. What are you reading right now? I am revisiting Jeanette Winterson, who has a unique way of writing between reality and magic. She puts many thoughts out there and travels between different characters, genders and realities. She is most famous for “Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit” but my favorite is “Art & Lies: A Piece for Three Voices and a Bawd.” What do you usually wear when you work? Jeans. What do your studio windows look out on? Not here, but the windows were the most precious part of my old studio. They caused the studio to get very cold, but they provided an amazing view of the Manhattan skyline. It was in Ridgewood, Queens, and I moved there right when I first arrived in New York. I was the second tenant to rent a studio in the building. What’s your worst habit? I buy and collect a lot of stuff I don’t need. When I see something interesting discarded on a sidewalk, I can’t help myself. What embarrasses you? I tend to get shy when people speak about me being a known artist or when someone says to another person that they should Google me. What’s your favorite artwork? The artist Arnaldo Roche Rabell has a painting titled “We Have to Dream in Blue” from 1986. It’s an auto-portrait, but he has blue eyes, a reference to his father, who was a corrupt police officer. I saw the painting at Museo de Arte de Ponce for the first time at age 11. Former governor Luis A. Ferré had an amazing art collection and established this museum in the south of Puerto Rico. Roche Rabell went to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1980s and made himself a name there. I remember wanting to paint the same way, when I saw his painting. “Angel Otero: Milagros” is on view from March 7 through April 20, 2019 at Lehmann Maupin gallery, 501 West 24th Street, New York.",The New York Times
2019,"A Brooklyn Man Got Into a Fistfight. Two Hours Later, His Little Brother Was Shot Dead.","Samuel Joseph, 15, was just getting out of school on Feb. 22 when his older brother got into a fistfight with another young Brooklyn man. What brought them to blows remains unknown, and the confrontation did not last long. The altercation was of the sort that often leaves nothing but bruises and hurt pride. Instead, within a few hours, Mr. Joseph was dead, shot execution-style in front of his sister at their apartment in Flatbush. His brother’s opponent in the fight, Martial Amilcar, 20, was on the run. Mr. Amilcar was arrested on Monday night in Queens and questioned by Brooklyn detectives at the 70th Precinct station house. He was charged late Tuesday with murder and criminal possession of a firearm. On Wednesday, the police were still looking for Mr. Amilcar’s associate, who they said had waited outside Mr. Joseph’s apartment building. The police said that on Feb. 22 Mr. Amilcar showed up in the lobby of the Joseph family’s apartment building and shot Mr. Joseph in the face, head and chest. Earlier that day, Mr. Amilcar and a second man had been searching the neighborhood for Mr. Joseph’s older brother. The police did not say which of Mr. Joseph’s older brothers — he is one of eight children — was involved in the original fight. The gruesome killing of the teenager shocked the city and rattled Mr. Joseph’s neighborhood, where his family of immigrants from Haiti had settled about a decade ago. The boy was a sophomore at the High School for Youth and Community Development at Erasmus. He had been leaving his apartment to get something to eat when Mr. Amilcar confronted him in the lobby. Mr. Joseph was remembered by friends and business owners in the neighborhood as “a good kid” and a talented basketball player. The murder was a sobering reminder of the city’s violent start to 2019, driven by a spike of homicides in Brooklyn — 24 so far in 2019, 14 more murders than during the same period last year. On the day of the murder, the police said that a security camera recorded Mr. Amilcar and Mr. Joseph’s older brother getting into a fight around 3:45 p.m., though they declined to say where it took place. Two hours later, Mr. Amilcar, wearing a hood, was seen outside of Mr. Joseph’s apartment building on Flatbush Avenue. He approached Mr. Joseph’s sister and asked if the older brother with whom he had fought was home. Mr. Amilcar, who also lives in Flatbush, can then be seen on security camera footage entering the lobby of the family’s apartment building. He confronted Mr. Joseph there while his associate waited outside. In a matter of seconds, Mr. Amilcar pulled out a pistol and shot Mr. Joseph. Afterward, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he died. On Tuesday evening, a young woman who identified herself as Mr. Joseph’s sister said she expects more arrests to be made. “I’m hoping they get all of them and put them away somewhere,” the woman said while standing inside the hallway of the family’s building on Flatbush Avenue, a few steps from a memorial to her brother that was outside. She declined to give her name, citing concerns for the family’s safety. Monalisa Ferrari, a community liaison who is assisting with wake and funeral arrangements for Mr. Joseph and is serving as a family spokeswoman, said the victim’s mother, Raymonde Samuels, has been particularly hard-hit by her son’s death. Ms. Ferrari said the family took some solace from news of an arrest. “I would say they’re relieved,” Ms. Ferrari said, “because having a criminal like this on the loose is worrisome.” Chief William Aubry of the Detective Bureau said on Tuesday that it remained unclear whether Mr. Amilcar intended to kill Mr. Joseph or had mistaken him for his older brother. Murders across the city have spiked to 51 in the first two months of 2019 compared to 34 over the same period last year, a trend that has concerned officials in the department and at City Hall. On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and police commissioner James P. O’Neill said at their monthly news conference on crime statistics that it was too early to tell if the increase was a fluke, or a harbinger of a new trend.",The New York Times
2019,"A Brooklyn Studio, for Starters","The Hunt After years of sharing rentals, a new buyer takes her savings to a fixer-upper in Kensington. Sam Reichman came to New York after graduating from the College of William & Mary in 2013. She lived mostly in Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn, always with roommates, some of them strangers she met through Craigslist. From the start, she was eager to become a homeowner. “Pretty much every apartment I’ve had is living below my means and saving with this goal in mind,” she said. Last spring, as she started hunting seriously, Ms. Reichman moved in with her boyfriend and his roommate, who rented in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “The girlfriends glommed on, to save money,” she said. “Four of us crammed into a two-bedroom.” Ms. Reichman, 27, who grew up in Baltimore, had a budget of up to $300,000 for a co-op unit farther out in Brooklyn. Her boyfriend would be joining her and helping to pay monthly costs, but she needed to be able to afford it on her own, in case he moved away for graduate school. If a one-bedroom proved too pricey, a studio would do, preferably one with an alcove and separate kitchen. “I never wanted to be able to smell food from my bed,” Ms. Reichman said. “And I wanted the bedroom to feel like its own little nook.” She was willing to take on an hour’s commute to her office in Midtown, where she is a video producer for Barron’s Group. “I am a huge podcast listener, so the commute doesn’t bother me that much,” she said. She contacted Carol Nemeroff, a family friend and a licensed sales agent at Douglas Elliman. “I was, like, five thorns in her side,” said Ms. Reichman, who knew she would need a lot of hand-holding. They saw a charming, newly renovated studio in Ditmas Park listed at $299,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $400s. It had a foyer rather than an alcove, but its beautiful archways and prewar details made up for the less-than-ideal layout. Ms. Reichman bid $301,000, but it sold for around $311,000. “I offered the most I could possibly afford, and it still wasn’t enough, and that was a huge disappointment,” she said. “That apartment had everything I wanted, and I had to peel it back from there as far as reasonable expectations.” Prices in Ditmas Park were on the high side, so she refocused on neighboring Kensington. An alcove studio there, on the ground floor next to the building’s mailroom and staircase, had big windows with shrubs and flowers outside. “It was just good enough, but not something I really loved,” she said. The price was $285,000, with maintenance of just under $500. It later fell to $265,000 and sold for $262,000. Ms. Reichman considered several apartments along Ocean Parkway, including one on the sunny top floor of an elevator building. It was nicely renovated and had a window seat in the kitchen. The price was $269,000, with maintenance in the low $600s. But Ms. Reichman was too late: There was already an accepted offer of $272,000. By now, it was early summer. “The inventory felt like it was gone, and the buying season was over,” she said. “I had sort of made peace with the fact that the apartment hunt was over until the next year.” Still, she said, “I was checking StreetEasy nonstop, trying to make a miracle happen.” Lo and behold, a new listing appeared. It was in the same Kensington building as the ground-floor studio, but was larger, with nearly 600 square feet. The online photos were underexposed and blurry. “I could tell they were bad iPhone pictures,” Ms. Reichman said. The price was $260,000, with maintenance in the high $500s. The floors were a mess. The bathroom had a tiny shower stall and no tub. The view included a parking lot. “It was a dumpy apartment,” she said. “There were so many not-great things about it that I thought, ‘This is my chance.’” Also, she and Ms. Nemeroff got locked inside while the selling agent was in the hall. “When we tried to leave, it wouldn’t let us,” Ms. Reichman said. “I took that as a sign.” She quickly offered $268,000. “We went a little bit over,” Ms. Nemeroff said. “She didn’t want to lose another apartment. If the apartment was not perfect, it was fine. Her criteria were more about having that little alcove and getting to work in less than an hour. She didn’t need to have a cute coffee place down the block.” The sellers, who had children, had added walls. The outlines showed on the floors, which the sellers offered to redo. Ms. Reichman and her boyfriend arrived in the fall. She is surprised at how few people have heard of Kensington, which is smack in the center of Brooklyn and just south of Prospect Park. With the help of relatives, she repainted the walls and retiled the kitchen floor. She had the finicky lock changed and bought houseplants. A hutch and a table serve as room dividers. “We can pretend it is a one-bedroom,” she said. “I was happily surprised that 600 square feet felt like a real apartment. This is a test for me and my boyfriend. If we can do this, we can live anywhere together. I’ve lived in so much worse than sharing a 600-square-foot studio with one other person.” Her trip to work takes just under an hour, including 10 minutes to the F train, “if you are power-walking,” she said. If need be, “I can message in and say, ‘Here’s the tweet that says the trains are delayed.’” And Ms. Reichman is glad to put effort into “doing the unsexy stuff that comes with being a homeowner, like replacing the exhaust fan in the bathroom and the light fixture in the entryway,” she said. “That kind of stuff weirdly makes me happy.” Email: thehunt@nytimes.com For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2019,A Brünnhilde Is Born: The Week in Classical Music,"that decisive moment [Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Hojotoho, and happy Friday! This week, the soprano Christine Georke brought her much-hyped Brünnhilde to the Metropolitan Opera for the opening of Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” my favorite installment of the “Ring.” Her arrival is remarkable if only because vocal troubles nearly pushed her to quit opera; you can read all about it in Michael Cooper’s profile of her: Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, who reviewed “Die Walküre,” wrote that in Ms. Goerke, the Met “has found a Brünnhilde who marries vocal vitality and emotional presence in each radiant note.” I couldn’t agree more. Listen for yourself how she tosses off those howls of “Hojotoho!” Expect more coverage of the “Ring” as the Met rolls its revival of Robert Lepage’s production. Anthony Tommasini has offered his thoughts on how Wagner’s epic always seems to be eerily resonant, especially now in this moment of divisive American politics. But enough about Wagner (for now). Elsewhere this week, I attended the latest edition of the New York Philharmonic’s Nightcap series. These little concerts are meant to provide an intimate introduction to living composers — John Adams, in this case. The program Mr. Adams curated, however, was generous and illuminating, featuring only two of his works (“I Still Play” and “First Quartet”) to make room for ones by his younger colleagues. So Mr. Adams presented music by people like Timo Andres — he also played the evening’s solo piano pieces — and Nico Muhly, as well as Gabriella Smith, who I hope will be heard at the Philharmonic again soon. Enjoy an excerpt from her “Carrot Revolution,” a sonically intrepid piece that has the impression of an image coming in and out of focus, joyously performed at Nightcap by the Attacca Quartet. I was back at the Philharmonic on Wednesday for a one-night-only concert featuring Yuja Wang, as thrilling as ever, in Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. The great Maurizio Pollini was originally scheduled to appear, but canceled. As it happens, Ms. Wang is currently touring the work. She was mesmerizing in a performance last month with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where she struck a Martha Argerich-like balance of commanding precision and wildness. The scales tipped slightly at David Geffen Hall this week as she opened the concerto with a fiery run of chords. Which is not to say she gave a feral performance: She never appeared out of control as she navigated the piece’s changing moods and fickle attachment to Romantic and Classical styles. For an encore, she leaned into Romanticism with one of her standbys, Liszt’s stirring transcription of the Schubert song “Gretchen am Spinnrade.” For those following Ms. Wang’s many appearances in New York this season, she’ll next play at Carnegie Hall on April 10, where her Perspectives series continues with a recital featuring the cellist Gautier Capuçon. On the program is Rachmaninoff’s Cello Sonata in G minor, a chamber work whose dreamy sound world I’m always happy to revisit. See you there. JOSHUA BARONE If the opera world had awards like the Oscars, then in 1998 the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey would surely have won for best actor in a leading role, for his wrenching performance as the hulking, slow-witted Lennie in Carlisle Floyd’s “Of Mice and Men” at New York City Opera. (Here he is in the video above, in a 2011 production at Opera Australia.) Mr. Griffey might even have picked up the award again in 2008, for the title role of Britten’s “Peter Grimes” at the Metropolitan Opera. His Grimes came across like a dangerously intemperate and painfully isolated man-boy. Now a professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music, Mr. Griffey returned to New York for a recital last Sunday at the Morgan Library & Museum. He shared the program with the gifted, radiant-voiced young coloratura soprano Amy Owens (presented in collaboration with the George London Foundation). The Warren Jones was the elegant, superb piano accompanist. Mr. Griffey brought robust sound, tenderness and his trademark crisp diction to songs by Frank Bridge, John Jacob Niles, Charles Ives and others. He paid tribute to Mr. Floyd, now 92, singing Sam’s Aria from “Susannah,” which he once performed at the Met with Renée Fleming in the title role. Mr. Griffey also expressed gratitude to André Previn, who died last month, for giving him career-changing opportunities, including casting him as Mitch in the premiere of the opera “A Streetcar Named Desire” (which also starred Ms. Fleming). Mr. Griffey then sang a wistful performance of Mitch’s revealing aria. ANTHONY TOMMASINI",The New York Times
2019,Queens Fire: A Burning Candle and Faulty Smoke Alarms Leave 8-Year-Old Boy Dead,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The sound of breaking glass could be heard early on Sunday morning as boys jumped from the windows of a Queens home that had become engulfed in flames as a result of a fire the authorities said was caused by a burning candle. The family had not been alerted to the fire because the smoke detector in the two-story home in the quiet Springfield Gardens neighborhood did not function, fire officials said. One of the children, 8-year-old Tighani Jones — “the baby,” as he was known — did not survive the 2:30 a.m. blaze that also injured six other people, the police said. Two older boys were able to jump to safety through second-floor windows, neighbors said. “I took my coat off, my sweater, and wrapped him up,” a neighbor, Dwayne Sundar, said of a boy he said was between 10 and 12 years old. That child told him there was another boy still inside the house. “I guess he tried to save his brother,” Mr. Sundar said, “but he couldn’t.” Neighbors described a frantic scene of screaming, shattering glass and fleeing boys. Cellphone video showed black smoke billowing into the night air as a man paced in the street, yelling, “Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!” into a cellphone. A woman screamed and a moment later, bright flames erupted from the side of the house. “We tried our best, we just couldn’t get to him — too much fire,” the battalion chief, Patrick Ginty, told 1010 WINS at the scene. “The second floor was fully involved with fire when we showed up, it was coming out every window.” The police said a 12-year-old boy cut his wrist escaping through a window on the second floor, where the fire started. He and the five other survivors were taken to Long Island Jewish Medical Center to be treated for smoke inhalation, according to the police. City fire marshals declared the fire an accident caused by a candle. Jim Long, a department spokesman, said the candle and Tighani were found upstairs. Candles are a leading cause of fires in New York City, and two-thirds of the deadly fires here involve smoke alarms that don’t work, Mr. Long said. “It’s a preventable fire that gets a head-start, gets advanced and takes a life,” he said. Tyree Carrow, who shared the cellphone video with The New York Times, said he was about to go to sleep when he heard screams and then the sound of glass breaking from across the street. Mr. Carrow, 23, said he and his mother went to the front door thinking, “Someone’s arguing, having a fight outside.” “So then we open up the front door and we just see flames coming out of the house — a bunch of smoke, flames, and then just big booms and glass falling, and people screaming,” he said. Mr. Carrow said he saw about a half-dozen people, adults and children, coming out of the burning house. Sixty firefighters responded, and it took them nearly an hour to bring the blaze under control, according to the Fire Department. The tragedy recalled a Bronx fire in 2016 that killed two baby sisters left alone with burning incense while their mother did laundry. The Fire Department has said a third of all candle fires begin when the flames are left unattended; officials posted a video on Twitter on Sunday reminding people how to use candles safely. Tighani’s house was still standing on Sunday afternoon, when two contractors arrived with sheets of plywood and nail guns to board up the burned-out upstairs windows. From the outside, the first floor looked almost untouched by the fire. But a vacate order was duct-taped to the front door glass, and ashy debris sat in piles below the second story’s side windows, which were ringed by scorch marks and remnants of exterior siding that hung in melted strips. The Department of Buildings said it had never received a complaint about the house. But after the fire, city building inspectors discovered the cellar of the house had been illegally converted to an apartment. The inspectors issued violations to the owner and ordered the property vacated, according to the buildings agency. Mr. Sundar, 40, said that on Sunday morning he had come outside after hearing the commotion, and saw smoke pouring from the house next door. Mr. Sundar said he called 911 and then saw two boys, who he believed to be Tighani’s brothers, flee the house by jumping from the second floor. The first boy out was a teenager who struggled to wedge himself through an upstairs window above the house’s side driveway. Mr. Sundar said he climbed onto the roof of a parked vehicle to reach up and help the boy down. “I was too short, and he’s stuck — and the window can’t open all the way so he’s stuck, half of his body out,” Mr. Sundar said. “But the smoke was so thick after that I can’t see, and he can’t see either.” That was when the teenager jumped through the window and fell to the curb below, and walked bleeding from his injuries to sit on a stoop across the street, Mr. Sundar said. Patches of blood and bloody footprints were still visible on the walkway hours later. Mr. Sundar said he stepped into the house to try to help but was driven back by flames. He said firefighters arrived within minutes but the blaze “spread so fast there was nothing they could do.” “By the time the truck rolled up and they pulled out the hose the house was already engulfed,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A C.E.O. Who’s Scared for America,"Capitalism, he says, is slowly committing suicide. Opinion Columnist Peter Georgescu — a refugee-turned-C.E.O. who recently celebrated his 80th birthday — feels deeply grateful to his adopted country. He also feels afraid for its future. He is afraid, he says, because the American economy no longer functions well for most citizens. “For the past four decades,” Georgescu has written, “capitalism has been slowly committing suicide.” Those are some strong words, so I want to tell you Georgescu’s story – and about what he thinks needs to be done. He was born just before World War II in Romania, where his father was a businessman and his maternal grandfather was a politician opposed to both the Nazis and Communists. His parents were traveling in the United States in 1947 when the Iron Curtain came down, and American officials told them they would be killed if they returned home. Peter and his brother went to live with their grandparents in Romania’s Transylvanian countryside. [Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.] One day a couple of years later, they found their dogs dead, from poisoning. The next night, government agents entered their home and arrested Peter’s grandfather. “We never saw him again,” Georgescu told me recently. “They killed him in prison.” Peter was 10 years old, and his brother, Constantin, was 15. The government moved them and their grandmother to a town near the Russian border. They slept on hay in a single room, inside an otherwise normal house, watched by a guard. Instead of going to school, Peter cleaned sewers. He was later promoted to a job turning off streetlights before dawn and digging holes for electric poles. In the early 1950s, a Romanian diplomat approached Peter’s father in New York, where he was living with Peter’s mother. The diplomat brought a recent photo of the boys, both teenagers, and pressured the father to spy for Romania. He went to the F.B.I. instead, and the F.B.I. encouraged him to go public with the blackmail attempt. It would make the Soviet empire look bad. The plan worked. The “Georgescu boys” became a media sensation. Frances Bolton, an Ohio congresswoman, took up their cause and interested President Dwight Eisenhower in it. Romania eventually freed the boys, as part of a prisoner exchange, and they landed in New York at Idlewild Airport — today’s J.F.K. — on April 13, 1954. (Their grandmother was not allowed to leave until years later.) Online, you can watch the television clip of Peter’s mother running across the tarmac and hugging them as they got off the plane. She had not seen them in seven and a half years. She didn’t recognize their voices, she told a reporter, because they each had a man’s voice. From there, Georgescu’s life moved quickly. The headmaster of Phillips Exeter offered him a spot at the school even though he spoke no English and hadn’t attended any school for much of his boyhood. After college and business school, Georgescu joined the advertising firm Young & Rubicam. He spent 37 years there, the last seven as chief executive. “The hero of my story,” Georgescu said to me “is America.” Over and over, he said, people who didn’t have any obvious reason to care about him helped him: the congresswoman who didn’t represent his parents’ district; the headmaster who’d never met him; the ad executives who mentored him. All of them, he believes, were influenced by a post-World War II culture that (while deeply flawed in some ways) fostered a sense of community over individuality. Corporate executives didn’t pay themselves outlandish salaries. Workers enjoyed consistently rising wages. Things began to change after the 1970s. Stakeholder capitalism — which, Georgescu says, optimized the well-being of customers, employees, shareholders and the nation — gave way to short-term shareholder-only capitalism. Profits have soared at the expense of worker pay. The wealth of the median family today is lower than two decades ago. Life expectancy has actually fallen in the last few years. Not since 2004 has a majority of Americans said they were satisfied with the country’s direction. “Capitalism is a brilliant factory for prosperity. Brilliant,” Georgescu says. “And yet the version of capitalism we have created here works for only a minority of people.” In his retirement, when he’s not spending time with his family, Georgescu has been trying to agitate other corporate leaders. He has published a book, called “Capitalists, Arise!” He has written op-eds and given talks. He talks about the signs of frustration, in both the United States and Europe. He has seen societies fall apart, and he thinks many people are underestimating the risks it could happen again. “We’re not that far off,” he told me. Some other business leaders are also worried about rising inequality. Warren Buffett is. So are Martin Lipton, the dean of corporate lawyers, and Laurence Fink, who runs the investment firm BlackRock. “There’s class warfare, all right,” Buffett has said, “but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning,” Georgescu believes that business, more than government, can solve the problem. He told me that executives should resist pressure to maximize short-term profits. Companies could make even more money if they invested in their workers and became more productive and innovative, he says. Costco is a favorite example of his. I’m skeptical that corporate America will voluntarily fix the situation, because the last four decades have been very lucrative for top executives and investors. To my mind, government action — including higher taxes on the rich and more bargaining power for workers — is necessary to bring back broad-based prosperity. But I am grateful for Georgescu’s efforts, because the culture and values of corporate America have a big effect on society. Not so long ago, top executives made decisions that took into account not just their own bank accounts but also their workers, their communities and their country. Georgescu is asking them to do so again. A note to readers: This is my last regular column for a few months, while I work on a book.

2019,A Cabaret Hostess Who Jokes About Her Love Life,"Up Next Catherine Cohen, 27, hosts Cabernet Cabaret, a weekly standup show at Club Cumming in the East Village. Name: Catherine Cohen Age: 27 Hometown: Houston Now Lives: In a tiny one-bedroom apartment in the West Village, with a mini-fridge instead of a regular fridge. Claim to Fame: Ms. Cohen is a standup comedian known for her self-deprecating humor about being a woman dating in New York City. She has a monthly show at Joe’s Pub called “The Twist? She’s Gorgeous” and hosts Cabernet Cabaret, a standup musical showcase, at Club Cumming on Wednesdays. Time Out named her one of the five New York City comedians to watch in 2018. “Like I say in my song, ‘Boys didn’t want to kiss me, so I had to be funny to win them over,’” Ms. Cohen said. “And it didn’t even work. Sad.” Big Break: After graduating from Princeton in 2013, Ms. Cohen moved to New York and took classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade. She performed in various comedy shows around the city, and in 2017 was looking for a spot to do a weekly show. Her friend Henry Koperski, a pianist, had just performed at the newly opened Club Cumming and put her in touch with Daniel Nardicio, who owns the bar with Alan Cumming. She did one performance, and then it became a regular Wednesday gig. “I meet people who come to the show,” she said. “And then we just hang out after and go to the diner. It’s that New York life I’ve always dreamed of.” Latest Project: Last year, Ms. Cohen started “Seek Treatment,” a comedy podcast with her friend Pat Regan, in which they share awkward dating stories, sex advice and witty observations about millennial culture. “I feel like when people listen to the pod, I can talk to them as if they’re my best friend because they know all my insecurities,” Ms. Cohen said. Next Thing: Ms. Cohen is making the jump from the comedy stage to the small screen. Last month, she appeared on “High Maintenance” as Darby, a Brooklyn woman who gives things away on Craigslist and flashes people who take them. And she will appear on “Broad City,” though she couldn’t reveal anything about her character. On Crushes: Spilling the details of her personal life on “Seek Treatment” comes with costs. “I’m a modern woman out on the town, falling in love a few times every hour,” Ms. Cohen said. “I love to crush.” She sometimes slips too many telling details about love interests into the podcast. “I’ll talk about a crush, and then the crush will realize and be like, ‘Was that about me?’” she said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Case for the Electoral College,"And why and how that case might fail. Opinion Columnist Debates about the Electoral College, like the one that Democrats have lately instigated, often get bogged down in disputes about the intentions of the founding generation — whether they were trying to check mob rule, prop up Southern power, preserve the power of small states, or simply come to a necessarily arbitrary constitutional compromise. These disputes are historically interesting but somewhat practically irrelevant, because everyone agrees that the college doesn’t work the way the founders expected. It doesn’t allow wise electors to veto demagogic candidates, it doesn’t throw most presidential elections to the House of Representatives — and as my colleague Nate Cohn pointed out last week, it doesn’t always give extra influence to the smallest states. (Donald Trump won because he overperformed in big swing states, not because he cobbled together a coalition of small ones.) [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Instead the Electoral College really just does one big thing that a popular-vote system wouldn’t do: It makes it possible for close elections to yield a president supported by a minority of voters, especially in circumstances where that minority is regionally concentrated rather than diffuse. Is there a case for a system that sometimes produces undemocratic outcomes? I think so, on two grounds. First, it creates incentives for political parties and candidates to seek supermajorities rather than just playing for 50.1 percent, because the latter play is a losing one more often than in a popular-vote presidential system. Second, it creates incentives for political parties to try to break regional blocs controlled by the opposition, rather than just maximizing turnout in their own areas, because you win the presidency consistently only as a party of multiple regions and you can crack a rival party’s narrow majority by flipping a few states. According to this — admittedly contrarian — theory, the fact that the Electoral College produces chaotic or undemocratic outcomes in moments of ideological or regional polarization is actually a helpful thing, insofar as it drives politicians and political hacks (by nature not the most creative types) to think bigger than regional blocs and 51 percent majorities. Thus the electoral/popular split of 1888 pointed the way to William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt’s national Republican majorities, and the near-splits of 1968 and 1976 pushed us toward Reagan’s nationwide landslides and Bill Clinton’s successful center-left campaigns. Time and again a close election leads to hand-wringing about the need for Electoral College reform; time and again, politicians and parties respond to the college’s incentives, and more capacious and unifying majorities are born. Does this theory fit our current situation? In a sense, yes. Donald Trump could win the presidency without a popular-vote majority only because both parties have been locked into base-turnout strategies that are partially responsible for our government’s ineffectiveness and gridlock. And to the extent that Hillary Clinton’s campaign leaned into this polarization (writing off many constituencies that her husband competed for), she deserved her electoral-college loss. Trump could also only win the presidency without a popular-vote majority because a large region of the country, the greater Rust Belt and Appalachia, had been neglected by both parties’ policies over the preceding decades, leading to a slow-building social crisis that the national press only really noticed because of Trump’s political success. In this sense, Clinton’s weird post-election boast that her half of the country was way more economically dynamic indicated the advantages of a system where a declining region can punch above its popular-vote weight — because it makes it harder for a party associated with economic winners to simply write the losers off. However: This defense of occasional countermajoritarian presidencies assumes that the political system will, over the medium-term, be responsive to the Electoral College’s incentives — that parties will be capable of overcoming polarization and addressing specific regional grievances, that politicians will be capable of working toward Rooseveltian or Reaganesque majorities, that presidents who win with a popular-vote minority will either adapt and gain a majority the next time (as George W. Bush did) or lose like Benjamin Harrison and John Quincy Adams. And neither political party has responded to 2016 the way my defense of the Electoral College predicts they should. A countermajoritarian outcome has not produced supermajoritarian ambitions. Instead of trying to expand its base, the Trump-era G.O.P. seems to be relying on the Electoral College to actively avoid any sustained outreach, while Trump’s likely Democratic rivals seem to be taking Clinton’s popular-vote margin as a license to march leftward. This points to a reality that the college’s defenders need to recognize: If neither party can escape 50-50 politics, if polarization makes electoral/popular splits recur cycle after cycle, then the Electoral College’s arguable virtues will no longer apply, and it will just be one more delegimitizer in a system shadowed by partisan disillusionment, one more potential catalyst for a true constitutional crackup.

2019,A Champions League’s Changing of the Guard Leaves Behind Two Fixtures,"On Soccer BARCELONA, Spain — In the last eight days, an era has ended, a dynasty has been dismantled, an aristocracy has crumbled and a balance of power that held for a decade has shifted. Change has swept through the Champions League. European soccer’s landscape has been transformed. Not that it was easy to tell from Barcelona last night. Here, where the hosts thrashed Lyon, 5-1, on Wednesday, it all felt the same as ever. This has been a tumultuous week. The peak came right away: Real Madrid — the team that had held this competition in its thrall, seemingly incapable of not winning it, its opponents apparently dazzled by the mythology of those bright white jerseys — humbled, at home, by a young and vibrant and entirely dismissed Ajax. The next night, Paris St.-Germain fell, the prize its Qatari backers covet more than any other once again proving elusive, despite the cushion provided by a two-goal lead from the first leg and the insurance policy of a squad assembled at extravagant expense. There might, ordinarily, have been some solace in being eliminated by one of Europe’s true giants, Manchester United, but that would only have applied if it had been Manchester United’s first team. It was not. It was a patchwork, scratch sort of a side, cobbled together with what little material Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had at hand, and it was still enough. And then, on Tuesday night, that other great cornerstone of European soccer — Atlético Madrid’s defense, so miserly and obdurate — came unstuck. It was generally held to be inconceivable that a team as disciplined and well organized and gnarled as Diego Simeone’s could contrive to throw away a two-goal first-leg lead, but contrive to it did. “It was not a lack of character,” Simeone said in Turin. “Juventus was just better than us.” He has not built his reputation on such acquiescence to defeat. Wednesday brought one more: Bayern Munich beaten comfortably on home territory by Liverpool, its players and coach, Niko Kovac, admitting that they had deserved no more. For the first time in 13 years, there will be no German teams present on Friday when the draw for the quarterfinals is made. There will be four representatives from the Premier League, for the first time in 10. No wonder, then, there is a sense that the guard is changing, that this will prove to be the season that bridges two distinct ages. The time of this incarnation of Real Madrid has passed, most obviously, but perhaps that can be said of others among the clutch of superclubs who have, for the last decade, dominated the latter stages of this competition, too. Bayern is gearing up to rejuvenate its squad. Atlético will lose the player that has best encapsulated its recent history — the grizzled Uruguayan defender Diego Godín — this summer. As they stumble, the English rise: Manchester City’s destruction of Schalke cemented its place as the favorite to inherit Real Madrid’s crown; Liverpool reached the final last year, and is a more rounded, more durable side this time around. Tottenham beat Borussia Dortmund in both legs, displaying a maturity it has previously lacked. Manchester United, reborn under Solskjaer, has a sense of abandon and fun that makes it dangerous. The Premier League is, at last, benefiting not only from its vast financial advantage over the rest of Europe, but from its decision — belated, admittedly — to spend a rather greater proportion of that on managers, rather than players. That is one reading of the situation, anyway. It is not the only one. The Champions League is about teams, of course, and about dynasties and eras and power bases and all of that, but more than anything, it is about players. Indeed, if the dominance of Real Madrid taught us anything, it was that, currently at least, this is a competition defined by individuals more than by systems. And those individuals have not changed at all. On Tuesday, it was Cristiano Ronaldo, scoring yet another hat-trick to pull Juventus clear of Atlético, to send the Allianz Stadium into raptures, to deliver on the reputation that convinced the Italian champion to spend somewhere north of $100 million on a 33-year-old forward last summer. And on Wednesday — obviously — it was Lionel Messi, scoring twice, creating twice, and orchestrating Barcelona’s demolition of a courageous, fearless but utterly outgunned Lyon. For a while, the French visitor discomfited Barcelona; for a while, there was a gentle draft of change here, too, if not quite a full wind. Lyon defended valiantly, and counterattacked with zest, before Barcelona broke the deadlock — a Messi penalty, deftly, almost thoughtlessly, chipped past Anthony Lopes. For a few minutes in the second half, too, Lyon had hope: Lucas Tousart had made it 2-1; a single strike, a bounce of a ball, would have been enough to add Barcelona to the list of giants toppled this season. It did not last long. Messi soon snatched it away. His second goal — a delicate shot at the end of one of those mazy dribbles where the ball seems to fall completely, hopelessly under his spell — effectively killed the game, before his two assists, for Gerard Piqué and Ousmane Dembélé, helped a victory bleed into a rout. But that is not what stood out. What makes Messi so captivating is that it is not just the killer blows that count, but all of the jabs and the thrusts and the parries. It is watching him dance around and skip over and ghost away from tackles. It is the precision of his passing, his unerring ability to make the right choice. Messi rarely tries the spectacular, the unlikely: he does not abuse his status, his talent. He just makes sure he does everything, almost everything, right. His gift has always been his simplicity; that is not fading, not at all, not yet. Eras do end, and times do change. Identifying when is not an exact science, of course: they tend to drift into each other; there are rarely clean breaks. But perhaps it is fair to say that Real Madrid’s period of dominance is at an end, or that the age of the superclubs has been put on hiatus, or even that Spain’s pre-eminence in European competition (every Champions League title since 2014, and 7 of the last 10) is over. But it is equally possible that none of those eras existed in the first place, and that instead they were simply consequences of the age of Messi and of Ronaldo, their teams the beneficiaries of their greatness, their ability to decide games and define seasons. That has not changed. Their age is not over yet. Everything might look different. Messi and Ronaldo, though, are still the same.",The New York Times
2019,A Chef’s Dream Villa in Costa Rica,"Villa Deevena, in Los Pargos, is a tropical take on the classic auberges of southern France. LOS PARGOS, Costa Rica — Impassable in spots during much of the rainy season, the dirt road to this village on the northern Pacific Coast of Costa Rica is a rutted, dust-spewing monster during the dry months. It is, as a friend once said, a “bone-jarring skunk of a road.” Until recently, visitors willing to make the journey were mostly surfers attracted by the world-class right-hand surf break at the nearby Playa Negra beach. These days, dedicated diners swerve and bump their way toward a discreet white sign for Villa Deevena. Through a door in a featureless whitewashed wall is a different world: fine china and crystal, a minimalist open-air dining room and an open kitchen. Cooks mince ginger and fresh basil, sear fresh fillets of snapper in fragrant olive oil and create little towers of goat cheese and roasted beet slices. Opposite the kitchen, a shaded courtyard with six svelte hotel rooms surrounds a long pool. The setup is reminiscent of the classic auberges of southern France, small inns deep in the countryside that are worth visiting for an amazing dinner and an overnight stay. Here in rural Costa Rica, there are howler monkeys in the trees, and guests can stroll down a dirt path to the ocean and go surfing. It all feels like a kind of fever dream. Villa Deevena opened in 2009, and it is the very real dream of the chef Patrick Jamon and his wife, Tasia. The restaurant and grounds were designed by Ms. Jamon, and built under her supervision. Atypically for this area, the cooking — classic French with flavors from all over Asia — emphasizes local, tropical ingredients grown, caught or gathered near the restaurant. Sautéed grouper fillets are bathed in a coconut curry and served with a carrot-ginger mousseline; chanterelles are stuffed into ravioli with sage; lobster is served with ponzu sauce and a crown of avocado; orange duck is made with mandarins, from a tree outside the restaurant, and a bit of ginger. Mr. Jamon, originally from the city of Valence in southern France, started working at age 14 at Restaurant Pic, now renamed Anne-Sophie Pic, for its chef. He went on to culinary school in Paris, returned home, married Ms. Jamon and started a family. In 1981, with only $500 and no knowledge of English, he moved to Los Angeles to work at Les Anges. That began a career of high-end chef positions, including cooking for dignitaries and presidents at the Regency Club, in Westwood. Mr. Jamon and his family started coming to Costa Rica in the ’90s to surf, and found Playa Negra. In 2008, Ms. Jamon suggested a sudden life change: “Are we going to get old in L.A.,” she asked, “or are we going to go do what we enjoy doing the most?” He was ready. As happens with many successful chefs, Mr. Jamon was spending more time managing than cooking, his chef’s whites almost more costume than uniform. “I was missing my people, missing the headaches,” he said. “So we moved here, and I got plenty of headaches.” Today the headaches are pretty much over. Ms. Jamon, the couple’s son Dean and his wife, Joya, all work at the restaurant and live down the street. Guests routinely trek to the restaurant from San José, five hours away by car, as well as from New York, Los Angeles and Paris. Ms. Jamon, with her charm and puckish humor, makes the restaurant feel like a home. For Christmas in 2009, after their move from Los Angeles, there was a fully decorated tree hanging upside down from the ceiling. “Everything in the world seems upside down,” she said, “so I decided to match it.” “I feel like I’m living 50 years ago, the way I used to live in my village in southern France,” Mr. Jamon said. He picks fruit from the trees, gathers porcini and chanterelle mushrooms in the woods, grows root vegetables and raises goats to make his own cheese on his farm up in the hills. A friend grows organic microgreens for him in a plot behind the restaurant. “Fish, lobster, octopus, all of that is right down the road to the beach,” he said. Most days, Dean goes out fishing and calls about his catch; it goes on that night’s menu. Mr. Jamon’s dedication to local food seemingly never ends. He recently bought a small piece of land simply because it includes two mature mango trees. “Growing a mango tree takes time,” he said, “and I can’t wait 20 years to get my first one.” His newest idea? Persuading local fishermen to harvest the abundant sea urchins for him. He has no regrets about his decision to relocate here. “When I come out to the dining room,” Mr. Jamon said, “and guests look at me with big eyes and say, ‘The worst ride in the world turned out to be worth it.’ Nothing can beat that.” Recipe: Grouper Fillets With Ginger and Coconut Curry Villa Deevena, Los Pargos, Guancaste, Costa Rica; closed September and October; 506-2653-2328; villadeevena.com.

2019,A Children’s Book Is Causing a Political Scandal in Baltimore. It’s Quite a Tale.,"What has become a full-blown political scandal in Baltimore started innocently enough. In fact, it began with a children’s book. Mayor Catherine Pugh, a fitness fanatic, said that about a decade ago, she was inspired to encourage children to pursue healthy lifestyles, and so she created the “Healthy Holly” series of books, about a little girl devoted to self-improvement and the betterment of those around her. At the time, Ms. Pugh, a Democrat, was a state senator who sat on the board of one of the state’s largest nonprofit health care companies. In what seemed like a happy ending, she struck a deal to sell 100,000 copies of the books to the company for $500,000. But now, the arrangement has become public, raising questions not only about the propriety of the arrangement, but also about just how many children had access to the books. “This is a window into the shadowy, seamy side of politics, where powerful insiders self-deal,” said Peter Franchot, the state comptroller, who has called for an independent audit. “I haven’t gotten over the shock of it. It’s almost juvenile.” Ms. Pugh, who became mayor in 2016, has acknowledged receiving $500,000 for the books from the University of Maryland Medical System, which operates 13 hospitals and 150 other health facilities around the state. The mayor has said that all copies were donated to places like school libraries and day care centers. But now, no one can find the books. They are not in school libraries. They are not in the city’s public libraries. One of the titles appears on Amazon.com, but is listed as “currently unavailable.” In an editorial this week, The Baltimore Sun asked, “Do we need to send out an Amber Alert for Healthy Holly?” Among the only copies of the book that have turned up are some 9,000 that were discovered in boxes inside a Baltimore school district warehouse under circumstances that have yet to be explained. Ms. Pugh initially responded to the scrutiny by telling a reporter from The Sun, which first reported the story, that the newspaper’s inquiry was a “witch hunt.” The mayor, who did not respond to a request for an interview on Friday, said in a statement that she had self-published the first “Healthy Holly” title in about 2011. Shortly thereafter, she said, she took the book along to a board meeting of the University of Maryland Medical System. “I recall passing the time by thumbing through the first book before an U.M.M.S. meeting,” Ms. Pugh said in the statement. “One of my colleagues loved it and thought it would help advance children’s health. Despite all that has happened, I am glad that the important messages in the book reached our city’s children.” The mayor’s misadventure is just the latest installment of crisis in Charm City, which has churned through five police chiefs in four years, suffered a record number of murders, and is a place where teachers must sometimes buy space heaters for their freezing classrooms. The city has also struggled to provide decent health care and health care education to residents, particularly its children, according to city data. A 2017 report from the city’s health department found the city’s age-adjusted mortality rate was 40 percent higher than the rest of the state; one in three high school students was either obese or overweight; one in four high school students drank one soda or more every day, but fewer than half ate one or more servings of vegetables. Fewer than half of middle school students, the report said, ate breakfast each day. Ms. Pugh has written four titles so far: “Healthy Holly: Fruits Come in Colors Like the Rainbow”; “Healthy Holly: Exercising is Fun!”; “Healthy Holly: Not all Vegetables are Green”; and “Healthy Holly: A Healthy Start for Herbie.” She is currently at work on “Healthy Holly: Walking With My Family.” In recent days, Ms. Pugh has acknowledged that she made various errors, including not listing her book deal with the health care nonprofit on ethics disclosure forms, and neglecting to note a $5,000 contribution from “Healthy Holly” profits to her 2016 mayoral campaign. “It was an error,” she told reporters this week. “I just feel that we can move forward. I’m not perfect.” Ms. Pugh has also resigned from the health care company’s board of directors, of which she had been a member since 2001. She said she had “more than enough to do” as mayor. She has also returned $100,000 from the book payments to the medical system. As part of the fallout, the board has asked Robert A. Chrencik, its chief executive, to take a leave of absence while a independent investigation is conducted into potential conflicts of interest. Two other board members have resigned, and several others have been asked to take temporary leaves of absence, according to the board. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland has called for an independent investigation, saying board members must halt any financial relationship they have with the nonprofit or tender their resignations. “I was frankly shocked and appalled,” Mr. Hogan, a Republican, told reporters this week, describing his reaction to the “Healthy Holly” book arrangement. “I was outraged.”",The New York Times
2019,A Chinese Law Professor Criticized Xi. Now He’s Been Suspended.,"BEIJING — One of China’s most prestigious universities has suspended a law professor and placed him under investigation after he published a series of essays that warned of deepening repression under President Xi Jinping, he said on Tuesday. Professor Xu Zhangrun, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, shot to prominence last year when he published a passionate essay in July that was a rare rebuke of Mr. Xi’s rule. The essay denounced Mr. Xi’s authoritarian tendencies as driving China back to closed, repressive politics that could prove disastrous for the country. In spite of censorship, the essay spread in China, capturing a current of disquiet about the direction of the country. Professor Xu received warnings, but he kept publishing pieces that criticized the authorities’ intolerance of dissent. Now, as if to prove Professor Xu’s point, the ruling Communist Party seems to want to silence him. His fate will be closely watched as a measure of how far the party under Mr. Xi will go in tightening restrictions over Chinese academic life, which is already heavily controlled. Since Mr. Xi came to power as party leader in 2012, he has taken particular aim at legal ideas, like constitutional limits on power, that he warned could be used to weaken party control. In a series of mobile phone messages, Professor Xu said that several Tsinghua University officials ordered him on Monday to stop all teaching and research and told him his pay would be cut drastically. He said a university “work team” would investigate him, focusing on the essays he had written since July. He said he was questioned for one and a half hours by the officials. “I don’t know what they’ll do next,” he said. “I’ve been mentally preparing for this for a long time. At the worst, I could end up in prison.” Professor Xu’s suspension could ripple beyond the leafy Tsinghua campus in northwest Beijing. The university is one of China’s most internationally reputable; it hosts many foreign academics, as well as Schwarzman College, founded by Stephen A. Schwarzman, a Wall Street financier. Mr. Xi himself studied at Tsinghua, as have many other senior officials. “A spirit independent, a mind unfettered,” says an old Tsinghua motto. The investigation into Professor Xu, 56, could be used as a warning against any potential dissent, said Geremie R. Barmé, an Australian Sinologist who has translated Professor Xu’s essays. “Xu has repeatedly spoken out with eloquence, humor and devastating candor,” Mr. Barmé said by email. “Tsinghua University has now determined that such poisonous thinking must not infect the student body.” Last year, the Communist Party launched a “patriotic education” drive seeking to ensure that academics and universities conform to party values, but that effort fizzled while the leadership focused on external worries. Professor Xu could now be used as an example to revive that campaign, Mr. Barmé said. Offices reached at the Tsinghua University law school said they had not heard about Professor Xu’s suspension. A professor there, Zhang Jianwei, said by phone that Professor Xu had not been suspended and could still teach. But Professor Xu insisted that was incorrect and that word of his suspension may not have reached other colleagues. Even so, the word had spread among his friends and supporters in Beijing and abroad, prompting denunciations. Zhang Yihe, a writer in Beijing, said she and other liberal intellectuals wanted to speak out in the hope that Professor Xu could be protected from worse punishment. “Xu Zhangrun’s hardships aren’t unique to him,” Ms. Zhang said by telephone. “Caring about what happens to Xu Zhangrun is caring about ourselves.” Professor Xu’s fate has followed the arc of many liberal Chinese intellectuals over the past decade. Once, they enjoyed a measure of official tolerance. But the Communist Party has made it increasingly difficult for many to teach, publish or go abroad. In earlier years, Professor Xu was allowed to lecture at Chinese universities and publish essays and interviews in party-run newspapers and journals. But tightening restrictions have closed off such venues, and liberal academics like Professor Xu have become increasingly disheartened about the prospects for political relaxation and a measure of democratization under party rule. “He cares greatly about scholarship,” said Sarah Biddulph, a professor of law at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who has known Professor Xu since 1995, when he studied at the university. “He is certainly not someone who would just grandstand or chase some form of notoriety.” In other recent steps to dismantle intellectual dissent, party officials in 2016 engineered the takeover of a Chinese history magazine that had served as a forum for liberal former officials and scholars. Last year, the authorities in Beijing shut the Unirule Institute of Economics, a private think tank that favored economic and political liberalization. Nevertheless, Professor Xu continued publishing critical essays — written in rapier-sharp classical Chinese style, rich in ridicule and historical references — mostly on the Chinese-language website of The Financial Times. From there, they spread among Chinese readers, although censorship stymied their widespread circulation. “In a season of discontent and buffeted by winds from all directions, silence now reigns in our realm,” Professor Xu wrote in an essay about his censors that Mr. Barmé translated. The university has moved against Professor Xu weeks before China enters a succession of potentially contentious dates, magnifying the nervousness of leaders who are already grappling with a slowing economy and a trade dispute with the United States. May 4 will mark 100 years since patriotic student protesters took to the streets in Beijing, and June 4 is the 30th anniversary of the bloody repression of the Tiananmen Square protests. In October, the Communist Party will celebrate 70 years since Mao Zedong founded the People’s Republic of China. Professor Xu said the investigation by a team of officials from the university carried echoes of Mao’s destructive Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals and officials were investigated by “special case teams.” “Yesterday the investigation team told me that I was suspended from research. But thinking is in our blood,” he said. “Unless you liquidate me, how could you ever stop me doing my research?”",The New York Times
2019,A Cinderella Story for the Miami Art Scene’s New $100 Million Player,"Miami’s art world has been waiting for the other cultural shoe to drop since 2014, when the nonprofit ArtCenter/South Florida sold one of its two buildings for $88 million — after buying it in 1988 for only $684,000, when the surrounding South Beach neighborhood was more sketchy than stylish. A scrappy organization founded to provide affordable studios, and largely ignored by the city’s marquee art institutions, was suddenly poised to become a major player. The ArtCenter is finally announcing plans for its Cinderella-like windfall (one that, thanks to investments, has since swollen to $100 million, more than the endowment of any other South Florida visual arts organization, many of whom have been struggling to fund-raise even a fraction of that sum). It will be moving to the mainland Miami neighborhood of Little Haiti, where it will build a new $30 million, 40,000-square-foot art center with 22 studios for resident artists, a 2,500-square-foot exhibition space, a 120-seat theater, as well as classrooms and work spaces for an expanded array of instructional courses on mediums like painting and filmmaking. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] “We need a facility that reflects our aspirations,” Dennis Scholl, the ArtCenter president and chief executive said, adding that an architect would be selected by May, with groundbreaking set for September 2020 and a planned opening in Spring 2022. At that point the rain of cash is likely to continue: Mr. Scholl confirmed that the ArtCenter would vacate its remaining South Beach building, though he declined to elaborate on specific plans for the property. The building was assessed by Miami-Dade County at $10 million, but real estate brokers believe it would sell for three to four times that figure. The newly expanded mission is to beef up Miami’s art infrastructure, Mr. Scholl continued in a recent interview, with a focus on career support for emerging artists. “We believe Miami is and should be a 365-day-a-year art town, not a five-day-a-year art town,” he said, addressing criticism that local art activity is anemic outside of the annual Art Basel fair. Accordingly, Mr. Scholl felt Little Haiti was a natural fit for the ArtCenter. “The Upper East Side of Miami is where the contemporary art community is basically relocating,” he said, citing its critical mass of artists and well-respected galleries — many of whom have taken a cue from the ArtCenter’s South Beach history lesson on gentrification and bought their properties outright, rather than sign leases. A name change for the ArtCenter is also in store, to Oolite Arts, a reference to Miami’s underlying geology. “Oolite is what Miami is made of; it just sung to us,” Mr. Scholl said. “I’ve always loved the texture of oolite and the way it was formed — which is a series of disparate granules that come together and create a porous but strong bedrock. All of these things reflect who we are and what we hope to become.” Many Miamians may be less enthused about oolite, or, as it’s more commonly known, limestone. Water bubbles up through limestone’s holes — considered by scientists to be a major factor in the sea-level rise which has already swamped some local neighborhoods even on sunny days. So is Oolite Arts tempting fate by invoking this phenomenon? “Since you’re trying to torture me,” Mr. Scholl answered wryly, “our new site is one of the highest points in Miami-Dade County. It is 11 feet above sea level,” practically Mount Everest by local standards. And while locating a veritable Noah’s Ark for artists wasn’t a goal, “It was a pleasant thing to learn.”",The New York Times
2019,A City Mom Upgrades Her Empty Nest,"The Hunt After her daughter left for college, a longtime East Village denizen went in search of a quieter block and new neighbors. She didn’t have to go far. Miche Griffin grew up on a farm near Nashville, dreaming of a more exciting life. “As a kid, I was drawing pictures of my loft in New York City,” she said. “Somewhere deep inside, I knew I needed the distraction and the busyness that the city offered.” She arrived in the East Village nearly 30 years ago, feeling like a pioneer and a risk-taker. “That was when Tompkins Square Park was full of tents, and one guy had cooked his girlfriend and fed her to the homeless people,” she said. “That was what I moved to.” Ms. Griffin eventually settled with her partner in a two-bedroom rental in a walk-up building, above a restaurant on a busy East Village block, and their daughter was born not long after. Her partner died about a decade later. Three and a half years ago, their daughter left for college in New England. She was never a city girl at heart, Ms. Griffin said. Even as a child, she agonized about homeless people, and complained that the playground was too loud and disorienting. When she moved away, “She said, ‘I don’t think I’ll live in New York City again.’” With her nest empty, Ms. Griffin, now 51, was ready to upgrade, downsize and escape a block that was increasingly noisy and crowded. “What used to be professionals or bohemians was turning into a party neighborhood,” she said. “It was like a fraternity party, and it is not conducive to daily living.” And the apartment was no longer much of a gathering place. “Ours was the apartment that all the kids came to, and when my daughter went to university it was like I lost five kids and not one,” she said. “I thought it would be healthy for me to have a clean slate.” Ms. Griffin, who works in the field of corporate relocation for international clients, went on the hunt for a one-bedroom with a monthly rent of up to $4,000 for herself and her German shorthaired pointer, Sacha. She was willing to live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which had a similar vibe to her beloved East Village, and where she figured she could get a nicer apartment on a better block for a similar rent. She didn’t feel too old for the neighborhood. “My personality totally fits,” she said. She had been eyeing the Lewis Steel Building, a converted steel factory with exposed brick and industrial style on North Fourth Street. Most one-bedrooms there were in the low $3,000s. At that point, Williamsburg was preparing for the L train to close for repairs. Ms. Griffin works from home, so she thought she could function day to day without the train. But then she reconsidered, fearing she might feel disconnected or spend too much on cabs. “The apartment was right, but the location wasn’t,” she said. “The East Village was the one place I belonged.” She liked the central location of the glassy Avalon Bowery Place, completed more than a decade ago, near the corner of Houston Street. It was across from a Whole Foods Market, with convenient subway access. But her budget would get her only a studio there. “I need to be able to separate my bedroom from my live-work area,” she said. A friend from the Tompkins Square Dog Run mentioned the Niko, a brand-new rental building about as far east as possible, at the corner of Avenue D. The size was appealing — a not-overwhelming 12 stories — with a panoramic view from the roof deck. Ms. Griffin found herself liking the area, which was more residential and less crowded than she was used to. It felt like the East Village she had known three decades earlier. She considered her daily routine. “Rite Aid is right downstairs, and the grocery stores are less expensive,” she said. A Citi Bike station was across the street, and the M14D bus stop was a block away. Both East River Park and Tompkins Square Park were quick trips, for walking Sacha. “She was ready to move to a nice place that was new, where she is not going to have any issues,” said the leasing agent, Adrienn Feher of MNS Real Estate. Ms. Feher showed Ms. Griffin a one-bedroom with a terrace, thinking she might like it for the dog, but it was on a low floor with less light than she wanted. Besides, Ms. Griffin knew she would walk Sacha more often if she didn’t have her own outdoor space. She picked a sunny one-bedroom on a higher floor, with windows facing Avenue D. She arrived last fall. “It’s the first time I’ve lived somewhere where everything works,” she said. Her rent is $3,475 a month (the building is currently offering two months free on new leases, so her monthly payment came to $3,089 over the lease term). Amenities, slated to be $100 a month, are currently free. Ms. Griffin easily fit her Indian teak table in the large living-dining area. “I cook a ton — it’s a passion,” she said. “That is my social life. I am not out at bars.” And she found an unexpected advantage to living so far east: “I get to places quicker because I am right beside the F.D.R. When I was more central, I would get stuck in traffic.” In her new, calmer spot in the East Village, Ms. Griffin has met many neighbors. The building staff — including her first-ever doorman — is friendly, “which was very appealing to me, being an empty nester,” she said. People greet one another on the street. If she is short of change at the deli, she pays the next time. “I forget I am not on a porch in the South,” she said.

2019,A Clash at the Cohen Hearing Reveals the Left’s Racial Divide,"WASHINGTON — As the child of former sharecroppers, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland is no stranger to blunt conversations about race. But when a fiery freshman Democrat practically accused a conservative Republican of racism on Wednesday, the uneasy truce that Mr. Cummings brokered put him in the center of a raw debate over race and gender in a changing House. The heated exchange came at the end of Wednesday’s explosive House Oversight Committee hearing featuring Michael D. Cohen. After Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, brought in a black political appointee of President Trump’s in an effort to prove Mr. Trump is not racist, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to “actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.” Mr. Meadows, red-faced and near tears, demanded that Ms. Tlaib’s words be “taken down” — struck from the record as a violation of House rules — and Mr. Cummings asked Ms. Tlaib to explain herself. She apologized. Then the questions began. “Whose emotions do we put first?” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a close ally of Ms. Tlaib’s who is on the oversight panel and witnessed the encounter. “We had to apologize for him getting hurt feelings over her saying and calling out a racist practice,” but Ms. Tlaib was also “hurt, and no apology was furnished to her.” The Root, a website that focuses on race, went further: “Cummings’ handling of Tlaib yesterday is part of a larger problem the Democratic Party has with this new class of women of color: Democrats want women of color in Congress, but they can’t seem to handle their truth-telling,” wrote Terrell Jermaine Starr. He added, “He messed up and needs to apologize to Tlaib nonetheless — publicly. Otherwise, Republicans will take Meadows’ cue and cry a river of white tears each time a woman of color dares to call them out on their racism.” The episode underscored who Mr. Cummings is and how he wants to run his committee. On Thursday, many of his colleagues — including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — came to his defense, saying he handled a difficult situation well by preventing an important and historic hearing from going off the rails. But outside the Capitol, the reviews were less kind. Critics were furious that Mr. Cummings had called Mr. Meadows “one of my best friends,” and resurfaced several 2012 campaign videos showing Mr. Meadows saying he intended to send President Barack Obama “home to Kenya, or wherever it is.” Beyond that contretemps, the Cohen hearing served to shine a national spotlight on a new generation of outspoken young Democrats, many of them women of color, who are forcing pointed conversations about race and abandoning the unwritten protocols of decorum in the way their elders — who often agree with them — have not. “You have to bear witness, bear witness to the truth,” said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil rights icon, who applauded young women of color for getting into what he likes to call “good trouble, necessary trouble.” “This body is going to continue to change as more people of a diverse background come,” Mr. Lewis said. “America is changing. We all need to get on board.” But a generational divide could be emerging, especially with some African-American elders who have been in the House for decades. “I think they certainly bring a different perspective in some ways,” said Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois. “I think the wording sometimes is a little different. The level of what might be called ‘professional civility’ may be a little different, but I think the individuals are expressing in many ways the same feelings and are saying the same things.” For the House Republican Conference, 90 percent of whom are white and male, some uncomfortable moments are inevitable. Mr. Meadows called the “birther” videos “old news” on Thursday and said he had previously apologized. He also appeared to reconcile with Ms. Tlaib; the two shared a hug and a seemingly cordial talk on the House floor. “She said she didn’t mean it yesterday, so there was no need to apologize,” he told reporters afterward. “I wanted her to know, and she wanted me to know, that our relationship is one that will hopefully provide real good results going forward.” Mr. Meadows and Ms. Tlaib are political and cultural opposites. Mr. Meadows, 59, a well-to-do real estate developer, is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and one of Mr. Trump’s most ardent defenders on Capitol Hill. Ms. Tlaib, 42, made headlines on her first day in office after she was captured on video using an expletive to describe Mr. Trump as she spoke of her desire to impeach him. A lawyer and social justice advocate from Detroit, she is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants and one of the first two Muslim women in Congress. She did not respond to a request for an interview on Thursday. Mr. Cummings brushed aside questions. “I’m not going to talk about that,” he said. “I think we were able to resolve it. I think we ended up with civility.” Congress, of course, has been grappling with issues of race for most of its existence, and certainly the debates during the civil rights era were pointed and passionate. But the rise of Mr. Trump, who has referred to a former black aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, as “a dog” and declared that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the white supremacists’ march in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., has made Washington’s conversation about race deeply personal for Ms. Tlaib and other lawmakers of color. “As representatives of communities that are on the margins of how the president defines his vision of America, I think they bring an urgency and an emotional depth to their rhetoric that is not just academic,” said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who was also present for the Tlaib-Meadows exchange. “It’s lived experience.” Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a liberal organization that helped elect both Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, described Ms. Tlaib as “one of a new generation of Democrats who is going to puncture the silence even when it’s uncomfortable.” Mr. Meadows anticipated that Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, would describe the president as racist, which is why he asked the Trump appointee, Lynne Patton of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to attend. When it was his turn to speak, he asked her to rise, and then he spoke for her, saying that she disagreed with Mr. Cohen and that “there was no way that she would work for an individual who was racist.” Ms. Tlaib was incredulous: “The fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself.” Another Michigan Democrat, Representative Brenda Lawrence, who is African-American, said it was “totally insulting” for Mr. Meadows to “prop up one member of our entire race.” Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts who is black, asked Mr. Cohen whether it was possible for Mr. Trump to “have a black friend and still be racist,” to which he replied, “Yes.” In fact, the only Democrats to call Mr. Meadows out were women of color. Men of color on the committee, such as Mr. Khanna and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, held their tongues. While Mr. Cummings may have wanted to put the matter to rest, the exchange was reverberating inside and outside the Capitol. “I think that he handled it in the way that made sense for him and the committee in that moment,” said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of Black PAC, which mobilizes black voters. “He is the chair of the committee, and a part of that role has to be to facilitate and mediate between members.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez agreed, saying she felt Mr. Cummings was “correct in the procedure” and was “trying to do everything in his power to protect” Ms. Tlaib from being reprimanded. But, she added, women of color often face disparate treatment at work. “At the end of the day,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, “one person got an apology and one person didn’t, and two people were hurt.” video OpinionKashana Cauley",The New York Times
2019,A Cliché Harlan Coben Couldn’t Resist,"WHAT I LOVE For the best-selling author of thrillers, buying a spooky old Victorian seemed a little too on the nose. But he did it anyway. 12 Photos View Slide Show › The house did not immediately grab Harlan Coben by the lapels. It was, to tick off the liabilities, situated on one of the main drags in Ridgewood, N.J. Locally, it was a well-known pile of Second Empire gingerbread, with pink trim and a mansard roof. People would drive by and gawk. Sometimes, they would park down the street and, affecting a casual air, take a nice, slow walk past the property for a closer look. And with three floors and nine bedrooms, it was a lot of house. Perhaps most problematic, it was a touch too on-the-nose for the best-selling author of a few dozen thrillers to live in a spooky Victorian manse. “It’s the kind of cliché I try to avoid when I write,” said Mr. Coben, whose latest work, “Run Away,” the story of a Manhattan money manager’s desperate attempts to save his renegade drug-addict daughter, is out this week. This not being a mystery by the master himself, there is no imperative to keep readers in suspense. Just over 20 years ago, Mr. Coben and his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben, a pediatrician, were living across town in a center-hall colonial, expecting their third child (they now have four) and looking for more space. “When the house came on the market, it seemed like a good value,” he said, and so the deal was done. “My wife and I were in agreement,” Mr. Coben continued. “It wasn’t like one of those home shows where they have a couple, and she wants something totally modern and he wants something old-fashioned. I watch and always wonder, ‘How did you guys get married?’” But this acquisition might have satisfied even such bickering pairs. The previous owner had preserved and protected its abundant Old World charm — paneled walls and ceilings, wainscoting, crown molding, herringbone floors, beveled leaded-glass doors — while showing an appreciation for modern conveniences of the Sub-Zero kind. “The Victorian had all the structure of a great old house, but it really was homey,” Mr. Coben said. “I couldn’t turn it down. I sort of fell in love.” The love burns as brightly as ever, but now it has a bittersweet tinge. One by one, the children have gone out into the world. With the youngest off to college next fall, Mr. Coben and his wife will be empty nesters in a very big nest. “But the kids like coming back to the house,” he said, smiling gamely. “They all have their favorite nooks and crannies.” Of course, Mr. Coben has his favorite spots, too. The library ranks high both because it provides an ideal background for the author photos on his book jackets and because, plain and simple, it’s a library. It has reading matter and lots of it, as well as treasures like a Maltese falcon statue, a tip of the hat to Dashiell Hammett, one of Mr. Coben’s literary idols. (“It’s kind of a cliché, but it’s here.”) Occupation: writer Edifice complex: “It was hard for me to imagine living in a house this spectacular,” Mr. Coben said. “I had panic attacks about living in a house this cool.” There is also a statue of Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek. “I loved him when I was a kid,” said Mr. Coben, a native of Newark, N.J., who played on the basketball team at Amherst College. Some of the volumes in the handsome built-in bookcases are foreign editions of the Coben oeuvre. Such display is not born of a desire to trumpet the popularity of exhortatory titles like “Hold Tight,” “Play Dead” and “Tell No One” in distant ports. It is all about storage. Storage is something of a theme for Mr. Coben, who has accumulated many items related to his work — both priceless and worthless — and has not the slightest idea what to do with them. Thus, plaques, posters of the film adaptations of his novels, photographs (some sent by fans) and blowup images of the New York Times best-seller list with this or that Coben novel in the top spot lean against one another in the library, just steps from the pool table. For the record, no one in the family picks up a cue stick. Ever. The presence of the table is a puzzle best left to keener minds. Except when reporters are around and there is an attempt to tidy up, the stretch of green felt holds detritus and, when Mr. Coben is sitting in a chair nearby, his feet. He and his wife have made a few alterations to the house over the years. They painted that pink exterior trim blue, added a bathroom, converted a broken-down greenhouse into a sunroom, outfitted the backyard with a pool and a sports court, and in the spirit of D.I.Y., installed a faux-tin ceiling in the kitchen using plastic molding and gray spray paint. Mr. Coben has an officially designated office on the second floor. It was once the bedroom of his younger daughter, Eve, which explains the red-and-purple walls. Providing a sober contrast is the partners desk that Mr. Coben and his wife bought to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Actually, the office is kind of superfluous. Unlike authors who require a setting with a specific barometric pressure to write even a check, Mr. Coben can work anywhere: a coffee shop, the back of an Uber (seriously). Plot turns have presented themselves during his time on the treadmill desk in the third-floor workout room and in the sunroom, which is just off the kitchen. “I don’t need or want one particular spot,” said Mr. Coben, who signed a deal last year with Netflix to turn several of his thrillers into series and movies. He left the job of furnishing the house to his wife when they moved in two decades ago. And sometimes he may feel a twinge of regret about that decision, particularly about some of the contributions from his mother-in-law, an antiques lover who is now deceased. “Once in a while I see something that’s really ugly, and I don’t know why we’re keeping it, and a lot of it was from her,” Mr. Coben said, hastily adding, “But I do like the player piano that came from her.” It was his mother-in-law who bought him the menagerie of animal-head walking sticks in the stand by the front door. “She thought I should have a collection of something, but I haven’t collected any beyond the ones she got me,” Mr. Coben said, unscrewing one of the sticks to reveal a flask, another to show the dagger tucked inside. Just a weapon looking for a plot. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Climate Panel That Subverts Climate Science,"letter A reader criticizes plans to appoint a panel to challenge climate studies that have already undergone rigorous peer review. To the Editor: In “Climate Panel Could Question Scope of Threat” (front page, Feb. 21), you report that the Trump administration intends to appoint a committee to investigate whether climate change “affects national security.” The executive order creating the committee “casts doubt” on multiple government studies of climate change, noting that accepted climate science has not “undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial peer review.” The government climate studies in question and dozens of similar studies have already been subjected to rigorous peer review. Perhaps the ultimate aim is to reset the standard for accepted scientific knowledge to that which is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, with climate-change deniers self-empowered to act as the judge of whether that standard has been met. For decades Republicans have treated science as an arena of partisan bickering rather than as a search for truth. The suggested change in the accepted system of peer review — adding the insidious requirement that it be “adversarial” — would bring us one step closer to that future.

2019,A Clockmaker With Plans,"NAME Tyler John Davies AGE 27 HOMETOWN Rothesay, Isle of Bute, Scotland NOW LIVES Birmingham, England CLAIM TO FAME Winner of the 2019 Young Talent Competition at the Salon de la Haute Horlogerie, held in January in Geneva. The program honors emerging watchmakers and is supported by F.P. Journe, the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie and the Asia-based retailer The Hour Glass. THE PIECE Mr. Davies attracted the competition’s attention with Equilibrium (pictured below), an eight-day weight-driven wall clock that he created in his final year of study at Birmingham City University. He made his own tools to create its visible deadbeat escapement, which transfers energy to the time-keeping element, and devised a chapter ringed dial large enough to encompass the movement. Other challenges included the clock’s large case of American black walnut, which Mr. Davies designed on a computer-assisted design system, and then joined and finished by hand. BACKGROUND Clockmaking wasn’t a childhood dream. After leaving school when he was 16, Mr. Davies worked in several fields — construction, hospitality, carpentry — until, at 19, he began an apprenticeship restoring antique clocks. Four years later he entered the university, more mature and focused, he said. “I knew that this is what I wanted to do. I was interested in the subject and liked that I’d have access to the equipment, machinery, books, teachers and the industry as well.” In 2018 he earned a degree in horology from Birmingham and became accredited by the British Horological Institute. LATEST PROJECT Mr. Davies has established his own restoration business and is designing and manufacturing a regulator clock with a moon phase. But his focus is not so much on selling his services as on building a portfolio of work, and eventually he wants to accept commissions. “I want to keep developing my designs and manufacturing techniques,” he said. “Then people can look at my work, see different aspects, and from there I can work with them on designs that they want.” NEXT THING Although he made most of the Equilibrium clock himself, Mr. Davies said he is eager to work with others — and already has been collaborating with a furniture maker. Glassblowing also fascinates him, he said — Birmingham’s glassmaking quarter is close to his workshop — and is brainstorming a co-creation. “Think a mantel clock but on a glass stand, with the movement set within,” he said. MAKING CLOCKS COOL Mr. Davies hopes that, by working with other artisans, he can help to change the traditional idea of clocks. “A lot of people say they don’t like clocks and find them boring. But I’d like to change people’s view and make it more contemporary — to turn a clock into a mechanical piece of art.”",The New York Times
2019,A Cloud Over Trump’s Presidency Is Lifted,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — For President Trump, it may have been the best day of his tenure so far. The darkest, most ominous cloud hanging over his presidency was all but lifted on Sunday with the release of the special counsel’s conclusions, which undercut the threat of impeachment and provided him with a powerful boost for the final 22 months of his term. There are still other clouds overhead and no one outside the Justice Department has actually read the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, which may yet disclose damning information if made public. But the end of the investigation without findings of collusion with Russia fortified the president for the battles to come, including his campaign for re-election. While critics will still argue about whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice, the president quickly claimed vindication and Republican allies pounced on their Democratic colleagues for what they called an unrelenting partisan campaign against him. Even as his own party’s congressional leaders called on the country to move on, however, the president indicated that he may not be ready to, denouncing the very existence of Mr. Mueller’s investigation as “an illegal takedown that failed” and calling for a counterinvestigation into how it got started. Emboldened and angry, the president can now proceed with his administration without the distraction of new search warrants and indictments by Mr. Mueller’s team or the worry that the special counsel might charge Mr. Trump’s family members or even uncover a smoking gun that would prove that his campaign collaborated with the Russian government to elect him in 2016. The questions about the Kremlin’s election interference that dogged the president almost everywhere he went may soon fade, even as other investigators continue to look into other allegations. Mr. Mueller’s team confirmed that Russia did try to tilt the election to Mr. Trump, but its conclusion that he did not conspire with the effort may ease the way for Mr. Trump to reorient American foreign policy toward Moscow and its strongman president, Vladimir V. Putin, without as much concern about domestic consequences. And it may give renewed confidence to Mr. Trump, who has complained that his dealings with world leaders have been hobbled by their uncertainty about whether he would survive the investigation. The end of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry also left Democrats on the defensive and will force them to decide how vigorously to continue pursuing allegations of misconduct by the president and his allies, including many that were unexamined by the special counsel, whose mandate was limited to Russia’s interference in the election and any possible obstruction of justice resulting from it. While Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Mueller’s findings were “a complete and total exoneration,” Mr. Mueller explicitly said they were not. Although he did not establish a conspiracy with Russia, Mr. Mueller made no determination when it came to obstruction of justice. “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” he wrote, according to the Justice Department summary sent to Congress. Instead, according to the summary, Mr. Mueller laid out various actions by Mr. Trump that could be seen as obstruction, letting others decide whether they added up to that. William P. Barr, the attorney general recently appointed by Mr. Trump after drafting a private memo expressing doubt that the president could be accused of obstructing justice for exercising his constitutional power, concluded on Sunday that they did not. But the House, controlled by Democrats, has the power under the Constitution to decide for itself whether the president’s actions constituted “high crimes and misdemeanors” that justify impeachment, and it could interpret Mr. Mueller’s evidence the other way once it sees it. The next phase of the story, then, will be the fight by House Democrats to force Mr. Barr to turn over Mr. Mueller’s full report and accompanying evidence, a constitutional battle that could ultimately be resolved in the courts. Until they read the report for themselves, Democrats are hardly going to agree that the president has been cleared. And they will most likely summon Mr. Mueller to testify, which could provide a public airing of Mr. Trump’s actions that, even if not rising to a crime, may not reflect well on the president. Still, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already said that she did not favor impeachment unless the evidence was “so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” a standard that seems even less likely to be met now. Either way, Mr. Mueller’s investigation has taken its toll on this presidency, leading to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for a half-dozen of Mr. Trump’s associates, including his campaign chairman and national security adviser, and spawning offshoot investigations. In any other administration, that record alone would be enough to seriously damage a president. Moreover, as Mr. Mueller closes up shop, federal, state and congressional investigators are still examining Mr. Trump’s business, his finances, his inaugural committee and his associates. Federal prosecutors in New York have implicated Mr. Trump in a scheme to violate campaign finance laws by directing hush money to two women to keep them from talking before the 2016 election about alleged extramarital affairs with him. The State of New York forced him to close his foundation after finding a “shocking pattern of illegality.” The House Judiciary Committee has sought documents from 81 people or entities associated with Mr. Trump on a wide variety of topics. But Mr. Mueller had bipartisan stature and credibility that none of the president’s other pursuers have, despite Mr. Trump’s own efforts to tear him down. Now the president who routinely assailed Mr. Mueller and his “13 Angry Democrats” for their “witch hunt” will surely use the results of the special counsel investigation to dismiss all others as part of a pattern of conspiracy mongering and vindictive persecution, whatever the facts may or may not show. He presumably will not convince his many critics of that, but he may reinforce his political base heading into a re-election battle where Mr. Trump’s ethical and legal issues will surely be a major focus of debate. In polls, core Republican voters have already expressed deep skepticism about the allegations against Mr. Trump and the legitimacy of the investigations into them. “Not indicted” or “not impeached” may not have been much of a bumper sticker in times past, but in today’s polarized political environment, each side sees these issues through its own lens. The notion that the system came after Mr. Trump in the form of Mr. Mueller and failed to take him down will fit neatly into the president’s narrative of grievance and victimization, energizing his self-portrayal as a threat to the existing order. For Mr. Trump, that is as good a day as they come.",The New York Times

Even as his own party’s congressional leaders called on the country to move on, however, the president indicated that he may not be ready to, denouncing the very existence of Mr. Mueller’s investigation as “an illegal takedown that failed” and calling for a counterinvestigation into how it got started. Emboldened and angry, the president can now proceed with his administration without the distraction of new search warrants and indictments by Mr. Mueller’s team or the worry that the special counsel might charge Mr. Trump’s family members or even uncover a smoking gun that would prove that his campaign collaborated with the Russian government to elect him in 2016. The questions about the Kremlin’s election interference that dogged the president almost everywhere he went may soon fade, even as other investigators continue to look into other allegations. Mr. Mueller’s team confirmed that Russia did try to tilt the election to Mr. Trump, but its conclusion that he did not conspire with the effort may ease the way for Mr. Trump to reorient American foreign policy toward Moscow and its strongman president, Vladimir V. Putin, without as much concern about domestic consequences. And it may give renewed confidence to Mr. Trump, who has complained that his dealings with world leaders have been hobbled by their uncertainty about whether he would survive the investigation. The end of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry also left Democrats on the defensive and will force them to decide how vigorously to continue pursuing allegations of misconduct by the president and his allies, including many that were unexamined by the special counsel, whose mandate was limited to Russia’s interference in the election and any possible obstruction of justice resulting from it. While Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Mueller’s findings were “a complete and total exoneration,” Mr. Mueller explicitly said they were not. Although he did not establish a conspiracy with Russia, Mr. Mueller made no determination when it came to obstruction of justice. “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” he wrote, according to the Justice Department summary sent to Congress. Instead, according to the summary, Mr. Mueller laid out various actions by Mr. Trump that could be seen as obstruction, letting others decide whether they added up to that. William P. Barr, the attorney general recently appointed by Mr. Trump after drafting a private memo expressing doubt that the president could be accused of obstructing justice for exercising his constitutional power, concluded on Sunday that they did not. But the House, controlled by Democrats, has the power under the Constitution to decide for itself whether the president’s actions constituted “high crimes and misdemeanors” that justify impeachment, and it could interpret Mr. Mueller’s evidence the other way once it sees it. The next phase of the story, then, will be the fight by House Democrats to force Mr. Barr to turn over Mr. Mueller’s full report and accompanying evidence, a constitutional battle that could ultimately be resolved in the courts. Until they read the report for themselves, Democrats are hardly going to agree that the president has been cleared. And they will most likely summon Mr. Mueller to testify, which could provide a public airing of Mr. Trump’s actions that, even if not rising to a crime, may not reflect well on the president. Still, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already said that she did not favor impeachment unless the evidence was “so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” a standard that seems even less likely to be met now. Either way, Mr. Mueller’s investigation has taken its toll on this presidency, leading to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for a half-dozen of Mr. Trump’s associates, including his campaign chairman and national security adviser, and spawning offshoot investigations. In any other administration, that record alone would be enough to seriously damage a president. Moreover, as Mr. Mueller closes up shop, federal, state and congressional investigators are still examining Mr. Trump’s business, his finances, his inaugural committee and his associates. Federal prosecutors in New York have implicated Mr. Trump in a scheme to violate campaign finance laws by directing hush money to two women to keep them from talking before the 2016 election about alleged extramarital affairs with him. The State of New York forced him to close his foundation after finding a “shocking pattern of illegality.” The House Judiciary Committee has sought documents from 81 people or entities associated with Mr. Trump on a wide variety of topics. But Mr. Mueller had bipartisan stature and credibility that none of the president’s other pursuers have, despite Mr. Trump’s own efforts to tear him down. Now the president who routinely assailed Mr. Mueller and his “13 Angry Democrats” for their “witch hunt” will surely use the results of the special counsel investigation to dismiss all others as part of a pattern of conspiracy mongering and vindictive persecution, whatever the facts may or may not show. He presumably will not convince his many critics of that, but he may reinforce his political base heading into a re-election battle where Mr. Trump’s ethical and legal issues will surely be a major focus of debate. In polls, core Republican voters have already expressed deep skepticism about the allegations against Mr. Trump and the legitimacy of the investigations into them. “Not indicted” or “not impeached” may not have been much of a bumper sticker in times past, but in today’s polarized political environment, each side sees these issues through its own lens. The notion that the system came after Mr. Trump in the form of Mr. Mueller and failed to take him down will fit neatly into the president’s narrative of grievance and victimization, energizing his self-portrayal as a threat to the existing order. For Mr. Trump, that is as good a day as they come.",The New York Times
2019,"A Coffee Shop Pioneer Was Murdered. 23 Years Later, His Wife and Her Brother Are Guilty.","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] For more than 20 years, the murder of Howard Pilmar, a high-end coffee shop and office supply entrepreneur who was stabbed dozens of times and left in a hallway outside his Manhattan office in 1996, went unsolved. From the get-go, the police investigating Mr. Pilmar’s grisly death were convinced that the culprit was someone who knew him. As they investigated, they discovered that Mr. Pilmar’s wife, Roslyn, and her brother, Evan Wald, had both visited Mr. Pilmar’s office the night before he was found dead. The police learned that Mrs. Pilmar stood to receive more than a million dollars in life insurance benefits after her husband’s death. When they questioned Mr. Wald, they noticed a cut on his hand. But as the years passed, detectives never found enough evidence to charge or arrest Mrs. Pilmar or Mr. Wald. Yet they could not find any other suspects in Mr. Pilmar’s murder either. Then, in August 2017, Mrs. Pilmar and Mr. Wald were arrested. At the time, prosecutors said that cold-case investigators turned up new information that would prove crucial to their case. On Friday, a jury in State Supreme Court found Mrs. Pilmar and Mr. Wald guilty on charges of second-degree murder after nearly four days of deliberations, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said. The verdict, 23 years in the making, was a victory for prosecutors, who built their case on largely circumstantial evidence that they hoped would be compelling enough to bring Mr. Pilmar justice. “For nearly 23 years, Roslyn Pilmar and Evan Wald evaded justice for their gruesome crime and thought they would get away with it,” the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. Mrs. Pilmar and Mr. Wald each face 25 years to life in prison. Their lawyers said they would appeal. “We’re disappointed in the verdict, of course, but the battle is far from over,” Sam Talkin, a lawyer for Mrs. Pilmar, said. Throughout the trial, prosecutors portrayed Mrs. Pilmar, 61, and Mr. Wald, 45, as greedy, vindictive siblings who lured Mr. Pilmar to his office and murdered him in March 1996 to resolve financial troubles and settle personal scores. “They planned it as a trap, and they set it up as a trap,” Elizabeth Lederer, the lead prosecutor, told jurors on Monday during closing arguments. “And he didn’t stand a chance.” Mrs. Pilmar was staring down deep financial problems before her husband’s death, prosecutors said. She had been caught stealing $160,000 from the dentist’s office where she used to work and had promised to pay it back. But she had kept the problem a secret from her husband and was desperate to come up with the money without his help. In the days before the murder, the calls about her debt were frequent and persistent, prosecutors said. Adding to her debts, the state told Mrs. Pilmar that she owed the government about $14,000 in unpaid taxes related to her work running one of her husband’s coffee bars. They threatened to shut the business down if she could not come up with the cash, Ms. Lederer said. “She owed the money, and she had to pay it back,” Ms. Lederer said of Mrs. Pilmar. “She had to find it quickly.” All the while, prosecutors said, the Pilmars’ marriage was falling apart. Mr. Pilmar had contacted a divorce lawyer and was looking for a way out of the marriage, they said. Witnesses said Mrs. Pilmar had complained about her husband, calling him verbally abusive. After her husband’s murder, Mrs. Pilmar received more than a million dollars on two life insurance policies, prosecutors said. She also inherited her husband’s businesses, which she sold months after his death, as well as an Upper East Side apartment and a summer home. She eventually pleaded guilty to grand larceny in the embezzlement case in 1999, repaid the money she had stolen, and was sentenced to probation. While Mrs. Pilmar grappled with money troubles, tensions were mounting between Mr. Wald and Mr. Pilmar. Mr. Wald worked for his brother-in-law and thought he was often overly critical, prosecutors said. As problems began to surface in the Pilmars’ marriage, Mr. Wald saw himself as his sister’s protector, Ms. Lederer said on Monday. Before the murder, he had said he would kill Mr. Pilmar if he ever hurt Mrs. Pilmar in any way. Mr. Wald’s lawyers, Daniel Gotlin and Michael Croce, downplayed the testimony about that threat in closing arguments, saying it was not enough to build a case on. “If you were planning something, why would you make that statement?” Mr. Gotlin asked on Monday. “It’s like announcing, I’m going to kill the guy.” Mr. Wald had been a suspect in the case for years after blood at the crime scene was found to match his DNA. When police investigators spoke with him after Mr. Pilmar’s death, they noticed a cut on his left hand that Ms. Lederer said Mr. Wald sustained while stabbing Mr. Pilmar. When the police found Mr. Pilmar, 40, in a pool of his own blood outside his office on East 33rd Street, there was no sign of forced entry. The killing happened shortly after the building’s security guard’s normal quitting time, and detectives saw that as a hint that the killer was familiar with Mr. Pilmar’s business operations. And because Mr. Pilmar’s wallet with $200 inside was found on his corpse, the police ruled out burglary as a motive. The vicious manner of Mr. Pilmar’s death also added to the police’s suspicions. He had been stabbed dozens of times in the chest, back and neck. It was the kind of brutal attack that prosecutors and the police said often pointed them toward suspects with close emotional ties to the victim. “Howard Pilmar was slaughtered and left to die on the floor,” Ms. Lederer said on Monday. The police believed that the wounds were created by a left-handed attacker, she said. Mr. Wald is left-handed, and the cut was found on his left hand, she told jurors. But Mr. Gotlin disputed the prosecutors’ assertions, saying that Mr. Wald’s cut came from cleaning up a broken plate that he had dropped. “His hand was cut. So what?” Mr. Gotlin said during closing arguments on Monday. “That doesn’t mean he killed anyone with a knife.” Mr. Gotlin also tried to get jurors to disregard the drop of Mr. Wald’s blood found at the crime scene. He said in the closing arguments that after detectives zeroed in on Mr. Wald early in their investigation, they failed to adequately pursue other leads. Before his death, Mr. Pilmar had spent much of his life working in his family’s office-supply business, King Office Supply. As early as 4 years old, he was sweeping the aisles in the stores before moving behind the register as a teenager and eventually taking over the family business. It was in 1992, after a trip to Seattle, when Mr. Pilmar came up with a notable business innovation. Spotting the proliferation of high-end coffee bars in that city, he opened a coffee bar in the front of the family store in New York City. The beanery, named Philip’s after Mr. Pilmar’s son, helped King Office Supply stand out from other midtown Manhattan office supply stores and aided Mr. Pilmar’s business in fending off competition from encroaching national chains. With business booming, he opened a second Philip’s in the city not long after. The night that Mr. Pilmar died, he was at his office at about 6 p.m., when his wife and Mr. Wald visited him. Mr. Wald said in an interview then that he and Mr. Pilmar went to work out at a gym before returning to the office. He and Mrs. Pilmar then left, he said. At 5:45 the next morning, when a King Office Supply employee opened the office, he found Mr. Pilmar on the floor, fatally stabbed.",The New York Times
2019,"A College Chain Crumbles, and Millions in Student Loan Cash Disappears","When the Education Department approved a proposal by Dream Center, a Christian nonprofit with no experience in higher education, to buy a troubled chain of for-profit colleges, skeptics warned that the charity was unlikely to pull off the turnaround it promised. What they didn’t foresee was just how quickly and catastrophically it would fail. Barely a year after the takeover, dozens of Dream Center campuses are nearly out of money and may close as soon as Friday. More than a dozen others have been sold in the hope they can survive. The affected schools — Argosy University, South University and the Art Institutes — have about 26,000 students in programs spanning associate degrees in dental hygiene and doctoral programs in law and psychology. Fourteen campuses, mostly Art Institute locations, have a new owner after a hastily arranged transfer involving private equity executives. More than 40 others are under the control of a court-appointed receiver who has accused school officials of trying to keep the doors open by taking millions of dollars earmarked for students. The problems, arising amid the Trump administration’s broad efforts to deregulate the for-profit college industry, began almost immediately after Dream Center acquired the schools in 2017. The charity, started 25 years ago and affiliated with a Pentecostal megachurch in Los Angeles, has a nationwide network of outreach programs for problems like homelessness and domestic violence and said it planned to use the schools to fund its expansion. Now its students — many with credits that cannot be easily transferred — are stuck in a meltdown. On Wednesday, members of the faculty at Argosy’s Chicago and Northern Virginia campuses told students that they had been fired and instructed to remove their belongings. In Phoenix, an unpaid landlord locked students out of their classrooms. In California, a dean advised students two months away from graduation not to invite family to attend from out of town. “In less than a month, everything I have worked for the past three years has been taken from me,” said Jayne Kenney, who is pursuing her doctorate in clinical psychology at Argosy’s Chicago campus. “I am also conscious of the fact that what seems like the swift fall of an ax in less than one month has in reality been festering for years.” The fall accelerated last week when the Education Department cut off federal student loan funds to Argosy after the court-appointed receiver said school officials had taken about $13 million owed to students at 22 campuses and used it for expenses like payroll. The students, who had borrowed extra money to cover things like rent and groceries, were forced to use food banks or skip classes for lack of bus fare. Lauren Jackson, a single mother seeking a doctorate at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology, an Argosy school in Chicago, did not receive the roughly $10,000 she was due in January. She has been paying expenses for herself and her 6-year-old daughter with borrowed money and GoFundMe donations. On Tuesday, after three months of not paying her rent, she received an eviction notice. “I didn’t want to go home and tell my baby that Mommy may not be a doctor,” said Ms. Jackson, whose school could close Friday. “Now I don’t want to go home and tell her that we don’t have a home.” Led by Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Education Department has reversed an Obama-era crackdown on troubled vocational and career schools and allowed new and less experienced entrants into the field. “The industry was on its heels, but they’ve been given new life by the department under DeVos,” said Eileen Connor, the director of litigation at Harvard Law School’s Project on Predatory Student Lending. Ms. DeVos, who invested in companies with ties to for-profit colleges before taking office, has made it an agency priority to unfetter for-profit schools by eliminating restrictions on them. She also allowed several for-profit schools to evade even those loosened rules by converting to nonprofits. That’s what Dream Center wanted to do when it asked to buy the remains of Education Management Corporation. Education Management, once the nation’s second-largest for-profit college operator, was struggling for survival after an investigation into its recruiting tactics resulted in a $200 million settlement in 2015. Despite those troubles, it had 65,000 students, and some of its schools maintained strong reputations. Dream Center is connected to Angelus Temple, which was founded by Aimee Semple McPherson, a charismatic evangelist once portrayed by Faye Dunaway in a TV movie, “The Disappearance of Aimee.” It is affiliated with the Foursquare Church, an evangelical denomination with outposts in 146 countries. Buying a chain of schools “aligns perfectly with our mission, which views education as a primary means of life transformation,” Randall Barton, the foundation’s managing director, said when Dream Center announced its plan. But Dream Center had never run colleges. It hired a team including Brent Richardson, who worked on the conversion of Grand Canyon University to a nonprofit as its chairman, to lead the schools’ corporate parent, Dream Center Education Holdings. He stepped down in January. Alarms were ringing from the moment the takeover was proposed. Dream Center’s effort to buy the failing ITT Technical Institutes schools had fallen apart after resistance from the Obama administration. When it asked to buy Education Management’s schools, consumer groups, members of Congress and some regional accreditors raised concerns. But in late 2017, Ms. DeVos’s agency gave preliminary approval to Dream Center’s plan. Almost immediately, the organization discovered the schools were in worse shape than expected, with aging facilities and outdated technology. The universities “were, on the whole, failing without hope for redemption,” the receiver wrote in a court filing last month. Dream Center had anticipated a $30 million profit in its first year, Mr. Barton wrote in a recent legal filing. Instead, it was facing a $38 million loss. And Dream Center showed little inclination to curb the tactics that got Education Management in trouble, like misleading students about their employment prospects. The executives it installed cultivated a high-pressure culture in which profit surpassed all other concerns, according to a report filed last year by Thomas J. Perrelli, the court-appointed monitor overseeing the schools’ compliance with their state settlements. By the end of 2018, Dream Center was facing eviction on at least nine campuses and owed creditors more than $40 million, and Education Department officials scrambled to plan for what looked like an imminent implosion. “We know all too well that precipitous school closures are bad for everyone involved and leave too many students high and dry,” said Liz Hill, an agency spokeswoman. “Teams of people at the department have been working tirelessly on behalf of students — caught up in this situation through no fault of their own — with the singular goal in mind to ensure as many students as possible had options to complete their education.” The problems grew in mid-January when a creditor sued Dream Center Education Holdings over unpaid bills and asked a federal court to install a receiver to wind down the insolvent organization. Within a day, a federal judge appointed Mark Dottore, who was working with Dream Center as a paid consultant, as its receiver. At a forum last month with students at Argosy University in Chicago, Mr. Dottore tried to calm an anxious crowd. “We will make it until June, I can pretty much assure you of that,” Mr. Dottore said, according to a recording provided to The New York Times by a student. “By hook or by crook, I’m going to get us there.” But on Wednesday, Mr. Dottore filed an emergency motion describing his plans to sell Argosy’s campuses, plus the South University and Art Institute campuses that haven’t been sold already. Any that didn’t have a buyer by Friday would close, he said. Even as Argosy campuses prepared to close, a dean at the American School of Professional Psychology in Northern Virginia emailed students on Wednesday, imploring them to attend classes the rest of the week “if we are to save the semester.” Scott Peck, a 50-year-old student there, left behind a six-figure salary in software and cashed out his 401(k) savings to pay for his doctorate. But he feels worse for his younger classmates. “What’s so heartbreaking is to see what’s happening to these kids in their 20s, who are believing things they’re told by people that they trust,” he said. Argosy was supposed to pay students the extra money they had borrowed, then seek reimbursement from the government. But Argosy reported that the money was paid out even though it wasn’t, Mr. Dottore wrote in court filings, and used the reimbursements for operating expenses instead. A Dream Center spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment on the fraud accusation. While Argosy students have little hope of getting back money they paid out of pocket, the Education Department said the federal loan debt of affected students would be forgiven for this semester. If the schools close, students can seek help under a program covering school shutdowns. Not all of the Dream Center schools are under threat of an immediate shutdown. Some were recently shunted to a new owner in a deal partly orchestrated by the Education Department. But the arrangement with Studio Enterprise, a Los Angeles company that provides support services for creative-industry training programs, raises its own questions. Studio is personally funded by the principals of Colbeck Capital Management, a New York private equity firm that set up the nonprofit owner. Dream Center said in July that it would close more than 30 ailing campuses across all three chains, but a few months later it reached a deal with Studio to salvage some Art Institute locations. As Dream Center’s problems mounted in December, the Education Department called an emergency meeting. Studio agreed to coordinate an acquisition of eight Art Institute campuses and, at least temporarily, six South University campuses. To maintain their nonprofit status, the agreement gave Studio the right to pick a nonprofit to buy the schools. Colbeck Capital used a Delaware-based nonprofit it created five years ago, renaming it the Education Principle Foundation, according to a state filing uncovered by the Republic Report, a site that has closely tracked Dream Center’s unraveling. In mid-January, a news release informed the 15,000 students at 14 Arts Institute and South campuses that their schools were owned by a foundation that hadn’t existed three weeks earlier. Two people familiar with the foundation’s plans said it intended to spin the South campuses off under their own leadership. Robin Von Bokhorst, listed in legal filings as the foundation’s president, did not respond to requests for comment. Bryan Newman, Studio’s chief executive, said the Art Institute schools had been “ignored for years.” “We’re coming in with the view that these schools need investment,” he said. Consumer groups and lawmakers, however, are questioning the arrangement. Two Democrats in Congress have asked the Education Department’s inspector general to investigate the department’s role in the deal. The fate of the schools in receivership is still being sorted out. The judge who appointed Mr. Dottore scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine if he should be removed. Creditors have complained about his close ties to Dream Center, and the judge wondered if Mr. Dottore was managing the situation in a way that did “more harm than good.” Many students agree. “The way they presented the receivership was that it would be beneficial to the students, but it’s actually been detrimental,” said Marina Awed, a student at an Argosy school in California, Western State College of Law, who was scheduled to graduate in two months. “It shouldn’t be this easy to defraud the Department of Education.”",The New York Times
2019,A College Investor Who Beats the Ivys,"In 2005, Paula Volent, the head of the Bowdoin College endowment, wanted to move some of the college’s money into a Sequoia Capital venture fund focused on China. But Stanley F. Druckenmiller, a prominent hedge fund manager and influential member of the college’s investment committee, didn’t like the idea. “I was pretty aggressive at pushing back because I thought it was too risky,” he said. “I did not get the whole China thing.” Ms. Volent didn’t take no for an answer. “We pulled together a detailed memo” that persuaded the committee to approve her plan, she said. It turned out to be a profitable decision. Bowdoin invested $500,000, which had swelled to $3.75 million by June 30. “It has been a complete home run,” Mr. Druckenmiller happily conceded. That has hardly been Ms. Volent’s only smart move since 2000, when she began managing the Bowdoin endowment. In that time, the little liberal arts college in Brunswick, Me., has risen to the top of the heap in financial performance. Bowdoin posted an 8.8 percent average annual return over the 10 years that ended June 30, handily beating the 6 percent average for all college endowments with assets of more than $1 billion, according to a national study. The school also outperformed all eight Ivy League endowments, none of which managed to beat the 8.1 percent average annual performance of a plain vanilla portfolio consisting of stock and bond indexes, according to Markov Processes International, a research firm. What’s more, Ms. Volent, 62, achieved this feat as something of a pioneer in a male-dominated field. Only 16 percent of comparable college endowments are run by women, according to data from Charles Skorina, whose firm recruits chief investment officers. Her own path has been unique, but Ms. Volent said the field could be a great one for women. “I really hope young women will not shy away from careers in finance,” she said during an interview at her small office on the Bowdoin campus. Aside from its financial rewards, Ms. Volent said, managing a college endowment is a way of doing good. A rising endowment can give “students who could not otherwise afford to get an education the chance to get one,” she said. That has been the case at Bowdoin. In the 2018 fiscal year, the college said, the endowment provided roughly three-quarters of the school’s $41.6 million financial aid budget. Ms. Volent found her way to asset management through a circuitous route. After receiving a degree in art history and chemistry from the University of New Hampshire, she took a job at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in 1980 with the intention of making a career in art conservation. She later earned an advanced degree at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts and worked at several other museums: the New-York Historical Society, the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. While running her own paper conservation studio in Los Angeles, Ms. Volent began taking business courses at the University of California, Los Angeles, and realized that she had an aptitude for numbers. But she discovered her vocation in asset management at Yale, where she earned a master’s in business administration. She also worked at the university’s endowment under David F. Swensen, who has mentored many portfolio managers and developed a highly regarded strategy that includes investments in alternative asset classes like real estate, hedge funds and private equity. Mr. Swensen declined to comment for this article. Ms. Volent recalled her start with Mr. Swensen with a smile: “I think he hired me because he wanted to write a book and he thought I was a good writer,” she said. She helped him write the book — and he helped her learn a new trade. “I fell in love with finance and endowments,” Ms. Volent said. “No question was too silly. You could ask David anything.” In 2000, she returned to Bowdoin as the manager of the endowment, which then held only about $465 million in assets. By the end of the fiscal year last June 30, it had climbed to $1.63 billion. Clayton Rose, Bowdoin’s president, gave Ms. Volent and her staff of six much of the credit but, in a statement, also praised “the discipline and foresight of our Investment Committee.” It plays a supervisory role now, but when Ms. Volent arrived at the endowment it did a great deal of the hands-on work itself, with the assistance of Cambridge Associates, an investment firm. Ellen Shuman, a former Bowdoin trustee and Investment Committee member, said skilled, full-time portfolio managers like Ms. Volent tended to do better than committees. “Investment committees are poor stewards of capital,” said Ms. Shuman, a partner at Edgehill Endowment Partners, where she manages money for nonprofits. “They each want people they know as managers. They are not there watching the managers day to day and monitoring the portfolio.” Mr. Druckenmiller, the chairman of the Investment Committee, has been an enduring influence on Ms. Volent, who said she had incorporated lessons from him, as well as from Mr. Swensen, in formulating her approach. Unlike Mr. Swensen, for example, Mr. Druckenmiller is a practitioner of short-term trading based on macroeconomic trends. He has a formidable reputation, both in his own right and as the manager of George Soros’s Quantum Fund. He managed that fund when Mr. Soros made a fortune by betting against the British pound. “I think that the long view that was drilled into me at Yale complements Stan’s shorter-term market values,” Ms. Volent said. “From each of them, I learned critical thinking.” Like Mr. Druckenmiller, Ms. Volent favors hedge funds that make macroeconomic bets — investments in equities, currencies and other instruments based on a manager’s views of global economic and political trends. For the most part, Mr. Swensen has avoided such funds, she said. “David believes that no one can anticipate changes in currencies and interest rates,” Ms. Volent said. With their high fees and requirement that investors keep their money “locked up” for long periods, hedge funds lately have been “getting bad press,” Ms. Volent said. “But Bowdoin’s best performance has come in periods where protection of capital is key and hedge funds have been additive here.” Still, the illiquidity of such funds has sometimes been a problem, she said. In the 2008 market meltdown, for example, Bowdoin was unable to withdraw its money from a declining fund, which Ms. Volent declined to identify. “We were ring fenced,” she recalled. On balance, however, she finds such funds useful, she said. As the endowment’s assets have grown, so has Ms. Volent’s compensation. In 2016, the most recent year for which information is available, she earned $2.78 million, according to Bowdoin’s government filings. That’s high for the amount of money she manages, Mr. Skorina said, but the endowment’s performance has been exceptional. Mr. Druckenmiller said Ms. Volent’s background in art might have made her more creative than most financial managers. “It can’t be overemphasized,” he said. “She does not have a cookie-cutter financial background.” He added that she liked to develop younger managers and stick with them. “She will work with managers that others might think are too young or inexperienced,” Mr. Druckenmiller said. “But if you are willing to invest with a manager earlier in their cycle, then you could have 15 or 20 years of outperformance. Last year, we had a 29-year-old manager who was up 35 percent.” Ms. Volent said her work in art restoration had taught her the need for concentrated study before plunging into action. “Art conservation and investment management are similar,” she said. “You do a lot of preliminary work. You don’t want to drop an artwork in a solution and it disappears. The same is true in investments.” While Bowdoin’s strong returns have gotten attention lately, it wasn’t always easy to persuade outside fund managers to work with the endowment. In contrast to Yale, Ms. Volent said, “no one even knew what Bowdoin was.” But she has been relentless, Mr. Druckenmiller said, during a 7 a.m. interview in his Manhattan office. “Paula can be dogged when she thinks an investment will work for Bowdoin,” he said. When outside funds have been closed to the school, he said, “she will cultivate them for years.” “Sometimes I think they take us just to get her off their backs,” he added. In assessing fund managers, Ms. Volent said, she looks for more than a strong performance record. “The numbers are important in illustrating patterns,” she said, “but they are only useful if they are used with qualitative good judgment.” For example, Ms. Volent recalled a meeting with a manager who had impressed her until he said he had to leave because his private jet was waiting. That sense of entitlement was a turnoff, she said. “We like to invest with managers who are small and hungry to establish themselves,” she said. “The jet suggested that he had already gathered a lot of personal assets and was not as focused on his portfolio.” Some of Bowdoin’s investments have been managed by funds in which trustees and investment committee members have an interest. In 2018, 8.2 percent of Bowdoin’s total holdings were in such “related party” funds, the college’s government filings show. More than half of the 809 schools surveyed by the National Association of College and University Business Officers permit such arrangements. Many require “recusal and disclosure” to safeguard against conflicts of interest. Such issues have been raised at several schools, including the University of Michigan and Dartmouth College. Ms. Volent said Bowdoin required the disclosure of potential conflicts. One of her greatest challenges is finding promising areas for investment. She has been pursuing contrarian ideas in recent months, considering investments in Britain, which has been in turmoil over Brexit — the country’s pending exit from the European Union. “When there is so much volatility, investors may have to get rid of stuff,” Ms. Volent said. That may be difficult for Britain, but for a small college in Maine, it might lead to good things. “There may be opportunities for Bowdoin,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,A Colonial-Era Cemetery Resurfaces in Philadelphia,"Remains buried in the First Baptist cemetery were believed to have been moved in 1860. But many coffins and bones were still there. CreditCreditSkeletal remains recovered from 218 Arch Street in Philadelphia, the site of the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia's cemetery, founded in 1698. In June 2017 Kimberlee Moran, a forensic scientist at Rutgers University-Camden, stood in a pit at a construction site in downtown Philadelphia, just across from the Betsy Ross House. The walls of the pit were shored up by diagonal pillars of dirt. They bristled with coffin wood — and human bones. But what she couldn’t see bothered Ms. Moran still more. “Where’s all the stuff in the dirt that’s now missing?” she wondered. With her were Anna Dhody, a forensic anthropologist at the city’s Mütter Museum, and Kimberly Morrell, an archaeologist with the engineering firm Aecom, hired to excavate the site. They were standing in what once was the cemetery of the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia, founded in 1698. Historical records said the remains were supposed to have been relocated to another cemetery, Mount Moriah, back in 1860. And yet here were all these bones and remnants of coffins. Ms. Moran and Ms. Dhody were not entirely surprised. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In fall 2016, after workers broke ground on a new condominium here, the two scientists were handed a single box of unclaimed bones collected on the site. A few months later, a backhoe crunched into skeletons and coffins. “There is a very characteristic ‘pop’ sound when a backhoe goes through a skull,” Ms. Moran said. With grudging permission from the developer, PMC Property Group, construction was halted whenever a backhoe turned up another body. The researchers mounted a two-week salvage excavation, recovering more than 80 burials. After hitting a stretch of soil that was grave-free, they hoped they’d found all the bodies. They had not. After the visit in June 2017, Aecom dug all summer, eventually discovering another 328 intact burials. Then the researchers knew they had uncovered the rarest of opportunities. Most unearthed cemeteries in the United States have been reinterred without analysis. Few dated to the colonial era. So Ms. Moran and Ms. Dhody — with George Leader, an archaeologist at The College of New Jersey, and Jared Beatrice, an osteologist at the college — started the Arch Street Project, a mostly crowdfunded attempt to understand more about the lives of these early Philadelphians. “This cemetery has the potential to fill in a lot of gaps about not just Philadelphia but the colonial period,” said Sherene Baugher, an archaeologist at Cornell University and co-author of “The Archaeology of American Cemeteries and Gravemarkers.” Comparing First Baptist’s remains, she added, to those from the African Burial Ground in New York City, as well as from Jamestown, Va., and St. Mary’s City, Md., may reveal widespread changes in health, lifestyle and diet over time, and hint at their impact by race and class. But first, the bones had to be exhumed. City and state heritage agencies said they had no jurisdiction over remains found on private property in a privately funded project. So the city’s Orphans’ Court, which oversees unmarked graves and cemeteries, decided the fate of those left behind in the First Baptist cemetery. The Philadelphia Archaeological Forum advocated in court for a respectful exhumation and reinterment. PMC, the developer, eventually agreed to pay for the effort. The court gave archaeologists until Sept. 30, 2023, to study the remains. Then they must be interred where they were supposed to have been moved more than 150 years ago: Mount Moriah Cemetery. As for the missing soil that so disturbed Ms. Moran? Doug Mooney, president of the archaeological forum, did the math and accused PMC of dumping perhaps as many as 782 bodies in a landfill during construction. The company denied dumping remains. In 1707, the First Baptist Church moved into a former Quaker meeting house at what is now 218 Arch Street. It was a well-connected congregation with a cemetery open to different sects and faiths. “You have lots of non-Baptists buried there, people from all walks of life — the wealthy, the poor, the influential, the unknown,” Ms. Moran said. In 1855, the church moved again to a new spot at Arch and Broad streets, and the cemetery fell into disrepair. The church applied for a license from the city Board of Health to move the graves to Mount Moriah. Approval came in December 1859. The move to Mount Moriah was to be made in haste. But by that point, perhaps 3,000 or more people had been buried at First Baptist, according to Nicholas Bonneau, principal historian of the Arch Street Project. “They only have three months, from January 1st to April 1st, in the middle of winter, to move what we now know are thousands of bodies,” Mr. Bonneau said. Newspaper articles indicate some relocation work occurred. An article on March 8, 1860, in The Public Ledger recounted how relatives of the dead, asked to identify their ancestors, were shocked to find many barely decomposed in their coffins. And some headstones at Mount Moriah predate 1859. But did the bodies actually come with them? Every day during the excavation in summer 2017, Ms. Moran or Dr. Leader loaded coffins into their cars and drove them to Waggin’ Tails, a former dog-grooming business in rural New Jersey. Its exterior featured murals of romping dogs, ears and tongues flying, which the scientists hoped would throw illegal bone-hunters off the trail. The temperature-controlled interior helped maintain the remains. The team now has the remains of at least 491 people. At Rutgers-Camden, the commingled bones are sorted and cleaned under Ms. Moran’s direction, while the intact remains, about 175 of which were found in or near coffins, are examined at The College of New Jersey. The largest coffins are more than six feet long, the smallest no bigger than a shoe box. With the help of students, Dr. Beatrice is creating a biological profile — age, sex, height, ancestry — of every person found intact. He’s finished with less than a quarter of them. “I have nightmares,” he said. “I wake up in the middle of the night and think about how many skeletons I still have to analyze, and I can’t get back to sleep.” The researchers assess teeth and bones, and look for pathologies and trauma that reveal details about an individual’s life. Cause of death can be hard to determine, thanks to what’s called the osteological paradox: Not every deadly disease or traumatic injury leaves a mark, and some kill before they do. Still other pathologies aren’t fatal or affect people in various ways. Many children and young males lie among the remains. Nutritional deficiencies are common; conditions like anemia and scurvy leave characteristic bone porosities. Dr. Beatrice has found linear enamel hypoplasia — grooves in the teeth that indicate generalized physiological stress — in virtually every mouth. “It’s very strange to have almost everybody exhibiting really obvious indicators of childhood stress that would disrupt their growth and development,” he said. The only parallel archaeologists have found comes from Philadelphia’s First African Baptist Church cemetery, unearthed in 1980 during a rail construction project. One man has a quarter-size cranial depression above the “hat-brim line” — a telling spot. “Things that happen above that level tend to be the result of interpersonal violence,” Dr. Beatrice said. Along his right side are healed injuries, perhaps from the impact of a carriage or a bad fall. The skull of another man was opened after death with a hand-sawed circumferential cut. Its interior is imprinted with the elaborate folds and fine veining of the surface of his brain. Philadelphia was home to some of the first teaching hospitals in the United States, but his skeleton has no other cut marks that indicate anatomical dissection. A lot of crumbled brain matter has been discovered in cracked skulls. Ms. Moran is collaborating with researchers at Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee to study what remains of the lipids and fatty tissue, which may reveal biomarkers of pregnancy, Alzheimer’s, immune responses to infectious disease and other telling conditions. (The Lincoln scientists got in touch after she put out a call for research ideas by posting on Instagram a photo of a desiccated but clearly recognizable brain.) Ms. Moran has done a genomic analysis of the soil that fell into the abdominal regions of four bodies, hoping to find evidence of the individuals’ gut microbiomes. So far she and her colleagues have recorded about 2,000 bacterial species, including those responsible for chlamydia, tuberculosis and leprosy. Ms. Dhody is analyzing DNA of the calculus buildup on teeth. Tartar and plaque form hard deposits that trap a wealth of genetic material from pathogens that infect an individual. She and her colleagues are reviewing the initial results. Fabric fragments, fake-gold shroud rings and pins, coffin nails, broken pottery and glass comprise most of the artifacts. But the cemetery has yielded one of the largest collections of coffin hardware discovered in a colonial American cemetery. These decorative plaques and handles have helped to date many burials to the 1720s to 1790s. One key resource has been a 1783 volume of the “Tuesby and Cooper Coffin Hardware Manufacturer’s Catalog.” Dr. Leader tracked down the only known copy at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and Ms. Dhody made digital copies when she visited last fall. Dr. Leader matched First Baptist hardware to the catalog. Coffin plaques have yielded the names of just three people: Thomas Weir, Mr. R. Watson and Benjamin Britton. Among nearly 500 remains, only Mr. Britton’s name is matched to his body. His long, ornately decorated coffin suggests that he was a rich, and large, man. One of three Benjamin Brittons buried in First Baptist, he may have been the oldest, a successful baker — and slave-owner — who died in 1782 at age 78. Two more names were found using headstones: Israel Morris and Sarah M. Rogers, who was 3 years, 9 months old when she died on Nov. 1, 1801. Mr. Bonneau identified her by matching a burial record to the age and death date on her broken headstone, from which the name had been lost. Eventually the researchers would like to compare the health of individuals with the wealth of their burial. Dr. Leader created a system that assigns a point value to each coffin based on its materials. Mr. Britton’s, for example, has tin-dipped lead metalwork — the most expensive material. Connecting the archaeological and historical data will yield a better picture of everyday life in colonial Philadelphia, which was the largest city in British North America by the end of the 18th century. “It was a city defined by possibility,” Mr. Bonneau said. “It was built for trade.” The city’s explosive growth had major health impacts. “People suddenly found themselves living in really tight quarters, and did not necessarily have the tools to manage hygiene or larger community sanitation,” he added. “That increased the amount of diseases that occurred throughout middle age.” The cemetery interred many victims of yellow fever epidemics in 1793, 1797 and 1798. Gravediggers placed a thick cap of soil over these coffins, likely to quell the stench of death and contain the “miasma” thought to transmit disease. Public health initiatives followed these epidemics, including the formation of the Board of Health, better street-cleaning and improvements to municipal water quality. Whether these changes are reflected in the First Baptist bones remains to be seen. Most of the First Baptist dead seem to be of European ancestry. Mr. Bonneau has found burial records of 15 people of African descent — all were free, and none share the same surname — but archaeologists haven’t determined African ancestry for any remains yet. “If the science comes back confirming that we have folks that are not European, then that makes it even more unique that we have a potentially truly — in every sense of the word — integrated cemetery,” Ms. Moran said. Today, First Baptist Church hosts an elderly congregation with just a dozen members at weekly services at the church’s third location, at 17th and Sansom. When the cemetery was discovered, “they felt no connection,” said Roy Harker, the church’s executive director. “And since there was no legal obligation, no one really expressed anything other than curiosity.” No descendants of those buried in the cemetery have contacted the church to ask about their ancestors, he said. When 2023 comes, the archaeologists would like to see the burials reinterred one person per box, reunited with any objects discovered with them, and the commingled bones buried together. But the final decision rests with PMC Property Group. And Mount Moriah has its own problems. It’s been closed since 2011 and neglected for longer, though a dedicated group of volunteers clears brush and removes trash. One headstone-free area of First Baptist’s original plot is a candidate for the final resting place of those left behind. The Arch Street researchers are presenting their findings at professional conferences and are submitting articles to peer-reviewed journals. They’re applying for research grants to supplement their crowdfunding. Multiple spinoff projects are being conducted at other universities. But never far from mind is the fact that these were people, deserving of the final rest they were denied. “I have all the respect in the world for every single person we have here,” Dr. Leader said. “As much as I am appreciative of getting the wealth of knowledge from them, I actually look forward to putting them back in the ground.”",The New York Times
2019,A Comic Book Publisher Creates Its Own Origin Story,"American Ronin, about highly trained corporate operatives; Fight Girls, about warriors vying to be queen of the galaxy; and Bad Mother, about a parent searching for her missing daughter: These are some of the stories that are coming from a new comics publisher, Artists, Writers & Artisans, one that is posing the question, what stories could we develop if we begin with a blank slate? In comic books, there are two main publishing models. One emphasizes flagship characters — like Batman and Spider-Man — whose success largely benefits their companies, DC and Marvel Comics. The other is creator-focused, where hits like The Walking Dead, by Robert Kirkman and published by Image Comics, can mean a financial windfall for its creators. AWA is aiming for something between the two: It will have interconnected superhero comics like DC and Marvel as well as stand-alone series like Image. And all of its creators will have a financial stake. It’s an approach reminiscent of old Hollywood. “The model here really is the old United Artists model, where people who are actually doing the creative have ownership, control and decision-making power over the work that they’re doing,” said Bill Jemas, a former chief operating officer and publisher at Marvel who is the chief executive and publisher of AWA. Joining him at the helm are Axel Alonso, a former editor in chief at Marvel, as chief creative officer and Jonathan F. Miller as chairman. Miller helped broker a deal in 2017 between the comic book writer Mark Millar and Netflix, which bought his library of characters for development on the streaming service. Jemas and Alonso say the first of AWA’s titles will arrive some time this fall. [Read about TKO, another new comics publisher aiming to shake things up.] “What we’re offering creators is an opportunity to bet on themselves without putting it all on the line,” Alonso said, during a recent conference-call interview with Jemas. Their stable of writers and artists includes both veterans and newcomers, Alonso said. They would be paid to produce the work as well as own their stories and characters, a percentage of the company or both. Besides AWA — whose team also includes Frank Cho, the writers Peter Milligan and Christa Faust and the artist known as ACO — there are other newcomers to the field trying to rupture the mold of comic books publishing. TKO Studios, which announced itself in December, plans to binge-release its mini-series, simultaneously selling collected editions of those stories and offering the first issue of each comic free. AHOY Comics, which began publishing in September, is more old school, but it is trying new things: It includes extra material — prose stories, cartoons, even a crossword — in its issues, and is also publishing Second Coming, a comic book featuring Jesus Christ, in July. AWA has its own biblical title, Archangel 8, which is written by Michael Moreci and is about one of God’s angels who goes rogue. To help shape the comics, the publisher has a creative council, which includes the screenwriter and director Reginald Hudlin, the novelists Margaret Stohl and Gregg Hurwitz, the comic book writer Garth Ennis and J. Michael Straczynski, a screenwriter and co-creator of Netflix’s “Sense8.” Straczynski took a sabbatical from comics about three years ago, but kept busy working on multiple projects: an autobiography, a novel and a screenplay, adapting his Rising Stars comic book series for MGM. “I was open to returning to comics if the project was something challenging, so when Bill and Axel approached me about creating an entirely new, cohesive, shared comic-book universe, the prospect was too much fun to resist,” he wrote in an email. Straczynski has developed the origin point of AWA’s superheroes. He has worked for comic companies with different publishing models. At DC and Marvel, “you always kind of know where the guard rails are,” he noted, including an obligation to bend, but not break the characters. With creator-owned work, “you can go as far as you want, since only you bear the consequences if you mess it up,” he wrote. Straczynski was drawn to the blended approach of AWA. “You get to create a new universe for what has every opportunity to become a major company, while taking real chances.” In developing AWA’s superhero universe, Straczynski and Alonso took a broad look at others. Straczynski postulated that DC’s heroes, which generally emerged out of the postwar ’40s, were largely authority figures, while Marvel’s, which mostly emerged from the ’60s, were anti-establishment. “Who are we writing our stories about, and for, and what are we trying to say that’s relevant to a contemporary audience?” he wrote. AWA has big ambitions and hopes to create a library of material like that of Marvel. “I think it’s fairly safe to say that Marvel is the most valuable entertainment franchise in the world,” Miller said. After the Netflix deal, he wondered if there were similar opportunities. He and Jemas got together, and Alonso soon joined them. “One of the great things about doing things this way is that you get to try a lot. Some things will hit, you never know when and where, but that’s part of the idea,” he said. “As long as you keep getting your turns at bat, then you’ll get some hits.” An earlier version of this article misidentified Bill Jemas’s role at Marvel. He was chief operating officer and publisher, not a vice president.",The New York Times

2019,A Condo Inspired by Japanese Aesthetics,"The High End The 12-story building that will replace the Church of the Redeemer in Boerum Hill borrows from Japanese architecture and gardens. The Church of the Redeemer, which was built in 1866 in Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill, mirrored the Gothic style of medieval churches in Europe. The condominium building rising in its place, however, looks toward Japan for inspiration. Ryoko Okada, a principal and director of interior architecture and design at ODA New York, said she tapped into the Japanese aesthetics of “wabi-sabi,” or the art of finding beauty in imperfection, when designing 561 Pacific. “It’s about finding natural materials that have an unconscious aesthetic,” she said of the many warm brown and gray materials she chose. The wood, stone, concrete and steel used in the interior all have knots and grains with very subtle imperfections, some of which will also change over time, she said. “It’s about celebrating what’s naturally incomplete.” Ms. Okada, a native of Japan, said the wooden slats found in the entryway of the 63-unit building resembles “koshi,” or wooden lattice entryways and window coverings found in traditional wooden townhouses in Japan called “machiya.” It allows some light in, but also keeps the entryway private, Ms. Okada said. The hallway in the ground-level lobby lounge is made with light gray concrete-look porcelain tile, with dark solid wood and metal inlays separating each slab. This is inspired by “tobi-ishi,” or steppingstone, and “roji,” a lush, garden path that leads to a teahouse. Both are Japanese design features that make you consciously focus on where you are walking and block the outer world. “I thought it would be great if residents can use the same thought process, where you can consciously start decompressing from the outside chaos when you get home,” Ms. Okada said. The building is in a particularly hectic area, just a block from the major traffic intersection of Atlantic, Flatbush and Fourth Avenues, and close to the Barclays Center and the Atlantic Terminal and Atlantic Center shopping complexes. Developed by Adam America Real Estate, the 12-story building will offer studios from $550,000, one-bedrooms from $850,000, two bedrooms from $1.375 million, and three-bedrooms from $2.275 million. Over a third of the apartments will come with private outdoor space. Sales start later this month. Building amenities include a gym, a playroom, a rooftop sun deck with barbecue and dining stations, and bike storage. Sixteen parking spaces will be available for purchase for $150,000 each. The building, expected to be finished early next year, will also have about 7,000-square-feet of ground floor retail space available. Like other parts of the city, the Brooklyn condominium market was slower in the fall and winter months, but the mood has been rather upbeat from the start of the year, said Brendan Aguayo, senior vice president and a director at Halstead Property Development Marketing, the firm in charge of sales. Mr. Aguayo said he has seen a large increase in traffic, demand and deal velocity as interest rates have stabilized. “Brooklyn condominium buyers are very sophisticated,” Mr. Aguayo said, noting their desire for “everything,” including high-end interior finishes, proximity to transportation and a vibrant neighborhood. Being within easy walking distance to Park Slope, Fort Greene, Gowanus and Downtown Brooklyn will likely appeal to many buyers, Mr. Aguayo said. “I think this building is on the forefront of the shift happening on Fourth Avenue and the renaissance of this corridor,” he said, referring to an anticipated rezoning of nearby Gowanus. “Wabi-sabi embraces the imperfect and accepts that change happens,” Ms. Okada said when describing the building’s Japanese design inspiration. It’s a notion that works extremely well for a calm, welcoming home, but is undoubtedly hard for some neighbors to swallow as their immediate surrounding gets denser. For those nostalgic for the Episcopal church that once stood here, one relic remains. A well-preserved mosaic tile that signaled the prominence of the church, which closed in 2010, still exists in the northwest subway exit on the corner of Pacific and Fourth Avenue.

2019,"A Conspiracy Theorist, Anthony Comello, and a Mystery Motive in Gambino Murder","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Anthony Comello was known as an aimless young man on his family’s block in Staten Island, where he lived in his parents’ house. He could be helpful, offering during snowstorms to plow the streets with his pickup and to clear snow from neighbors’ driveways. But he also believed in far-right conspiracy theories, had an OxyContin habit and could be aggressive when he was high, people who knew him said. Still, he was not the kind of person anyone imagined would someday pull off the highest-profile mob killing in decades. Mr. Comello, a 24-year-old born and raised on Staten Island’s South Shore, is accused of gunning down a Gambino crime family leader, Francesco (Franky Boy) Cali, on a quiet street in Todt Hill last week. The shooting rocketed Mr. Comello, an otherwise unsensational young man who was struggling to launch his adult life, into true-crime infamy. But in the days since Mr. Cali, 53, was shot 10 times, Mr. Comello — as well as his motive — has remained a cipher. The police have not explained how Mr. Comello even crossed into Mr. Cali’s orbit, let alone why he allegedly decided to kill him. Mr. Comello has no known connection to organized crime, according to law enforcement officials and his friends. Whatever the motive of the shooting, the Gambino crime family has not historically been a forgiving entity, and officials say Mr. Comello faces a threat to his life in prison. He was being held in protective custody in New Jersey and was expected to be transferred to Staten Island on Monday. An outlandish twist came this week when Mr. Comello, at his first court appearance, displayed symbols and phrases associated with far-right conspiracy theories, scrawled on his palm with a pen. His lawyer said he had become obsessed with such theories in recent months. In February, officials said, Mr. Comello had shown up at public buildings announcing he wanted to make a “citizen’s arrest” of prominent liberal Democrats like Mayor Bill de Blasio. In his only comments since his arrest, Mr. Comello was cryptic. “Don’t believe in fairy tales,” he said to a Daily News reporter on March 20, before abruptly ending a short jailhouse interview. How all of the story’s incongruous pieces — a mob boss, a far-right conspiracy theory, a struggling young man from a middle-class Staten Island home — fit together remains unknown. Yet a fuller picture has emerged of a rudderless person who appeared to take an abruptly ominous turn and had been influenced by conspiracy theories in the dark corners of the internet. The son of a veteran manager at Bloomberg L.P. and a construction worker, Mr. Comello graduated from Tottenville High School in 2012. He was described by two former classmates as aloof but easily influenced, a teenager who sought approval from popular crowds but was never quite accepted into them. He experimented in high school with drugs, two former classmates said, and occasionally picked fights while under the influence. According to social media accounts, Mr. Comello started a Facebook group in 2011 to discuss prices of marijuana. But as high school friends matured and moved forward, Mr. Comello spiraled downward. By adulthood, his drug habit had escalated into a serious problem. According to three friends, Mr. Comello wrestled with drug addiction and popped pills, including OxyContin. A habitual smoker of Marlboro Reds, he was a regular at Campos deli a few blocks from his family’s home. Didar Janid, a deli employee, said Mr. Comello was friendly but had a combative reputation. “He was a little bit aggressive,” Mr. Janid, 46, said. “Gradually he was calming down.” [“I just heard the pow-pow-pow-pow-pow.” Read more about the fatal shooting of Francesco Cali on Staten Island.] Mr. Comello’s mother, Nicole Mucillo-Comello, 51, is a well-established executive overseeing information systems in the Bloomberg organization, where she has worked for 28 years, according to her social media accounts. His father, Alfonso Comello, 54, worked in Staten Island’s construction industry. Anthony Comello is the middle of three children. His older brother, Alfonso, 30, works in construction and was a mason for the New York City Housing Authority until 2016. Mr. Comello’s younger sister, Nicolette, 21, attends St. John’s University, according to her social media profile. On Retford Avenue, where Mr. Comello lived with his parents in a spacious, two-story home, he led a quiet existence. He was sometimes seen walking the neighborhood with a friend who lived nearby, neighbors said. Reached by a reporter, the friend declined to comment. Mr. Comello appeared to have odd construction jobs and was often seen working with his father, according to neighbors. The family home had a fleet of pickup trucks, one said. “I’ve seen his parents numerous times,” said Victor Ujeck, who lives across the street from the family’s home. “Very nice people.” “I would never imagine he could have done this,” Mr. Ujeck said. “I was shocked.” Law enforcement officials were initially investigating whether Mr. Comello had a romantic interest in a female relative of Mr. Cali’s. In an early conversation with detectives, Mr. Comello said Mr. Cali had told him to stay away from a young woman in the Cali family, the police said. Yet neighbors and friends did not recall hearing about a girlfriend or a love interest. Despite his drug use and intermittent scuffles, Mr. Comello had no serious run-ins with the law before this year. Whatever his criminal inclinations, they escalated from bland to bizarre in February, when United States Marshals kicked him out of a Manhattan federal courthouse. Mr. Comello had entered the building and demanded a citizen’s arrest of local and national political figures, including Mr. de Blasio and the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. The stunt was noticed by the city police and the marshals, who law enforcement officials say put out a bulletin alerting other city institutions to watch for Mr. Comello. The following day, he was seen at the mayor’s residence, Gracie Mansion, where officers recognized him. Mr. Comello left the property before the situation escalated, but spoke briefly with officers. “These were rambling statements,” said John Miller, the chief of the New York Police Department’s intelligence division. ""He wanted to make a citizen’s arrest of Maxine Waters, Congressman Schiff. He blamed Nancy Pelosi and all kinds of other people for stealing the election.” The motivation for Mr. Comello’s February stunt became clearer Monday, when he was arraigned in a New Jersey court. As he entered the courtroom, he raised his open palm, where he had scrawled the letter Q and several phrases associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. That baseless theory suggests, among other things, the United States government is run by pedophiles and President Trump will overthrow them. It encourages followers not to trust career politicians, particularly Democratic ones. Mr. Comello’s lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, said the young man became fascinated with QAnon and other far-right internet narratives involving Mr. Trump. Friends and family, Mr. Gottlieb said, described a noticeable and recent shift in Mr. Comello’s personality as he fell deeper into digital rabbit holes. [What is QAnon? Explaining the internet conspiracy theory.] In the days since Mr. Comello’s arrest, his family has all but gone underground. Attempts to reach his parents were unsuccessful; a neighbor said Wednesday that he had seen the family packing bags and leaving their Eltingville home, and thought they had moved out. At Mr. Comello’s older brother’s home, a man said the family did not want to talk. At a separate address listed for an apparent relative, a man told a reporter to “take a walk.” Mr. Cali’s murder was not the Comello family’s first brush with the law. Mr. Comello’s older brother, Alfonso, is currently facing felony assault and burglary charges in Richmond County for an incident in Staten Island last September, charges that he denies and is fighting. According to a criminal complaint, Alfonso Comello entered the home of a woman he knew on Sept. 25 with an accomplice and beat the woman’s face with the handle of a knife. The beating was violent enough to knock out several of the woman’s teeth. The woman, whose name was redacted in court papers, was tied to a bed as Alfonso Comello rummaged through drawers and demanded money. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Arthur Louis Aidala, said Alfonso Comello categorically denied the charges. Missing from the Comello family troubles, however, is any obvious connection to Mr. Cali. According to the police, Anthony Comello entered Mr. Cali’s neighborhood late on March 13 and backed his blue pickup truck into Mr. Cali’s Cadillac Escalade, knocking off the S.U.V.’s license plate. He rang Mr. Cali’s doorbell and the two walked outside and exchanged words, according to surveillance video obtained by the police. Mr. Comello picked up the Escalade’s license plate, and handed it to Mr. Cali. Then he allegedly pulled a pistol and opened fire and fired 12 shots, hitting Mr. Cali 10 times. He drove away in his pickup. Mr. Comello’s fingerprints were found on the license plate, the police said. “Something went very wrong here,” Mr. Gottlieb said.

2019,Opinion | A Contempt for Facts,"letter A reader worries about another cultural shift. To the Editor: I appreciate Arthur C. Brooks’s assertion that our country has moved beyond polarization and into a “culture of contempt” (Sunday Review, March 3). I certainly catch myself crossing that line. But he doesn’t note that a large portion of our citizens now have contempt for facts. It will take more than kindness and dialogue to change this distressing cultural shift.

2019,A Conversation With Alec Soth About Art and Doubt,"Ahead of his latest solo show and book, the photographer talks with T’s Hanya Yanagihara about the often unsettling power dynamic of taking a person’s picture, and their shared love of the artists who do it so well. On a chilly winter day in early 2018, I got an email from someone I’d never met asking if he could come over and perhaps photograph me. “Yes,” I replied. “Come over anytime. Come over this weekend.” He said that he would. I had never met Alec Soth, and yet — in the artificial way that we feel we know something of the person who has created a work of art we’ve consumed and, in my case, returned to again and again — I felt I had. I first encountered Alec’s debut project, “Sleeping by the Mississippi,” several months before it was shown in New York City, in 2004. That work, a series of 47 images of people and places taken as Alec followed the sweep of the country’s second greatest waterway, which meanders and swells from northern Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, remains the visual equivalent of an American songbook: Here is a sofa bed in Louisiana, the ceiling above and walls around it sparkling with lengths of tinny, glittering light bulbs and metallic-shimmery ropes of beads hung thick as kudzu; here is a self-possessed, bouffant-haired lady in Mississippi, fingernails trim and neat, holding a gilt-framed picture of a cloud shaped like an angel. What could have easily become a parade of grotesqueries is instead a chronicle of small lives, no less wretched or stately, sad or dignified, than any other — what unites them, in the end, is not the Mississippi, but the tenderness, the humanness, with which they are presented. It is that quality that unites all of Alec’s work; it is why a photograph by him, no matter where or of whom they are taken, is so recognizably his. Alec’s framing, his color, his sense of light, his angles: They are all his, and they are inimitable. But what is as distinguishable about his work is something less nameable — there is a kind of patience to his images, a gentleness, a suggested communion between two people. Making fun is easy. Making contact is something much harder. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] That weekend, then, Alec came over. He looked around my New York apartment, where I live with three of his photographs, including one, “Charles” (2002), a portrait of a man in Minnesota, his face obscured by glasses and beard, a nunnish balaclava on his head, holding, so proudly and carefully, two model airplanes, one in each hand, that hangs to the right of my desk, where I write — it is a portrait of childlike pride, and also a portrait of loneliness. I have seen Charles’s face more than I have seen some of my friends’ — and, of course, I haven’t seen it at all. Then we sat down to talk. At the time of our first meeting, Alec was emerging from what I could dramatically call a crisis of conscience, but might more accurately be characterized as one of those occasional awakenings that do and must beset every creative life, the one that forces you to demand of yourself why you make the work you do. Why do we do it, any of it? Why do we write, and paint, and compose, and choreograph, and make images? Even putting aside the question of whether art does or should help anyone (no; no), one must then ask whom one’s art might be hurting. I always say that art is an exploration of what it means to be human — and on good days, I know what I mean by that. On bad days, I don’t. What Alec described that afternoon, with great generosity and humility, is the moment every artist fears; the one in which you become too aware of what your art demands — not of you, but of others. I understood that fear, and I understood as well the negotiation one makes with oneself to push onward, past that awareness: I can’t go on; I must go on. Half a year later, Alec returned to my apartment, where we sat down again to have the conversation recorded below (which has been edited for clarity) and to look through the photographs that comprise this series. He had just come from a meeting with his gallerist Sean Kelly, and he admitted to being frustrated by his inability to articulate what this work was about. (“Was the work about anything?” he wondered aloud. “Did it matter if it wasn’t?”) I have long had the theory that Alec is one of the most narratively minded artists working today; it is why so many writers I know respect and admire him — there is a story being told with and in every one of his series, and the details with which that story is constructed are often pleasingly off. But he is also, as this conversation proves, a rarer creature still: a truly articulate human, one who has come to realize that the greatest artists are the ones who move closer to their deepest doubts about what they do and who they are. Doubt is a bonfire that burns within all of us, all the time. We circle around it, we dip toward it, we run away. But it is always there, and a few of us march toward it, and some of us do it with a camera in hand. He walks up to it, he holds aloft the camera, he shoots. The resulting image will be for all of us to see — proof that the fire can be looked at directly, and that the person who recorded it has survived, and has come back to tell us that we can, too. Alec Soth: I’ve struggled to talk about my work this time around. Maybe I’ll get my banter together over time. But I really don’t have it together now. Hanya Yanagihara: What do you say when someone asks? AS: That’s what I’m struggling with. I can give a super-long answer. But the short one that I’ve been giving — portraits and interiors wherever I travel: I can feel how unexciting it is. It’s just not sexy. Whereas if you say something like, “I’m traveling along the Mississippi River,” people get it. They can hang onto that. HY: I think all visual artists these days are more or less expected to have some sort of prepared statement. AS: I’ve always liked the accessibility of my work, that people are let into it pretty quickly. Part of talking about it might be for sales, but it’s more about getting people engaged with the work. They’re related, I suppose. It’s like being on a book tour. You have to say something. HY: Yes, but it’s a little different. Because the writer’s medium is words. So you should be able to use words to describe to some extent what you’re doing. Yes, the work should speak for itself, and yes, it stands alone as its own being. There is no amount of explaining you can do that will ever substitute for the experience of reading the book and having a reaction. But I don’t know of a single author who at some point has not had to explain or defend with language their work, which is also, of course, created with language. AS: Right. But I think there’s a difference between the novel and poetry. So if you’re asked, “What is your latest book of poems about?” “Well, it’s about, like, light and birds and...” HY: Yes, yes, you’re right. AS: And I think that’s what is happening with me a little bit. I’m on the poetic side of the spectrum. It’s a little less driven by narrative. HY: Do you think part of the difficulties you’ve had explaining the work are related to the sort of — I don’t know how you want to characterize it — but the crisis of art making that you had before you began this series? And will you talk a little bit about that? AS: Oh, boy. HY: It does seem central to the creation of this body of work. AS: It’s true. Yes, it’s the basis of everything. I just worry that this story has become a little self-indulgent. HY: I found it fascinating. AS: Well, a few years ago, I started meditating. It wasn’t a huge part of my life. It was just interesting to watch how my brain worked. But I didn’t feel particularly changed. And then I had an experience on a trip to Helsinki, in Finland. I was meditating on the plane. Then when I landed, I went for a long walk and sat by a lake and meditated. I’m sure the jet lag was a part of this, but I ended up having a full-on mystical experience. The only way to describe it is to say that I suddenly understood that everything was connected. I felt it in a deep and profound way. This changed everything. The next day, I had to give a lecture about my work. I stayed up all night rethinking everything about what I do. Photography, for me, has always been about separation and this feeling of social distance that I have. But if I know that everything is actually connected, even if I can’t experience it all the time, aren’t I just promoting or reinforcing distance with my work? So not long after this, I stopped photographing people. I stopped traveling and just stayed at home. I was completely content to give up the path I had been on for all those years. I was just so happy sitting around looking at the light. A year went by of doing this. HY: Were you photographing the light or just experiencing it? AS: Sometimes I’d photograph, sometimes not. I have an abandoned farmhouse on a little piece of land that I’d purchased years before. I started going there to just experience the weather and the light. Sometimes I just read. I tried to never have an intention to produce anything. If it happened, it happened. Then a year went by and I realized, wait a second, I have to work. I decided to start traveling and photographing again, but I thought, “Well, I’m going to do it in a different way. When I photograph people, I want to find a new way to engage with them. Where it’s not driving around, snagging people, talking them into stuff they don’t want to do.” HY: Is that how it felt? Is that how you experienced your earlier series? You make it sound so predatory in a way. AS: There is something predatory about it. It’s not like I didn’t get people’s permission. But there’s a power dynamic at play. Avedon talks about this all the time. In the end, the photographer has the power. HY: I wonder, did you feel you were looking for a kind of humility? Or did you just feel that you wanted something to be corrected? AS: Maybe it’s a correction. When I started as a photographer, I was so nervous photographing people. That made the playing field more even. But as the years went by, I got more professional about it. I wasn’t as nervous. There was this sense of like, here is Mr. Hot Shot photographer coming in. I can handle this situation. Which is definitely different from how I started. After all of that meditation, I thought, “Why am I doing this? What value is it to others?” I had to figure out how to photograph people again. I did an experimental project at Fraenkel Gallery in which I spent a lot of time one-on-one with people in the gallery space. Sometimes we’d take pictures of each other, but we’d also just play and hang out. The choreographer Anna Halprin wanted to do one of these sessions with me, but she was 97 and too frail to come to the gallery. So I visited her home in Marin, Calif. I photographed her in a way that I have always photographed people — with a certain amount of distance. But it felt different. It felt like I had come back to something. Or slightly purified the system. HY: Why? AS: I just felt like a younger photographer; like I’m just taking pictures. This is why it’s hard to talk about this work. It’s like Photo 101. I’m just spending time with a person, taking their portrait. HY: What did you have to unlearn? AS: That’s a good question. Instead of getting the subject to do something for my project, maybe it’s more about taking what’s there and having an encounter and having it work or not. HY: Did you feel disarmed? AS: I wouldn’t say disarmed, no. I felt comfortable. I felt like I wasn’t abusing anyone. HY: This is the fundamental question that everyone who photographs people has to ask themselves or should ask themselves. Is there something fundamentally exploitative about photographing people? Do you ever feel you’ve been? AS: Yes. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Absolutely. HY: Why? AS: Because I’m using people for my purpose. There are different kinds of exploitation, different degrees of it. I don’t think mine has been the most severe. But I definitely have an awareness that, yeah, I’m using people. I’m sure that writers struggle with this. I’m sure even figurative painters struggle with it. HY: Was Arbus ever exploitative? AS: Oh, yeah. But she was also a huge influence. My earliest pictures didn’t have people in them at all. Then I looked at Arbus. There’s so much power. And that’s how I thought of people in my pictures — they’re like the gasoline. The power is undeniable. I originally struggled to get that fuel into the engine. But once I did, it started to drive everything. And then at a certain point I realized that I’m not taking these people into consideration. Or not enough consideration. HY: Why do you think people agree to be photographed? AS: People like to be acknowledged. Why do people want to be on social media? They want to have an identity and presence. HY: Especially with “Sleeping by the Mississippi,” there were some people where you look at them as a viewer and you just think, “No one has asked to see them in years.” And so the first way they’re being seen is in a way that opens them to ridicule to some extent. But yet also honors them and memorializes them to a certain extent. AS: Right. It does both of those things. I mean, usually, the process, the experience of approaching a person is very positive. It’s really the part after that I worry about. Most people don’t understand photographs on a wall in a museum. That’s for paintings. They just don’t get it. All of the shoots in this series were set up in advance. People knew more about what they were getting into. They could go online and read about me and figure out the whole thing. It’s more of an even playing field. Take you, for example. You’re a person who definitely understands photography and how it works. We didn’t know each other, but I thought there could be a connection on some aesthetic level. But I could feel your apprehension to being photographed. You stated it, but I could also feel it. I wasn’t interested in getting in your face or having you take off your clothes. That’s something that’s different for me now. Because I know how to manipulate a situation. HY: But could you have, do you think? Do you have those skills? AS: I really think I do. HY: Really? AS: Yeah. A week ago, I was invited to take a picture in someone’s old mansion in Salt Lake City. The owner told me that there was a ballroom on the third floor. But then he said his wife didn’t want me to photograph there, didn’t even want me to see it. I know I could have gotten in there if I wanted to. I just don’t feel pushy in that way anymore. HY: If it had been five years ago, would you have pushed? AS: Oh, totally. In a second. Yeah, yeah. I would have been in there. In fact, that would have been my only goal. HY: Is it a different kind of respect for the people? Or is it almost — is it sort of a challenge to yourself? AS: I suppose part of it is respect. But I also have a sense now that it doesn’t matter as much. Enough is enough with the ego gratification. HY: Some of the most intimate and the rawest photographs in this series are of spaces. There’s this idea of taking a portrait of someone through their space: Not through the space that they want hidden off, but the space they occupy. Not the ballroom, but the bathroom. This is something you’ve maybe been doing all along. And so when you talk about humans really being the kindling that sets fire to an image, I understand what you mean, but there’s a kind of charge to photographing the small spaces of someone’s life. Is that something that you consciously decided to do with this series? AS: When I started this project, my only intention was to spend time with another person in a room, any room. But after I photographed Anna Halprin, I decided it should be in the subject’s home. This makes them more comfortable. It’s also more stuff to help reveal what might be going on inside of them. I started thinking about “Message From the Interior” by Walker Evans. That book only has twelve pictures. They’re all interiors and only a few of them have people, but there’s so much to look at. When I was in high school, I used to deliver Chinese food. I loved that moment when the customer opened the door and I could peek into their interior world. It always felt magical and mysterious. Being a photographer is an excuse to invite myself inside and look around. Sometimes I wish I could just look at the person in the room without ever talking. HY: The poem from which you found the title for this project [“Gray Room” by Wallace Stevens] is about a fundamental distance between the speaker and the subject. And an elemental connection between the two. AS: That poem makes so much sense to me. This is how photography works — this appreciation of all these surfaces, all this beauty. But you can’t quite get inside. It’s about making do with that. HY: And in a way, it’s a very beautiful celebration of the limits of this medium. And I suppose an honest admission that as much as we think photography — and, let’s say, especially portrait photography — captures something, it does, but it doesn’t capture everything. Nor should it be expected to. AS: There’s a shared solitude. HY: You mentioned Peter Hujar and Nancy Rexroth in an email. And I know that you’re a great admirer of Hujar, as am I. Why? AS: Hujar’s influence was like a spiritual aura hovering over this work. He had this incredible intimacy in his pictures. An interiority about them. But also an ability to just make pictures. That was the feeling that I wanted. I didn’t want to try to connect all the dots into a grand narrative. I just wanted to make photographs that were loving and affectionate and tender. HY: I don’t know if you saw the show that Jeffrey Fraenkel held [at his gallery in San Francisco] a couple of years ago of Hujar’s work. AS: I didn’t, no. HY: It was a really beautiful show. It wasn’t that large. But he curated it very beautifully; the pairings were very good. There was this one couplet of the famous picture of David Wojnarowicz with the snake. And next to that was a lesser-known picture of a dark, roiling sea. And then next to that was one of his beautiful horse pictures. And then next to that was a sink with a clutter of objects in and around it. You don’t think of Hujar necessarily as an object photographer. Certainly someone like Arbus was only a portrait photographer. Or at least most prominently. And yet many of his works, you’re right, had that same quality. He was able to somehow suffuse them with the same kind of intimacy as if they were portraits. I think what I have found that I respond to in his work as I look at it more and more is that there’s a mutual respect that runs through everything. When it’s a picture of a horse or a picture of a disabled child or a picture of a former lover. And that kind of graveness, that gravity, is really, I think, what unites them for me. AS: The word that I would use for Hujar is “tenderness.” That’s the feeling that I get from Hujar over and over again. No matter how sexualized. HY: Yeah, me too. But then Nancy Rexroth is a very different kind of photographer. AS: Very different. Nancy Rexroth is someone that I see as quite removed from the world. She and I have corresponded over the last few years, but we’d never met until I took her picture. I always imagined her living in an all-white room on the second story of an old house like Emily Dickinson. It was so surprising to see her living in a crammed apartment bursting with color in Cincinnati. But there was still something reclusive about her place. HY: I thought of her when you were talking about light and watching light. AS: When I think of her, I imagine her alone in a room, dreaming about her childhood. And when I think of Hujar, I think of him in a room with another man looking at him tenderly. So they’re two very different photographers. I’m probably some mishmash of both, in a way. With other stuff mixed in, too. I don’t photograph people I know. The more I know you, the less likely I am to take your picture. HY: Because you just can’t see anymore? Or you can’t… AS: I don’t understand it. I honestly don’t understand it. It just doesn’t work. I have to get on the therapist’s couch. HY: What is the most intimate moment that you have when you’re making a photograph? Is it when you’re behind the camera itself? AS: Good question. HY: While you think, I’ll talk. When you were photographing me, I thought a lot about this. We had talked about the power imbalance of being the subject and the shooter beforehand. What I remember about the experience was that it was a very womblike experience. You were literally hidden, shrouded. You were almost in a supplicating posture, I felt. You were enthralled to the machine. And all I had to do was sit still, which wasn’t very difficult. But what you had to do — I suppose what I’m trying to say was it felt like you were being controlled both by me, the subject and by the camera itself. I think you’re also very... you have a lovely, soft voice. You’re a very reassuring presence. But I was reminded in those moments of the kind of humility it takes to be crouched in an uncomfortable position beneath the hot piece of cloth waiting for the eye of the camera to do what you wanted it to do. So I understand that in the moments before you get behind the camera, there is a sort of dance, there’s an exchange, sometimes more manipulative than others. But once you get behind the camera — and I know people disagree with this — I felt you were disempowered rather than empowered. I mean, I thought of how Arbus always held her camera at her chest. And shot from there rather than up against her eye. And in that sense, it was a restoration of power. She was able to talk and look the subject in the eye while at the same time doing something they couldn’t see. She regained control of the machine. But when you were looking into the machine — I don’t know. You give up something of yourself as a human to the machine. That makes you less powerful, I always think. AS: So that moment, the moment of being under the dark cloth looking at the person is incredible. It’s really satisfying. And this is simply a technical matter. But there’s this anxiety that’s caused by that moment when I have to take off the dark cloth, put in the film and take the picture. And all the possible things that I could lose. I’m always panicked about that. But the looking is really something. It makes me think about the idea of Zen photography. If I were a Zen photographer, I would just look through binoculars. Binoculars are amazing. Because you’re thrown inside the image. And that far away thing, you can almost touch it. “I Know How Furiously Your Heart is Beating,” will be on view at four different galleries this month.

2019,A Cosmic Being Dies in Yoga Class. Then Things Get Really Weird.,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE SILK ROAD By Kathryn Davis If writers can be said to have an animating concern that threads through their work — memory for Proust, love for Austen — then Kathryn Davis’s is none other than the animating force itself, the soul. Davis has been quietly publishing a novel every few years since 1988. She has gathered a small devoted following, and yet she is refreshingly unconcerned with wider success. Her writing exists outside of genre and trends and time. She operates in a mode that could be called surreal realism, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy dissolve into a place where imagination is akin to gravity and exerts a pull just as powerful. Her eighth novel is even more metaphysical and experimental than its predecessors. If a Hilma af Klint painting could become a book, it would be this one. “The Silk Road” opens with a mystery. Eight cosmic beings, whose memories of a shared childhood lead us to believe they are siblings (though they are perhaps variations on a single soul, reincarnations of one another), are taking a yoga class in a subterranean labyrinth somewhere in the arctic north. They are referred to only by their professions: the Astronomer, the Archivist, the Botanist, the Keeper, the Topologist, the Geographer, the Iceman and the Cook. The class is led by the enigmatic Jee Moon, who is described as “shrouded in something aqueous.” Someone, though we never learn who, fails to arise from corpse pose. It is deemed a murder, but no one is especially interested in solving it. The book’s other mysteries seem more pressing to a reader — what state of existence are these beings in, who is Jee Moon, where are we, what is the plague that has decimated the population — and yet the novel is just as uninterested in answering them. “The Silk Road” merits being read twice, not because there is more joy to be found in the language once you know where the story is going but because there is something else to be found once you surrender to a journey without a destination. Journeys are another of Davis’s fascinations. As with the soul, the theme that thrummed underneath her other novels becomes central here. In the beginning, the characters (if they can be called that; their personalities are only hastily sketched) tell how they each arrived in this settlement: terrestrial tales of poetry readings, hiking trips and car accidents, though these stories swerve and never finish. Halfway through the book, the siblings embark on an excursion, though where and why we are not told, and time folds in on itself. They are on this new journey and on every journey they have undertaken before, together or separately, together and separately, until they inhabit one another’s memories and one by one they disappear — though even this description makes it sound too concrete. If the trip is like anything, it is a psychedelic one, an ayahuasca journey complete with heavy symbolism. The objects that emerge from the fog are signposts for signposts — tarot cards, constellations, tokens, the three-line gallows of a children’s game of Hangman. Davis’s language has been compared to music, and though she can craft a lyrical sentence (“Not that mother was particularly big, just sweeping like a generalization”), much of the writing here reads more like an oblique spiritual handbook. (“Voluntary action arises from within, from the unpredictable movement of a single atom.”) “The Silk Road” is more like music in its harmonies: Davis pulls from folk songs, French ballads, nursery rhymes; from Hindu gods and Greek ones; from Chinese and Western astronomy. Every source is blended into the ur-source, the life source, the blinding white of every color seen at once. “The Silk Road” is unlikely to make its way onto any best-seller lists. And yet, for those willing to get lost in its spiritual haze, there is a uniquely un-2019 pleasure to be found: a meditative bewilderment that just might cede to enlightenment.",The New York Times
2019,A Czech Artist Sends Her Message to Hong Kong,"PRAGUE — For the Czech sculptor Anna Hulacova, sometimes art is a family affair. Her husband, Vaclav Litvan, whom she met when they were students at Prague’s Academy of Fine Arts and who is also a sculptor, sometimes works with her on the technical side of her pieces, and he often helps install her works in museums and galleries for shows. Her aunt, Zdenka Kucerova, who is a beekeeper back in Ms. Hulacova’s home village of Kasejovice (about a 90-minute drive southwest of Prague), has also had a hand in helping the 34-year-old artist with her conceptual art over the years. They designed a way for Ms. Hulacova to put some of her works, with hollowed-out middles, on top of beehives so the bees over time created intricate honeycombs inside the cavities of her sculptures. Ms. Hulacova — a keen environmentalist — and her aunt also made sure that once the sculptures were removed, there was little disruption to the bees and hives. Meanwhile, her father, Josef Hulac, a furniture restorer and farmer, and her brother, Jan Hulac, have done intarsia (a form of wood inlay similar to marquetry) work for a few of her installations. A wooden skateboard and table, where they used 15 different types of wood including cherry, oak, mahogany and ash, were part of the installation “Graceful Ride,” which was exhibited last year at Kunstraum, a London gallery. “They enjoyed doing it,” Ms. Hulacova said, adding that she paid her father and brother for their work. “Especially my father, because he could finally return to his best techniques, which was a cherry on top for him.” At Art Basel Hong Kong, Ms. Hulacova’s work “Pathetic Poetic,” an installation that includes not only her own sculpted concrete pieces but also her father and brother’s skateboard and table (and their intarsia wooden bookshelves), will be featured in the Discoveries sector of the fair. It’s something of a coup for Ms. Hulacova, as well as for her gallery, Hunt Kastner (the first Czech gallery to show at Art Basel Hong Kong), because it is a chance for her work to be seen by collecting and curating circles across Asia. Though her work has been featured at other big-name art fairs including Frieze London in 2017, she hasn’t had much of a presence outside Europe, though she will also take part in the Aichi Triennale in Japan starting in August. However, Ms. Hulacova has increasingly become a name not only in her own country, winning Czech Artist of the Year 2017, but also across the Continent as well. She has been featured in a number of European solo exhibitions, including one in Paris at the Fondation Louis Vuitton from October 2018 to January 2019. She has also participated in a several group exhibitions including, also in Paris, the Palais de Tokyo’s “Another Banana Day for the Perfect Fish” and in last year’s Baltic Triennial in Lithuania where her “Underworld Upside Down” received much critical praise. Another group show, “Entomos: Hulacova-Keresztes-Janousek,” closed this month at the Colloredo-Mansfeld Palace in Prague. Adeline Ooi, the Asia director for Art Basel, said the whole point of the Discoveries sector was to introduce up-and-coming artists to a new broader Asian market. “When we discussed the project, it jumped out,” she said of Ms. Hulacova’s “Pathetic Poetic” installation. “It stood apart from everybody else in its own way. It rang with a certain kind of honesty, and it was distinct, and you could not say no to this.” As a child, Ms. Hulacova loved to model in clay, and her father sometimes let her practice carving in his studio. As a teenager, she was sent to school to learn traditional woodworking. While she enjoyed the experience, she realized that her real love was more contemporary, so at 18 she moved to Prague to study art — something that her family supported but didn’t really understand at first. “They didn’t know that art can be a serious job,” the shy artist said with a chuckle. “It was quite funny when I found out that I would go on a residency to Strasbourg and my grandfather started to cry because he could not believe that someone would pay for me to be staying somewhere.” While at art school, she found she was interested in juxtaposing not only sculptural styles, like classical with conceptual, but also working with different materials, aspects that she experiments with in her current work. However, a number of her professors felt that her work was too provincial and naïve. “They didn’t understand it,” said Kacha Kastner, one of two North American expat co-founders of Hunt Kastner. “In the Czech Republic, there is a strong post-conceptual bent and at that time no one was making figurative sculpture, and so I think it took longer for people to jump on the bandwagon. But maybe that is a good thing.” What makes Ms. Hulacova’s work stand out, say critics and curators who have worked with her, is that combination of seemingly incongruous themes, concepts and materials that on paper seem like a bizarre mishmash yet somehow, once combined, create a powerful and stimulating body of work. They include brutalist architecture and Central European folklore to Greco-Roman mythology, Surrealism, Futurism and science fiction — all represented through things like wood, concrete, honeycomb and digital prints. “Through this ambiguous yet playful mix of inspirations, techniques and materials,” Yoann Gourmel, one of the curators of “Another Banana Day for the Perfect Fish,” wrote in an email, “she successfully merges in her own distinctive language the local with the global, the past with the present, the organic with the digital, without any distinction or sense of hierarchy.” The combination, much of which Ms. Hulacova said comes out of her anger over things she finds unjust, including issues around loss of animal and insect habitats, often also mixes the optimistic with the pessimistic, so while some find her works grotesque and disturbing, others find them playful and beguiling. “People do not realize her works have a deep social commentary,” Ms. Kastner said. “When she is angry, she sees a situation, like problems with the environment that people are not addressing, and she feels she has to do something.” Her art must be touching a nerve. “There is a wave of tensions in her work that make it absolutely mesmerizing,” said Vincent Honore, who curated last year’s Baltic Triennial. “She is an extraordinary artist.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Dating App for Three, Plus","Nonmonogamous coupling — and “thruppling” — has been lubricated by the internet. Feeld is a dating app with options that put the Kinsey scale to shame. If you’re single, you can set up an account stating your preferences and curiosities, as you might with any other service. The app lists 20 possibilities for sexuality alone, including heteroflexible (straight-ish) and homoflexible (gay, for the most part). But couples and partners can sign up, too, in service of finding a third — or a fourth. The app was released in 2014 by Dimo Trifonov and Ana Kirova, two graphic designers living in London, as 3nder (pronounced “Thrinder”). They hoped to appeal to individuals and partners looking to join or have threesomes. But after Tinder filed a lawsuit and the company rebranded as Feeld (as in “playing the”), the founders said they welcomed the opportunity to expand the mission of the app. “Feeld is a platform for alternative dating, for people who are beyond labels,” Ms. Kirova said in an interview. “They can meet each other without the necessity of coming from a very defined place with a very defined requirement.” According to the company, the majority of Feeld users are between the ages of 26 and 32, and they cluster in major cities: New York, London, São Paulo, Los Angeles and Paris. About 35 percent are on the app with a partner, and 45 percent identify as something other than heterosexual. (Gender options include nonbinary, intersex and two-spirit, as well as gender-nonconforming, genderqueer and gender-questioning.) Feeld facilitates types of sexual attachment that are not exactly novel, but are often described in novel terms. (See “thrupple,” a term sometimes used to describe a romantic partnership for three people.) And it’s certainly popular, or at least, of growing interest to many. The company did not provide the most up-to-date download information (in 2016, it reported 1.5 million downloads), but says there are currently 12,000 connections made on Feeld and an average of 100,000 messages sent on a daily basis. It’s not just the vocabulary of sex and sexuality that has evolved. The rhetoric of relationships has become increasingly about labor (a lasting romance takes work), and the rhetoric of labor has become about relationships (each company is a family). Consequently, start-up origin stories are often expressed as love stories — the result of passion and ambition, open communication and ready collaboration. For Mr. Trifonov and Ms. Kirova, who began dating six years ago, those semantics are true in every sense. They made Feeld as much for their users as for themselves. Mr. Trifonov said that they had been together for two years when Ms. Kirova revealed she also had feelings for a woman. “She felt really bad about it, like she was doing something wrong,” he said. The two met in London, though they were both raised in Bulgaria, an environment Ms. Kirova described as rigid. “If you’re not straight, you’re not normal,” she said. Ms. Kirova considered herself and Mr. Trifonov to be open-minded — “artistic” is how she put it — but it took her a long time to question her own straightness. “That moment when things started shaking and changing, I was like, I’m losing my identity,” she said. Mr. Trifonov and Ms. Kirova wanted to stay together while also giving Ms. Kirova space to try other relationships, but they didn’t like the options available to them. (They decided to search as a couple.) They felt unfairly judged by the label “swingers,” and recall users on other dating apps reaching out to say they shouldn’t be in spaces intended for single people. Thus, Feeld was born. The company struggled to find funding at first: Mr. Trifonov said many prospective investors considered the app “adult entertainment,” which venture capitalists tend to avoid for reasons as legal as they are moral. (On that, Mr. Trifonov said: “How come you can’t differentiate pornography from sexuality? These are two different things.”) Apps like Tinder and Bumble don’t advertise their utility when it comes to polyamorous exploration, but they can be used to the same end. (OkCupid recently added a feature that allows couples to link their accounts in their pursuit of a third.) Eventually an angel investor swooped in to save Feeld, but the fact that the business is sex-related has presented other challenges. An attempt to build a Feeld integration for Slack, which would allow co-workers to anonymously confess their office crushes, was, unsurprisingly, shut down — a human resources complaint waiting to happen (the company told Mr. Trifonov it was a violation of their developer policy). The money transfer app TransferWise temporarily blocked Feeld’s ability to collect money for paid memberships (which offer more privacy) because Feeld was considered “adult content.” Mr. Trifonov also claims he was refused an office rental because the landlord didn’t approve of the nature of their business. Now, the company is up and running more or less smoothly, with some 20 people employed. In the tradition of small businesses everywhere, all workers do multiple tasks, and titles are given more for the benefit of people outside than those within it. (The company also runs an event series on nonmonogamy and put out a magazine.) Ms. Kirova describes herself as being responsible for general product leadership, long-term conceptual ideas, as well as much of the hiring and personnel decisions. Mr. Trifonov, the founder and head of the operation, believes she’s just being modest: “She’s like the unicorn of the company,” he said. If they had stayed simply a threesome app, Mr. Trifonov believes it would have died as a threesome app. “When I started Feeld I thought — like every other founder, I guess — this company isn’t going to be like other companies,” he said. I asked if he thought that there was some overlap between the two expectations: that social mores, from business to the bedroom, are better overthrown than followed. “I guess they overlap somehow, don’t they?” he replied. “When you have the mind-set of questioning things, it applies everywhere. We questioned our relationship. We questioned the way the business will work.”",The New York Times
2019,A Dating Show Made for the Age of Apps,"Screenland Watching the Netflix show “Dating Around” is like sitting next to a Tinder date at a bar: The possibility that something outrageous, sexy or at least interesting will happen holds your attention long after it has become clear that the people you’re spying on are just as boring as you are. The series is part of a naturalistic downshift in reality TV; it features neither overt competition nor narrative arc. It simply follows a person going on five blind dates over the course of a week, and then choosing one person to go out with again. The five dates must know they’re being judged against one another, but the show avoids acknowledging this, and the dater’s deliberations are never shown. To the extent that anyone on the show is looking for love, they’re doing so casually, nonaggressively, realistically. They’re merely game — not playing one. First dates are inherently dramatic, even when they’re dull. The atmospheric nerves — choosing an outfit, worrying you’ve said something dumb — easily create enough tension to carry a 30-minute television show. What’s most revealing about “Dating Around,” though, is the way it’s structured. The lead dater wears the same outfit and eats five different meals at the same restaurant. This allows the five dates to be edited into one four-dimensional hyperdate. Rather than showing each date in succession, episodes are organized into three segments — drinks, followed by dinner, then “after hours,” during which daters may respectfully part ways or head onward to a bar — with all the dates interwoven so they all appear to have happened in a single evening. It’s as if Ashley has body-swapped with Kate on her bathroom break, over and over and over again. All dating shows are contrived, but the contrivances on “Dating Around” are not preposterous, designed to shock or entertain — in fact, they’re depressingly familiar. A minute-long sequence in the first episode epitomizes the show’s attitude toward romance. After dinner at a Thai restaurant in Brooklyn, Luke, a motorcycle-riding real estate agent, asks Victoria, the clear front-runner among his five options, if she wants to get out of there. The scene cuts to B-roll footage of the New York City streets, and then emerging from the restaurant are our couple — Luke and now Betty, a divorced 30-year-old wearing a very short dress. Betty points at the sky as though it’s a dish she just whipped up with whatever she had in the fridge. “Look at that,” she says. Luke stops and complies. “Oh, wow,” he says, the opposite of awe-struck, his pose a lazy Vanna White, forearm raised to present to her what she’s already presented to him. “Full moon. Yeah.” He moves back to where she’s standing so they may look up at it together. “That’s beautiful,” he says. “So beautiful,” she agrees. Cut to a shot of the moon, looking like the moon. Now we hear Luke’s voice, slightly more upbeat — “This is a nice night!” — as a squeakier woman’s voice asks, “Do you see the full moon?” This voice belongs to Tiffany, a third option. They’re standing in front of the same Thai restaurant. Soon they’re making out — her initiative — and as they walk away from the restaurant holding hands, Luke expresses gratitude for the full moon. Cut back to Luke and Betty, who is calling for a “sexy dance” on the same stretch of sidewalk where he was just — or would soon be? — necking with another girl. The trick of the editing is not to highlight differences among the daters but to suggest that on some level they’re interchangeable. No script is necessary because they rarely deviate from how things are supposed to go. Tepid small talk about drink selection — “What is this?” “Like, a margarita” — moves on to “Where are you from?” followed by a pause for menu consideration, then onto job talk and canned flattery like “How are you single?” The blind dates eventually converge on what feel like serious topics, though the same ones come up almost every night of the week: past relationships, kids, priorities. “I just want love,” Betty says. “Connection, chemistry, love.” A minute later, Tiffany explains the importance of the “three C’s”: “compatibility, chemistry and connection.” The vocabulary — abstract nouns that fail to conjure the grand concepts they’re supposed to — recalls nothing so much as dating-app marketing, while the show’s carousel-like form reproduces the experience of using Tinder and the rest. Not only do the daters skew toward the kinds of people you commonly see on the apps — youngish, professional, fluent with an iPhone — but they’re also eager to filter their options with getting-to-know-you questionnaire material, the sort of information that you want to find out at some point but that wouldn’t necessarily come up were you to meet by chance, say, at a friend’s party. The impulse to control or strategize romance isn’t new — red flags and deal-breakers, and the analysis they inspire, abound in 1990s romantic comedies, and courtship rituals predate humanity entirely. What seems uniquely contemporary about “Dating Around” is the rote, bored way people enact these norms, as if they have no choice — or rather because they have so much of it. Regard the moon: It’s in a lot of poems. Its repeat cameo here is a way to signify romance, even where no romance was present; whether its appearance was noticed naturally by the daters or pointed out by the producers, it functions as a symbol of a symbol, inspiring the young not-lovers to go through the motions. The importance of compatibility reinforces the sense that love can be found through a formula or a checklist; the idea is as seductive as anyone on this show. When, during an “after hours” conversation, one contestant uses the word “swipe” to refer to dating itself, without having to explain the word’s provenance, she reveals that dating has become so process-oriented that it’s practically indistinguishable from the mechanisms that were meant to streamline it. Though dating apps may improve many aspects of modern romance — by making people safer and more accessible — their guardrails also seem to limit the possibilities for it. The stakeslessness of “Dating Around” might be a refreshing lack of pressure, but it might also reflect the disturbing effects of the same phenomenon in real life. Despite what tech companies would have us believe, people cannot be optimized for one another; an overwhelming abundance of options discourages the leaps of faith that can transform the terrible uncertainty of dating into something great. Nothing is especially wrong with this arrangement, but is anything right? The second episode, featuring a divorced 36-year-old woman, ends with a shot of her walking in SoHo, arms laden with shopping bags, fine with it all, catching the eyes of strangers who pass: She hasn’t called any of her dates back, but maybe one of the next five will work out. Like keeping up with a decent TV show, it’s at least something to do.",The New York Times
2019,A Dead Baby Was Found in a Ditch in 1981. DNA Helped Charge the Mother With Murder.,"On a winter day in 1981, the body of a newborn baby was found abandoned in a ditch near a cornfield in Sioux Falls, S.D. He had been wrapped in a blanket. Tears were frozen on his cheeks. After no one reported him missing, residents in Sioux Falls named him Andrew John Doe. He was eventually laid to rest in a local cemetery, where he remained unidentified, but not forgotten, for nearly four decades, a court document said. Now the authorities believe they have solved the case. On Friday, the Sioux Falls Police Department said that investigators had finally tracked down the baby’s mother, a 57-year-old woman in Sioux Falls named Theresa R. Bentaas, using DNA testing and genealogy databases. She was arrested that day and faces murder charges, the department announced at a news conference. Chief Matt Burns said the arrest was the outcome of years of persistence. Even as tips went nowhere and lines of investigation went thin, he said, detectives pressed on “in the hope of generating a lead, stirring a memory or burdening a conscience to confess.” The turning point in the case, which highlights how DNA technology is increasingly being used to solve old homicides, came in 2009, Chief Burns said. That was when Michael Webb, a detective at the department, took the lead in pursuing the investigation using technology and databases that were not available to his predecessors. [Why the arrest of a Golden State Killer suspect set off alarms among some scientists and ethicists.] The case was “cold,” Detective Webb said at the news conference, but it was never “closed.” “We don’t forget about these cases — we never do,” he said. “You work pretty hard when it is a child case.” Ms. Bentaas is being held on murder and manslaughter charges, but the final charges will be determined by a grand jury or in a preliminary hearing on March 26, Crystal Johnson, a prosecutor working on the case, said in an interview on Tuesday. Ms. Bentaas is being held in Minnehaha County Jail with bail set at $250,000, according to records from the county sheriff’s office. She had an initial appearance in front of a judge on Monday, Ms. Johnson said. Raleigh Hansman, a lawyer for Ms. Bentaas, declined to comment on Tuesday, and calls to Ms. Bentaas’s family members were not answered. Advances in DNA technology and genealogy databases have recently helped the authorities find suspects in a number of old murder cases, including the search for the Golden State Killer in California. Some of these cases, like the Sioux Falls one, have involved the identification of mysterious remains, Detective Webb said. “These cases are frustrating and disappointing,” he said. “You are going to learn you have more failures than successes. We persisted on.” The story of the Doe baby started on Feb. 28, 1981, when Lee Litz, a Sioux Falls man, was test-driving a car and spotted a pile of “wine-colored” blankets near the road, he said in a recent interview with The Argus Leader, a Sioux Falls newspaper. He stopped to examine the blankets out of curiosity because they looked new, he said. Wrapped up in the bundle was the dead baby. The placenta was still attached. Clothing with traces of blood was found nearby, the arrest affidavit for Ms. Bentaas said. “I just wish I could have found him earlier when he was still alive,” Mr. Litz said. An autopsy said the baby had been born alive, most likely on Feb. 27, and had probably died of exposure, according to the affidavit. Detectives could not locate the mother or family members of the infant, and the case went cold. The baby was buried in St. Michael Catholic Cemetery, with about 50 residents paying respects at the graveside, the affidavit said. When Detective Webb picked up the case in 2009, he obtained a court order to exhume the body for DNA testing, and the remains were transported to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, where a DNA profile was obtained, the affidavit said. The baby’s remains were reburied on June 16, 2010, it said. The DNA was sent to Parabon NanoLabs, which worked with law enforcement agencies to help identify possible suspects and relatives. The findings helped investigators unspool members of a family tree, helped by GEDMatch.com, Ancestry.com and findagrave.com, according to Detective Webb and the affidavit. The findings eventually led the authorities to a residence in Sioux Falls where Ms. Bentaas was living, the affidavit said. They went through the trash. A package wrapper in the trash was addressed to her. A water bottle, cigarette butts and a beer can had female DNA on them that “could not be excluded” from a profile of the baby’s biological mother, according to the affidavit. The father of the baby was not aware of the pregnancy and has not been charged, the affidavit said. Ms. Bentaas spoke to investigators on Feb. 27 of this year, the anniversary of the day the baby is believed to have been born. She said that in 1981 she was “young and stupid,” the affidavit said. She said she hid her pregnancy from family and friends, gave birth alone in her apartment, and then drove the baby, who was in the passenger seat, to the place by the road where he was later found, it said. She was “sad” and “scared” as she drove away, the affidavit quoted her as saying. Asked if she thought about it when she drove by the spot now, she said, “Of course.”",The New York Times
2019,A Deadly Blaze in the Alps Made a Biker a Hero and Tunnels Safer for All,"Wheels Two decades ago, 39 people died inside the Mont Blanc Tunnel in a fire so horrific it changed safety standards forever. The truth eventually caught up to the legend of a man who rushed in. The Italian side of the Mont Blanc Tunnel. While the legend of the biker was exaggerated, the horror of the fire there 20 years ago — and its impact on tunnel safety — cannot be overstated.CreditCreditSamuel Zeller for The New York Times Twenty years ago Sunday, a fire deep inside an Alpine tunnel killed 39 people and turned a motorcycle-riding security guard who worked there into a hero. In the chaos just after the blaze, local French and Italian newspapers reported that the biker had raced in and out of the burning tunnel, saving as many as 10 people before dying in one last rescue attempt. It was some time before investigators released a final, accurate account of the disaster at the Mont Blanc Tunnel: The biker, who was known by his nickname, Spadino, an Italian riff on his skinny frame, had not saved anyone. But he died trying to do so, and local bikers still gather at the tunnel mouth once a year to honor him. While the legend was exaggerated, the horror of the fire — and its impact on tunnel safety — cannot be overstated. The lessons of the tragedy have guided tunnel design and engineering ever since, including recent American projects like the Port of Miami Tunnel and Seattle’s new S.R. 99 Tunnel. The Mont Blanc Tunnel opened to traffic in 1965. When built, it was the world’s longest road tunnel, linking the French and Italian highway systems and shortening truck routes between Italy’s industrial north and other parts of Europe. It had been open nearly 35 years without a single fatal incident until the morning of March 24, 1999. [Read the original Times coverage of the 1999 fire at the Mont Blanc Tunnel.] Around 11 a.m., a Volvo FH12 tractor-trailer, registered in Belgium, stopped to pay the toll. It was an ordinary truck with ordinary cargo: nine tons of margarine and 12 tons of flour. To this day, no one can say with certainty why the rig caught fire. The driver, who had been alerted to a problem by oncoming vehicles, stopped almost in the middle of the 7.2-mile tunnel. When he climbed out of the cab, flames burst from under the truck, and he leapt back. Witnesses reported that the fire had very quickly become too intense to drive past. Spadino — Pierlucio Tinazzi, who got his nickname, Italian for a thin, light sword, when he was young — was just outside the French portal on his motorcycle. It’s not clear whether he suspected trouble or thought he was making a routine trip back to the Italian portal. Regardless, he followed a few other heavy trucks in. Mr. Tinazzi was most likely the first tunnel employee to realize the Belgian truck was trailing smoke. The last few drivers who made it into France said the motorcyclist had appeared to be trying to catch up to the burning truck. He never quite got there. Near the fire, he came upon Maurice Lebras, a French truck driver who was unconscious. In his last radio communication with the control room, Mr. Tinazzi said he had dragged the trucker into a fire refuge off the main tunnel. He closed the fire door and waited. The refuge had a fire door rated to a “four-hour” standard. The fire burned for 50 hours. A few minutes after Mr. Tinazzi rode in, two trucks from the Chamonix Fire Department arrived carrying 14 firefighters. They plunged into thick, toxic smoke. Moments later, the fire melted the wiring for the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness. Their trucks stuck now, the firefighters retreated into two refuges. In the tunnel, the margarine had melted and then turned into a highly flammable vapor. A strong breeze created a blast-furnace effect, igniting the fuel in other abandoned vehicles. Temperatures reached 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. Five hours later and with no time to spare, a rescue crew reached the firemen via a ventilation duct. All of them survived but their commanding officer, who died in a hospital. It was a week before the tunnel cooled enough for forensic investigators to recover bodies. Most of the victims had almost certainly suffocated before they burned. That was a small mercy. The blaze was traumatic for the close-knit Alpine communities of the French Haute-Savoie region and Val d’Aosta in Italy. Compounding the emotional toll, a lengthy renovation closed the tunnel and hurt tourist traffic. The region needed a hero, and soon after the fire, the government of Italy honored Mr. Tinazzi with a gold medal for civilian bravery. The International Motorcycle Federation, the world governing body of motorcycle sport, presented its highest award to his family. Its citation, like those early newspaper reports, credited Mr. Tinazzi with saving several people, even though the legend of the biker-hero “had been woven by the Italian media before anyone knew exactly what had really happened,” said Antoine Chandellier, a French journalist who has reported on the region for decades. The magnitude of death and destruction reverberated widely. It so shocked civil engineers who specialize in tunnel construction that many remember where they were when they learned the news. William Connell, a tunnel systems engineer, was working on the enormous tunnel project known as the Big Dig in Boston at the time of the fire. “Initially, there was a lot of conjecture, and uneasiness, about how a fire of that size could become so deadly and produce so much damage,” Mr. Connell said. Before Mont Blanc, tunnel engineers were divided on the benefit of sprinkler systems. Concerns included impaired visibility for motorists as well as reliability and maintenance costs. Only five United States road tunnels had been equipped with sprinklers. “When the full report on the Mont Blanc fire finally came out, it was evident that additional measures of fire protection and emergency response planning would have reduced the significance of the fire,” Mr. Connell recalled. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association publishes a document with a dry title but life-or-death consequences: “NFPA 502: Standard for Road Tunnels, Bridges and Other Limited Access Highways.” Mr. Connell served as chairman of the association’s technical committee on tunnel safety from 2005 until 2015. After the Mont Blanc report highlighted the French and Italian operators’ lack of preparedness, the committee made formal emergency response plans and regular training exercises part of the standard. Recognizing that road tunnels were more common in Europe, Asia and Australia, he recruited international expertise to the committee. The association writes standards, not laws; it’s up to the local authorities to adopt them. When the Florida Department of Transportation decided to construct its first major road tunnel in 2010, the association’s 502 standard was incorporated into the Florida Fire Prevention Code. Chris Hodgkins is the chief executive of Miami Tunnel, the company that built and operates the three-quarter-mile tunnel connecting the Port of Miami with the Interstate highway system. The tunnel diverts traffic that used to crawl through downtown. “We learned from Mont Blanc that people don’t die from the fire — they die from the fumes and smoke,” Mr. Hodgkins said. “We have 44 jet fans that can operate in either direction, so we can suck air away from the fire, so toxins don’t affect people in the tunnel.” The Miami tunnel is a “twin-bore” tunnel, with a separate passageway for traffic in each direction. It has cross-passages every 450 feet so that, in a fire, people can escape through the other tunnel. In Seattle, the recently opened S.R. 99 Tunnel carries two stacked roadbeds, in an immense single-bore tunnel under downtown, running for nearly two miles. It includes heat detectors that can locate a fire to within 10 feet, and, as in Miami, a deluge system can dump several tropical rainstorms’ worth of water into a fire zone, while leaving the rest of the tunnel dry. Brian Russell, the civil engineer who served as project manager on the S.R. 99 Tunnel, said the boring machine was 57½ feet in diameter, providing room for spaces for safety systems in addition to the roadways. “People think of tunnels as a hole through the ground,” he said, “but that’s not the case anymore. I tell people, ‘This is like a building for cars.’” The Seattle tunnel includes refuges every 650 feet, which open into a passage with its own fresh air supply — a tunnel within the tunnel — for escape. The Mont Blanc Tunnel finally reopened in 2002. A French engineer, Jean-Marc Berthier, led development of a unified safety protocol for the Franco-Italian venture, and served as the tunnel’s administrator for the next few years. Since then, Mr. Berthier has become a global evangelist for tunnel fire safety. “In 2016, we had Jean-Marc perform a safety review of the Port of Miami Tunnel,” Mr. Hodgkins recalls. “At one point, I mentioned that we’d never had a fire, and he banged his hand on the table and said, ‘Yet!’” Sure enough, in December 2017, a car erupted into flames in the tunnel. The driver escaped unhurt; the deluge system kept the fire under control until a Miami-Dade fire crew arrived. The jet fans kept the tunnel air clear while it was evacuated. There were no casualties. In less than two hours, the tunnel was reopened to traffic.",The New York Times
2019,A Debut Novel Probes the Difficult Lives of Arab-American Women,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A WOMAN IS NO MAN By Etaf Rum In a hushed bedroom, a woman smears foundation over the bruises on her daughter-in-law’s face, layer after silencing layer. “There are things in this life no one should see,” she tells the young woman her son has beaten. “When I was your age, I never let anyone see my shame.” Etaf Rum’s debut novel is a dauntless exploration of the pathology of silence, an attempt to unsnarl the dark knot of history, culture, fear and trauma that can render conservative Arab-American women so visibly invisible. “Where I come from,” her narrator begins, “we keep these stories to ourselves. To tell them to the outside world is unheard-of, dangerous, the ultimate shame. But you have seen us.” From a refugee camp near Ramallah to a Brooklyn rowhouse, “A Woman Is No Man” follows three generations of Palestinian women as they confront the claustrophobic expectations that continue to shape their lives. In the spring of 1990, Isra Hadid accepts a marriage proposal that will take her to America, her heart full of fairy-tale hopes. Eighteen years later, her eldest daughter, Deya Ra’ad, longs for college but reluctantly considers potential husbands at the urging of her grandmother Fareeda. When an anonymous note lures Deya to a Manhattan bookshop, the story she knows about her family is violently rewritten. The daughter of Palestinian immigrants, born and raised in Brooklyn, Rum is keenly aware of the risks of exposing her community to the scrutiny of narrative. It’s a devil’s bargain: Speak and add inadvertent fuel to the ever-smoldering fire of anti-Arabism — or don’t speak and add another layer of silence. “I knew that as long as I stayed away from controversial topics like arranged marriages and domestic abuse, no one would criticize me or call me a traitor. No one would shun me. No one would try to hurt me,” Rum has explained. “Perhaps these fears are why there aren’t many Arab-American women on bookshelves; why, whenever I search for our stories in bookstores and libraries, I cannot find them.” There’s a burden that comes with being among the first of your kind; the potential for misinterpretation is too great to leave much to chance. What emerges is a story as didactic as it is brave. “A Woman Is No Man” is both a love letter to storytelling and a careful object lesson in its power. Timorous Isra’s heroine is Scheherazade, the bewitching taleteller of “The Thousand and One Nights.” “No one asks Scheherazade to marry the king,” she marvels. “She volunteers on behalf of all women to save the daughters of Muslims everywhere. For 1,001 nights, Scheherazade’s stories were resistance. Her voice was a weapon.” Of Rum’s three women, it is implacable Fareeda — enforcer of norms, keeper of secrets — whose voice proves the most revelatory. Her marriage at 14 to a stranger in the dust of the al-Am’ari refugee camp has “made a warrior out of her,” yet she fights to uphold a system where “the shame of her gender was engraved on her bones.” It’s a startling portrait of the mechanics of complicity, of the intergenerational pathology of silence. “It took more than one woman to do things differently,” Fareeda reflects, wearily. “It took a world of them.” Across the globe, a bold new generation of Arab women are putting that defeatism to the test by sharing their stories. The triumph of Rum’s novel is that she refuses to measure her women against anything but their own hearts and histories. “It’s hard to belong anywhere, truly belong, if we don’t belong to ourselves first,” Deya is told. Distinctly, defiantly and earnestly, “A Woman Is No Man” belongs to itself.",The New York Times
2019,A Deep Talent Pool Should Keep the Dodgers Afloat,"2019 National League Preview Los Angeles has a strong chance to become the first team since the 1923 Yankees to lose two World Series in a row and return for a third try. The final out of the last World Series exemplified the Los Angeles Dodgers’ resourcefulness and torment. The year before, they had lost the World Series to the Houston Astros when their star shortstop, Corey Seager, grounded out to end Game 7. Last fall, long after Seager had been lost for the season to injury, his replacement, Manny Machado, struck out to clinch the title for the Boston Red Sox. The Dodgers simply excel at talent acquisition, loading their roster with more solid players — and the occasional superstar — than any other team in the majors. Yet they’ve suffered the indignity of losing the last two World Series on their home field. Those defeats may obscure just how good the Dodgers really are. They have a strong chance to become the first team since the 1923 Yankees to lose two World Series in a row and return for a third try. “Last year was probably the most talented team I’ve ever been around, but it didn’t necessarily perform like that on a nightly basis,” said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ president for baseball operations. “We led the N.L. in runs scored, we led the N.L. in fewest runs allowed, but it was just kind of the choppiness of it. For us, a lot of it is how to be as consistent as we can be, bring our talent to the forefront as many nights as we possibly can.” [M.L.B. Season Preview: Stuffed to Its Seams] Talent was everywhere on the roster last season, and this one should be no different. By Baseball Prospectus’s calculations, the Dodgers had 18 players with at least two wins above replacement for them last season. No other team had more than 13 such players, and the average team had seven. That depth allows Manager Dave Roberts to aggressively exploit matchup advantages on offense, and to use his starting pitchers with extreme caution. The Dodgers are the only team that has not used a pitcher for 180 innings in any of the last three seasons. They will be tempted this season to unleash Walker Buehler, who sparkled last fall in a one-game playoff with Colorado for the National League West title; in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series clincher in Milwaukee; and in the Dodgers’ only victory in the World Series, when he shut out the Red Sox for seven innings. Buehler, 24, is not the only young homegrown starter who could make a major impact this season. The left-hander Julio Urias, 22, showed in October that he was past the shoulder trouble that cost him nearly two seasons. “There’s really no pitch limit for Walker, but we’re going to see how his body’s reacting, how he feels and have that open line of communication,” Roberts said. “With Julio, it’s been abbreviated for him the last couple of years, so to say he has a clear runway I don’t think is fair to him. But I do know that he’s going to impact us this year.” Buehler and the veteran Clayton Kershaw have taken it slowly in spring training, but with the Dodgers, it is hard to tell the difference between hurt and injured. They play the long game in Los Angeles, where arriving at full strength in October is all that matters. The Dodgers lost a few contributors from last year’s team, but added center fielder A.J. Pollock, who was a force for Arizona when healthy; reliever Joe Kelly, whom they plan to use in an expanded setup role that could stretch him to 90 innings; and the grizzled catcher Russell Martin, who had a .338 on-base percentage for Toronto last year. Martin’s .194 batting average did not bother the Dodgers, Friedman said, because he consistently made hard contact. Martin, 36, has played in five league championship series without ever advancing to the World Series. This could be the year he gets there — and, with any luck, he just might leap into the arms of closer Kenley Jansen after the final out. Then again, the Colorado Rockies are conceding nothing in pursuit of their first division title. They signed Daniel Murphy to play first base and gave third baseman Nolan Arenado an eight-year, $260 million contract extension last month. The entire team surprised Arenado by attending the news conference announcing the deal. “I love playing with this group,” said Arenado, who fought back tears for a moment. “I really believe we can win. I wouldn’t make this decision if I didn’t believe that.” The Rockies’ pitching carried them last season, setting club records for most strikeouts, lowest WHIP (walks-plus-hits per inning pitched) and fewest hits allowed in a nonstrike season. Kyle Freeland and German Marquez were rotation stalwarts, and Scott Oberg and Wade Davis (who allowed one run in the regular season after Aug. 9) stabilized a bullpen that will count on a full season from Seunghwan Oh to offset the loss of Adam Ottavino to the Yankees. While Colorado kept its cornerstone, the Arizona Diamondbacks shed theirs, trading first baseman Paul Goldschmidt to St. Louis. They have not done much to replace the production of Goldschmidt and Pollock, but with Zack Greinke, Robbie Ray, Zack Godley and Luke Weaver in the rotation, they expect to compete. “We’re trying to make a shift here,” Manager Torey Lovullo said. “We’re going to rely on the pitching and defense and we’re going to make up for some offensive losses in other ways.” Reverse-engineer the Diamondbacks and you’d get the San Diego Padres, who added a middle-of-the-order slugger with infielder Manny Machado but have a painfully inexperienced rotation led by Joey Lucchesi. The Padres will soon let loose a flood of prospects, so it is hard to predict how close they really are to contending. But starter Chris Paddack and shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. offered tantalizing spring training glimpses of the kind of young, cheap talent that enabled the Padres to afford a 10-year, $300 million contract for Machado. [A.L. Preview: How Hard Will It Be for the Red Sox to Repeat? Ask the Astros] “You need to have quality young players that are making major-league minimums, or prearbitration salaries, to enable you to go out and sign some bigger-dollar players, especially in our market, where it’s not unlimited funds,” General Manager A.J. Preller said. “We feel that we’ve built up the talent base to enable us to get into conversations for Machado and some of the big-name free agents.” Speaking of Machado, Preller added: “You see it in the energy here at the complex. It raises the level of competition for everybody.” Will it raise the Padres’ place in the standings? They should at least move past the San Francisco Giants, who did not improve an offense that ranked 29th of 30 teams in runs last season, ahead of only Miami. This will be the final season for Giants Manager Bruce Bochy, who is 74 victories shy of 2,000 in his career. He will need a lot of luck to get there. Every N.L. Central team expects to contend, which makes this the most intriguing division in the majors. The Milwaukee Brewers won it last season — in a one-game playoff over the Chicago Cubs — before their joy ride ended in that Game 7 loss to the Dodgers in the N.L.C.S. They know they might have missed their best chance to bring the World Series to Miller Park. “It’s so difficult to put yourself in that position ever again,” outfielder Ryan Braun said. “We could have a much better team, a much better regular season, but things have to go right to get to a place where you have a Game 7 to get to the World Series — at home, with the pitcher we want on the mound, after we had just won Game 6 and felt great about our chances. I’m grateful for the opportunity, but it’s not an easy thing to get over.” The Brewers hope to get over it by finding an ace or two from a group of rookies who pitched mostly in relief in October: Corbin Burnes, Freddy Peralta and Brandon Woodruff. They will again lean heavily on a strong bullpen and slugging lineup that includes the Most Valuable Player Award winner, Christian Yelich, and a new catcher, Yasmani Grandal, who hit 24 home runs with an .815 on-base plus slugging percentage for the Dodgers last season. The Dodgers benched Grandal for most of the postseason after he struggled on defense in Game 1 of the N.L.C.S. in Milwaukee. That diminished Grandal’s value but gave the Brewers an opportunity: a one-year, $18.25 million contract that could be a steal. “Look, guys go into defensive slumps,” General Manager David Stearns said. “We focused on the entirety of what we think he can contribute to our team, and we think it’s meaningful: He’s a very good receiver, he’s a good framer, he handles a pitching staff well, and he can control the running game.” The St. Louis Cardinals went 41-28 last season for Manager Mike Shildt, who replaced the fired Mike Matheny in mid-July. It wasn’t quite enough to lift them to the playoffs, but they should return this year after a three-year absence — an interminable gap for their regal brand. “It’s a long time, I know,” said John Mozeliak, the president for baseball operations. “We’re very aware of it.” In Goldschmidt, Marcell Ozuna and Matt Carpenter, the Cardinals have three elite run producers to go with slick defenders like center fielder Harrison Bader, second baseman Kolten Wong and catcher Yadier Molina, who is 36 and just won his ninth Gold Glove. Jack Flaherty could be a breakout rotation star, and Jordan Hicks — who threw 41 pitches last season that hit 103 miles per hour or higher — will form an imposing relief duo with the newcomer Andrew Miller. The Chicago Cubs finally solved Miller in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series in Cleveland, when they completed a comeback and won their first championship since 1908. They have not returned to the World Series, and last season’s wild-card flameout put the clubhouse on notice: Theo Epstein, the president for baseball operations, has vowed “sweeping changes” if he does not see improvement. Manager Joe Maddon is working in the final year of his contract, surrounded by new coaches but a roster that still includes more than half of the players who appeared for the Cubs in the World Series. The core deserves one more chance, and another title would be no surprise. But given the strength of the division, neither would third place. The Cincinnati Reds are the only team in the majors with at least 90 losses in each of the last four seasons. That streak should end now, because the Reds can finally pair their solid offense with a respectable rotation: Luis Castillo, Anthony DeSclafani, Sonny Gray, Tanner Roark and Alex Wood. If they were in the A.L. Central, the Reds might be the favorites. The N.L. version is much different. “I’ll tell you right now, this is the best division in baseball,” said Reds reliever Jared Hughes, who has also played for Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. “We’re always incredibly competitive from top to bottom. The goal is to win the division, to win the World Series, and the vibe coming in is that we’re capable of doing that. But there’s no complacency in the N.L. Central.” The Pittsburgh Pirates can also dream big because of five exceptional pitchers: starters Jameson Taillon, Chris Archer and Trevor Williams and relievers Felipe Vazquez and Keone Kela. But their middling offense got few upgrades, and right fielder Gregory Polanco will spend at least the first month recovering from shoulder surgery. Across Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Phillies were the clear winners of the off-season — a meaningless title, of course, but reason enough to consider them the East favorites, despite going 8-20 last September to spoil a promising season. “We had a lot of holes to fill, that was the conclusion,” said John Middleton, the Phillies’ managing partner. “When you look at the rubble of the last six weeks of the ’18 season, we weren’t a player away from being a good team. We were a bunch of players away.” General Manager Matt Klentak started by acquiring shortstop Jean Segura from Seattle as part of a deal for Carlos Santana, a masterstroke that allowed Rhys Hoskins to move back to first base from left field, where Andrew McCutchen now plays after signing as a free agent. Klentak also signed reliever David Robertson and traded for the game’s best catcher, J.T. Realmuto. It was a good winter — and then the Phillies signed Bryce Harper, the former Nationals star, for 13 years and $330 million. “To have him in this clubhouse is deflating for the teams in our division, so it’s a great feeling to be on this side,” starter Jake Arrieta said. “Not that the teams in our division are scared, by any means, I don’t think that’s the case. But we definitely appreciate the organization signing a guy like Harper and bringing in the pieces we have.” The Washington Nationals should still reach the playoffs, with Patrick Corbin joining Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg in an overpowering rotation. Their three best hitters — Anthony Rendon, Juan Soto and Trea Turner — have somehow never made an All-Star team, but that should change this summer. The reigning division champions, the prospect-rich Atlanta Braves, added third baseman Josh Donaldson and catcher Brian McCann but otherwise stood pat. That may prove to be wise in time, but for now it leaves them looking vulnerable as pitchers Mike Foltynewicz, A.J. Minter and Mike Soroka start the season on the injured list. Injuries also struck early for the Mets, who tried to build a deeper roster this winter but will open without infielders Jed Lowrie (knee) and Todd Frazier (oblique). Frazier is 33, Lowrie is 34, and second baseman Robinson Cano is 36. But the under-30 hitters look good, and with Jacob deGrom atop the rotation and Edwin Diaz as the closer, the Mets have a chance. “I truly believe that we can and will win,” said Brodie Van Wagenen, the new general manager. He has to say that, of course, and his moves have been encouraging — but probably not enough, given the persistent injury risks on the roster, to change the Mets’ spot in the standings. The Miami Marlins will be picked for last place in every reasonable forecast. The chief executive, Derek Jeter, got his wish and had the team’s mechanical home run sculpture moved to the outside of Marlins Park. The display was whimsical and fun, but it would not have been used much, anyway — no player on this threadbare roster hit more than 13 homers last season.",The New York Times
2019,"A Deep-End Albanian Experience, Tucked Into the Bronx","Restaurant Review 10 Photos View Slide Show › The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu, if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick’s, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin’s and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu’s collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana. The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that’s repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. (Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania’s Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak, which our server described as “like butter for bread” and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as “cream with polenta,” the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don’t expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant’s version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant’s qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania’s national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is — please rise and face Hughes Avenue — a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu’s several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you’d be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

2019,A Delicious Link to Oaxaca in South Los Angeles,"Critic’s Notebook The city’s food culture has been shaped for decades by immigrants from the southern Mexican state, including the team behind Poncho’s Tlayudas. LOS ANGELES — Each week, in a kitchen in South Los Angeles, Alfonso Martinez prepares about 400 pounds of moronga — a light, onion-flecked cloud of a sausage, already crimson from a base of fresh pig’s blood, pushed to a deeper, more exuberant shade by the addition of dried red chiles. The loops of sausage are sweet, delicate and uniformly soft, but where they’re scored and pressed against the grill, they turn crisp. Dabbed with smoky salsa, this moronga would be reason enough to visit Poncho’s Tlayudas, Mr. Martinez’s Friday-night pop-up behind the offices of the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations, a group run by his wife, Odilia Romero, that works for the rights of Indigenous people. Ms. Romero and Mr. Martinez (whose nickname is Poncho) immigrated from different regions of Oaxaca, a state in southern Mexico. There, the moronga was seasoned with fresh chiles and a tender variety of chive, and the sausage made use of every part of the pig. In Los Angeles, where Mr. Martinez has made the sausage for two years, he has adapted the recipe with dried chiles and fresh yerba buena plucked from fellow Angelenos’ yards. “It’s become like a Oaxacalifornia style of blood sausage,” Ms. Romero said. California has been shaped for decades by immigrants from Oaxaca, who number at least 150,000 in Los Angeles — the largest Oaxacan population outside Mexico. Many of them run small food businesses, like specialty markets, restaurants and food trucks. Along with immigrants from Mexico City, and the states of Jalisco, Sinaloa and Nayarit, Oaxacans define Mexican cuisine and culture here. And their cooking is essential, illuminating the sheer diversity of the city’s Mexican-American population and the variety of Indigenous peoples, languages and traditions that it represents. Many Oaxacan immigrants made their way north to find work and better living conditions in the early 1990s, just before the Mexican government’s devaluation of the peso threw that country into economic turmoil. When another couple, David Padilla and Maria Ramos, arrived in 1992, they turned to the craft that Ms. Ramos’s parents had taught her as a child: barbacoa. At first, they catered quinceañeras and weddings, but soon opened their own restaurant, Gish Bac, in Mid-City. Ms. Ramos, who still cooks in the open kitchen, turns out goat meat that is slick and almost sticky from a low, slow roast, served with its own rich, restorative juices. Fernando Lopez left his family behind when he made his made his way north in 1993, joining his sister Soledad Lopez. As she had done before him, Mr. Lopez drove from Los Angeles to Tijuana to pick up ingredients shipped to the border, then sold them door to door, catering to the small but flourishing Oaxacan communities in Culver City, Pico-Union and Marina del Rey. He took requests: Oaxacan tortillas known as tlayudas; lard; small-batch mezcal; dark chocolate; grasshoppers called chapulines. Guelaguetza, the restaurant founded by the Lopez family, will celebrate its 25th year in business in May. “My dad had to keep on bringing ingredients from Oaxaca because so many people living in Los Angeles knew exactly what these things were supposed to taste like,” said Bricia Lopez, one of Mr. Lopez’s four children, who now run the business together. “There’s just no way to recreate our bay leaves, our oregano, our avocado leaves, our chiles.” Bill Esparza, the author of the 2017 cookbook “L.A. Mexicano,” said Oaxacans’ dedication to their regional ingredients is fierce, and that establishing a flow of quality products from home was critical for their restaurants and food businesses to thrive in Los Angeles. While cooks from other regions may have compromised where they needed to, “Oaxacans would not open restaurants without their ingredients,” Mr. Esparza said. Newer restaurateurs, like Mr. Martinez, still import essentials. The fresh, flexible, sweet-scented tlayudas come from a group of Oaxacan artisans who shape each one to be huge and thin, as lightly crinkled and diaphanous as a summer dress, totally distinct from the fatter, palm-size corn tortillas you might encounter at a taqueria. Drizzled with golden dregs of homemade lard, spread with seasoned black beans, meaty quesillo and shredded cabbage, the tlayuda at Poncho’s is then folded in half so all the ingredients melt into one another. The cabbage steams gently. The outside toasts. And the tlayuda becomes a tlayuda. The dish is substantial, but not heavy; crisp, but not fragile. It is portable, but best enjoyed immediately, in place, surrounded by the warmth of chatter and grill smoke, at a communal table draped with floral oilcloth, just in front of the open kitchen. Mr. Martinez, 41, didn’t grow up eating tlayudas. But as a musician in a brass band, he traveled to the capital, Oaxaca City, and often demolished the snack after shows — trombone in one hand, tlayuda in the other. In Los Angeles, he put aside music and worked briefly in a Chinese restaurant, a cafeteria at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an Iranian restaurant. But two years ago, Mr. Martinez started to make the food he wanted to make — tlayudas and moronga — at home. His first customers were Zapotec, members of an Indigenous group living near him in South Los Angeles. In October, he and Miguel Mendez, a cook, set up the food stand at the downtown Sunday market, Smorgasburg. (There, in response to a crowd that is less familiar with Oaxacan food, and wary of the tlayuda’s unwieldy size, they have ordered smaller versions of the tortillas.) The blood sausage, also on sale at Smorgasburg, has become a fixture at Oaxacan events across the city — weekend religious celebrations, traditional brass-band performances — and, more recently, has played a vital role in the city’s day-to-day politics. Poncho’s Tlayudas nourished activists, many of them Indigenous people from Oaxaca, as they protested and prepared for hearings at City Hall leading up to the legalization of sidewalk vending late last year. Teachers on strike stopped in to refuel with tlayudas in January, after spending the day marching in front of city schools. “This is a space where people come to eat and to organize,” Ms. Romero said. An interpreter of English, Spanish and her native Zapotec, Ms. Romero, 47, has roots in Zoogocho, in the mountainous northern part of Oaxaca. The recipe for the moronga was passed down to Mr. Martinez from her parents. “Blood sausage is not Mesoamerican,” she said; pork arrived in Mexico with Spanish colonists. “But it mysteriously ended up in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, a four-hour drive from Oaxaca City, and now it’s part of a tradition.” It began with her great-grandfather and his brother, who learned to read in a region where most people weren’t able to go to school. “They must have had contact with Spanish people,” Ms. Romero said, because somehow, her great-grandfather learned to season, shape and poach fresh pig’s blood, transforming it into moronga. Her father received a lesson in the technique as a wedding present. If you ever need to survive on something, his grandfather told him, you can survive on this. When Ms. Romero’s father moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, he remembered his father’s words. He took up sausage-making when Ms. Romero’s mother suggested there could be a market for it. “My mom is a very determined woman.” Ms. Romero said. “In the 1980s, in Los Angeles, she went out to find pig’s blood. She got on a bus, and she carried it home.” Over the years, Ms. Romero’s family sustained itself, and a growing community, with this moronga. At Poncho’s Tlayudas, it’s not a precise replica of the original Oaxacan sausage, but maybe better: It’s the Oaxacalifornian version. Poncho’s Tlayudas Fridays from 5 p.m. to midnight, 4318 South Main Street, Los Angeles; Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Smorgasburg, 787 South Alameda Street, Los Angeles.

2019,A Designer Who Finds Inspiration at Her Mother’s Colorful Cottage,"Two by Design For the London-based Matilda Goad, a love of pastels and lushly printed wallpapers began at her family home in West Sussex. The London-based housewares designer and creative consultant Matilda Goad, 29, vividly remembers Christmas when she was 8 years old, in the family home in Sussex that has always been her lodestar. As her parents entertained downstairs, she rearranged the furniture in her bedroom, dragging the voile-draped cane bed and skirted kidney-shaped vanity across the room. One thing she couldn’t change, however, was the tiny-pink-rosebud wallpaper, which, reflecting her mother’s characteristic brio, was hung not merely on the walls but also on the ceiling. “I suspect I might not have been very pleased,” says Matilda’s mother, Emma Goad, 67, a former clothing designer who started out in the 1970s as an assistant to Ossie Clark. Still, it is hard to imagine that she wasn’t partly charmed by her daughter’s verve for celebrating tradition while giving it a tweak; after all, both women have singular aesthetics inextricably tied to Deerkeepers, the warm and eccentric early 18th-century brick-and-flint cottage where Emma has lived for 43 years and where Matilda continues to return for inspiration. Matilda, a member of the new generation of young product designers who also decorate spaces (she recently styled the 18th-century busts in the windows of Jamb, the Pimlico Road antiques shop, with Saint Lucia-style crowns and designed a pop-up British pub for the much-photographed Wiltshire wedding of the fashion designer Hannah Weiland and the brewing scion Arthur Guinness), introduced an eponymous line of unapologetically feminine housewares in 2016: scalloped raffia lampshades, gold-striped ceramic vases and ribbed beeswax candles in shades like lilac and pistachio. 7 Photos View Slide Show › While her oeuvre is playful and modern, the roots of her taste are evident. In the Notting Hill apartment she and her husband lived in until recently, there were red-lacquer cabinets, a cowhide rug and a large sofa upholstered in crimson corduroy — but there were also lace panels over the bedroom windows, a strawberry-print wallpaper in the bathroom and a set of vintage botanical prints. “Sometimes, my mom will say my colors are wacky, but we have a lot of fun together, and it’s great to have her as a sounding board,” Matilda says. The women share a preference for spaces that are comfortable and full of personality, eschewing anything too “smart.” The six-bedroom residence that is the font of their aesthetics was indeed once a deer keeper’s cottage, part of the capacious listed Georgian estate called Uppark, built in 1690 and owned for generations by Emma’s family. The novelist H. G. Wells, whose mother and father were employed at the house as a maid and a gardener, stayed for a time in the 1880s. In 1954, Emma’s father, Richard Meade-Fetherstonhaugh, donated the main house to the National Trust. The rest of the estate stayed in the family, however, and Emma inherited the cottage in 1976, when she got engaged to Matilda’s father, Geoffrey Wanklyn Goad, now a retired property broker. Deerkeepers sits in a dell along an especially idyllic stretch of English countryside, with woodlands on one side and the chalk hills of the South Downs on the other. The reclusive 18th- century Romantic painter J. M. W. Turner based some of his most haunting landscapes on the area. By the time Emma took possession of the house, the original thatched roof had been replaced with clay tile, but it was “quite dark and dingy and beamy,” she says. In a first round of renovation, she knocked down a wall to create an open fireplace of stone and blasted oak in the drawing room, which she painted pale lemon yellow and filled with sofas upholstered in a geometric print by David Hicks and white-painted rattan furniture. Over the years, she’s redone most of the rooms a handful of times, playing with embellishment and pattern (“At one point, it all became very chintzy and braided,” she says), but her penchant for French furniture, antique quilts and small-scale, pale-colored florals has never wavered. She recently redid the intimate, low-ceilinged dining room, which she says now looks “rather like a hatbox,” with a large oil painting of an English foxhound on leafy, hand-blocked wallpaper by Pierre Frey. In the master bedroom, however, the walls, curtain and coverlet have for 30 years borne the same rose-and-ribbon print by Warner, a purveyor to the British royal family. “If you repeat a fabric, it’s telling you something,” says Emma. “But you have to be confident, and you have to feel passionately about it.” As a child, Matilda would sit for hours at the long, wooden kitchen table, looping picot-edged rosettes or pressing flowers cut from the dahlia beds in her mother’s one-acre garden — with clipped yews and gracefully crumbling stone steps. Her style of collaborating with clients reflects those bucolic, craft-filled beginnings; instead of sticking to purely pedigreed sources, she scours antique fairs for the right trim or trinket, just as her mother used to, with Matilda in a stroller. Another fecund resource is her mother’s workroom at the back of the house, stacked with boxes of ribbons and folded scraps of fabric. “I’m always rooting around and pulling things out,” Matilda says. At the end of the day together, in the home they once shared, mother and daughter sit together on Hans Wegner wishbone chairs near the kitchen’s ivory Aga stove. There are backgammon games by the fire and long walks past the dew pond, where the deer come to drink at dusk. Walking through this landscape, virtually untouched for centuries, never fails to ignite a creative spark: “Last time I was here,” says Matilda, “I cut a ton of twigs to use in a shop window. There’s always something.”",The New York Times
2019,A Diabetes Home Test Can Be a Waste of Time and Money,"The New Health Care Routine glucose monitoring may be unnecessary for people with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. More than 30 million people in the United States have diabetes. The vast majority of them have Type 2 diabetes. Some of those are testing their blood sugar at home, but the best research is telling us that they don’t need to — that in fact it’s a waste of money. It’s not a small problem. The waste is running into the billions of dollars, and it’s costing all of us money through the health care system. For people with Type 1 diabetes, blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration is the standard of care. Patients need to check their blood sugar a number of times a day, then give themselves insulin to replace what would have been made in the pancreas. Treatment for Type 2 diabetes, however, doesn’t involve these critical calculations of insulin. It’s usually maintained with a pretty regular administration of the same drugs on a set schedule. Self-monitoring for blood glucose, therefore, may be unnecessary for those not on insulin. This has been tested in well-designed studies. The Monitor trial, published two years ago in JAMA Internal Medicine, was a pragmatic trial that took place in 15 primary care practices in North Carolina. Patients with Type 2 non-insulin-treated diabetes were randomly assigned to one of three groups. People in the first group were told to check their blood glucose once a day. People in the second were told to check their blood glucose once a day, and then were given tailored advice depending on the results from the meter. The third group was told not to check blood sugar at all. After one year (a pretty impressive length for a study like this), there were no differences in the hemoglobin A1C levels (the best way to monitor long-term blood glucose control) between the three groups. There were also no differences in the health-related quality of life measures for the patients. There were no differences in the number of times they experienced hypoglycemia, how much care they needed, and how many progressed to the need for insulin. In other words, there were no measurable differences in how patients fared, whether they checked blood sugar or not. This evidence, while the best to date, confirmed what previous work had shown. A 2012 Cochrane review assessed all the randomized controlled trials through 2011 that had investigated how testing for blood glucose at home improved outcomes. It included 12 trials involving more than 3,200 patients. By 12 months, the overall benefit to testing, with respect to lab values, was statistically insignificant. There were never any benefits with respect to patient satisfaction. Still, not everyone is on board. Critics of this most recent trial said it didn’t prove that blood glucose monitoring couldn’t help: It’s possible that with better training, or more attention to detail, there might be ways to make this work. The point of pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials like this, though, is to test how practices work in the real world. In these high-quality primary care practices, even with customized help in interpreting the measurements (which is more than most patients get), testing blood sugar didn’t make a difference. Choosing Wisely, an educational campaign aiming to reduce unnecessary medical tests and procedures, advises against routine home glucose monitoring for patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. It says there is no benefit, and that there are potential harms (a study has shown an association with increased anxiety and depression). This argument is supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Society of General Internal Medicine and the Endocrine Society. Of course, there are exceptions. When patients are acutely ill, or changing regimens, or finding that their blood sugar is not well controlled, testing may be appropriate. Such decisions should be made in consultation with a physician. But for most people with Type 2 diabetes not on insulin, testing is inappropriate most of the time. That message is not getting through. At the end of last year, another study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine that quantified the prevalence of glucose testing in adults. Researchers examined a database that contained data on more than 370,000 commercial health insurance and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who had Type 2 diabetes. Of the more than 23 percent of patients who were using testing strips, more than half were probably doing so in spite of widespread recommendations that they shouldn’t. They were using a median of two testing strips a day at a cost of more than $325 per year per patient. On another front, The New York Times has reported that “a surprisingly large number of people” who use insulin are using less because they can’t afford it, putting themselves in danger. With a health care system as complicated as ours, it’s hard to take money from one pot and shift it easily to another. Efficiency in each system is crucial. The fact that a necessary facet of diabetes care is increasingly out of reach — while unnecessary and potentially harmful care is easily overused — illustrates how much work still needs to be done.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Difficult Surname?,"letter A reader shares his experiences in pronunciation. To the Editor: Re “America, Say My Name,” by Viet Thanh Nguyen (Sunday Review, March 10): My grandfather arrived in the United States from Armenia in the 1890s, and we’re still teaching folks how to pronounce our surname. (It’s juh-RAH-yahn.) Ironically, immigrants read it and in most cases pronounce it correctly. Americans don’t seem to take time to actually read it and think that they can wing it.

2019,A Disheartening Blast of Winter Weather Across the Nation,"DENVER — The call went up across America: Mother Nature, please have mercy. A punishing winter that has already produced record snowfalls and crippling temperatures in many areas sent another wave of severe weather blasting across the country over the weekend. Fresh snow buried cars and snarled travel from Denver to St. Louis, and behind the snow came a mass of air so frigid that the National Weather Service declared a wide area of the north central United States to be entering another deep freeze. The intense cold was expected to spread into the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast through Monday, and to stretch into parts of the Deep South by midweek. Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with weathermodels.com, said much of the country should prepare for an “all-week cold snap.” On Sunday, the National Weather Service also warned of severe thunderstorms moving across the South and Southeast. Tornadoes were reported in at least three states, with severe damage and at least 23 fatalities reported in Alabama. The nation may not be unified about much at the moment, but there seemed to be general agreement about the start that March is getting off to. “I hate this,” said Abie Olivos, 78, a retired Navy barber in Denver, who spent Sunday morning shoveling his neighbor’s walkway for the fourth or fifth time this season. “I’m ready for spring, let’s put it that way,” he said as snow fell on his silver pompadour and leather jacket. “I’m ready to go fishing.” The snow fell mainly in a broad stripe through the middle of the country, with plunging temperatures in at least a dozen states — more than 30 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in some areas. As much as two feet of fresh snow fell in the Rocky Mountains, and the deep cold stretched as far south as Texas. [The New York metropolitan area braced on Sunday for its own encounter with the winter storm.] Mr. Maue said the frigid air had come from Western Canada, where pools of Arctic air had been stuck for weeks. The cold air mass made its way down the West Coast and then eastward over the spine of the Rocky Mountains to the nation’s midsection. Mr. Maue said he understood that many people were experiencing “spring fever angst,” but that they should remember, “it’s still winter.” The March mess follows a February full of record-breaking cold and snow in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and other states. Rapid City, S.D., recorded subzero temperatures on 20 of the month’s 28 days. The Twin Cities in Minnesota received 39 inches of snow, beating a normal February by more than two feet. As much as 26 feet fell in parts of the Sierra Nevada range in California, and people there started calling the month “Februburied.” On Sunday, Joe Skifter, 59, of Minneapolis, said that in some parts of the city, snow was piled so high that pedestrians were practically mountain-climbing to reach the sidewalk, while lethal-looking icicles hung precariously from the eaves of buildings. “It’s getting difficult to find any place to put the snow,” said Mr. Skifter, the general manager at Open Book, a nonprofit space for people interested in bookmaking and literature. Patti Tritschler, 57, who leads a commercial interior design firm, was among the air passengers arriving back in Chicago from warmer climes on Sunday, only to find the temperature there dropping again. “Honestly, we haven’t recovered since the polar vortex,” Ms. Tritschler said. “It’s just gone on and on and on.” Even skiers who were thrilled to see fresh powder struggled with the weather on Sunday. The storm dropped more than a foot of snow on Colorado’s ski resorts, setting off a stampede of skiers heading into the mountains from Denver. But avalanche dangers, snowy roads and the sheer volume of traffic stretched what is ordinarily a 90-minute drive to three hours or more. Michal Rosenoer, who on nonpowder days is the executive director of Emerge Colorado, a group that works to elect more Democratic women to public office, said the roads were already jammed when she left home at 5:30 a.m. to drive to the Copper Mountain ski resort. “It’s insane,” she said. “I’ve never seen it like this before.” An annual rite of springtime’s approach in Franklin County, Kan., is the local home and garden show. But when Susan Rader, 53, was driving to the show on Sunday, she said, she was nearly blinded by heaps of cascading snow when she happened to emerge from under a highway bridge just as a truck was passing overhead. The crowd at the garden show was much sparser than usual, Ms. Rader said, with area merchants shut down by the storm and no sign of the food trucks that would usually be on hand. The day before, she said, the skies over her corner of eastern Kansas were clear, and the mounds of earlier snow had mostly melted. “We got all this snow, and we’re right back where we started,” she said. “Digging out, putting ice melt down. Wet, muddy, cold. It’s coming in waves. We’re just tired of all the waves of cold. They just don’t stop.” Faced with having to slog through yet more of an already exhausting winter, some tried to wring a wry smile from the weather on social media. “Yay, more snow! Said no one EVER!” the Missouri State Highway Patrol posted on Twitter. In Wyoming, Minn., where it takes a lot of snow to faze people, the Police Department shared a “Wanted” poster for Mother Nature, faulting her “for a season of general nastiness.” The Nebraska State Patrol tried to take it as a test of character. “It’s snowing … Good,” the department wrote on Twitter. “Another chance to get stronger scooping it. Bitter cold? Good. It will make us tougher.” And in Dodge City, Kan., where heavy snow and subzero wind chills were forecast, the local National Weather Service office started an informal Twitter poll, asking whether the lengthy winter was welcome or annoying. The early responses weighed heavily against the snow.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Dose of Moderation Would Help Democrats,"They can appeal to moderate voters without betraying progressive values. Opinion Columnist The energy in the 2020 Democratic campaign has been coming from the left. Candidates are pushing Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, a wealth tax and other ideas that are more progressive than anything a recent Democratic nominee has favored. Much of this shift — which has been focused on economic policy — is smart. Republicans may cry socialism, and affluent centrists may not love it. But the American public leans decidedly left on economics. A clear majority favors higher taxes on the rich, a higher minimum wage and expanded government health insurance. After four decades of slow-growing living standards, people want change. And yet there are also risks in the Democrats’ move to the left — risks that the sillier criticisms of the party’s new progressivism sometimes obscure. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] So far, the 2020 candidates have mostly been competing with one another to see who can come off as the most boldly and purely liberal. Bernie Sanders talks about completing his revolution. Kamala Harris has spoken about the joy that marijuana brings. Sanders, Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand have all talked about eliminating private health insurance. And so on. Ideological purity doesn’t tend to play well in general elections, however. Every modern president has found ways to appeal to Americans’ fondness for consensus — even if that fondness is based partly on a naïve view of politics and even if the candidates’ appeals have sometimes been more stylistic than substantive. Donald Trump campaigned as a defender of Medicare and Social Security. Barack Obama became a national figure by reaching out to both red and blue America. George W. Bush was a “compassionate conservative.” Bill Clinton followed a “third way.” Ronald Reagan put a sunny face on his conservatism. As frustrated as many Americans have become, most still don’t see themselves as radicals. About 35 percent call themselves moderate, compared with only 26 percent who say liberal, according to Gallup. Another 35 percent say conservative. Even among Democrats, only about half use the liberal label, with other half choosing moderate or conservative. Perhaps most fascinating, Gallup found late last year that most Democratic voters — by a margin of 54 percent to 41 percent — would rather their party move to the center than to the left. (Most Republicans, by contrast, want their party to continue moving right.) In another recent poll, by Monmouth, most Democratic voters said they would prefer a nominee likely to win the general election to one who shared their views on most issues. All of which suggests that the 2020 Democratic field would benefit from more candidates who made an effort to appeal to both the left and the center. Such a candidate might end up winning the nomination and crushing Trump. Or he or she could sharpen the eventual nominee, by getting that nominee to reach beyond the party’s liberal base. I expect that the campaign’s next phase will feature several candidates who try to do so. Obama, for example, has advised potential candidates that he “sees a relatively open space for a more moderate Democrat,” as The Times reported. Two Obama favorites who could have filled the role — Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, and Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor — aren’t running. Joe Biden remains the most obvious possibility. Even without having entered the race, he continues to lead just about every poll of Democratic voters. Beto O’Rourke will probably run too, and he’s shown an intriguing appeal across the left and center. Democrats typically lose Texas by between 10 and 30 percentage points. O’Rourke lost his Senate race by fewer than three points, and his coattails helped elect some House Democrats. Amy Klobuchar is making a similar play. Her kickoff speech name-checked John F. Kennedy, Reagan, Martin Luther King Jr. and Walt Whitman. Similarly, John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, described himself last week in Iowa as “a doer,” in contrast to the “dreamers and debaters” from Congress. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio senator, also has the potential to win self-identified moderates. Brown is a good case study, because he shows that appealing to the middle doesn’t mean abandoning progressive principles — as, say, Howard Schultz, the Starbucks billionaire and potential independent candidate, would. (Remember: The political center isn’t where most billionaires think it is.) Brown is a proud populist, a defender of unions and a critic of “corporate freeloaders.” But he also avoids casting himself as an out-of-the-mainstream lefty. He isn’t in favor of banning private health insurance. Since Obama’s 2012 re-election, Brown is the only Democrat to have won a statewide race in Ohio. As Geoff Garin, the Democratic pollster, said to me, voters don’t conduct fine-grained analyses of a candidate’s ideology: “They live in a world of character and personality and values.” Candidates can have an ambitious progressive agenda while also reaching out to swing voters. It’s still very early in the 2020 campaign, and all of the Democratic candidates have the ability to follow this path. Sanders can do so by emphasizing working-class issues that matter to voters across the ideological spectrum. Elizabeth Warren can talk passionately about family values — the real thing, not the fake version. Harris can present herself as an advocate for crime victims, whether the crimes were white-collar or violent. I understand why the Democrats have been focusing their attention on the left. It has a newfound — and welcome — energy. But the best strategy for beating Trump in 2020 doesn’t involve only the left. And beating Trump is terribly important.

2019,Opinion | A Drug to Treat Postpartum Depression,"letter A social worker says outrage at the cost of Zulresso should be balanced by hope for more affordable treatments. To the Editor: Re “Can a Drug Stop Postpartum Depression?,” by Elisa Albert and Jennifer Block (Op-Ed, March 25): We do not completely understand the etiology of postpartum depression. Those of us in the trenches with moms who suffer deeply know only too well that our best efforts to understand and prevent postpartum depression do not always prevent it. We simply cannot isolate the serious and complex origins of this mental health crisis. So, yes, what we have here is an outrageously expensive result of a small study with rapid and impressive results. We hope that this new drug, Zulresso, leads to better, more affordable and more accessible treatments in the future. The understandable outrage from women who suffer should be balanced by our relentless quest for understanding and improved treatments. But in addition to the promise of this new biological pathway to treat severe postpartum depression, we must not disappoint families by dismissing the myriad social, cultural, medical, psychological and financial influences that bombard postpartum women. We can be grateful for this progress as well as attentive and responsive to the enormous challenges that families face after childbirth. Both positions can coexist.

2019,Opinion | A Dummy’s Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals,"Democrats are offering up a litany of exciting big ideas. Let’s take a look. Opinion Columnist We in the news media often whack politicians for not being serious about policy. And then we ignore their policy proposals. So here, in the spirit of orgiastic wonkishness, is my Dummy’s Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals. I write it because something fascinating is underway: After decades of incrementalism, Democrats are now proposing a litany of exciting big ideas. Here’s my take: Child allowances are among the best ideas to boost America’s future. They are used very successfully abroad to reduce child poverty. One proposal would give families with children $250 to $300 per month, in the form of a refundable tax credit. Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan estimates that this would reduce the number of children living in poverty by more than one-third. This version is called the American Family Act, sponsored by Michael Bennet and Sherrod Brown in the Senate and Rosa DeLauro and Suzan DelBene in the House. It is broadly backed by Democrats in the House and the Senate. [Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.] The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in an important new report, calculate that child poverty costs the United States some $1.1 trillion each year. So if you think child allowances are expensive, just look at the cost of child neglect. Baby bonds have been proposed by Senator Cory Booker and are an excellent way to reduce wealth gaps and help low-income families buy homes, afford college and start businesses. The idea is that every child would get a $1,000 savings account at birth, and then children in low-income households would get an additional $2,000 deposit in the account each year. At age 18, the person would get control over the account — which at this point could be worth almost $50,000, including interest — but it could be used only for wealth-building purposes, such as education, a down payment on a home or possibly starting a business. Such accounts have been rigorously studied since the 1990s and have been remarkably successful at helping people gain financial success, often as entrepreneurs. As Robert E. Friedman wrote in his excellent recent book on such accounts, “A Few Thousand Dollars,” the accounts increase homeownership, education and business start-ups (they work best when paired with financial literacy training and savings matches). A plus: Baby bonds would reduce most of the racial wealth gap in the U.S. Child care for at-risk kids is one of the highest-return investments we can make. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a high-quality child care program that resembles the U.S. military’s outstanding program, paid for on a sliding scale depending on the parents’ income. The focus of Warren’s program is helping parents find child care while they work, and that’s important. The United States was a world leader in helping women get into the labor force, but we have lagged the last couple of decades. For prime-age women, we now rank 30th out of 35 advanced countries in female labor force participation — partly because of child care challenges. But while the economic gains are potentially enormous, the even more important reason is to put at-risk low-income children on a path to success. Research suggests that investments in early childhood, especially for kids in dysfunctional homes, are perhaps the best investments this country could make. How do we pay for all this? I like Senator Bernie Sanders’s suggestion for raising the inheritance tax plus various wonky steps that target the wealthy, like eliminating the step-up basis and ending the gap between capital gains and earned income rates. Warren’s proposed wealth tax is also intriguing. It has been tried in Europe and failed, but it may be more workable in a larger country like the United States that people are less likely to cut ties with. It’s true that the wealth tax would be a challenge for paper billionaires with illiquid private companies. But we already have a wealth tax — the property tax — that hurts low-income widows. If impoverished widows can manage, so can billionaires. I suggest testing at a 1 percent rate for billionaires. There are some bad Democratic ideas out there, too. Rent control typically backfires by reducing supply and compounding shortages. Legislation that would make companies pay a tax equivalent to the food stamps and school lunch subsidies employees receive would lead companies to avoid hiring people in low-income households, particularly those with children. There are also many more good ideas, including vigorous antitrust enforcement to break up semi-monopolies, an expanded earned-income tax credit and other job initiatives, plus universal health insurance (though multi-payer has worked well in countries like Germany, so no need to be dogmatic about single-payer). These policy proposals don’t have the drama of a denunciation by President Trump of his rivals, but they could help reshape America. So let’s treat them as no less important than Trump’s tweets.

2019,A Fan Yells ‘Sell the Team.’ Did Knicks Owner James Dolan Threaten Him?,"James L. Dolan, the owner of the Knicks, took exception to a fan at Madison Square Garden who suggested that he sell the team. Dolan’s response: threatening to bar the fan from future games. In a video released by TMZ, Dolan is seen leaving the courtside area late in the Knicks’ loss to the Sacramento Kings on Saturday. A fan yells from off camera, “Sell the team.” Dolan stops quickly and responds, “You think I should sell the team?” and beckons the fan to come nearer. “You want to not come to any more games?” “Why?” the fan asks. “That’s rude,” Dolan says. “It’s an opinion,” the fan contends. “No, it’s not an opinion, and you know what? Enjoy watching them on TV,” Dolan says. He walks away and seems to signal with his eyes to guards, and then some assistants call out, “Hold him,” apparently in reference to the fan. It was not clear if any fan was actually banned. The Madison Square Garden company said in a statement, “Our policy is and will continue to be that if you are disrespectful to anyone in our venues, we will ask you not to return.” The Knicks have had a lot of bad seasons recently — five years without a playoff appearance. But this season has been particularly ugly, with the team, at 13-54, possessing the worst record in the league. A rare Knicks victory on the night of the Academy Awards was so noteworthy that Samuel L. Jackson publicly alerted the Knicks superfan Spike Lee, seated in the audience, about it. The team has occasionally seemed to lash out at criticism. At the end of December, the Knicks invited reporters to a news conference with Steve Mills, the team president, but the team failed to notify The Daily News, presumably because of its coverage of the team’s dismal season. A Daily News back page had encouraged Dolan to sell the team. The headline read: “DO IT! According to a report, James Dolan, who’s sick of being berated by fans, won’t rule out selling Knicks … or Rangers.” Last year he also struck back at the radio station WFAN after a host, Maggie Gray, sharply criticized him. In response, he barred his employees from doing any business with WFAN and other stations run by its parent company, Entercom. Dolan has also had several run-ins in and around the Garden. Two seasons ago, he got into a verbal altercation with a fan outside the arena, a dispute that also began with a recommendation that he sell the team. Charles Oakley, a beloved former star, was handcuffed and ejected from the Garden the same season. Oakley, who had been critical of Dolan, said security guards asked him why he was sitting near Dolan. The team claimed Oakley had acted abusively, and Dolan said on a radio show, without providing evidence, that Oakley might have had an alcohol problem. As a result of the team’s struggles, and his own missteps, Dolan is a frequent target of disdain from Knicks fans, and a good percentage of them might agree with the anonymous fan on the TMZ video imploring him to sell. Many fans gave up on 2018-19 long ago and instead are looking ahead to next season, with the hope that the team will land the No. 1 draft pick or perhaps sign a marquee free agent or two. But for now, no change at the top of the Knicks is on the horizon.",The New York Times
2019,A Favorite Tool While Reporting on Start-Ups: Paper?,"Tech We’re Using Erin Griffith explains how Silicon Valley’s hot young companies are no longer churning out must-use apps and gadgets on an everyday basis. How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Erin Griffith, a start-ups and venture capital reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she’s using. You focus on start-ups. Do any of the tech products you use come from start-ups? If very old, highly valued pre-I.P.O. companies like Slack, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest still count as start-ups, then yes, every day. Every few minutes! I’m Slacking in between each sentence I write. We’re no longer in an era when hot new social media apps are bubbling up every few months, and if they are, I’ve aged out of the early-adopter demographic. Now whenever I stumble upon a new social media app, my only “friends” using it are the venture capitalists I write about. (Even those apps tend to be copied or bought by Facebook.) I use Nuzzel, which sends alerts for stories my Twitter friends are talking about. This is a good way to catch things that elude push notifications and newsletters, including whatever hate-read everyone is angry about. Pocket, an app for saving articles, lets me feel better about not finishing all the Important Long Reads I encounter throughout the day. I can tell myself I’ll get to them later. (I probably won’t.) Giphy, a search engine for GIFs, allows me to express myself when words, emojis or Bitmojis are not enough. I also use a combination of Swarm, the check-in app that grew out of Foursquare; an IFTTT (If This, Then That) recipe; and Google Calendar to record my whereabouts. It’s helpful for doing expenses or remembering the name of a restaurant I went to last month. And Strava, an app for workouts, lets me track my bike rides and jogs. A lot of this creates a privacy mess, I know. What tech tools do you rely on the most for work? This is least techie answer possible, but aside from email and my phone’s voice recorder, it’s probably paper. (Sorry, trees, including the one this article will be printed on.) For every big story I do, I print out huge stacks of background reading on the executives and industry. They’re good for flights since there’s no danger of bad Wi-Fi or no outlets. When I’m writing a longer story, I print out all my interview notes and spread the pages across my kitchen table (or floor), in the manner of a chef’s mise en place. This helps me organize my thoughts before I dive into the writing. I don’t understand how people can work off 30 different documents on one tiny laptop screen. I also find it very comforting to constantly make and remake to-do lists on whatever paper I can find — old envelopes and junk mail, receipts, notepads shaped like my first initial, Post-its. I leave a trail of these everywhere I go, like the Johnny Appleseed of productivity. Anything that doesn’t contribute to deforestation? To transcribe interviews, I use Temi, a service that relies on artificial intelligence. The quality is not great, but it is very cheap and gets me over the impossible procrastination hump of not starting the article because I don’t want to listen to my own voice. And it presents the messy interview transcript in a way that I can find what I want and easily play it back, sometimes without having to endure any of my stammering. Like every other reporter, I use Signal and way too much Twitter. I also use some of the data services the venture capitalists use to identify and track up-and-coming start-ups: App Annie, Crunchbase, CB Insights, Pitchbook, LinkedIn. The most crucial reporting tool I have is probably a gigantic purse that fits my entire life: laptop, tangled masses of chargers and headphones, numerous snacks and water bottles, a dozen pens, a bunch of notebooks, and at least three half-read New Yorkers that have traveled across the country with me so many times they’re basically my emotional support animals. What trends do you see emerging in the start-up scene? Which of them do you think have potential to be successful, and which ones will be a flash in a pan? Being new to San Francisco (I moved from New York last year), I felt it was important to go full native. I acquired AirPods, downloaded the Mr. Chilly weather app for the city’s “microclimates” and briefly embraced scooters. I have not yet bought a vest from the vending machine at San Francisco International Airport, but given the aforementioned microclimates, I see their appeal. The scooter services rode a wave of hype, and I suspect the severity of the backlash to scooter debris — and the vandalism — was greater than the companies and their investors expected. Between injuries, regulatory scrutiny, higher-than-anticipated replacement costs, potential tariffs and the wearing off of the initial novelty, the companies seem to be experiencing a trough of disillusionment just in time for spring. I stopped riding the scooters because I was spending every scooting second thinking about how this would be an especially embarrassing way for a tech reporter to die. Even imagining myself explaining to strangers that, heavy sigh, yes, these crutches are from a scooter accident was enough to convert me back to a boring old analog bike. You’ve written about hustle culture and toil glamour. Is the idea of work-life balance dead? Unfortunately, a lot of the companies that outwardly promote the concept of work-life balance are the ones with the worst cultures of overwork. Over time, I imagine, hypocrisy will turn people off working at those places. Until then, it’s up to the workers to draw their own boundaries. One way to do that is to understand the difference between taking pride in their work and defining their self-worth by their jobs. And maybe lowering sky-high expectations about their company’s do-gooder missions, and being realistic about how fulfilling their jobs will actually be. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life? I have exactly one useful product endorsement: Everyone should abandon the tyranny of bulky, uncomfortable U-shaped neck pillows for the Trtl sleep pillow. When I covered the tech industry from New York, I traveled to San Francisco all the time, and the Trtl saved me on countless red-eyes. It’s basically a plastic neck brace attached to a Velcro scarf. It looks absurd. It easily fits into a purse. It’s glorious.",The New York Times
2019,A First Novel Explores Zimbabwe’s Troubled History,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. HOUSE OF STONE By Novuyo Rosa Tshuma Zamani, the narrator of Novuyo Rosa Tshuma’s remarkable first novel, “House of Stone,” has a troubled relationship with the past. For him there is history, and then there is “hi-story,” a subtle but important distinction for a man who wants more than the incomplete, fragmentary tale his uncle passed on to him before dying. As an orphan born in the violent aftermath of Zimbabwe’s war for independence, Zamani sees the past as riddled with loss and impossible-to-bear gaps and silences that he must “powder away” in order to reinvent himself. The path Zamani takes as he constructs a new “hi-story” is a circuitous one. If he were an ordinary narrator, he would most likely mine and interrogate memories and photographs to construct the narrative he wants. Zamani, however, is anything but ordinary; when we first meet him he has already woven himself into the fabric of another family, the Mlambos, whose son, Bukhosi, has mysteriously disappeared. Zamani lives on the Mlambos’ property as a lodger in what he refers to as a “pygmy room.” Following Bukhosi’s disappearance he draws closer to the grieving parents, Abednego and Mamma Agnes, perversely referring to them as his surrogate mother and father and doing his best to fill the void left by their missing son. And yet, to be more than just a lodger Zamani needs intimate access to Abednego and Mamma Agnes’s past, from their childhood memories of colonial Rhodesia to the buried, unspoken tragedies of their lives during Gukurahundi — the post-independence strategy of ethnic cleansing that began under President Robert Mugabe. Gaining access to that history of profound loss is far from easy. The past is reluctant to give up its ghosts, so Zamani must coax them out, first from Abednego and later from Mamma Agnes. He does so through subtle manipulation and, when that isn’t enough, force and ultimately fear. In one of the novel’s more haunting scenes, Zamani, in order to learn more of his surrogate father’s life, pours glass after glass down the recovering alcoholic’s throat, nearly drowning him in Scotch. With Abednego all but passed out, Zamani leans in close for a selfie. It’s torture masquerading as affection and belongs as much to the brutal “fact-finding” methods of the colonial and postcolonial era as to our own era of state-sanctioned violence. Zamani’s actions and ambitions carry an obviously colonial overtone. Zamani, however, is too rich and complicated a character to be reduced to any single metaphor or symbol. He is elusive and conniving, earnest and manipulative, brutal and desperate. In his excess, he has more in common with Saleem Sinai, the narrator of Salman Rushdie’s classic “Midnight’s Children,” than he does with the orphan Pip of “Great Expectations.” He refers to Wittgenstein on history and in his usurpation of facts and stories resembles Charles Kinbote in Vladimir Nabokov’s “Pale Fire.” Tshuma’s brilliant layering of competing images and metaphors is one of the many marvels of this wise and demanding novel. While Zamani may claim, over and over, that what he’s seeking is a full accounting of history at the most intimate level, the stories that are slowly and painfully revealed suggest that something far more complicated is at work. Zamani, like Zimbabwe, is a product not only of independence but of the Gukurahundi massacres and the decades of cover-up that followed. We remember the liberation as heroic and say little to nothing about the dead left in its wake. Throughout this stunning novel a single question is repeated by the ghost of the missing Bukhosi: What happened? Tshuma’s novel gives a devastating answer to that question, but it does much more than that. Zamani’s radical retelling of the past is a sublime performance of narrative possibilities — presented with an excess of love and violence that at times is almost too much to bear. As Zamani extracts the past, he bends and manipulates it for his own needs. He consumes the private histories of Abednego and Mamma Agnes, leaving a trail of devastation behind him. It’s a remarkable feat. Through Zamani, Tshuma shows us how much work it takes to efface the past, and, through “House of Stone,” she proves that those efforts are no match for a novel as ambitious and ingenious as this one.",The New York Times
2019,"A Flurry of Ideas to Reverse China’s Declining Birthrate, but Will Beijing Listen?","BEIJING — One proposal would end financial penalties for babies born out of wedlock. Another would lower the legal age of marriage. Others would ban discrimination against mothers and mothers-to-be in the workplace and would expand or extend parental leave to fathers. China’s annual legislative session — the National People’s Congress — is typically a staid affair to aggrandize Communist Party rule, but this year it has produced a flurry of proposals to address what experts and officials now acknowledge is a looming demographic crisis caused by the country’s sharply declining birthrate. The ideas now being floated by regional officials, businesspeople and others reflect the depth of the concern over the issue but also the fact that there is not yet a clear consensus on what the government should do about it. One deputy, Huang Xihua, went so far as to propose amending the Constitution to remove all limits on family planning, which until 2016 notoriously forbade most Chinese families from having more than one child. “The reason so many deputies are putting proposals forward is that the birthrate has declined for two consecutive years,” He Yafu, a demographer and the author of a book on the impact of China’s population controls who helped Ms. Huang write her proposal, said in a telephone interview. “The reasons to limit births no longer exist.” The government has, so far least, showed no sign of abdicating its heavy-handed approach to social policy — nor the vast bureaucracy that still enforces family planning laws. For more than three decades, China enforced its “one child” policy harshly, imposing fines and in some cases abortions and sterilizations. The government only relented in 2016 after experts anticipated the demographic issues that the country is now facing. Virtually all families can now have two children, but the anticipated baby boom did not materialize. In the last two years, births have dropped precipitously, falling by 12 percent in 2018. The trend has prompted increasingly dire warnings that China faces a graying population and a dwindling work force to support it in the decades ahead. The debate at the congress might signal changes in the months ahead. Some of the proposals could serve as trial balloons to gauge or shape public sentiment, especially on such sensitive issues as marriage and gender equality. The proposal that has generated the most attention outside the Great Hall of the People, where the congress is being held, would remove legal restrictions on children born out of wedlock. While Chinese law nominally gives children of single mothers the same rights as others, the mothers can face fines or other penalties. In many provinces, for example, a child can only receive a residence permit — known as a hukou — if their parents’ marriage was registered. Others require single parents to pay a “social maintenance” fee to cover the cost of public services a child receives — essentially a tax. There have been cases where single mothers have been fired from their jobs, the Chinese news outlet Caixin noted last month in a survey of regional policies. In a conservative society like China’s, single mothers remain stigmatized, though perhaps less so than before. A change in the law could also affect single women who choose to have children on their own through artificial insemination — either in China or abroad. Ms. Huang’s proposal would remove all the legal constraints on the practice. “Giving a hukou to children born out of wedlock is not to encourage unmarried childbearing,” she said in a video interview on a Chinese website, NetEase, “but to provide them with the protection of their rights.” An enthusiastic supporter is Zou Xiaoqi, an accountant in Shanghai who gave birth two years ago to a son. She was 41, unmarried and not previously inclined to have a child when she became pregnant. “I didn’t used to particularly like children,” she said, “but I felt I couldn’t give him up.” While pregnant, she discovered that the local authorities would not provide her maternity benefits, which included the cost of prenatal care and her salary during six months of leave. She sued the local family planning council and the social services department, but ultimately lost. “Stigmatization is still quite powerful, especially in some smaller cities or rural areas,” she said. “These mothers do not have the courage to fight for their own rights,” she said, referring to unwed mothers. While the largely ceremonial legislature ultimately ratifies new laws, the government ministries themselves draft them and submit them to the deputies for approval, often after months or years of consideration. It remains to be seen which, if any, of the proposals the government will take up. Ms. Huang, for example, has raised her proposals before without success. Other proposals have focused on offering incentives to families with children — through tax breaks, subsidies or greater government spending on schools and services. Yao Jinbo, the chief executive officer of 58.com, an online consumer retail site, proposed increasing living allowances for families that choose to have a second child. Another executive, Ding Lieming of Betta Pharmaceuticals, proposed lowering the legal age for marriage to 20 for men and 18 for women, from 22 and 20 today. At least two delegates suggested laws to expand paternity leave — “to encourage fathers to share family responsibilities,” as one of them, Ke Jianhua, put it. Premier Li Keqiang, who opened the congress with a lengthy work report, pledged that the government would “move faster” to develop child-care services and early education, though he made no specific proposals. He also pledged to end discrimination in the workplace, especially that facing mothers, who can lose their jobs when pregnant or on maternity leave. His remarks echoed a directive issued in February by nine government ministries and agencies prohibiting employers from asking job applicants about their marital or childbearing status. “We will resolutely protect against and stop gender and identity discrimination in employment,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,A Forgotten Italian Port Could Become a Chinese Gateway to Europe,"TRIESTE, Italy — For centuries, this cosmopolitan port city at the northern tip of Italy’s Adriatic coast acted as a geographic pivot point between empires. Then, for nearly 70 years, Trieste’s geopolitical star dimmed and its old world mishmash of central European cultures grew stale, like an old strudel in one of its elegant cafes. Now, courtesy of a rising China, Trieste appears ready to return to the center of a realigning world. This week, President Xi Jinping of China arrives in Rome for a state visit in which Italy is expected to become the first Group of 7 nation to participate in China’s vast One Belt, One Road infrastructure project. The symbolism is striking — a powerful China drives a crack in the economic alliance that once dominated the globe and delivers a major blow to a Trump administration that has been critical of the Belt and Road Initiative. For Italy, the deal would open the country to greater Chinese infrastructure investment, particularly in ports like Trieste. Officials here say they expect Beijing-backed conglomerates, such as the China Communications Construction Company, to bid hundreds of millions of euros for infrastructure concessions. For China, having a toehold in one of Europe’s historic ports would bring favorable customs conditions, a faster trade route to the heart of the Continent and direct access to railroads for moving its goods into the European Union. “Fundamentally, what’s happening is that the port of Trieste is returning to the logistical role for Europe that it had for the old Austro-Hungarian empire,” said Zeno D’Agostino, the president of the Trieste port authority, whose office is sprinkled with gifts from Chinese delegations and a book about European-Chinese cultural relations. To walk through Trieste is to witness how the city has already opened to China. Chinese tourists shop for the city’s trademark Illy coffee and take pictures with their Huawei phones of the elegant Caffè Degli Specchi. A brand-new cruise ship, built in nearby shipyards expressly for Chinese passengers, is docked in the central waterfront piazza, preparing to set sail on Marco Polo’s path to the Far East. Most significant, construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site where a new pier is expected to become China’s home in the industrial port. In the years after World War II, the Americans held great sway in Trieste, and Washington has now sought, so far unsuccessfully, to stop Italy’s deal with Mr. Xi, characterizing the Belt and Road Initiative as an economic and potentially military threat. While other members of the European Union, including France and Germany, have also expressed reservations about the deal with China, supporters in Italy say that there is nothing to worry about and that the critics are merely upset that Trieste — and other Italian ports, like Genoa and Palermo — are going to cut in on their business. They reject comparisons to the port of Piraeus in Greece, which China essentially bought, and say Italian law makes such an acquisition or the laying of Chinese debt traps impossible. Michele Geraci, an Italian economic development minister who is running the negotiations with Beijing, said in an interview that Chinese ships carrying materials from home or its vast network of interests in Africa through the Suez Canal simply needed to get their goods to central European markets as quickly as possible. “Trieste meets that requirement swiftly,” he said. Italian officials say their American counterparts initially seemed disinterested in the deal. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement, has made several trips to China in recent months, nearly signing the accord during a November visit to Beijing, they said. After the fact, American diplomats began making their case, but the Italians said the deal was noticeably not on the American radar during recent high-level meetings in Washington. But this month, Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the American national security adviser, John R. Bolton, sharply attacked the deal in a Twitter post and in several interviews, while the National Security Council’s official Twitter account also issued a reproach on March 9. “Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China’s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people,” the tweet stated, referring to the Belt and Road Initiative. The Americans have also tried to pressure leaders of the nationalist League party, which is part of the governing coalition in Italy. This month, Trump administration officials and, separately, the former White House official Stephen K. Bannon, met with party leaders; Mr. Bannon said that he had warned his Italian allies in the League against what he called China’s “British East India Company model of predatory capitalism.” Awakened to the growing Chinese influence, American officials have had more success pushing Italy to avoid using the new 5G networks of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei, which Washington warns could be used by Beijing to disrupt and spy on communications networks. In recent days, the Italians have excised any mention of technology and communications from the Belt and Road agreement, people familiar with the negotiations said. In Trieste, city leaders are focused on the economic benefits to the port. Beyond its convenient location, the city on Monday celebrated the 300th anniversary of Emperor Charles VI of Austria declaring it a “free port.” That status still confers special privileges, with no customs charges or time limits on storage for goods. If the deal goes through, proponents say they envision Chinese companies working with Italian counterparts, hiring local laborers to assemble imported goods before putting them on trains to the rest of Europe or on ships back to China. If the amount of work and components used measure up to customs requirements, those products could be labeled Made in Italy. But some business leaders say that fully embracing the Belt and Road program would bring risks and could complicate efforts to bring other investment to Trieste. Vittorio Petrucco, chairman of I.CO.P, a construction company doing work in the port, said he and a former Microsoft consultant in Trieste, which has a vibrant research sector, had begun exploring his “dream” of building an underwater data center that would cool the servers of American tech giants. “I prefer to look West instead of East,” Mr. Petrucco said of his project, planned for an area near an old ironworks factory that looms above the pier envisioned for use by the Chinese. He added that both projects would take years to build and worried that all the American opposition and controversy surrounding the Belt and Road agreement would poison the waters for his proposal. “It’s sad,” he said, “but there’s nothing I can do about it.” Roberto Dipiazza, the mayor of Trieste, said that the United States could scuttle the deal if it really wanted to. He said that his city had much to gain from closer ties to China, but that the Chinese had even more to gain from his port’s deep harbors, customs benefits and rail yards. “We will find a point of agreement between China and the U.S.,” he said, showing off a Make America Great Again cap signed by President Trump that he had received as a gift. Italy, he noted, was caught “in the middle.” Some of Trieste’s most entrenched political players think Italy is compromised by such a position. Giulio Camber, a veteran lawmaker considered by many to be the political boss of Trieste, said he no longer had any interests in the port, and that his opposition to the deal was motivated by his distrust of what he called China’s Communist dictatorship. As light sliced in through the closed curtains of his office, illuminating his cigarette smoke, gilded furniture and oil paintings, Mr. Camber said the Chinese were behind many of the Turkish businesses exporting goods into the port. Beijing, he said, would feast on the Italians just as they did on the Greeks before them. “They are the weakest,” he said of the Mediterranean countries. Mr. Camber dismissed the local and national assurances about Chinese expansion, saying that Beijing would easily outmaneuver officials in Rome. “It’s like the world champion in chess playing with a couple of guys who play for fun at the Caffè Degli Specchi,” he said, referring to the famous cafe in Trieste’s main square, the Piazza Unità d’Italia. “You can’t imagine what the world’s best chess player is up to.”",The New York Times
2019,A Former Prison Breaks From the System That Built It,"PHILADELPHIA — Built as a punishing fortress in 1829, Eastern State Penitentiary sat a mile and a half outside Philadelphia, isolated behind 30-foot walls, a model of solitary confinement imitated around the world. The prison remained in use for the next 142 years, even as Philadelphia grew around it. It closed in 1971; then the site was rescued in the 1980s and stabilized, preserved in a permanent state of decay. Today, the brick and stone of the vaulted ceilings are crumbling. Layers of paint are flaking off the walls, and floors are heaped with dirt and dust. Inside the cells, beds and tables are toppled, drawers ajar, frozen in time. The building once attracted more visitors than Independence Hall, even as its practices drew critics including Charles Dickens, who called the prison a place of “torture and agony.” “People feel a power being in a real place that has historic significance,” said Laura Lott, president and chief executive of the American Alliance of Museums. Although it no longer outranks Independence Hall, hundreds of thousands of visitors come each year to explore its grounds, accompanied by an audio tour narrated by the actor Steve Buscemi. But recently talking about the site’s history didn’t seem like enough for Sean Kelley, senior vice president and director of interpretation. Two years ago, after discussions about how the museum addressed the rising number of people incarcerated in the United States — especially people of color — Mr. Kelley helped rewrite the museum’s mission statement, declaring that Eastern State would no longer be neutral in recognizing mass incarceration as a crisis. “Eastern State Penitentiary’s move in this way seemed really courageous because it was not just presenting multiple viewpoints, but taking a stand on the issue,” Ms. Lott said. Marney Penn, a tour guide for the museum, said that it was important to integrate discussions about modern incarceration into the museum’s story since Eastern State helped make the prison system what it is today. “Sometimes you do need to shock people to attention,” Ms. Penn said. “If you’re coming here for a historic tour, that’s great. But at the end of your tour, it’s like, surprise, we have all this really serious information for you.” Art installations in the cells have long been a feature. There are also family weekends with a program that works with inmates to train shelter dogs; visitors can meet the dogs and learn about “Pep,” Eastern State’s famous canine “prisoner.” There have been on-site tastings of Nutraloaf, a composite food product served in prisons. Since 2012, Eastern State has marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day by hosting readings of Dr. King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” in its historic synagogue. You could easily take the tour, peer into the cell where Al Capone stayed for a few months in 1929 and leave, Mr. Kelley said. That might be all visitors want to see, and that’s O.K. But it’s hard to miss the 16-foot “Big Graph” sculpture in the prison yard at the end of the tour. It illustrates the number of people incarcerated in the United States over the decades on one side, with the racial breakdown on the other. From there, it’s a short walk to “Prisons Today,” an exhibit that opened in 2016 and was honored by the Alliance of American Museums. Learn about different forms of incarceration around the world and how your upbringing might affect your chances of going to prison. In an interactive display you can read confessions by both visitors and imprisoned people. The capstone is a video installation produced by Greenhouse Media using archival video and C-SPAN clips that charts the prison population over the decades and the political response to mass incarceration. “They are a leading organization among historic sites,” Paula Marincola, executive director of the Pew Center for Arts and Heritage, said. “They do very thoughtful and imaginative work in interpreting their site for their public and connecting the site and its history to contemporary issues.” The Pew Center has supported Eastern State on a number of initiatives, including one currently in the works. No longer content to just talk about the modern prison system, Eastern State is going inside. It started when Mr. Kelley took a trip to Chicago and saw a screening of “Freedom/Time,” a work the artist Damon Locks created with inmates at Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois, using frame-by-frame animations on tracing paper to tell eight-second stories. “I came back here, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it,” Mr. Kelley said. “I couldn’t stop thinking about that quote that prison walls don’t just keep the prisoners in, they keep the public out.” Sitting in the coffeehouse across the street, he looked at Eastern State’s walls and saw an opportunity to bridge the divide. “Hidden Lives Illuminated,” a collection of one-minute films made by people in Philadelphia-area prisons, will premiere in August and be projected onto those walls. Among the stories: The 18 dogs one man has fostered while in prison; the musical prodigy son using his music to cope without his father; the loneliness of a 22-year-old fighting cancer while in a cell. “We’re trying to let the voices of people who are incarcerated be a springboard for deeper conversations about criminal justice reform,” Mr. Kelley said. The scale will be hard to ignore. In December, while testing the projector by showing a film on the walls, “people were coming out of the coffee shop and clapping, cars were slowing down, people walking their dogs were like, ‘What are you guys doing?’” he said. Three years ago, the museum began hiring former inmates — referred to as “returning citizens” — to work as guides. He said that museum officials kept feeling like they were “at this arm’s length talking about groups of people.” It isn’t required that the guides talk about their experiences, but choosing to can be enlightening for visitors. In the exhibition “Prisons Today,” display boxes hold items belonging to some of those guides. Recently, Ms. Penn struck up a conversation with two women examining commissary receipts inside one box. Those were her receipts, she told them. Ms. Penn’s experiences help her explain things in a way other guides can’t, including how she bought necessities, like deodorant, while earning only 19 cents an hour. “We hold onto things, we are opinionated, and there is stigma attached with criminals and people who come out of the criminal justice system,” Ms. Penn said. “I love my job because we break down those barriers.”",The New York Times
2019,A Glittering Goodbye to Hector Xtravaganza,"New Yorkers gathered to memorialize the life of the ballroom scene “grandfather” and L.G.B.T. icon. CreditCredit [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] “You can’t wear your hair down in a sequin dress,” a voice echoed through a corridor backstage, while fixtures of New York’s ballroom scene primped and prepared. “It snags!” Outside, a dazzling line of stylish guests waiting to enter El Museo del Barrio on the Upper East Side stretched from the entrance to the end of the block, around the corner and then some. They all had arrived on Saturday afternoon to celebrate the life of Hector Xtravaganza at a memorial held at the museum. Friends, family and followers gathered to pay their final respects. Hector was a fashion designer, a night life denizen, a dancer and a community activist who aimed to help lift the social stigma surrounding those who were H.I.V. positive. He has been credited with helping bring the city’s vibrant ballroom circuit and vogueing scene into the mainstream. He died of lymphoma in late December of last year at age 53. Hector — born Hector Crespo — was an original member of the House of Xtravaganza, one of several groups from the 1980s New York ballroom scene who were thrust into the limelight by the popular documentary film “Paris Is Burning.” At the time of his death, he carried the title of “Grandfather,” acting as the patriarchal figure who prioritized looking out for members of his family. In the 1970s and 1980s, a New York City L.G.B.T. community was forming in the Harlem ballroom scene and at the Christopher Street pier in Greenwich Village — a popular hangout that Hector would frequent. Teens who had run away or been kicked out of their homes by families disapproving of their sexual orientation found acceptance in the ballroom world. Many joined “houses,” or chosen families that would compete at balls. A large number of the dancers from that era attended Saturday’s memorial. Guests in stylish attire filled the museum’s auditorium. There were feathers and sequins. Elegant hats rested atop faces covered by oversized sunglasses. Men strutted with open, sternum-exposing dress shirts. Everyone usually greeted one another with a kiss on the cheek. The room seemed to be a combination of veterans from the scene embracing longtime acquaintances and bright young disciples honoring their newly found family by paying respects to the man who introduced it to them. A large golden X stood on each side of a stage set up for eulogies. A giant red, gold and silver crystal-encrusted stiletto heel accompanied those who spoke at the lectern. “I will sum up my cousin and quote him: ‘Blood does not family make. Those are relatives,’” said Jose Disla Xtravaganza, a member of the house and Hector’s longtime friend. “‘Family are those with whom you share your good, bad, and ugly, and still love one another in the end. These are the ones you select.’” The room was decorated in burnt orange and many of those who spoke also wore that color. Mr. Disla Xtravaganza said Hector had been fixated on burnt orange toward the end of his life. Jennie Livingston, director of “Paris is Burning,” recalled her time working with Hector and spoke about his dedication to outreach. Dominique Jackson, a star of the FX network show “Pose,” set in the ’80s New York ball scene and on which Hector appeared and worked as a consultant, spoke of Hector’s generosity and support during her gender confirmation surgery. Father Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, a house leader, dancer and choreographer known for his work with Madonna in the early 1990s, reminisced about ballroom competitions with categories like “Butch King,” which Hector regularly won. “Back in the day, the ‘Ganza kids really had nothing, but we had each other and we had our truth,” he said. “We had to fight for everything, including respect in the ballroom scene and the world. We had to fight for our dignity and to have our identities even recognized. We even had to sometimes fight for our lives. We looked out for one another. We were family, and those that didn’t have, never went without. That was Xtravaganza.” A flute rendition of “Amazing Grace” played while black and white photographs of a young Hector danced across a backdrop onstage. Sobs and sniffles from attendees accompanied the music as if they were written into the melody. A printed proclamation from City Hall was presented and read aloud, which carried a message from Mayor Bill de Blasio recognizing Hector Xtravaganza’s contributions to the culture of New York City, his volunteer work and mentorship of the youth of the city’s L.G.B.T. community. The mayor had officially declared the date as “Hector Xtravaganza Day.” To close the ceremony, four women in glimmering golden gowns performed a spirited and emotional lip sync of “The Other Side of the Rainbow” by Melba Moore. A subsequent standing ovation brought one performer to her knees in tears. As guests filed out of the spacious hall to say their goodbyes, Hector Xtravaganza’s urn, capped with a crown, and embellished with deep red, shiny silver, and burnt orange gemstones was left onstage.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A God Problem,"Opinion Perfect. All-powerful. All-knowing. The idea of the deity most Westerners accept is actually not coherent. CreditCreditReuters Mr. Atterton is a professor of philosophy. If you look up “God” in a dictionary, the first entry you will find will be something along the lines of “a being believed to be the infinitely perfect, wise and powerful creator and ruler of the universe.” Certainly, if applied to non-Western contexts, the definition would be puzzling, but in a Western context this is how philosophers have traditionally understood “God.” In fact, this conception of God is sometimes known as the “God of the Philosophers.” As a philosopher myself, I’d like to focus on a specific question: Does the idea of a morally perfect, all-powerful, all-knowing God make sense? Does it hold together when we examine it logically? Let’s first consider the attribute of omnipotence. You’ve probably heard the paradox of the stone before: Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted? If God can create such a stone, then He is not all powerful, since He Himself cannot lift it. On the other hand, if He cannot create a stone that cannot be lifted, then He is not all powerful, since He cannot create the unliftable stone. Either way, God is not all powerful. The way out of this dilemma is usually to argue, as Saint Thomas Aquinas did, that God cannot do self-contradictory things. Thus, God cannot lift what is by definition “unliftable,” just as He cannot “create a square circle” or get divorced (since He is not married). God can only do that which is logically possible. Not all philosophers agree with Aquinas. René Descartes, for example, believed that God could do absolutely anything, even the logically impossible, such as draw a round square. But even if we accept, for the sake of argument, Aquinas’ explanation, there are other problems to contend with. For example, can God create a world in which evil does not exist? This does appear to be logically possible. Presumably God could have created such a world without contradiction. It evidently would be a world very different from the one we currently inhabit, but a possible world all the same. Indeed, if God is morally perfect, it is difficult to see why he wouldn’t have created such a world. So why didn’t He? The standard defense is that evil is necessary for free will. According to the well-known Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga, “To create creatures capable of moral good, [God] must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can’t give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so.” However, this does not explain so-called physical evil (suffering) caused by nonhuman causes (famines, earthquakes, etc.). Nor does it explain, as Charles Darwin noticed, why there should be so much pain and suffering among the animal kingdom: “A being so powerful and so full of knowledge as a God who could create the universe, is to our finite minds omnipotent and omniscient, and it revolts our understanding to suppose that his benevolence is not unbounded, for what advantage can there be in the sufferings of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time?” What about God’s infinite knowledge — His omniscience? Philosophically, this presents us with no less of a conundrum. Leaving aside the highly implausible idea that God knows all the facts in the universe, no matter how trivial or useless (Saint Jerome thought it was beneath the dignity of God to concern Himself with such base questions as how many fleas are born or die every moment), if God knows all there is to know, then He knows at least as much as we know. But if He knows what we know, then this would appear to detract from His perfection. Why? There are some things that we know that, if they were also known to God, would automatically make Him a sinner, which of course is in contradiction with the concept of God. As the late American philosopher Michael Martin has already pointed out, if God knows all that is knowable, then God must know things that we do, like lust and envy. But one cannot know lust and envy unless one has experienced them. But to have had feelings of lust and envy is to have sinned, in which case God cannot be morally perfect. What about malice? Could God know what malice is like and still retain His divine goodness? The 19-century German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer was perhaps the first philosopher to draw attention to what he called the “diabolical” in his work “On Human Nature”: For man is the only animal which causes pain to others without any further purpose than just to cause it. Other animals never do it except to satisfy their hunger, or in the rage of combat …. No animal ever torments another for the mere purpose of tormenting, but man does it, and it is this that constitutes the diabolical feature in his character which is so much worse than the merely animal. It might be argued, of course, that this is precisely what distinguishes humans from God. Human beings are inherently sinful whereas God is morally perfect. But if God knows everything, then God must know at least as much as human beings do. And if human beings know what it is like to want to inflict pain on others for pleasure’s sake, without any other benefit, then so does God. But to say that God knows what it is like to want to inflict pain on others is to say that God is capable of malicious enjoyment. However, this cannot be true if it really is the case that God is morally perfect. A morally perfect being would never get enjoyment from causing pain to others. Therefore, God doesn’t know what it is like to be human. In that case He doesn’t know what we know. But if God doesn’t know what we know, God is not all knowing, and the concept of God is contradictory. God cannot be both omniscient and morally perfect. Hence, God could not exist. (I shall here ignore the argument that God knows what it is like to be human through Christ, because the doctrine of the Incarnation presents us with its own formidable difficulties: Was Christ really and fully human? Did he have sinful desires that he was required to overcome when tempted by the devil? Can God die?) It is logical inconsistencies like these that led the 17th-century French theologian Blaise Pascal to reject reason as a basis for faith and return to the Bible and revelation. It is said that when Pascal died his servant found sewn into his jacket the words: “God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob — not of the philosophers and scholars.” Evidently, Pascal considered there was more “wisdom” in biblical revelation than in any philosophical demonstration of God’s existence and nature — or plain lack thereof.

2019,"A Gotti Was Released From Prison, Then the Gambino Boss Was Killed. Is There a Connection?","[Update: A man is being questioned in the killing of the Gambino boss.] While Gene Gotti was in prison in the 1990s, he hatched a plan with a Gambino family associate: They would keep up a strict workout routine at the prison gym, federal agents learned. They had to stay in shape, Mr. Gotti reportedly said, because once they got out, he was going to retake control of the Gambino enterprise. This week, that exchange took on new significance. Late Wednesday, the acting boss of the Gambino crime family, Francesco Cali, was shot dead outside his Staten Island home, just six months after Mr. Gotti had been released from federal custody. Police commanders said on Thursday that it was too early in the investigation to determine if Mr. Cali’s killing was related to Mr. Gotti’s release, or was mob-related at all. But one avenue of investigation remains the possibility of an internal war among family associates, former law enforcement officials said. Mr. Cali represented a new chapter in the Gambino family’s history. He was part of a Sicilian faction that took over the family in 2011, when Domenico Cefalù rose to be the acting boss. Both Mr. Cefalù and Mr. Cali had tapped networks in Palermo, Sicily, for foot soldiers, and they adopted a quieter approach to their business dealings. Gene Gotti, 72, represented the old guard. He is the younger brother of John J. Gotti, the infamous “Dapper Don” who ran the family until his conviction on murder and racketeering charges in 1992. John Gotti died behind bars a decade later. A third brother, Peter Gotti, who investigators say became the family’s boss after John Gotti’s death, is serving a life sentence in prison. Given the era of relative peace among New York’s five major Mafia families, many experts on organized crime have begun theorizing that the killing of Mr. Cali might point to a struggle within the family. If so, it could signal a bloody new chapter for the enterprise, where a rift has festered between the Sicilian leadership of Mr. Cali and Gotti loyalists. “What happened here? I don’t know,” said James Hunt, the former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York, where he handled the Gambino portfolio. “You’ve got guys recently released. Gene Gotti was recently released. He may think he was the heir to the throne.” Mr. Cali, 53, was drawn out of his house at 9:17 p.m. Wednesday when a pickup truck rammed repeatedly into his Cadillac sport utility-vehicle, which was parked on the street in front of his home. Security camera video from the Cali house — obtained through a search warrant because the family was not cooperating — showed Mr. Cali coming outside and interacting with the truck’s driver, who seconds later pulled out a pistol, the police said. The gunman shot Mr. Cali six times before speeding off. Chief Dermot Shea, who runs the Police Department’s detective bureau, would not say whether investigators had spoken to Gene Gotti as of Thursday afternoon. When Gene Gotti was arrested in the late 1980s, his brother’s enterprise was starting to crumble. The Gambinos’ heroin business was being undersold by the Colombian and Mexican cartels, who could move drug shipments cheaper and faster. And federal investigators were circling. Gene Gotti was convicted on a heroin-trafficking charge in 1989 and was sentenced to 59 years in federal prison. At the time, he was reputed to be a Gambino captain, officials said. John Gotti, who eluded convictions in three trials, was finally arrested by the F.B.I. in 1992 and convicted of racketeering, extortion and murder. He was foiled after his underboss, Salvatore Gravano, decided to cooperate with the government. In recent years, Mr. Cali emerged as the heir apparent to a new Gambino generation, becoming the acting boss in 2015, prosecutors said. He was a protégé of Mr. Cefalu, and the pair spent the last decade quietly overhauling much of what John Gotti had built, opting for a quiet, reserved approach to organized crime. “They’ve gone back to the old ways, staying under the radar, no flash,” Mr. Hunt, the former D.E.A. head, said. “They got so sick of all the bad stuff from Gotti that they really pulled it in.” Mr. Cali in particular maintained close ties to the Mafia in Sicily, where he had ties through blood and marriage. He filled the family’s decimated ranks with Sicilians, known to be far less flamboyant and showy than their American associates. He quietly cultivated the family’s hold in New York City’s construction and trucking industries, and pulled the clan back under the radar. Rarely seen in public, Mr. Cali avoided the spotlight John Gotti had once sought. He caught only one federal charge — on a racketeering scheme involving the failed construction of a Nascar speedway in Staten Island — and spent less than two years in jail. Mr. Cali’s murder is the highest-profile Mafia killing in more than three decades. In 1985, the Gambino boss Paul Castellano was shot outside Spark’s Steakhouse in Midtown Manhattan. The hit, authorities said, had been sanctioned by John Gotti, who took control of the clan not long after. For investigators who have long watched the Gambinos, Mr. Cali’s slaying was so brazen that it raised the possibility it was a personal vendetta. Mafia assassinations are usually carried out by a team of gunmen in a place far from the target’s home and family — a restaurant, a barber shop, a cafe. The assassins also generally take care to avoid security cameras and use cars and guns that are difficult to trace. “This is not how usually the mob operates, especially not with a person at this high level,” said Robert Boyce, a former chief of the Police Department’s detective bureau. “That is the primary question, is this a sanctioned hit?” Killings this high profile, Mr. Boyce said, rarely go unanswered. “There’s a very good probability there will be more violence,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Grand Compromise on Immigration,"A bipartisan deal to bring millions of immigrants out of the shadows, and pay for a secure border. Mr. King is a Republican representative from New York. Mr. Suozzi is a Democratic representative from New York. Americans are frustrated by the inaction of their federal government on comprehensive immigration reform and border security. So are we. We both represent districts on Long Island, and we have both worked on immigration-related issues for over 25 years — one of us, Representative Suozzi, from the perspective of immigrant’s rights as a mayor, as a county executive and now as a member of Congress; the other, Representative King, from the perspective of border security as a former county comptroller, and now as a congressman and former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. We come at this from different points of view and different parties, but with a shared commitment to finding a solution to our country’s border-security issues. Together, we have found common ground to address the problems faced by undocumented immigration and the need for robust border security. For more than 30 years, our government has failed to solve these problems. This year, the American people endured the longest government shutdown in American history when lawmakers and the president failed to reach a spending deal that centered around border security and immigration along the United States and Mexican border. The national emergency regarding immigration reform, however, is not on the border, but in the nation’s capital. We must work together — across party lines — to address these matters in a way that receives bipartisan, bicameral support, and gives the president legislation he feels he can sign. On Long Island, we have one of the 10 largest populations of undocumented immigrants from Central and South America, as well as countless unaccompanied minors. Many have been in our communities for decades living productive lives, attending school with our children, working six days a week and going to church on Sunday. It is our duty, as elected officials, to provide solutions to the problems, not sound bites to the press. That is why we are proposing a realistic set of reforms that would offer legal protection for five million undocumented people and, alongside it, enough funding to make our border secure. First, our plan would create a path to citizenship for approximately 1.9 million immigrants brought by their parents, without documentation, when they were 18 or under, the so-called Dreamers. To be eligible, they must have graduated from high school; have no record of criminal activity; and be either in the military, working full time for at least three years or attending college. We would extend similar coverage to the 400,000 people who were invited to America and given temporary protective status after facing natural disasters, violence and extreme poverty in their home countries. Finally, relatives of Dreamers, of T.P.S. recipients and of others who are undocumented — approximately 2.7 million more people — would be eligible for three years of protective status, renewable indefinitely, if they have been in the United States for a significant number of years and have no record of criminal activity. Taken together, this represents five million people. Next, to qualify for protection, an undocumented person would be required to pay a $2,000 fee. If each of the five million paid that amount, our plan would generate $10 billion. Some of that money, in turn, would be used to cover the administrative costs of this new program; we figure those costs would be $1.4 billion. The remaining $8.6 billion would be split evenly: $4.3 billion would pay for additional physical structures along the United States-Mexico border, as proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, and $4.3 billion would go to aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to help prevent further out-migration from those countries, as well as to radar technology, improved ports of entry, immigration judges, border patrol personnel and humanitarian assistance along the border, as recommended by the Department Homeland Security. For far too long, many people living in our country have been living in fear, and many others have grown frustrated by the inaction of our elected officials. The undocumented have lived in the shadows, facing the daily anxiety of potential deportation, even as they try to participate in our American communities. As legislators, we know what we have to do: We must stand together and pass legislation that will help secure our borders while giving undocumented immigrants a path to permanent residency without the fear that at any moment they may be deported.

2019,Opinion | A Green New Deal for the Rest of Us,"letter A reader says the American left is waking from its long slumber. To the Editor: Re “How the Left Embraced Elitism” (column, Feb. 12): Economists produce lots of numbers. If you look at the ones David Brooks cites, then “the productive dynamism of capitalism is truly a wonder to behold,” and the turn toward socialism suggested by the Green New Deal would only serve to undermine the free market’s success. Or you could look at these: In 2011, extreme poverty in the United States was double the levels in 1996, with child poverty reaching record levels. In 2015, 100 million Americans, almost a third of us, were living in near poverty. In 2018 the United Nations condemned the “private wealth and public squalor” in the United States. Looking at those numbers, one could be led to believe that capitalism had accomplished exactly what Marx predicted: made the rich richer and the poor poorer. Unfortunately, our politics is incapable of understanding that capitalism does both these things: It is very good at creating wealth and very bad at spreading it around. Worse still, now that Citizens United has identified money as the political equivalent of personhood, our biggest banks, social media and tech companies, which have also been our biggest malefactors, are virtually invulnerable to the democratic processes, or even the laws, that might restrain them. So it’s no wonder that the left is waking from its long American slumber. Now, if it can only restrain the tendency to circle the wagons and open fire, maybe we can save both the democracy and the planet. David BermanNew York",The New York Times
2019,A Gripping Political Mystery in Northern Ireland,"Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music | How to Listen No spoilers on this week’s podcast, we swear. Patrick Radden Keefe talks about his new book, “Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland.” The book begins in December 1972, when 38-year-old Jean McConville, a mother of 10 and recently widowed, was taken from her home by a group of masked intruders who abducted her in front of her children. “Say Nothing” uses the central mystery of what exactly happened that night, and why, to also investigate the history of the Troubles in Ireland and write about the lives of many people involved on each side of the conflict. Keefe eventually reveals (in the book, not on the podcast!) exactly what happened to McConville. “In doing that,” he says of detailing McConville’s fate, “I’m drafting on an incredibly brave effort by her children, starting in the 1990s, to come out and break the code of silence in Ireland, and say: ‘We need to know what happened to our mother. We’ve been waiting decades for answers, for a body.’ And I think it took great courage for them to do that.” Frans de Waal visits us this week to discuss “Mama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves.” “I think animal intelligence and emotions are completely intertwined,” he says. “Also in humans, I think, you cannot separate the two. You can barely think without emotions, and you can barely have emotions if there’s not some cognition involved.” Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world, and Lovia Gyarkye, Tina Jordan and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host. Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”: “War Diaries, 1939–1945” by Astrid Lindgren “The Vegetarian” by Han Kang “Kafka Was the Rage” by Anatole Broyard “Giving Up the Ghost” by Hilary Mantel “Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson” by Robert A.

2019,A Hamptons House Built to Withstand the Grandchildren,"ON LOCATION The East Hampton, N.Y., vacation home was designed to accommodate an extended — and expanding — transcontinental family. It only looks fragile. 12 Photos View Slide Show › A few years after their daughters moved from the mountainous western edge of Austria to the concrete canyons of New York, Konrad and Doris Wuehrer decided to start a new tradition. Instead of expecting their children to return home to Austria every summer — as the women, Barbara Wuehrer-Engelking and Monika Wuhrer (who uses a variant spelling of the surname), were beginning to start families of their own — the parents would organize a family vacation in the United States, renting a beach house with room for everyone. At first, it was Cape Cod. But after a few years, when the drive proved too long for the increasing number of grandchildren (the New York-based sisters now have five sons between them), they switched to the Hamptons, and found a house in the Springs hamlet of East Hampton. “We thought it was really good: nature, living, recreation,” said Mr. Wuehrer, 80, a retired mechanical engineer. It was so good, in fact, that as the years and memories piled up, he said, “we decided to buy a house.” Finding the right one, however, proved challenging. Every house they saw was too small, too close to neighbors or in dismal condition. But the children had some ideas of their own. Ms. Wuehrer-Engelking, 49, an architect who works on low-income housing and restoration projects, had married another architect, Jerome Engelking, 45, who had experience designing upscale residential and commercial buildings at Richard Meier & Partners Architects. Why not look for land, Mr. Engelking suggested, where he could design a family home from the ground up? The Wuehrers liked the idea and eventually found a forested lot of a little more than three acres, bounded on two sides by a nature preserve where Springs meets Amagansett. As Mr. Wuehrer put it, “It’s a really nice property in the middle of the woods, almost like a park.” “It’s just trees, deer and birds,” Mr. Engelking said, which meant they wouldn’t need to worry about the children disturbing the neighbors. “That sealed the deal.” The Wuehrers bought the property for $575,000 in 2014, and Mr. Engelking set to work, with Ms. Wuehrer-Engelking facilitating communications between her father and husband. “I do architecture, but it’s completely different,” she said of her work, so she let her husband take the lead. “You cannot have two architects with two different opinions.” Impressed with the secluded, unspoiled site, Mr. Engelking envisioned a house that would be visually wide open. “I suggested a glass house, to maximize the generous opportunities of the surroundings,” he said. Mr. Wuehrer was intrigued, but felt that a house made of wood would be cozier. “He wanted something that felt homey, not a machine for living,” Mr. Engelking said. “These two things didn’t necessarily jibe.” Or at least they didn’t until Mr. Engelking discovered IC2 Technologies, a company in Quebec that makes a glass curtain-wall system with a glue-laminated wood structure that would deliver the openness Mr. Engelking envisioned with the visual warmth Mr. Wuehrer wanted. Using this system, Mr. Engelking designed a long, single-story, 2,500-square-foot house with three bedrooms and a media room at one end — each with its own door to the lawn outside — and an open living, dining and kitchen wing at the other. He used a limited material palette, leaving the pine structure exposed and installing a radiant heating system in the concrete-slab floor. “Instead of doing any bold, formal move or loud, ostentatious design, I’d rather be very simple and quiet,” Mr. Engelking said, reducing the house “to the bare structural minimum.” On the eastern side, where the three and a half bathrooms face the driveway, he had vertical cedar slats installed on the exterior, for extra privacy. On the western side, facing the lawn, there are large, retractable exterior wood blinds that can completely cover the floor-to-ceiling glass on hot summer days. Construction began in May 2016 and took about a year to complete, at a cost of $500 a square foot. But “that included a lot of sweat equity,” said Mr. Engelking, who managed the many contractors and oversaw the work. The transparent house may not be what Mr. Wuehrer initially imagined, but he is happy with the result. “The conception is very clear, and I like that,” he said. “One side for sleeping, one side for living and dining, and every room has a door to the garden. It provides privacy for everybody staying in the house.” But more important, he added, “We now have a place where the big family comes together. We have five grandsons in New York, and we have a son here in Austria who comes with another three.” The New York-based family members use the house throughout the year, but it is when everyone comes together — and eight boys, between the ages of 1 and 17, tear through the rooms — that Mr. Engelking judges his work. “The house was designed to withstand hurricane-force winds,” he said. “But the real storm is in the summer, when all the grandchildren are in the house. That’s the stress test.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate.",The New York Times
2019,"A Handyman Asks: After Servicing a Home, Can I Get Paid to Service My Clients’ Other Needs?","work Friend Plus: A radical prescription for dealing with millennial entitlement in the office. CreditCreditEmily Simms for The New York Times Even a Work Friend needs a break from the office sometimes. Send in your questions about all kinds of money-related extracurriculars: marriage and divorce; windfalls and investment catastrophes; and, of course, anything that happens in a truck. Confide to workfriend@nytimes.com. I’m 62. I’ve been a handyman for 40 years. My body is breaking down, but I can’t afford to retire, and I can’t imagine having any success changing careers at this point. I specialize in renovation of classic residential architecture. But truth be told, what I’m truly gifted at is “relationship void-filling.” I have never romanced an employer, but I’ve provided countless customers with everything else they wish their husbands could or would provide — namely, an attentive ear; an ability and eagerness to talk about literature, film and music; a sense of humor; and the kind of compassion and empathy that can’t be taught. My entire adult life I’ve been making $15 to $20 an hour to renovate houses and making $0 an hour to renovate women’s egos and souls. I know — because I’ve read about them in this publication — that there are dignified escort services out there designed for men who aren’t looking for sex, just attractive women with whom to dine or attend business functions. Women who are good at that job can make several thousand a week. I’d be delighted to make three or four hundred extra dollars a week by doing more for women than repair the drawer slides of their master-bathroom vanity cabinets. What should I be charging to be the most comforting gentleman handyman on earth, and how should I advertise? — Lynchburg, Va. I hate to break it to you, but in this neoliberal age when everything is monetized, including — maybe even especially — the renovation of egos and souls, either you haven’t been charging enough for your time or you aren’t as charming as you think. (There is also a third option, which is that you are an absolutely terrible handyman and your company is what your clients have been paying for all along.) But let’s assume for the purpose of this question that you are exceedingly charming and handy both. What can you do now to make more money? In my experience, it’s almost never a bad idea to just state plainly what you want and put it out into the world. “Consummately Skilled and Affable Handyman,” reads my imagined Craigslist ad, which you will send to all your previous clients to forward to their wealthy friends. “Hi there,” it continues. “I am an unusually attentive handyman with a specialty in the renovation of classic residential architecture (enthusiastic references available upon request). I am an expert at my job, but I also enjoy establishing relationships with my clients and continuing to work for them long term on personal projects.” People will get it. You might be surprised how many well-off women request your services. At your age, the supply of available wealthy women increases, while that of fit or even alive men goes down. It’s called a market inefficiency! I have a good feeling that this will be the most lucrative phase of your career. I work as a driver for a trucking company, and I subscribe to an app that helps me meet people — especially those who are looking for sex and romance. People in the dispatch office, apparently as a group, will make profiles on this app and relentlessly harass me everywhere I go. The other day they used the app, acting as a person looking for sex, to send me to a certain location. Of course, after I arrived, no one showed up, and when the office called me to ask where I was, one woman told me she and all my managers had been having a lot of fun “watching me looking.” I feel pretty jerked around here. What do you think? — Yuba City, Calif. First things first: You could probably take legal action against your bosses and file a sexual harassment suit. Your dating life is none of their business, even if it involves meeting people in random clandestine locations on the road for anonymous sex. You can do whatever you want in your off hours, as long as you aren’t, um, doing it in the company-owned vehicle. That said, you might not want to take things there. Perhaps you really need your job or otherwise don’t want to get a bad reputation in the business. Personally, I think it’s a terrible idea to meet up with total strangers in random clandestine locations for anything at all, really, but I am not a man and I am also not a trucker, so what do I know. It might be best to split the difference: Tell your bosses that their behavior is actionable and a form of sexual harassment. Say that you value your job and your colleagues and everything else (even if this isn’t true), but the cyberstalking has to stop. Even if what they’re doing isn’t technically grounds for a lawsuit, the threat of taking action can be powerful. I mean, no one wants the hassle! At the very least, pushing back with a threat will demonstrate to them that this is not just fun and games for you. I joined a new team at work, and with that came a new manager. After four months on the team, I’ve noticed that my manager routinely blows off my weekly meetings; does not respond to emails; shares brief, vague performance evaluations; and seems to be giving more attention to other colleagues. I think of myself as a high performer, but when I have trouble getting any sort of feedback from my manager, it’s hard to believe the problem isn’t with me. Do you have any tips to respectfully get my manager to provide the feedback that I’m looking for? — G.B., Seattle This question has a binary answer: Either you are doing fantastically and the manager is of the type who wants to avoid headaches above all else, or you are doing horribly and the manager is also of the type who wants to avoid headaches above all else. Unfortunately, it’s up to you to determine which one of these explanations is more probable. The good news is that some consulting firms ask exactly this sort of brainteaser in their interviews! At what point do people grow up and get out of the seventh grade? Your employer is not paying you to act like children. When I first entered the work force, I was thankful to my employer for giving me a job. Now, new hires act like they are doing me a favor just to show up — then spend all day on their phones complaining and looking for another, more “dream” job. All I hear is, “I want a job that makes me happy.” Here’s a thought: Paying your bills on time is a happy thing. — K.B. Even though yours is pretty close to a rhetorical question, I am going to offer some advice: Start recruiting ambitious, hungry kids from good state schools and community colleges. That is, if you’re looking for workers who don’t act like they just got out of the seventh grade, hire some who don’t take their education for granted. Also, kids who had physically demanding summer jobs like working retail, washing cars or digging ditches are often highly appreciative of the perks of working in a phone-type environment. And they can deal with cranky bosses like yourself. But pay them really well, O.K.? Katy Lederer is the author of three books of poems and a memoir.

2019,"A Handyman, a Sudden Eviction and a Gentrification Battle Royale","How a sprawling Brooklyn co-op, an enclave of progressive good will, fell out over a free apartment and a beloved caretaker. Hector Caballero was told to vacate his apartment, part of the Clinton Hill Cooperative, where the handyman has lived rent-free for 19 years.CreditCreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times Here is a vision of New York the way many people dream it: a packed room of neighbors on a Saturday afternoon, diverse in age and race and class, talking about community. They are long-timers who anchored the buildings through some rough years and newcomers paying top dollar during the good. They have come to share their sense of home and belonging. And they are ready to explode. Finally somebody says it. You’re like Donald Trump, a woman yells at the co-op president, a 52-year-old financial planner in a plaid shirt. A pen raps on a table for order. It doesn’t come. “It was very disrespectful,” a woman recalled. This is a story about change in the new Brooklyn, where gentrifiers and social activists are often the same people, and the threats to a neighborhood’s charms can be the people who move there to enjoy them. The dispute at the Clinton Hill Cooperative apartments, a sprawling complex of 12 red brick buildings where people say they know their neighbors, involves a single apartment and a beloved handyman who lives there. But it is also about the narrative of a community in rapid flux: amid the upheaval, is a free apartment a glitch from the sketchier past, something to be rectified in the name of progress? Or is it a strand of continuity that people might yearn to call home? The Clinton Hill Co-ops were built for Navy Yard workers during World War II, and still bear maritime-themed tile mosaics over the doorways. On a recent weekday morning, a few women pushed strollers by a security stand in one of the inner courtyards. One change: there used to more benches for hanging out, said Dolores Gilliard, 73, who moved to the complex in 1979. She pointed to an adjacent laundry that no longer offers self-service, in response to the neighborhood’s churn. Ms. Gilliard drew a line. “Gentrification is not going to change who we are,” she said. “We have the biggest block party in Brooklyn. We have seniors, millennials, gay people, kids of all nationalities. The best block party.” When the co-op board announced last month that it planned to take away the apartment of Hector Caballero, a handyman who had lived there with his family for 19 years, it hit residents as an affront. Many thought that in their turf — a progressive enclave in a progressive part of Brooklyn — they had figured out a formula for harmonious gentrification, even as other parts of the city split apart. “This community was always a community,” said Barbara Abrams, 74, who has lived in her 10th floor apartment, with views of the Empire State Building, since the 1970s. “People say hello. You hold the door for each other. It’s just nice.” Now, suddenly, there was a victim. Mr. Caballero, 55, started working as a handyman in the Co-ops in February 1990, and he was given an apartment 10 years later, with the understanding that he would be available for emergency repairs at all hours. The neighborhood had a rougher image then, and the Co-ops were coming out of financial distress, with apartments going vacant. Myrtle Avenue, the complex’s northern boundary, was known as Murder Avenue. Mr. Caballero, who has an easy demeanor, became a favorite of residents, as were his two children. “He’s smiling all the time,” Ms. Abrams said. “I never saw him make an evil face.” Seven hundred residents signed a petition urging the board to keep Mr. Caballero and his family in place. When residents demonstrated outside a board meeting in February, carrying signs that read “Worker Justice” and “Hector Stays,” someone called the police. An officer from the 88th Precinct told the crowd to disperse. “The eviction,” she announced, “is a done deal.” This only raised the anger in the complex. “I didn’t think it was radical to say, We want to keep the community the way it is,” said Helen Yentus, 38, who bought her apartment three and a half years ago. “As a gentrifier, as a new person, I moved here for this.” Where the protesters saw a board driven to maximize revenue at all costs, the board’s president, Timo Lipping, looked at the same complex and saw something entirely different: a dark secret, unknown even to the full board. Mr. Lipping, who led what he calls a “wave election” in late 2015, saw himself as a reformer in the Co-ops. He fought to reduce the number of board seats held by the co-op’s initial sponsor, and to replace old board members who had become “stagnant,” he said. When he stepped into his position, he said, “the head of security pulled us aside and said there was a serious crime ring in the maintenance staff.” The security chief, who has since died, outlined a range of criminal activity by a handful of maintenance workers, said Mr. Lipping and another executive board member, Peter McGuigan. The group did not include Mr. Caballero, whose work was considered good. “We didn’t know whether to believe any of this,” Mr. Lipping said. “I knew the guys were lazy and needed to be reformed.” A law enforcement raid fizzled when someone inside the building administration tipped off the staff, the two added. “They were shaking down guys who delivered paper products,” Mr. McGuigan said. “All these street-level cons.” The executive committee quietly hired two outside investigators, at a cost of about $30,000, who confirmed the security chief’s allegations, Mr. Lipping and Mr. McGuigan said. “When we got their report, it ranged from the guys just not doing their job up to full-blown criminal activity — mainly drugs, but maybe guns, too,” Mr. Lipping said. “That’s terrifying.” Asked about this account, Mr. Caballero said, “That’s news to me.” He added: “That has nothing to do with my apartment. Why are they bringing all this stuff up now?” The committee did not inform other board members or residents about the investigation, Mr. Lipping added, because it was a personnel matter, and “because we didn’t want to scare anybody.” The investigators’ report remains in a lawyer’s office, where no one can see it. Mr. Lipping declined to share the report. For many residents, this article will be their first word about the investigation. “It was scary,” Mr. McGuigan said. “You walk your kid to school, and you say, There’s that guy the F.B.I. was watching.” The investigation also showed mountains of work that was not getting done. “We were paying people overtime, and we had 350 work tickets that were backed up,” said Audrey Churchill, a board member who moved to the Co-ops in 2004, after growing up in public housing nearby. Poor maintenance of asbestos led to an abatement cost of nearly $1 million, Mr. McGuigan said. Some workers spent days watching DVDs or taking side jobs for extra pay, including work for which residents were supposed to pay the co-op, Ms. Churchill said. Mr. Caballero was not among those implicated. But amid the scrutiny of the maintenance staff, his apartment raised a red flag, Mr. Lipping said. Though the co-op had formal agreements granting apartments to its two live-in supers, as stipulated in the union agreement and required by law, it had no such agreement for the four handymen who had also been given apartments. In a staff of close to 40 maintenance men, giving free housing to a few struck board members as unfair and fiscally imprudent, especially as the apartments rose in value. After negotiating with the union, the board decided to take back two of the four apartments. On January 15, the complex manager informed Mr. Caballero that he would have to give up his apartment in three months. Another resident handyman had gotten a similar notice and left quietly. Mr. Caballero chose a different route. “You’re going to give me 90 days to leave after 19 years?” he said. “I want to be treated with dignity and respect.” Mr. Caballero complained to his union but got little action. When he told Neil Donnelly, a shareholder who had been active in a previous effort to stem evictions within the complex, Mr. Donnelly gathered neighbors in support. “I was stunned,” Mr. Donnelly, 41, said. Neighbors who had been tepid in the earlier effort to prevent evictions were incensed about Mr. Caballero, said Iben Falconer, who is married to Mr. Donnelly. “The fact that this happened to Hector, this was an affront.” Told of the board’s investigation, Ms. Falconer said: “You’re going to hear me vent a little bit. We were not told any of this. They’re using it as an excuse that they’re trotting out when they want to get somebody out of his apartment.” She added: “That doesn’t seem like the way to create the kind of community that we all want to live in. We want to have resident handymen who understand our buildings. They haven’t addressed that.” Residents accused Mr. Lipping of putting “curb appeal” over the needs of a neighbor and his family. “Curb appeal is when you want to sell something,” said Dunton Black, 73, who bought his apartment in 1984 for $13,500. “My next step is the cemetery.” Someone told Mr. Lipping to watch his back. “So I’ve been threatened over this whole thing, too,” he said. It was such a small matter, one apartment in a complex of more than 1,200. But in the heated real estate market of 2019, it became a litmus test of values. For the board, which ran on promises to clean up past negligence, the apartment was a legacy of a “culture of corruption,” Mr. Lipping said. “I’m a financial planner,” he said. “I’m not a politician or a public speaker. I was not mentally prepared to have a bunch of people who I have spent countless hours working on behalf of call me these horrible names.” For the residents, Mr. Caballero and his apartment were ties to a softer market that valued stability and continuity, because the alternative was decline. Mr. Caballero had been a steadying force when change was tilting toward social disorder. Now that every change brought neighbors with more resources and fancier jobs, did stability and continuity still matter? With board members not communicating well about the decision to remove Mr. Caballero from his apartment, speculation about the reasons behind it ran unchecked. Maybe they were hiding a financial hole. Or somebody in the original sponsor’s organization was pulling the strings. Or Mr. Lipping cared only about raising the value of apartments, so he wanted the money to add amenities. Maybe it was just a heartless management company, telling the volunteer board that they knew best. Residents aired their grievances in the media and to elected officials, complaining that they got no response from the board. “We don’t know who made the decision to take back the apartment,” Ms. Gilliard said. “It has rallied the community to tell the board: ‘We’re not just shareholders. We care about the maintenance men.’ It’s made us closer and stronger. She added: “We can’t let you get away with any slight, because we don’t know what you’re going to try to get away with tomorrow.” Mr. Black said he was suspicious that the board suddenly needed money. “I’ve been fighting for 30 years with these people,” he said. “They’re pushing too hard against us, who they’re supposed to be representing.” To many in the Co-ops, the injustice was clear. Even local politicians lent Mr. Caballero support, with Clinton Hill’s City Council member, Laurie A. Cumbo, and Hakeem S. Jeffries, a United States congressman from Brooklyn, urging the board to keep him and his family in their home. Finally, the board announced a reprieve of sorts. Mr. Caballero could stay until July, rather than leaving in April. As articles about the conflict came out in the Daily News and Gothamist, the board members kept silent. Their underlying story — of criminal activity among some now-former maintenance men — was too inflammatory, bad for both community peace of mind and co-op reputation, Mr. Lipping said. The one neighbor to whom Mr. Lipping had confided, Michael Grinthal, had rejected it as reason to evict Mr. Caballero. Mr. Grinthal, 45, a housing lawyer, said he had sensed that something shady had been going on. “I knew there were things I didn’t know,” he said. “This felt like, Ah, this is what that all was.” But he added, “I don’t think that should be brought to bear on the question of whether Hector, who didn’t have anything to do with it — why is that being raised to color this decision?” Mr. Lipping said he hoped the furor would die down as people got on with their lives. In the meantime, the board hired a publicist to help tell its side of the story. “I want to make sure this gets done right,” Mr. Lipping said. “It’s my home, too. If people don’t like me, whatever. But it’s important for me that we do this right. In the beginning we made some missteps, misjudging the reaction. But we’re not professionals. We’re just volunteers. “I feel like telling people, this is the United States, you have the right to express yourself, but we only have a limited amount of bandwidth.” For Mr. Caballero, the next step is unclear. “I wasn’t expecting that much love from the community,” he said. He arranged to meet with a lawyer and looked into a couple of jobs in other buildings — without the free apartment, he cannot stay at Clinton Hill Co-ops, he said. “I’m 50-plus,” he said. “I was trying to retire here with honor. I came here on my own, and I would like to leave on my own.” For him and for the others, there remained a lingering question, of home and neighborly obligation. As he put it, “My kids say, ‘If we don’t belong to this community, where do we belong?’”",The New York Times
2019,A Heart-Healthy Diet May Be Good for the Brain,"A diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruits and whole grains and minimizes saturated fat may be good for long-term cognitive health. Eating a heart-healthy diet beginning in your 20s may provide brain benefits in middle age, new research suggests. The study, in Neurology, ranked 2,621 people on their degree of adherence to three different diets considered to be good for the heart. All emphasize vegetables, fruits and whole grains and minimize saturated fat consumption: the Mediterranean diet, which involves mainly plant-based foods and moderate alcohol intake; a research-based diet plan that rates food groups as favorable or not; and the DASH diet, which stresses low-sodium foods. Researchers tracked their diet compliance at ages 25, 32 and 45, and tested mental acuity at 50 and then again at 55. Those who adhered most strictly to the Mediterranean or the food group diet scored higher than those who did not, especially on tests of executive function, which involves organizing and planning. After adjusting for many health and behavioral factors, people with the strictest adherence to these diets had a 46 to 52 percent lower risk of poor cognitive function. But adherence to the DASH diet, which does not consider alcohol consumption, was not associated with cognitive test scores. Which diet is best? “We can say at this point that a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean diet is a good option,” said the lead author, Claire T. McEvoy, a dietitian and epidemiologist at Queen’s University Belfast. “It’s palatable and adaptable, and in that respect it’s a pretty good dietary pattern.”",The New York Times
2019,A Hermès Watch for Any Gender,"What makes a watch a man’s watch? Or a woman’s? Consider La Galop d’Hermès, a stirrup-shaped timepiece introduced at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in January. It’s a feminine watch, according to Ini Archibong, the California-born designer who collaborated with the Parisian house on the piece, but it doesn’t have “a gender per se.” “In the beginning of the research, there was a lot about looking at fashionable, powerful women who were moving fast in a determined way, going somewhere,” said Mr. Archibong, 35. “But then we thought, ‘What if there’s a watch that has feminine energy but invites the man to embrace that?’” Mr. Archibong, who is now based in Switzerland, was approached three years ago by Hermès to create “a new women’s icon.” “It was a lot of pressure,” he said. “How do you even do that? You know what the iconic watches are, but you don’t know what makes them that.” “It came down to an iconic silhouette,” said Mr. Archibong, who consulted regularly during Le Galop’s development with Philippe Delhotal, the design and development director of the house’s watch division. Mr. Archibong said he examined the Panerai Luminor, the Patek Philippe Nautilus, the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, the TAG Heuer Monaco and the Rolex Oyster Perpetual — “traced them and made a black silhouette, removing the straps so it was just the case. Then I sat with Philippe and he just named them off, one by one. If you have an iconic case shape, then you’ll be able to identify exactly what it is from far away.” He said that Hermès hadn’t steered him toward its equine roots; he settled on the stirrup-shaped case himself after spending time at the house archives. “Hermès was started upon the idea of creating a better harness for attaching the horse to the carriage,” he said. “If you look at the logo, there’s this negative space in the harness connecting to the horse. I started with that and realized that the brand’s story was about hardware and about aerodynamics, speed, efficiency and travel.” He described spending six hours with the company historian on one occasion, learning how early Hermès designs were approached. “I saw all the stirrups that Emile Hermès collected, and that’s when the stew started cooking,” he said. “That’s how I design — in my head. I just fill it up with stuff until something comes out, and when it comes out it’s the whole thing, it’s a whole idea.” Mr. Archibong’s parents, academics from Nigeria, had expected that he would follow in their footsteps, and he did study business before deciding to pursue a career in design. He is a graduate of the prestigious L’École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in Switzerland and spent several years working in Singapore, and his portfolio includes lighting fixtures and furniture for brands such as Sé, Formentera and Lapicida. Designing a watch, however, came with a new set of challenges. “Moving down in scale means changing how drastic a movement is,” Mr. Archibong said. “When you get down to a watch, you’re drawing with your knuckles. If you’re making a gesture that’s bigger than what you can do with your knuckles, you’ve already done way too much.” Le Galop was made at 26 millimeters (an inch) in diameter and 40.8 millimeters tall — small for a man’s watch but large for a woman’s. The crown was tucked away at 6 o’clock, reducing the perception of size even further. When it came to designing the two-layered dial, which Mr. Archibong described as the most challenging element, he said he was inspired by his obsession with cathedrals and their windows. The outer part of the dial was bead-blasted, a finish suggested by Mr. Delhotal that gives the watch’s appearance much of its depth, and that Mr. Archibong admitted he had not known was possible when the process began. Mr. Archibong said he enjoyed that mentoring. “A lot of times, I got the feeling that Philippe was sending me on missions to make me keep trying, even though he knew what the thing to do was,” he said. “He was teaching me how to design a watch through the process of designing this watch.” Much of La Galop’s personality is communicated through its Arabic numerals, which taper in size with the case. They were designed by Vincent Sauvaire, a young typographer who also graduated from the Lausanne school and previously worked with Vacheron Constantin. “The perspective of the numbers getting smaller is to keep that zoom feeling going and have everything flowing in a direction,” Mr. Archibong said. At its introduction, La Galop was presented in either steel or rose gold, with a diamond-set option and a time-only battery-powered quartz movement. Prices start at $3,650. “The essence of the watch is in its simplicity and in that sense, it needs to tell the time,” Mr. Archibong said when asked if he would like the range to be extended. “What it offers to the wearer isn’t really about the mechanical part of it. It’s about purity and being a window into the house of Hermès.” Mr. Archibong, who was wearing a Slim d’Hermès watch during the interview, said he wore the Galop as one of a number of accessories on his wrist. “The size is perfect for being on the verge of large for a woman’s wrist so it’s a powerful statement, and then also large enough to be the size of a vintage watch on a man’s wrist,” he said. “People describe a lot of my work as feminine,” he said. “What they actually see is a certain amount of delicacy in it, but there’s also strength. The interplay of delicacy and strength is what makes things have feminine energy.”",The New York Times
2019,A High-Level Resignation in Iran Is Seen as Sign of Hard-Liners’ Strength,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The surprise resignation of Iran’s foreign minister last week was a rare public display of the jockeying between hard-liners and the more moderate camp within the clerical leadership, a divide that has been exacerbated by the country’s deepening economic crisis, analysts said. Hard-liners have long had the edge. But Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s open show of frustration was a sign that he and his ally, President Hassan Rouhani, find themselves further weakened after the collapse of their biggest foreign policy project — the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers. The further empowerment of the hard-liners could presage even more tense relations with the United States and worsen Iran’s economic crisis, fueling instability. “Since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Zarif is suffering,” said Talal Atrissi, a sociology professor at the Lebanese University in Beirut who studies Iran and its regional allies. The foreign minister, he said, “strongly believed in dialogue and negotiations with U.S., but the cancellation of the deal showed that the strategy that Zarif was following wasn’t correct.” At issue is which camp within the clerical leadership has more clout in foreign affairs. Under Mr. Zarif, the foreign ministry has advocated greater engagement with the West as the key to Iran’s future, a view opposed by hard-liners who see the West as an irredeemable enemy that must be challenged. Competition between the two camps has grown since President Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, setting off steep inflation and a rise in unemployment. Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, met with Mr. Zarif last month before his resignation and said he seemed frustrated that initiatives that he cared about appeared blocked. That frustration boiled over last week, when he was not informed of a state visit by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria until it was over. “I think he was looking for a pretext and I think the way he was treated with the Assad visit was quite insulting for any foreign minister,” Mr. Vaez said. “This was the last straw for Zarif. It was an emotional reaction.” The president rejected Mr. Zarif’s resignation, leaving the foreign minister in his post for now. But the issue cropped up again on Tuesday when a foreign ministry spokesman said the resignation had been intended to protest the sidelining of “the diplomatic system.” Mr. Assad, making the first visit by one of Iran’s closest Arab allies in nine years, was granted an audience with the hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — the most powerful figure in the country. Another leading hard-liner, Qassem Soleimani, was also in the room. He is the head of the Quds Force, the foreign branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr. Zarif resigned soon after in a lyrical post on his Instagram account, apologizing “for all the shortcomings during my service.” In rejecting the resignation, President Rouhani said it was “against national interests” and hailed Mr. Zarif as a “trustworthy, brave and religious” person. General Soleimani also issued a rare statement saying Mr. Zarif’s absence had been because of a “bureaucratic” mistake. That appeared to put the issue to rest until Tuesday, when the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said that the ministry had no knowledge of Mr. Assad’s trip until it was over. Among the reasons for Mr. Zarif’s resignation was “this type of lack of coordination,” Mr. Qassemi said, adding that the move was intended as “a positive effort to return the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic system of the country to its main place,” according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency. Mr. Zarif and General Soleimani represent two different streams in Iranian foreign policy that often overlap but sometimes compete. Mr. Zarif was educated in the United States, speaks fluent English, served as the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations and regularly appears at international conferences to defend his country and its policies. He has pushed for greater ties with the West and was one of the main architects of the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement was a blow to relative moderates like Mr. Zarif and Mr. Rouhani. But Mr. Zarif has worked to maintain as much of the deal as possible with Europe while also advocating moves that would give Iran greater access to the international financial system, efforts that now appear to be in jeopardy. General Soleimani has long been a shadowy figure in charge of Iran’s often secretive military operations abroad. These include maintaining ties with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party, and other militias in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. General Soleiman’s star has risen as Iran has exploited the chaos that followed the Arab Spring uprisings to expand its influence. Photos of the silver-haired general now pop up regularly on social media, showing him visiting Iranian-aligned forces in different conflicts across the Middle East. Iran and the militias it backs played a critical role in helping Mr. Assad turn the tide against rebels seeking to oust him in the early years of Syria’s civil war. And General Soleimani visited Russia in the summer of 2015, before Russia also intervened militarily in the war, leading to a string of rebel defeats and strengthening ties between Russia and Iran. The inner workings of Iran’s government are often opaque. Some analysts suspected that Mr. Zarif’s resignation was a gambit to strengthen his position by forcing public endorsements from the country’s other top power brokers. But those statements of support are unlikely to restore Mr. Zarif’s clout on key foreign issues, said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy. And Mr. Zarif’s move has little chance of meaningfully improving his ministry’s stature in foreign policy decision-making — especially in Syria, which has long been outside of the diplomats’ remit, he said. While the office of the foreign minister has never been very powerful in Iran, it is less likely to be so during a time of multiple crises, said Karim Sadjadpour, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies Iran. “As long as the Islamic Republic is faced with internal and external insecurity, the security forces of the country will be in the driver’s seat, not civilians,” Mr. Sadjadpour said.",The New York Times

AMERICA’S JEWISH WOMEN A History From Colonial Times to Today By Pamela S. Nadell Considering that the very definition of Judaism and what it means to be a Jew has changed so much over the last three centuries of American history, it’s a near impossible endeavor — yeoman’s work — to capture succinctly the role of Jewish women over that long span. But that is the task that Pamela S. Nadell has set for herself in “America’s Jewish Women”: summarizing what cannot really be summarized. She’s mostly successful. Nadell is clearly aware of the magnitude of the job. In her prologue, she sets the stage for her analysis by introducing Grace Mendes Seixas Nathan and her great-granddaughter, the famed author of “The New Colossus,” Emma Lazarus. Nadell does so in order to make a point: While both were Jewish American women, they lived in dramatically different eras, self-actualizing and contributing differently as a result. They were constrained by the mores of their times and sought to redefine the roles handed down to them, just as Jewish women have done throughout American history, Nadell argues. The book proceeds chronologically and is stronger in some time periods than others. Nadell’s recounting of the colonial era, for example, is fuzzy. She muses about the life of Rachel Hendricks Samuel, widow to New York’s Judah Samuel as of 1702, wondering if the woman could read a prayer book. “That is doubtful,” she concludes. “But perhaps in her short life — she was probably 42 when she died — she had prayed over candles kindled in her two brass candlesticks, as commanded of Jewish women on Sabbaths and holiday eves.” Much of this section is replete with similar conjecture, which makes sense. After all, at this point, Jewish women tended to spend most of their adult lives being pregnant, nursing, caring for children or some combination thereof. None of these pastimes lend themselves particularly well to quiet contemplation, or to crafting long written musings. Unresolved elements of the history, like the absence of a Jewish ritual bath, or mikvah, in New York until 1730 and in Philadelphia until 1786 are raised, but not adequately addressed. The subject matter comes into sharper focus, and the book gains in speed and strength, in the next century. In 1840 there were 15,000 Jews living in America, Nadell writes, but by 1880 there were 250,000 — and at the turn of the century, approximately 2.5 million Jews came to America, nearly half of them women. Nadell hits her stride in her examination of Jewish women from 1840 to 1940, where she clearly and compellingly lays out the impact they had on American workers’ rights, education and political protest. Painting a vivid picture of a golden land that often defaulted on its promises, Nadell creates an extremely readable portrait of Jewish women collectively realizing their power to change their destiny — whether through creating charitable organizations or joining forces in the broader workers’ movement. It’s especially pleasurable to hear stories of Jewish activism around the battle for women’s suffrage and the availability of birth control — both of which gave American women as a whole more agency and capacity for self-determination. As The Forward reported during the age of labor strikes, Jewish women were “the fighters, the picketers, the agitators” of the age — badges that many of us would still wear proudly today. Nadell examines how World War II and anti-Semitism spurred on American Zionist activism (which could easily be the subject of its own book). From Betty Friedan to Sonia Pressman, Bella Abzug and Gerda Lerner, Jewish women had an outsize role in the feminist struggle. As the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously quipped: “What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the garment district and a Supreme Court justice? One generation.” And, I would add, Jewish women realizing the power of their voices, intellects and ambitions. Unfortunately the influence of Jewish women on the arts and entertainment doesn’t receive as much airtime. (The nonpareil entertainment icon Barbra Streisand only gets a one-line mention in the context of “Yentl” as “an American Jewish feminist filmmaker” — a shande!) “America’s Jewish Women” is a thoughtful history of a group of diverse, passionate, contemplative, vocal and dynamic women, and is a welcome addition to the American historical canon. It’s truly remarkable to read this book and appreciate how these women — numerically small, qualitatively great — made such a tremendous impact on this nation.",The New York Times
2019,"A History of College Admissions Schemes, From Encoded Pencils to Paid Stand-Ins","College admissions scandals have run the gamut through the years. In one, expert test takers in New York memorized the answers and phoned them to people taking the exam hours later in Los Angeles. Fifty people were charged this week with taking part in a nationwide scheme to game the process of admission to highly competitive schools. While federal authorities say that this is the largest prosecution of its kind in history, it is far from the first. Here’s a look back at five other times manipulation of the admissions process caused a scandal: It was an ingenious and audacious idea: pay expert test takers to memorize answers in New York and then phone them to Los Angeles and Chicago, where the tests had not been taken yet. The answers were then carved in code on the sides of pencils being used to take the same tests, the Graduate Management Admission Test, the Graduate Record Exam, and the Test of English as a Foreign Language. Between 1992 and 1996, several hundred people took advantage of the time differences, paying between $2,000 and $9,000, depending on how high the desired score was. The students were flown or driven to test centers, where they were given pencils with the coded answers. Hundreds of students received high scores and were admitted to graduate schools around the country, prosecutors said. The mastermind of the scheme, Po Chieng Ma, was sentenced in 1998 to four years in prison. Columbia University, New York University, Fordham University and Hunter College, all in New York, were among the schools receiving fraudulent scores, the indictment said. “This obsession with test scores, as indicated by this case, underscores the importance of getting a fuller picture of candidates than can be gleaned from just looking at standardized tests,” said George E. Rupp, the president of Columbia at the time. Twenty students were arrested on Long Island in 2011 for accepting payment or paying others to take the SAT and ACT between 2008-11. Administrators at Great Neck North High School began an inquiry after a student confided to a college counselor that someone was accepting money to take the SAT for other students. They decided to focus on students who had registered to take the tests outside the district and also compared SAT scores with student grade-point averages. Some of the widest discrepancies were with students who chose to take the test off-site, where they would not be recognized. The test takers used fake identification cards. The group of 20 were from five schools: Five of them were suspected of taking tests for others and the other 15 were accused of paying them $500 to $3,600 to take the tests. Students who signed up could pay in installments. One of the test takers was Samuel Eshaghoff, a graduate of Great Neck North, who even took tests for girls. “I thought that there was an easy way to make money,” he said later on “60 Minutes.” “And just like any other easy way to make money, it’s always too good to be true.” The scheme prompted a requirement that students provide a photograph when they sign up for college entrance exams, and that officials check those images against the test takers’ ID. T.M. Landry, a small school in small-town Louisiana, had gained national attention for sending its underprivileged black students to elite colleges, including Yale, Brown, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell and Wesleyan. It produced its first graduating class in 2013. But The New York Times reported last year that the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and trafficked in the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture Cinderella stories. The Landrys, the husband-and-wife team that led the school, were also accused of physical and emotional abuse by students and teachers. One student interviewed said that he did not know that the school had lied on his behalf, while others were told to lie on their applications. While some Landry graduates were successful, others had to withdraw from college, or transfer to less rigorous programs because of a lack of preparation. The Landrys denied fabricating student stories, and the school is still operating. While it is no surprise that admissions offices have ways for top administrators and prominent alumni to signal their interest in applicants, a Chicago Tribune investigation in 2009 revealed a “clout list” of those who got special consideration because of political connections. The scheme was known internally as Category I, and The Tribune said that 800 applicants won spots at the flagship Urbana-Champaign campus after intervention from state lawmakers and university trustees. The newspaper said the students were admitted even though some did not meet the university’s admission standards. A state commission’s inquiry concluded that Category I was a sophisticated shadow admissions process for applicants who were supported by politicians, donors and other prominent sponsors. According to internal documents and email messages released to the panel, university officials fretted about the university’s decline in national rankings as a result of admitting unqualified students, even as they encouraged the special treatment. The university’s president and the chancellor of the flagship campus, as well as a majority of the members of the university’s board, resigned after the commission’s report. On the day in June 1989 that 80,000 high school students in New York were to take a state-administered chemistry exam, The New York Post published the answers to the stolen test on its front page. The Post said that it published the answer key to the multiple-choice test after learning that thousands of photocopies of the answers had been illegally sold to students in New York City. The test is one of the many state-sponsored Regents examinations, whose results are a factor in course grades and college admissions. State education officials said that the answer sheet on the front page appeared to have been sent by fax in the morning to students in upstate New York. In addition to chemistry, other stolen tests included those for United States history, global studies and 10th-grade mathematics. It was only the second time in the 111-year history of the Regents that an exam had been canceled, The Times reported. The Post’s editor at the time, Jerry Nachman, said that the front page showed the pervasive corruption surrounding the test. “These weren’t the Pentagon papers,” he said of the 56-question answer key. “What made the story was not the uniqueness of the documents, but their omnipresence.”",The New York Times
2019,"A History of the Iberian Peninsula, as Told by Its Skeletons","matter With an analysis of DNA from nearly 300 fossilized remains, scientists are peering into human prehistory in the region. For thousands of years, the Iberian Peninsula — home now to Spain and Portugal — has served as a crossroads. Phoenicians from the Near East built trading ports there 3,000 years ago, and Romans conquered the region around 200 B.C. Muslim armies sailed from North Africa and took control of Iberia in the 8th century A.D. Some three centuries later, they began losing territory to Christian states. Along with historical records and archaeological digs, researchers now have a new lens on Iberia’s past: DNA preserved in the region’s ancient skeletons. Archaeologists and geneticists are extracting genetic material spanning not just Iberia’s written history but its prehistory, too. “We wanted to bridge the ancient populations and the modern populations,” said Iñigo Olalde, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Olalde is the lead author of a paper published on Thursday in Science that analyzes the DNA of 271 ancient Iberians. In recent years, scientists have created similar chronologies for entire continents, based on hundreds of samples of ancient DNA. Now researchers are starting to narrow their focus to smaller regions. With a total of 419 ancient human genomes obtained by various laboratories, Iberia offers a rich trove. Scientists have recovered only 174 ancient genomes in Britain, and just eight in Japan. This dense record shows that Iberia’s genetic profile changed markedly in response to major events in history, such as the Roman conquest. But researchers have also uncovered evidence of migrations that were previously unknown. Iberia, it now seems, was a crossroads long before recorded history, as far back as the last ice age. The oldest known human DNA in Iberia comes from a 19,000-year-old skeleton found in 2010 in a cave called El Mirón, in northern Spain. The skeleton belonged to a woman, a member of a band of Ice Age hunter-gatherers. People in Iberia continued to live as hunter-gatherers for thousands of years after that, long after the end of the Ice Age. Dr. Olalde and his colleagues analyzed DNA from four additional hunter-gatherers, while a separate team, based at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, extracted DNA from 10 more. Both teams obtained the same striking result: Iberian hunter-gatherers had a remarkable mix of genes, showing that they descended from two profoundly distinct groups of early European hunter-gatherers. One of these groups can be traced as far back as 35,000 years, thanks to a skeleton discovered at a site in Belgium called Goyet. The Goyet-related people spread across Europe, only to be replaced on much of the continent near the end of the Ice Age by a genetically distinct population. The earliest sign of the second group appears 14,000 years ago, known to researchers by DNA in a skeleton at an Italian site called Villabruna. But in Iberia, the new studies find, the Goyet and Villabruna people coexisted. Hunter-gatherers across the peninsula had a mixture of ancestry from the two peoples. “This is quite amazing, because it’s not happening in other areas,” said Vanessa Villalba-Mouco, the lead author of the Max Planck study, published in Current Biology. Ms. Villalba-Mouco speculated that the geography of Iberia — located in a far corner of Europe — may have allowed the Goyet people to endure there after they disappeared elsewhere. “Maybe nobody was bothering these hunter-gatherers,” she said. But whatever solitude Iberia might have offered came to an end about 7,500 years ago, when new people arrived with crops and livestock. These first farmers, originally from Anatolia, brought with them a distinctive genetic signature. After their arrival, the genetic makeup of Iberians changed dramatically. Ninety percent of the DNA from the later skeletons derives from the Anatolian farmers; 10 percent comes from the hunter-gatherers. But this shift was not a simple story of an older population replaced by a newer one. Starting about 6,000 years ago, Dr. Olalde and his colleagues found, hunter-gatherer ancestry in Iberian farmers actually increased to 20 percent. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] It’s possible that hunter-gatherers endured beyond the advent of farming. They may have taken up farming as well, and perhaps later the two cultures merged. For centuries afterward, the researchers found, there was little change in the genetic profile of Iberians. But there are hints of a few remarkable migrations. A skeleton from an elaborate grave in central Spain about 4,400 years old belonged to a man whose ancestry was 100 percent North African. “That’s crazy,” said David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of the paper in Science. “We double-checked it because it was so weird.” Another striking result emerged when the researchers studied the DNA from a 3,500-year-old woman. They concluded she had a North African grandparent. These findings suggest that people were moving into Iberia from Africa more than 3,000 years before the rise of the Roman Empire. “These are cosmopolitan places,” Dr. Reich said. About 4,500 years ago, still another wave of people arrived, profoundly altering the makeup of Iberia. A few centuries earlier, nomads from the steppes of what is now Russia turned up in Eastern Europe with horses and wagons. They spread across the continent, giving up nomadic life and intermarrying with European farmers. When they finally reached Iberia, these people spread out far and wide. “They really have an impact on the whole peninsula,” said Dr. Olalde. But skeletal DNA from that period is striking and puzzling. Over all, Bronze Age Iberians traced 40 percent of their ancestry to the newcomers. DNA from the men, however, all traced back to the steppes. The Y chromosomes from the male farmers disappeared from the gene pool. To archaeologists, the shift is a puzzle. “I cannot say what it is,” said Roberto Risch, an archaeologist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, who was not involved in the new studies. But he ruled out wars or massacres as the cause. “It’s not a particularly violent time,” he said. Instead, Dr. Risch suspects “a political process” is the explanation. In their archaeological digs, Dr. Risch and his colleagues have found that Iberian farmers originally lived in egalitarian societies, storing their wealth together and burying their dead in group graves. But over several centuries, palaces and fortresses began to rise, and power became concentrated in the hands of a few. Dr. Risch speculated that the cultural shift had something to do with the genetic shift found by Dr. Olalde and his colleagues. The Bronze Age in Iberia was followed by the Iron Age about 2,800 years ago. In skeletons from this period, Dr. Olalde and his colleagues found clues of more arrivals. Iron Age Iberians could trace some of their ancestry to new waves of people arriving from northern and Central Europe, possibly marking the rise of so-called Celtiberian culture on the peninsula. In addition, the scientists found a growing amount of North African ancestry in skeletons from the Iron Age. That may reflect trade around the Mediterranean, which brought North Africans to Iberian towns, where they settled down. North African ancestry increased in Iberia even more after Romans took control. Now the peninsula was part of an empire that thrived on widespread trade. At the same time, people from southern Europe and the Near East also began leaving an imprint. This shift in ancestry could explain one of the biggest mysteries in Iberian history. Researchers have long puzzled over the distinctive culture of the Basque region in northern Spain. The Basque speak a language that is unrelated to other European tongues. Some researchers have speculated that they descended from a population that had been distinct since the Bronze Age or earlier. Genetically, at least, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Before the Roman era, the Basque had DNA that was indistinguishable from that of other Iron Age Iberians. But Roman genes did not flow into Basque Country. After the fall of Rome, ancient DNA in Iberia reflects its medieval history. Skeletons from the Muslim era show growing ancestry from both North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Which brings us, just a millennium later, to the present. In February, Clare Bycroft of the Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford and her colleagues published a study of the DNA of 1,413 people in Spain. The team was able to identify pieces of North African DNA in people across Spain. The researchers estimated that the subjects’ North African ancestors lived about 800 years ago, during Muslim rule. The researchers were also able to group Spaniards into five genetic clusters. On a map, these groups form five strips running north to south. Those strips line up neatly with history. At the height of the Muslim rule, a few small Christian states survived on the northern coast of Spain. As Muslims lost power, those states expanded their southern borders, starting roughly 900 years ago. Up until now, wide swaths of time typically separated genetic studies of living people and those of ancient DNA. But now, in places like Iberia, the gaps are being filled in, creating an unbroken genetic chronology. “The two worlds are starting to merge,” said Dr. Bycroft.",The New York Times
2019,A Hollywood Colorist Who Transforms Madonna and Kanye West’s Hair,"Up Next Daniel Moon treats hair like a canvas waiting to be painted. Name: Daniel Moon Age: 39 Hometown: Pasadena, Calif. Now lives: in a loft in downtown Los Angeles that he shares with his girlfriend. Claim to fame: Mr. Moon is something of a mad scientist of hair coloring, dyeing the heads of Kanye West, Miley Cyrus and Madonna in expressionistic rainbow hues that look painterly. He was once called “the leader of the hair graffiti color cult,” by i-D magazine. “I created my own freehand style where showcasing crazy colors in a high-end way makes it more like art,” Mr. Moon said. “Madonna once said to me, ‘Oh, Danny, I feel like a Basquiat right now, the way you’re coloring my hair.’” Big break: In high school, he bleached his wrestling teammates’ hair as a way to stand out during tournaments. But he didn’t get serious about hair dyeing until the joined the Marines when he was 18. “My girlfriend would send me pictures of her changing her hair week after week while I was on a base in Okinawa with nothing but male Marines,” he said. “There were four girls on the island, so, yes, I wanted to be a hairdresser.” He left the military in 2001 and returned to Los Angeles, where he apprenticed at several high-end Beverly Hills salons. He eventually landed a chair at Andy LeCompte’s studio, where he worked from 2008 to 2016. “I was surrounded by the best of the best,” Mr. Moon said. “Andy introduced me to off-the-wall techniques I had never seen before.” Latest project: Mr. Moon opened his own salon, Hair Los Angeles, in the downtown Arts District last year. The minimalist white space is decorated with his photography and art collection, along with his line of plastic aprons, cutting capes and glitter hair gel. “Because my work is often identified as art, people just thought my salon was a gallery or something,” he said. Next thing: Being an outré Hollywood colorist means that he is subject to the whims of his high-profile clients, whether that means turning Katy Perry’s hair a shade of “muppet-referenced, sherbet-pink orange” or providing Zoe Kravitz a “blond moment that will withstand the history of time” for Allure magazine. “Everybody is in a really good head space when I show up,” he said. “They’re like, ‘All right, dude, what you got?’” For those looking to parrot his kaleidoscopic touch at home, Mr. Moon plans to sell his own line of hair color products later this year. Moon man: His Instagram followers know him by his nickname, Major Moon. He said the stage name of sorts is a play on “the color world, the Bowie world and the intergalactic world” of his creative practice and his military past. “It goes both ways,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"A Jewelry Designer’s Opals, Illustrated","Of a Kind Victoire de Castellane, the Paris-based creative director for Dior fine jewelry, remembers the moment that opals, which are formed from silica in fissures of rocks, first captivated her. At age 6, she spied a “magical ring” on the finger of her grandmother, the aristocratic Silvia Rodríguez de Rivas, which turned out to be a black opal surrounded by diamonds — a gift from the heiress Barbara Hutton. De Castellane has been collecting the stones since 1995, mostly from Australia, where many of the world’s best opals are found. In their surfaces, she sees “nature and the sea.” Now celebrating the 20th anniversary of her first jewelry line for Dior, de Castellane has dozens of opal pendants, rings and bracelets in her personal collection; some are her own design, others are vintage pieces. She wears them with everything from her signature Alaïa flared dresses to Liberty prints. “They’re like something out of a fantasy, like my own personal treasure,” she says — stones for all seasons. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting.

They’re a mix of Australian and Ethiopian stones.” Ethiopian pinfire opal ring. “I bought this in Venice in 2015. The transparency of Ethiopian opals looks like water lit with fluorescent lights.” Opal bracelet. “I love to embellish the black opal’s natural colors with lacquer, as I did here with the silver and gold leaf. I wear it with black, which makes it resemble an écrin, a jewelry box.” Bracelet with three Australian black opals and diamonds. “These are among the first stones I acquired, from an opal hunter in Coober Pedy, a very obscure part of the Australian outback. I especially love black opals, which aren’t really black, just dark.” Australian boulder opal bracelet. “This stone reminds me of the Mediterranean, where I spent summers as a child. At home, I keep my opals in a box with a glass of water, which prevents them from drying out.” An earlier version of this article misstated how Victoire de Castellane stores her opals. She keeps them in a box with a glass of water, not in a glass of water.",The New York Times
2019,A Jewish Cemetery in Missouri Was Vandalized and Repaired. Now a Man Has Been Sentenced.,"It took only a few months to repair the vandalism at a Jewish cemetery near St. Louis in 2017. But finding and then sentencing the man who did it took years. The man, Alzado M. Harris, 35, was sentenced to three years of probation in St. Louis County Circuit Court on Thursday for toppling 154 headstones in the cemetery in University City, Mo., in February 2017, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney’s office, Josi Nielsen, said on Monday. Earlier this month, Mr. Harris pleaded guilty to felony charges of institutional vandalism, according to court records. He must also pay $5,000 in restitution, maintain full-time work and take an anger management course, the records show. “We are grateful that the case has been solved, and resolved,” Anita Feigenbaum, the executive director of the cemetery, Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, said in an interview on Monday. On the morning of Feb. 20, 2017, the headstones were found pushed over and disembodied from their foundations at the cemetery in University City, which has a population of about 35,000. The cemetery is more than 100 years old, and Ms. Feigenbaum said the headstones had been made of marble, granite and other materials and hand-carved with English, Hebrew or Yiddish. The authorities scanned video surveillance, but it did not cover the southeast corner of the cemetery, where the headstones had been overturned, she said. They also examined DNA from a jacket that was discovered under a toppled headstone, said Ms. Feigenbaum, who was kept informed as the investigation progressed. The DNA led to Mr. Harris after investigators matched samples on the jacket with a sample obtained from his previous criminal record profile, authorities told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2018. The authorities said Mr. Harris was drunk and angry when he did it, the newspaper reported. The police department and Mr. Harris’s lawyer did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday. The vandalism in 2017 came amid a series of anti-Semitic attacks, bomb threats and other acts of vandalism against Jewish centers across the country, sending ripples of concern throughout the Jewish community. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been prepared to join the investigation if it turned out to have involved a possible federal civil rights violation, a spokeswoman for the bureau, Rebecca Wu, said on Monday. But “no information came to light suggesting” a potential violation, Ms. Wu said in an email. In the first two months of 2017 before the University City vandalism, at least 53 Jewish community centers around the country had received bomb threats, including centers in Albuquerque; Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; Milwaukee; and Wilmington, Del., according to the J.C.C. Association of North America at the time. Some of them had reported being repeatedly threatened. Reports at the time included swastika graffiti found on some college campuses as well as the New York City subway, according to a report in The Times that year. “He was not motivated by hate, but the incident had impact as if he was,” the Anti-Defamation League of St. Louis said in a statement last year, commending the investigation that led to Mr. Harris’s arrest. A week after the vandalism in Missouri, the police in Philadelphia found about 100 toppled headstones at the Mount Carmel Jewish Cemetery there. The Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, which began accepting burials in 1893, was founded by Russian immigrants whose aim was to give Jews access to a proper burial no matter their financial means, Ms. Feigenbaum said. There are now about 22,500 plots. Cemetery administration officials got wind on Feb. 19, 2017, that something was amiss, she said, when visitors reported seeing some overturned headstones. The news alone was not so startling — tree branches, bad weather or storms can affect plots in a cemetery. But the next day, the groundskeeper went out to explore, Ms. Feigenbaum said, and found headstone after headstone upended. The damage was not scattered, such as might be seen after a storm. The groundskeeper contacted Ms. Feigenbaum, she said. “At first he was like: ‘No, there are more than 50 down. It was no weather. Something happened,’” Ms. Feigenbaum said. “I called the police even before I got there.” “It wasn’t like one here, one there,” she said. “It was condensed in one area, so it had a significant impact. It looked deliberate.” Survivors of relatives buried in the cemetery searched the grounds, clutching slips of paper describing where relatives were buried to see if their plots were affected. Ms. Feigenbaum said the authorities told her that Mr. Harris had squeezed in through a chained gate. Video surveillance failed to cover the spot. The Jewish community swung into action to repair the headstones, she said. That meant trying to track down families and survivors, both in the United States and other countries, which was a search complicated by scope, generations and time. Many of the headstones marked graves from the 1920s through 1940s, she said. They were also obligated under Jewish law to replace the headstones with exact replicas. “Being an Orthodox Jewish cemetery, we have to adhere to Jewish law as well,” she said. “If you can’t find the family, you have to replace it with the exact same, or better.” Muslim and Christian communities raised funds, she said. Schoolchildren painted small rocks, which in Jewish tradition are placed on or near headstones as markers. There were organized vigils and cleanups. The plots were repaired before the summer of 2017, she said. “It really affects every religion and every single person,” Ms. Feigenbaum said. “Everybody has somebody who passed away. It happened to hit a Jewish cemetery at a time of possible and increasing attacks out there. That is why you saw communities coming out.”",The New York Times
2019,A Jewish Councilman Who Said ‘Palestine Does Not Exist’ Loses Seat on Immigration Committee,"[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] New York City, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, has often served as a proxy battleground for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mayors — dating back from Robert F. Wagner, who in 1957 barred a welcome for a Saudi king he deemed anti-Jewish, to Bill de Blasio, who in 2015 canceled a plan to meet Palestinians in the occupied West Bank — have been forced to confront the highly charged issue. But as more Palestinian immigrants have settled in New York, the political calculus has grown slightly more complicated, as seen last week, when Kalman Yeger, a Brooklyn councilman who represents the Orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park, took to Twitter on Wednesday to state that “Palestine does not exist.” Mr. Yeger’s remarks came after Zainab Iqbal, a journalist for Bklyner, reported that Mr. Yeger had referred to “so-called Palestinians” in a tweet. He responded by calling Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota anti-Semitic. The councilman’s pronouncements led to a cascade of criticism calling his comments “hateful” and “Islamophobic,” and prompted demands for an apology and his removal from the City Council’s immigration committee. The latest such call came from Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said on Friday that if Mr. Yeger is “not going to apologize, he shouldn’t be on that committee.” According to the United Nations, 137 states bilaterally recognize Palestine. On Monday, the City Council’s leadership team met for more than an hour and decided to remove Mr. Yeger from the immigration committee, The New York Times has learned. There was “broad consensus” that Mr. Yeger’s views were inconsistent with the committee’s mission, participants said. “I do not believe that someone who engages in the type of rhetoric we heard from Council Member Yeger belongs on the immigration committee, which is supposed to welcome and support immigrants in our city,” Corey Johnson, the Council’s speaker, said in a statement. Mr. Yeger could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening. He had been unapologetic about his comments during a news conference on Thursday. “There is no state by that name. There is no place by that name. That’s a fact. I didn’t make it up, I didn’t invent it,” Mr. Yeger said on Thursday. When the news came out on Monday, Mr. Yeger, on Twitter, cited an editorial from The New York Daily News to defend his comments as free speech. Linda Sarsour, a New York City-based Palestinian-American activist, applauded his removal from the Council committee. “This sends a wider message that saying anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian things comes with consequences,” Ms. Sarsour said. The dismissal came as a diverse coalition of Palestinian, Jewish, immigrant and civil rights groups announced it was planning a protest on City Hall’s steps later this week. Mr. de Blasio agreed with the decision. “It’s important for people to understand that everyone is valued,” the mayor said in an interview on Monday with NY1’s Errol Louis. Mr. Yeger is the second member of the City Council in recent memory to lose a committee assignment after making comments deemed unacceptable. The committee on for-hire vehicles was eliminated in February after its chairman, Ruben Diaz Sr., a councilman from the Bronx, said the “homosexual community” controlled the Council. The City Council’s Committee on Rules, Privileges and Elections will have to vote to remove Mr. Yeger from the committee and then two-thirds of all Council members will have to approve the removal at next week’s meeting. But the decision has broad support, according to Mr. Johnson. “He is being removed from the Immigration Committee,” Mr. Johnson said in his statement. Mr. Yeger’s earlier remarks led to a small protest by pro-Palestinian groups outside his office in Borough Park, which was met with a much larger counterprotest from Mr. Yeger’s supporters, including one incident where a protester asked a Muslim woman whether her young daughter had “any bombs on her to blow us up.” Ms. Sarsour also found herself caught up in the controversy when her name was used to draw counterprotesters to Mr. Yeger’s office. “This is a lot more complicated than a councilman makes a comment,” Ms. Sarsour said. “It’s on a deeper level and represents a bubbling up of longstanding conflicts around the Palestinian and Israeli conflict.” Indeed, the city’s politics have frequently been roiled by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1966, Mayor John V. Lindsay canceled a dinner for a Saudi king who said that any friends of Israel were his enemies. Mayor Abraham D. Beame rescinded giving Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, a key to the city after a United Nations committee labeled Zionism a form of racial discrimination. Mayor Edward I. Koch had an argument at City Hall with the Austrian foreign minister in 1984 about whether the Palestine Liberation Organization served as the voice of Palestinian people. Mayor David N. Dinkins took criticism from his black constituents for not scheduling any meetings with Palestinians during a 1991 trip to Israel. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expelled Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, from a concert for world leaders at Lincoln Center. And in 2016, the City Council passed a resolution condemning the call for a boycott of Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. The reaction to Mr. Yeger’s remarks suggests that things are changing. Mr. Johnson had called Mr. Yeger’s remarks “dehumanizing” during a news conference on Thursday. The mayor, who is considering a run for president, has come under criticism recently for speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, even as other declared Democratic presidential candidates declined to do so this year. And some saw Mr. de Blasio’s initial response to Mr. Yeger’s comments as inadequate, especially given the strong criticism of Representative Omar’s remarks about Israel. The mayor sought to fortify his comments on Friday during his weekly radio appearance on “The Brian Lehrer Show” on WNYC: “I made very clear that there has to be a Palestinian homeland,” said Mr. de Blasio, who went on to call Mr. Yeger’s comments “destructive and divisive.” Dov Hikind, a former assemblyman from Brooklyn who helped organize the counterprotest outside of Mr. Yeger’s office, was disheartened by the criticism of Mr. Yeger. “Progressive Democrats, liberals, have unfortunately moved away from the kind of support for Israel that we are used to,” said Mr. Hikind, who said he saw nothing wrong with Mr. Yeger’s remarks. “Are there Palestinians? Yes, of course. Palestine doesn’t exist,” said Mr. Hikind. “It may exist in the future if the Israelis and Palestinians come to an agreement. ” Mr. Hikind characterized the person who made the bomb remark to the young Muslim woman as an individual who said “terrible things,” but who did not represent the majority of counterprotesters. Ms. Sarsour and Mr. Hikind do agree that the unequivocal political support for Israel that used to exist in New York among the city’s politicians is no more. The response to Mr. Yeger’s comments prove that, she said. “It’s been a long time coming for elected officials to say anti-Palestinian things with any sort of consequences,” Ms. Sarsour said. “We are in a new era.” Opinion",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Jobs Bill That Helps Train Workers,"letter Senators Tim Kaine and Rob Portman take issue with an Upshot column that criticizes their bill. To the Editor: Re “A Well-Meaning Job Training Bill That May Hurt More Than Help,” by Kevin Carey (The Upshot, nytimes.com, March 1): Mr. Carey tries to discredit our Jobs Act, a bill to expand Pell grants to short-term credentialing programs. Responding to the 86 percent of voters who support making federal financial aid available for job training, the Jobs Act would place people who don’t go to traditional college on a clear career path to employment. Mr. Carey’s greatest concern with the Jobs Act is a mistaken belief that short-term training programs don’t lead to higher wages. In fact, most studies show that they do. Even the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce report he cites concludes that “certificates have grown because they are affordable, usually take less than a year to complete, and often yield high returns in the job market.” Mr. Carey also stokes fear that Pell grants under the Jobs Act would go toward shoddy, low-quality programs. But most certificate programs are offered by nonprofit institutions like community colleges, which are accredited and regulated for quality. Mr. Carey’s criticism should call us to reform Pell grants, not shun job training. In fact, America’s public community colleges are the biggest supporters of our bill. States like Virginia and Ohio have demonstrated that you can support short-term credentials and ensure quality and positive outcomes for workers and employers. We have been big supporters of America’s colleges and universities. But some Americans feel alienated by a federal higher education policy that communicates one thing: If you aspire to anything but a four-year degree, we will not support you. Calling skills-training programs ineffective does little to change this perception.

2019,A Kushner Is an N.B.A. Owner,"Joshua Kushner, the venture capitalist whose older brother is President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, became a minority shareholder of the N.B.A.’s Memphis Grizzlies earlier this season, according to four people familiar with the matter. Jesse Derris, a spokesman for Joshua Kushner, confirmed the purchase, as did a spokesman for the N.B.A. “Brandon Arrindell and Joshua Kushner recently, in their respective individual capacities, purchased minority stakes in the Grizzlies,” said a team spokesman in a statement. Kushner, 33, agreed with Grizzlies owner Robert Pera to purchase a share of the team as a limited partner in late 2018, according to two of the people, who weren’t authorized to discuss the partnership publicly. The transaction closed at the end of February. Neither Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, nor his father, Charles, who spent 14 months in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering, is involved in the Grizzlies, according to the people. However, Joshua Kushner’s wealth can be traced to his family’s real estate fortune, which funded other investments he has made. Members of the Kushner family have previously lodged unsuccessful bids to buy the Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Nets when the team was in New Jersey. According to The Daily Memphian, which first reported the agreement, Brandon Arrindell, a principal at a Memphis investment management firm, also purchased a stake in the team. The Kushner investment comes at a time when the relationship between top N.B.A. players and the White House is increasingly tense. No N.B.A. team has visited the White House since Trump became president. The N.B.A. superstars LeBron James and Stephen Curry have engaged in public spats with Trump; James has referred to him as “a bum.” Joshua Kushner’s politics are very different from his brother’s. Joshua Kushner is a lifelong Democrat and said he did not vote for Trump in 2016. He participated in both the first Women’s March and the March for Our Lives protests. The Kushners, especially Jared, have close ties to N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver. Silver attends sporting events with Jared Kushner, he told The New Yorker, and Kushner advised the N.B.A. on a real estate search. Kushner, who owned The New York Observer before selling it to his family’s trust, also once ordered the deletion of a benign article about Silver purchasing a new apartment, according to BuzzFeed. Joshua Kushner is a mainstay of the New York tech scene, founding the investment firm Thrive Capital, which has $2.5 billion under management, and cofounding Oscar Health, a health start-up. He was brought into the Grizzlies ownership group by Pera, who is also part of the New York tech scene. The deal stemmed from an unusual arrangement Pera had with previous limited partners of the Grizzlies. Pera agreed to purchase the Memphis Grizzlies from Michael Heisley in June 2012 for $377 million. Pera was 34, and made his wealth as the founder of Ubiquiti Networks, a New York-based wireless technology company. He founded Ubiquiti in 2005, and took it public in 2011. But Pera, despite holding a controlling interest in the Grizzlies, purchased only about 25 percent of the franchise and put up just $45 million of his own money, according to The Memphis Flyer. Pera put together a large ownership group to pay for the rest. Steve Kaplan, a Los Angeles investor, and Daniel Straus, the founder of multiple health care companies, each bought a stake worth roughly 14 percent, while a consortium of more than 20 local investors bought the rest. The agreement between Pera, Kaplan and Straus included an unusual buy-sell clause that allowed both Kaplan and Straus to exercise a right to purchase control of the team after five years. Once exercised, one or both of the limited partners could set a new valuation for the franchise. At that price, Pera had to either buy their shares or sell them his. In November 2017, both Kaplan and Straus triggered the clause. After negotiations between the three were unsuccessful, Pera announced in April 2018 that he would retain his majority ownership. ESPN reported he had bought his former partners out at a $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion valuation of the franchise. That meant Pera was forced to raise roughly $375 million — about the same amount the entire team was valued at in 2012 — to purchase the Straus and Kaplan shares. It seems he brought on minority investors to help shoulder that financial commitment. The Grizzlies have slumped to a record of 29-42 after a promising start and will miss the N.B.A. playoffs for the second consecutive season. In February, Memphis traded its former All-Star center Marc Gasol to Toronto and is widely expected to trade the last remaining link to the club’s playoff successes — Mike Conley — in the off-season.",The New York Times
2019,A Landscape Designer’s Wild Garden,"At her Long Island home, Deborah Nevins finds respite from the opulent environments she’s celebrated for creating. THE NEW YORK-BASED landscape designer Deborah Nevins spends much of her time taming profusion. Over her three-decade career, she has created gardens for Tommy Hilfiger, David Geffen and Michael Eisner — and almost nothing is out of bounds. Her carefully structured yet naturalistic environments are known for their subtle Blakeian radiance. In a collaboration with the Italian designer Renzo Piano’s firm for the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens, which was completed in 2016, she turned a 42-acre section of a former parking lot for the Olympics into a public green space with 1,500 olive, pine, almond and pomegranate trees interspersed with more than 300,000 perennials and shrubs, including Jerusalem sage and fragrant yellow-blooming coronilla; in the late 1980s, at the Southampton estate of the art collector Paul Walter, she installed roughly 140 feet of copper beech hedge and a pair of soaring cedars trimmed to look like Italian cypress that became as well-known as his accretion of late 19th-century photography and Indian miniature paintings. While contemporary landscape designers rarely have the name recognition of architects (as they did during the late 19th-century era that Edith Wharton conjures, when wealthy patrons were as obsessed with collecting plants as they were constructing mansions), Nevins is among the few who inspire reverence. Still, going all-out, as is her métier, can be enervating; it requires making constant, ambitious decisions, traveling frequently and meeting repeatedly with high-energy clients. When you are, like Nevins, contemplative and scholarly — she has a master’s degree in art history from Columbia University and only started a career making gardens after a decade of lecturing on landscape history at Barnard College and the Cooper Hewitt museum — it’s not difficult to believe you would want to spend your off hours in a simple place of your own, on a bench surrounded by a tall, squared-off hedge, cooking with herbs from your kitchen plot and savoring the tangy perfume of lemon trees in terra-cotta pots. So it’s hardly surprising that the 1,700-square-foot two-bedroom house Nevins had built for herself two decades ago on the East End of Long Island favors serenity over ostentation. The scrupulously plain two-story box with pitched roof and white cedar shingles is the locus of an understated two-acre spread that reflects Nevins’s nuanced personal style: rigorous yet unmannered, brainy but comforting. The garden, which incorporates mostly English traditions, including all-green rooms created from clipped hornbeam, is complemented by the house’s Nantucket-style simplicity. In the proportions and harmonies of the site, you can see traces of the legendary gardens that influence her work (but on a more human scale): the tension between formal and wild areas at St. Paul’s Walden Bury in Hertfordshire, the childhood country home of the Queen Mother; the tall trees of Hidcote, the early 20th-century Gloucestershire estate of the American banking heir and plantsman Lawrence Johnston; and the riotous bounty of Ninfa, created in the late 19th century by members of the noble Caetani family on the ruins of a medieval town in Lazio, Italy. EVEN IN THE PLANNING stages of Nevins’s home, the garden came first. When she purchased the land, it was largely overgrown, a tangled mass of trees and scrub. But once she cleared some brush, she discovered several stately old oaks and giant cedars; she built the house and gardens to maximize their impact while leaving the perimeter wild. Now, every way you look — down the paths, past the garden rooms and beds, beyond the exuberant rose bushes — your eye lands on one of those towering trees in the middle distance. “Your eye is relaxed but excited by seeing it all within a frame,” she says. Although Nevins is a Modernist, faithful to monochromatic structures in dialogue with architecture, she recognizes that contrast, balance and strategically deployed color are what make a garden as pleasurable as it is striking. Having collaborated over the years with both minimalists like Renzo Piano and maximalists including Gil Schafer, who specializes in traditional American homes that recall the horse farms of New York’s Hudson Valley, her own environment is an alchemically scaled series of discrete experiences, each section designed to evoke its own set of emotions. There is the subdued elegance of enclosures of privet and boxwood, a walk through bushy shrub roses, including striking white Mary Manners and pale pink-tinged Dupontii, paths through beds with tall spectacular flowering foxglove, linaria and hollyhock. The woodland beyond the borders of hedge has been tamed just enough to let sweet-scented mock orange and white cow parsley remain visible. Her garden also reflects a profound understanding of her own perfectionism, of how she prefers to live. For instance, many gardeners plant their showy flowering borders front and center, to be admired from the inside, whereas Nevins placed her perennials on the side of the house. “It would drive me crazy to look out and see them all the time, to know they need to be weeded,” she says. The flowers she chooses are never precious; rather, she favors species plants like the feathery Macleaya cordata, known as plume poppy, and the gangly, speckled-orange native swamp lily. She eschews as well most newly created dwarf hybrids that allow suburban gardeners to create tiny tableaus, instead embracing robust height in plants like Queen Anne’s lace and purple-magenta ironweed. And while the trend today at garden centers is for flamboyant, fuller flowers, which are often hybrids, she has chosen mostly single blooms, like the white Paeonia emodi, a peony with a sparse petal arrangement that is “more aesthetically pure,” Nevins says. Even the rarer plants she cultivates have a low-key grace, including a purple strain of Caryopteris divaricata, a four-foot-tall Himalayan native with a baroque curlicue violet flower that attracts legions of butterflies. Such purity resonates as well in the highly structured green-on-green areas of the garden, created from hornbeam, privet, boxwood and yew trees — a quilt of forest, hunter and jade. Nevins also uses sycamores, with their distinctive camouflage-like bark, to create airy structures: On the south side of the house, there is a double row of them that conjures a leafy veranda; outside the back door, two rows of three — trimmed from the top so they will spread — shade a gravel and bluestone patio furnished with a plank table and chairs. While it is popular now to build a house that blurs the distinction between outside and in, that usually requires massive sliding doors — which would preclude the almost monklike approach Nevins has taken with her home, where she lives alone, designed in collaboration with the New Haven architect Peter de Bretteville. It recalls the residences of the austere late-colonial era, which had strict threshold boundaries in order to keep the domestic sphere free of everyday grit. But Nevins has found her own way to meld the past and the present, to make the home and its garden a unified field: Throughout the main level, there are eight narrow nine-foot-tall triple-hung windows that extend to the floor. Her inspiration was Thomas Jefferson — another Francophilic architectural and botanical obsessive — who created similar ones for Monticello. Not only do they allow incomparable airflow through the 20-by-28-foot sitting-cum-dining room, which is decorated with spare arrangements of white upholstered and slipcovered furniture, but on a Sunday afternoon, as the weather grows cold, such windows also enable one of Nevins’s favorite rituals: She throws them open entirely, hauling in her two potted Meyer lemon trees to overwinter inside. For a few hours, before she returns to Manhattan for the workweek and a peripatetic existence planning other people’s fantasies, she is in the midst of her own orangery. As the sun sets, she is quiet by the fire with its pale wooden mantel, a fresh-cut bunch of rosemary in an antique glass vase beside her, first frost glinting, sharp and alive, on the hedgerow beyond.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Landscape Lewis and Clark Would Recognize Is Now Under Threat,"Logging, mining and development loom over the Northern Rockies. Mr. Garrity, a fifth-generation Montanan, is the executive director of Alliance for the Wild Rockies. Ms. King is a singer-songwriter and alliance member who has lived in Idaho for more than 40 years. The Northern Rockies are surely near the top of the list of the world’s most spectacular landscapes. Its ranges contain one of the last great expanses of biodiversity left in the continental United States, including most of the species that were there when Lewis and Clark first passed through in 1805 on their journey of discovery. These attributes alone would be reason enough to protect this region. Instead, the Trump administration has been pushing oil, gas, mining, and logging projects, and removing legal protections from threatened species. To be fair, the Obama administration also pursued some of those actions. But the current administration’s zealotry threatens the region’s wild landscape and rich biodiversity. It’s up to all of us who care about the environment, science and preserving wild places for our children to resist such efforts. Legislation recently introduced in the House would protect a vast swath of this region. But until that law is enacted, we’ll have to rely on the judiciary. Along with other organizations and Indian tribes in the Northern Rockies, our group, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, has been fighting threats to the region in court. Fortunately, this past year has brought some encouraging news. But the court system alone will not provide the protection this area needs and deserves. In August, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit voted unanimously to halt a planned 125-square-mile logging and burning project in the Payette National Forest in western Idaho. The court concluded that parts of the project ran counter to the forest’s management plan. Under that project, so many trees would have been cut that the forest would have no longer provided elk or deer with the cover they need. Forest streams would have been filled with sediment from bulldozers building miles of new logging roads — further damaging the native fisheries for which the Northern Rockies are internationally famous. According to the United States Forest Service’s own projections, taxpayers would have spent more than $12 million to subsidize the logging. On the same day of the Ninth Circuit ruling against the Payette project, a Federal District Court judge in Montana, Dana Christensen, granted a request by Alliance for the Wild Rockies and two other groups for an injunction temporarily stopping a logging and road building project along the northwestern border of Yellowstone National Park. Nearly 16 miles of logging roads would have been bulldozed through grizzly bear habitat. The judge concluded that the Forest Service had failed to consider how the project would affect the Canada lynx, which has been listed since 2000 as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Now the court is weighing whether to permanently block the project. Then, in September, Judge Christensen ordered the Yellowstone-area grizzly bears restored to full protection as a threatened species. When the federal government removed the bear’s protected status in June 2017, ignoring the concerns of scientists, environmentalists and tribal leaders, the State of Wyoming started gearing up for its first grizzly hunt in more than 40 years. But Judge Christensen ruled that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service had erred in removing the bear’s threatened status, siding with us and opponents of the hunt. The Interior Department is appealing this decision. This was a particularly important ruling because the loss of protected status could have opened the bears’ habitat to mining, logging, and development. But the fight to protect the landscape and its species is far from over. With the nation’s environmental laws under all-out attack by the Trump administration, victories in the judicial branch can get us only so far. That’s why Congress must act to protect the Northern Rockies. Legislation introduced recently in the House by Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, and soon to be introduced in the Senate by Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, would designate 23 million acres of roadless public lands in Montana, Idaho, western Wyoming, and eastern Oregon and Washington as wilderness. The Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act would also establish a system of vital biological corridors connecting smaller ecosystems within the Northern Rockies to protect native plants and animals. Restoring over one million acres of damaged habitat and watersheds would create jobs, and taxpayers would save millions of dollars that would otherwise be spent on road-building and logging projects in which private corporations cut down our public forests. A proposal recently introduced in Congress seeks to add 23 million acres of wilderness and designate key wildlife corridors.

That reputation is fast eroding. By passing this legislation, Congress can help reverse this trend. Our group and others have been fighting for more than a quarter of a century to protect the ecosystems of the Northern Rockies that are the rightful heritage of all Americans and generations to come. With the support of an engaged public and insistence by an independent judiciary that this administration adhere to longstanding environmental laws, we will succeed. On June 12, 1805, Meriwether Lewis climbed a bluff in what is now Chouteau County, Mont. From this vantage, he was able to see wolves, antelope, mule deer and “immense herds of buffalo.” He added, “From this height we had a most beautiful and picturesque view of the Rocky Mountains, which were perfectly covered with snow.” They were, Lewis wrote in his journal, “an august spectacle.” Nearly 214 years later, parts of the Northern Rockies remain as they were when Lewis first saw its peaks. We must protect them so future generations can experience the grandeur that he beheld. Mike Garrity is the executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies.

2019,"A Late Call, a Late Goal, and United Eliminates P.S.G. From the Champions League","Marcus Rashford’s injury-time penalty sent Manchester United through to the Champions League quarterfinals on Wednesday, securing a 3-1 victory at Paris St.-Germain that overturned a two-goal deficit from the first leg. The referee Damir Skomina awarded the penalty after a lengthy video review that showed defender Presnel Kimpembe jumping up to block Diogo Dalot’s shot with his elbow. Rashford kept his nerve, blasting the ball past Gianluigi Buffon to send United through and crush P.S.G.’s hopes for a Champions League crown for yet another season. “The kid is fearless. He’s got no doubt. Slotted it in. Brilliant,” United Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. “I hope,” he added of the penalty, “it was the right decision.” As the United players sprinted to celebrate with their fans at the final whistle, Kimpembe lay flat on the ground for several moments as a stunned Parc des Princes crowd looked on in disbelief. The video-assistant referee system being added to the competition for the knockout rounds played a key part in the night’s other match, too. Alex Telles scored a penalty in extra time to send Porto into the quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Roma, overturning a one-goal deficit from the first leg. Telles converted the spot kick after Alessandro Florenzi had been penalized following a review. United had only a slim chance to advance after losing by 2-0 at home in the first leg, and Solskjaer’s task was made even harder by the fact that 10 of his players were either injured or suspended. That included midfielder Paul Pogba, who was sent off in the first leg at Old Trafford. “Everything seemed to be against us, but we’re used to that,” Rashford said. “We showed what we’re about today and got the result we needed.” It was the first time in Champions League history that a team lost the first leg of a knockout tie at home by a two-goal margin and still went through. “We always believed; that’s the thing. We had a plan,” Solskjaer said. “It wasn’t about having the ball and outplaying them. The plan was to be in the game with 10 minutes to go and we were.” United had been handed an immediate lifeline when P.S.G. gifted United striker Romelu Lukaku a second-minute opening goal, before equalizing through left back Juan Bernat in the 12th. Bernat turned in a cross at the back post after Kylian Mbappé got behind United’s static defense. United scored from its first attack when Lukaku intercepted a back pass from Thilo Kehrer, rounded Buffon and slid the ball in from a tight angle. Then the experienced Buffon spilled a low shot from Rashford and Lukaku turned in the rebound. “We agreed that when Marcus steps out on the press that I would follow,” Lukaku said. “I told him every time he shoots I’ll follow the ball, and that’s what happened.” P.S.G.’s defense had another bad night, a recurring theme during the knockout stages of a competition it has never won. Three years ago, P.S.G. was eliminated by Barcelona after winning by 4-0 at home and then losing the return leg, 6-1. “If it were a league game you would wipe your mouth and go on, but today it’s horrible and cruel,” P.S.G. Manager Thomas Tuchel said.",The New York Times
2019,A Leonardo Made a $450 Million Splash. Now There’s No Sign of It.,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — The Louvre Abu Dhabi might seem to have all you could ask for in a world-class museum. Its acclaimed design shades its galleries under a vast dome that appears to hover over the waters of the Persian Gulf. Inside are works by Rembrandt and Vermeer, Monet and van Gogh, Mondrian and Basquiat. Yet the work that the Louvre Abu Dhabi once promised would anchor its collection is conspicuously absent: “Salvator Mundi,” a painting of Jesus Christ attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. Few works have evoked as much intrigue, either in the world of art or among the courts of Persian Gulf royals. First, its authenticity as the product of Leonardo’s own hand was the subject of intense debate. Then, in November 2017, it became the most expensive work ever sold at auction, fetching $450.3 million from an anonymous bidder who turned out to be a close ally and possible stand-in for the ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Now, the painting is shrouded in a new mystery: Where in the world is “Salvator Mundi”? Although the Abu Dhabi culture department announced about a month after the auction that it had somehow acquired “Salvator Mundi” for display in the local Louvre, a scheduled unveiling of the painting last September was canceled without explanation. The culture department is refusing to answer questions. Staff of the Louvre Abu Dhabi say privately that they have no knowledge of the painting’s whereabouts. The Louvre in Paris, which licenses its name to the Abu Dhabi museum, has not been able to locate “Salvator Mundi,” either, according to an official familiar with the museum’s discussions with Abu Dhabi, who declined to be named because of the confidentiality of the talks. Officials in the French government, which owns the Louvre in Paris, are eager to include “Salvator Mundi” in a landmark exhibition this fall to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death and say they are still holding out hope that the painting might resurface in time. (A representative of the Louvre declined to comment.) But some Leonardo experts say they are alarmed by the uncertainty about the painting’s whereabouts and future, especially after the announcement from Abu Dhabi that the painting would go on display to the public. “It is tragic,” said Dianne Modestini, a professor at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts and a conservator who has worked on “Salvator Mundi.” “To deprive the art lovers and many others who were moved by this picture — a masterpiece of such rarity — is deeply unfair.” Martin Kemp, an Oxford art historian who has studied the painting, described it as “a kind of religious version of the ‘Mona Lisa’” and Leonardo’s “strongest statement of the elusiveness of the divine.” “I don’t know where it is, either,” he added. Noting that it was never clear how Abu Dhabi might have acquired the painting from the Saudis in the first place — whether by a gift, loan or private sale — some have speculated that Crown Prince Mohammed might simply have decided to keep it. The Saudi embassy in Washington declined to comment. The 33-year-old crown prince may not be the painting’s first royal owner. Believed to have been painted around 1500, “Salvator Mundi” was one of two similar works listed in an inventory of the collection of King Charles I of England after his execution in 1649, Professor Kemp said. But the painting disappeared from the historical record in the late 18th century. The painting sold at the record auction later turned up in the collection of a 19th-century British industrialist. It had been so heavily painted over that “it looked like a drug-crazed hippie,” Professor Kemp said, and it was attributed at the time to one of Leonardo’s followers. In 1958, it was sold out of that collection for the equivalent of $1,350 in today’s dollars. The claim that the painting was the work of Leonardo himself originated after a pair of dealers spotted it at an auction in New Orleans in 2005 and brought it to Professor Modestini of N.Y.U. She stripped away overpainting, repaired damage made by a split in the wood panel, and restored details. Among other things, one of Jesus’s hands appeared to have two thumbs, possibly because the artist changed his mind about where the thumb should be and painted over the original thumb. It had been exposed by scraping later on, and Professor Modestini covered the thumb she believed Leonardo did not want. Its new attribution to Leonardo won the painting a spot in a retrospective of his work at the National Gallery in London in 2011. Two years later, a Russian billionaire, Dmitry E. Rybolovlev, bought it for $127.5 million — less than a third of what he sold it for in 2017, when it was auctioned in New York by Christie’s. Now the Louvre Abu Dhabi’s failure to exhibit “Salvator Mundi” as promised has revived doubts about whether it is Leonardo’s at all, with skeptics speculating that the new owner may fear public scrutiny. An expert on Leonardo’s paintings, Jacques Franck, sent letters to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, raising doubts about the attribution. Mr. Macron’s chief of staff, François-Xavier Lauch, wrote back that the president “was very attentive to the preoccupations.” Others have argued that the painting was so extensively restored by Professor Modestini that it is as much her work as Leonardo’s. “Nonsense,” she said in an interview, calling these “ridiculous claims.” Auction house contracts typically include a five-year authenticity warranty. But the extensive public documentation and debate before the 2017 sale would make it difficult for the buyer to recover the payment by challenging the attribution to Leonardo. The anonymous buyer at the auction in New York, Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, was a little known member of a distant branch of the Saudi royal family with no publicly known source of great wealth or history as a major art collector. But he was a close friend and confidant of Crown Prince Mohammed. A few months after the auction, the royal court named Prince Bader as the kingdom’s first-ever minister of culture. Christie’s initially sought to guard Prince Bader’s identity so closely during the bidding that it created a special account number for him that was known only to a handful of the house’s executives. But contracts and correspondence obtained by The New York Times showed Prince Bader to be the anonymous buyer. American officials familiar with the arrangement later said that Prince Bader was in fact acting as a surrogate for Crown Prince Mohammed himself, the true purchaser of “Salvator Mundi.” Prince Mohammed’s aggression and impulsiveness have recently come under new scrutiny in the West after American intelligence agencies concluded that he ordered the killing last fall of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was ambushed and dismembered by Saudi agents in a consulate in Istanbul. But by the time of auction, the prince had already shown a taste for pricey trophies, paying $500 million for a yacht and $300 million for a chateau in France. As a Times article about Prince Bader’s role in the auction was about to be published in December 2017, the Louvre Abu Dhabi, possibly to deflect attention from the Saudis’ extravagant spending, tweeted that “Salvator Mundi” would be coming to its collection. Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed is a close ally of Crown Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia. And the chairman of Abu Dhabi’s department of culture and tourism, Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, is a top lieutenant of the emirate’s crown prince. Last June, Mr. Mubarak announced with great fanfare that “Salvator Mundi” would go on display as part of the museum’s permanent collection in September 2018. “Having spent so long undiscovered, this masterpiece is now our gift to the world,” he said in a statement reported in the Emirati-owned newspaper, The National. “We look forward to welcoming people from near and far to witness its beauty.” When September came, however, the exhibition was canceled without explanation and never rescheduled. Museum officials said that only Mr. Mubarak could answer questions about the painting, and a spokesman for Mr. Mubarak, Faisal al-Dhahri, said that neither Mr. Mubarak nor the ministry would comment. In the meantime, any clues to the movements of “Salvator Mundi” have the art world abuzz. One person familiar with the details of the painting’s sale said it had been sent to Europe after the completion of payment. And Professor Modestini said that she had heard from a restoration expert that he had been asked by an insurance company to examine the painting in Zurich last fall before further shipping. But the examination was canceled, and the Zurich expert, Daniel Fabian, declined to comment. After that, said Professor Modestini, “the trail goes completely cold.” video",The New York Times
2019,"A Life Frequently Apart, but an Enterprise They’ll Boldly Take On","Vows Mary Wiseman never worried that the parents of her boyfriend, Noah Averbach-Katz, wouldn’t like her. When the couple started dating in 2013, she already knew them pretty well — she and Mr. Averbach-Katz were acting students at Juilliard, the Manhattan performing arts college. His parents, Rachelle Averbach and Steve Katz, frequently flew to New York from their home in California to see their son in school shows. They were always friendly and encouraging. “Noah’s parents were like fixtures in our class,” said Ms. Wiseman, 33. “They’re enthusiastic, supportive people. They would even get our drama group little gifts and things.” It wasn’t until 2017, though, that she knew unequivocally she had also become his parents’ favorite classmate. This was the year the flame-haired Ms. Wiseman landed the role of Ensign Sylvia Tilly in the CBS TV series “Star Trek: Discovery.” “My mom is a huge Trekkie,” said Mr. Averbach-Katz, 30, who lives with Ms. Wiseman in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. “When Mary got the job, we FaceTimed her with the news. She wept.” Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Averbach-Katz met in 2011, when both entered Juilliard as graduate students in a 17-member drama group. They didn’t start dating until their third year. “And we weren’t even that good of friends before that, because school takes up so much time,” said Ms. Wiseman, who grew up in Milford, Pa., and Gaithersburg, Md., with three older brothers and her parents, Dorothy and Kevin Wiseman. A first hint of attraction came during their second year, when they were cast opposite each other in a scene of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” in a scene-study class. Ms. Wiseman played Masha, who has an affair with Vershinin, the soldier, played by Mr. Averbach-Katz. “In that scene he says, ‘I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love,’” Ms. Wiseman said. “Normally our teacher would do a scene like that over and over again. It was very rare to only do a scene once. But she was like, ‘Oh, wow — that shouldn’t have worked but it worked.’” Not long after, their onstage chemistry spilled into a production of “Three Sisters” Soon they were ducking into private spaces around campus to kiss. “We tried to be sneaky about it, because you’re in this small group, and there’s a delicate group dynamic: When people start dating, everyone has to adjust,” Ms. Wiseman said. “So we’d run down the hall and find a spot and make out really fast and then pretend it wasn’t happening, even though Noah would have lipstick all over his face.” By their fourth year, “we were a big-time, hard-core couple, and everyone knew it,” Mr. Averbach-Katz said. But then, in 2015, came graduation, and with it a host of challenges to keeping up their romance. Mr. Averbach-Katz, lanky and sad-eyed, found his first roles as a professional actor in regional theater, in cities like Washington and Portland, Me., and shows including “My Name is Asher Lev.” Ms. Wiseman, meanwhile, stayed in New York, landing a role in her classmate Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ Obie-winning, Off Broadway play, “An Octoroon.” When both were in New York, “basically we were just living at each other’s apartments,” Mr. Averbach-Katz said. (His was in Harlem, hers in Brooklyn.) “We’d buy food for one place, then go to the other place, and all the food we bought for the first place would spoil.” Separations for work, though, seemed necessary. “We’ve always had this implicit understanding that, because we’re both actors, when an opportunity comes up we have to say yes, even if it separates us for a long time,” Ms. Wiseman said. Mr. Averbach-Katz continued acting in shows like “The Lion in Winter” at Two River Theater in New Jersey in 2016. Ms. Wiseman started veering in an on-camera direction, securing a recurring part as Trinity in the Zach Galifianakis show “Baskets.” Then the “Star Trek” audition came along. She’s not sure she would have gotten the part without Mr. Averbach-Katz’s input. “I had sort of grown up on ‘Star Trek,’” Mr. Averbach-Katz said, in what may be an understatement. “As a kid I would go to ‘Star Trek’ conventions with my mom, and there’s some extremely embarrassing pictures of me as a 13-year-old, at the height of my sex appeal, in ‘Star Trek’ gear,” Mr. Averbach-Katz said. He was an only child who grew up in Fairfax, Calif., amid “Star Trek” Christmas ornaments, saltshakers and action figures. Steven Katz, the publisher of Mother Jones, is less a Trekkie than his wife, Rachelle Averbach, a psychotherapist. She started watching the sci-fi phenomenon after the original series debuted in 1966. She later integrated the show into her life in an unexpected way, using it to teach her son life lessons. “There are these wonderful moments in ‘Star Trek’ about equality and the environment and racism and sexism,” Ms. Averbach said. “Noah and I would watch the show and we’d talk about it.” When Mr. Averbach-Katz expressed reservations about being bar mitzvahed, for example, she cued an episode of “Star Trek: Next Generation” in which the character Alexander wasn’t sure he wanted to become a Klingon. “It was a rite of passage for Alexander, and it became this fun parallel for our own cultural dilemma. That’s’ sort of how ‘Star Trek’ became an important philosophical point of discussion in our family.” It is also how its aesthetic eventually became an important piece of Ms. Wiseman’s audition video. Mr. Averbach-Katz helped her read for the part. “He told me, ‘You have to nail the techno babble,’” Ms. Wiseman said. When she went to send her photo to the show’s producers, Mr. Averbach-Katz, who never comments on Ms. Wiseman’s wardrobe, told her to change. “I was wearing this crazy hippie peasant dress with holes in it,” she said. “Noah was like, ‘Mary, you have to wear something more structured.’” Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Averbach-Katz moved into their Prospect Heights apartment just after she signed contracts to became Ensign Tilley. Both were starting to think marriage was in their future. And both were ready to put lessons they had learned about long-distance love to use as Ms. Wiseman prepared to commit to nine months a year shooting “Star Trek” in Toronto. “It was a watershed moment in my life. It was everything I’d hoped for, like I’d won the lottery,” she said of the part. When she told her parents, “I saw my dad’s shoulders relax in a way I don’t think I’ve ever seen in my life. He actually cut a different silhouette.” They were as relieved as she was at the idea of a steady paycheck, and the financial security that came with it. “But in other ways I was really sad at having to be apart from Noah,” Ms. Wiseman said. Mr. Averbach-Katz’s regional theater work had prepared them for separation in smaller doses. And they were armed with advice from theater veterans: “There’s a general rule of thumb that older actors have told me, which is that you should really aim to see each other every two weeks. You can push it to three, but after that it gets really hard.” They put that rule into practice as Ms. Wiseman left for her first season, in March 2017. Still, “the experience of missing Noah was like someone had taken an organ out of me. It just felt like, I need this person.” Mr. Averbach-Katz felt the same. But he sensed that Ms. Wiseman’s role in “Star Trek” opened a new chapter for them as a couple. “When Mary got the job I was like, hell yeah, I’m going to propose,” he said. He already had a ring in mind. On a Thanksgiving trip home to California in 2017, while Ms. Wiseman was deep into her first season, he asked his mother if she still had his Grandma Sweetheart’s Edwardian diamond ring. She did. The ring, a diamond surrounded by platinum filigree, dates to between 1890 and 1910. “It was given to my mother by her mother during the Depression, at a time when people didn’t have things. So it became this symbol of hope and better times,” Ms. Averbach said. “I was happy Noah wanted it for Mary.” A month later, over Christmas at the Wisemans’ house in Silver Spring, Md., Mr. Averbach-Katz asked Kevin and Dorothy Wiseman for their blessing to propose. Once he got it, he asked for advice about timing. “They told me I should do it in April, before she left to go back to Toronto,” Mr. Averbach-Katz said. April 1, 2018, has since become legendary in both families. That morning, Mr. Averbach-Katz orchestrated a scavenger hunt that led Ms. Wiseman from their apartment in Brooklyn to his old apartment in Harlem, then on to Malachy’s Donegal Inn, the bar in Manhattan where they first exchanged “I love yous,” then to Juilliard and finally to two favorite local cafes. At each stop, Ms. Wiseman was ambushed by loved ones. Her brothers flew in from multiple cities to surprise her at Juilliard; Ms. Averbach and Mr. Katz secretly awaited her arrival at the first cafe, Cheryl’s Global Soul; her parents were camped out at the final cafe, Lincoln Station. By the time the scavenger hunt instructions told her to go home, more than a dozen friends and family members had congregated at the apartment. Mr. Averbach-Katz dropped to one knee, presented his grandmother’s ring, and asked if she would marry him. Ms. Wiseman, overwhelmed by her day of surprises and in tears, said yes. Since then, Mr. Averbach-Katz has been immersed in a copy of “Wedding Planning for Dummies.” “Mary didn’t wrap in Toronto until the holidays, so I’ve done a lot of the wedding planning,” he said. “I had a lot to learn.” Their Feb. 16 wedding at the Full Moon Resort in Big Indian, N.Y., betrayed no signs of amateurism. A crowd of 160, including several of Ms. Wiseman’s “Star Trek” castmates, was kept cozy in a barn outfitted with hanging globe lanterns and a huppah. Ms. Wiseman, in a silk ivory wrap dress by the Spanish designer Cortana and with her long hair flowing, walked down an aisle with both parents; her eight-member bridal party included her three brothers and just one woman, her cousin Delia Regan. Mr. Averbach-Katz, in a black satin J.Crew tuxedo, was flanked by eight friends, three from New York and five from California. Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church, officiated. After calling on Boo Killebrew, an actor friend of the couple’s, to read the Masha-Vershinin scene from “Three Sisters,” he reflected on the nature of love. “Love is a force that finds you,” he said. “Love turns you into the truest version of you.” Then Mr. Averbach-Katz, reading from handwritten vows, told Ms. Wiseman, “Before you, so much of myself was a mystery. You reached me. You unlocked me. You showed me how to be myself.” When it was her turn, Ms. Wiseman, dabbing tears, said, “I promise when we’re apart I’ll still be tethered to you. Your name is written on my heart.” After two blessings from Mr. Averbach-Katz’s cousin, Rabbi Gary Katz, Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins pronounced them married. The room erupted in cheers, though Vulcan salutes may have been appropriate.",The New York Times
2019,"A Lighter Matthew Barney Goes Back to School, and Back Home","CRITIC’S pICK The artist dances with wolves, and hunters, in his new film “Redoubt,” shot in his native Idaho. It’s the most emancipated work of his career. NEW HAVEN — Two parallel homecomings give shape to “Redoubt,” the much anticipated and unexpectedly nimble new project that Matthew Barney debuted here earlier this month. One is to Yale University, where Mr. Barney, class of 1989, began to merge ornery sculpture made with plastics and Vaseline with athletic performances and perplexing symbolism. Thirty years after graduating, the artist elected to present his newest project on the campus where he made his first mature work, in which the undergraduate would dangle from his studio walls or climb naked at Yale’s cathedral-like gym. The other homecoming is to central Idaho, where the artist grew up. As usual with Mr. Barney — whose epic “Cremaster” cycle (1994-2002) introduced a whole generation to the sexual potential of bees, rams, racecars and the Chrysler building — “Redoubt” combines sculptures, drawings and performances with a feature-length film that itself generates new artworks. Mr. Barney has filmed in Idaho before: The Busby Berkeley revue of “Cremaster 1” (1995) takes place on a blue Boise football field, while “River of Fundament” (2014), his six-hour noble failure of excrement-slicked reincarnation, features a poetic coda of salmon spawning in an Idaho river. But “Redoubt” is rooted, unlike those expansive works, in a single place: the remote, rugged Sawtooth Mountains, the landscape of Mr. Barney’s childhood. It also speaks more directly to contemporary American themes: the place of the gun, the fate of the environment and the fantasies and paranoias of those who turn their back on constitutional government and American society. Lighter, freer and a little more conventional than usual, it is Mr. Barney’s most engrossing film in over a decade. Mr. Barney appears only in a supporting role, and he now seems especially eager to embrace collaboration and improvisation, notably via dance, a fascinating addition to his cinematic techniques. It’s certainly less visually striking than the “Cremaster” cycle and “River of Fundament.” But I love the new, more open Mr. Barney of “Redoubt,” which the Yale University Art Gallery is screening on Saturday afternoons and at a few other times, alongside an exhibition of large bronze and brass sculptures and strange electroplated engravings inspired by the film. (The show travels afterward to Beijing, then London.) “Redoubt” has a cast of just six, and draws its structure partly from the tale in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” of Diana, the chaste goddess of the hunt, and Actaeon, a doomed young hero who spies on her. Diana, here, is a hunter living off the grid in Idaho, attended by two dancing Virgins and clad in the military-grade camouflage favored by some anti-government types in the American west. (The film’s title alludes to American Redoubt, a far-right survivalist movement in the region.) We first see Diana crafting her own bullets out of the same bronze and brass Mr. Barney uses in his sculptures, against the awesome backdrop of Idaho’s snow-covered mountains. Diana is played by Anette Wachter, a world-champion sharpshooter who does her own marksmanship in the film; she is also a prolific gun blogger, and recently told the magazine NRA Family, “I can’t express how much I love being involved in the gun industry and culture.” Diana is hunting an elusive gray wolf, one of many returning to the Sawtooth Mountains after near-extinction, thanks to a federal government effort that drew strong opposition from the livestock industry, as well as hunters. The effort took place when Mr. Barney was a boy. Whatever its symbolic import in “Redoubt” (and Mr. Barney gives us plenty to work with, notably shots of the constellation Lupus), the wolf is also a living embodiment of the clash between Washington and anti-statist Idaho communities whose libertarianism comes in both mild and extremist strains. This project’s Diana is an American original, and hunts not as divine action but from political convictions. “Redoubt” tracks Diana and her two Virgins in search of their prey. (The cinematography is by Mr. Barney’s longtime collaborator Peter Strietmann, who pictures the mountains in a breathtaking palette of steely blues and grays, though he relies too much on drone shots that have already become travel-dad YouTube clichés.) The only other human up in the mountains is an Engraver, played by Mr. Barney with a bushy white beard, who observes the women at a distance and etches their hunt on sheets of copper. His character is an artist, but also a federal employee: Note the United States Forest Service patch on his ski cap and green jacket. Each day, he drives to the trailer home of an Electroplater (played by K.J. Holmes, a renowned dance artist). She dunks his copper etchings in chemical baths, and, with the help of rudimentary batteries, coats them with a new metal crust. The etchings appear, transformed, in the exhibition here at Yale: pictures of Diana, of wolves and of the Idaho mountains that are encrusted with metal nodules and scorched in places after too long in the chemical bath. The show also includes a few larger-scale sculptures cast from fallen trees, which have much in common with the explosive bronze splashes made at the time of “River of Fundament” and seen at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. But it’s the electroplated etchings, sometimes daintily figurative and sometimes scarred into abstraction, that most fully express the aims of “Redoubt,” reflecting an artist seeking newer, freer shores. That freedom extends to another medium: dance. The revelation of “Redoubt” is Eleanor Bauer, who plays one of Diana’s two Virgins and choreographed the bulk of the film’s movement. (Like most of Mr. Barney’s films — except “River of Fundament,” in which Ms. Bauer also appears — this one has no dialogue.) She and Laura Stokes, playing the other Virgin, communicate through gesture and performance as they hunt. The women roll their legs over snow banks, writhe in a hammock and balance their weight against each other while bathing in a hot spring. One even strings the other from a tree with climber’s rope, lifting her like a lupine carcass. In another dance sequence, Sandra Lamouche, a performer of the Bigstone Cree Nation, executes a hoop dance in an abandoned American Legion hall. Her brief appearance reaffirms that, where so much of Mr. Barney’s earlier work sought to disrupt binary understandings of identity, “Redoubt” is mostly focused on white bodies, and how white Americans live, colonize and kill in one of the continent’s most exquisite ecosystems. Ms. Bauer’s choreography draws heavily on Steve Paxton’s practice of contact improvisation, in which dancers respond to and anticipate each other’s motions. There are echoes, too, of Trish Brown’s gravity-defying dances with ropes and harnesses — especially when Ms. Bauer climbs a huge charred tree and splays her body horizontally. This stunning image of Ms. Bauer rigged in a climber’s harness, suspended hundreds of feet up in the Idaho air, has almost none of the mythopoetic baggage that weighed down “River of Fundament.” “Redoubt” plants itself in a place and time when the promises of democratic participation are unraveling, and where “prepper” fantasies of societal collapse intertwine with more justified fears of ecological degradation. And these more immediate concerns have produced a different sort of film, less awesome but more urgent, in which the bodies on screen find an unexpected freedom. This new work may therefore have less in common with “Cremaster” and “River of Fundament” than with the most primordial Barney works: his decades-long “Drawing Restraint” series, in which the artist draws on walls while dragging weights or while tethered by bungee cords. (The first of them took place in 1987, here at Yale.) It turns out that Ms. Bauer has also recently executed new phases of “Drawing Restraint,” at Mr. Barney’s invitation. In those works and this one, Mr. Barney seems to be forging a more emancipated kind of collaboration, more trusting that another body can replace his own.

2019,A Long Island House Holds the Story of Washington’s Spy Ring,"OYSTER BAY, N.Y. — Raynham Hall, a historic house museum a few blocks from the bay that gives this hamlet on Long Island’s North Shore its name, has long been known as a nexus of activity during the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the home’s owners welcomed visitors in, to see some of the relics and hear the tales of that period. For part of the 20th century, it was owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who told the story of how the British commander John Graves Simcoe made the house his headquarters while he and his Queen’s Rangers, an elite Loyalist unit, were garrisoned in Oyster Bay, in 1778 and 1779, and again in 1780. Simcoe’s friend, the dashing British intelligence chief John André, is known to have visited him here. There are also the requisite ghosts said to be wandering around the 22-room house, not to mention a yarn (erroneously perpetuated in a state historic plaque still in front of the building) about Sally Townsend, the daughter of the home’s owner, Samuel Townsend. The apocryphal story says that, while she was serving doughnuts to André and other officers at her family’s house, she got wind of the conspiracy with the American general Benedict Arnold to hand West Point over to the British, and was able to alert Gen. George Washington’s headquarters. (André was intercepted with incriminating papers and hanged as a spy in 1780, doughnuts having had nothing to do with it.) But the great untold secret of this house wasn’t even known until the 1930s, when historians confirmed the existence of the Culper Ring — an American espionage network that extended from British-held New York, along the coast of Long Island, across the Sound and to Washington’s headquarters in Connecticut. The man at the center of that ring, Sally’s brother Robert Townsend — code-named Culper Jr. — grew up in this house, and would spend much of his adult life here. The Culper Ring has been having a cultural moment in the 21st century with the publication of several popular books, and an AMC series based on one of those books, “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” that ran from 2014 to 2017. André, Simcoe and Robert and Samuel Townsend were all portrayed in the show. While the house itself was not depicted, there’s no doubt as to its significance. “Raynham Hall plays a central role in the story of George Washington’s spy ring,” said the historian Alexander Rose, whose 2006 book, “Washington’s Spies,” provided the basis for the TV series, for which Mr. Rose was also a producer. “A lot of the action centered around this house, which is beautifully preserved.” Yet, while it hosts about 10,000 visitors a year — nearly half of them schoolchildren — the house, which is owned by the Town of Oyster Bay and operated by the nonprofit Friends of Raynham Hall, is relatively obscure. Like a good intelligence agent, it manages to project its own false identity: When Samuel Townsend bought the house in 1738, it was a two-story, four-room structure. By the time of the Revolution, it had been expanded into an eight-room saltbox. In the 1800s, it was restructured into a Victorian manor with a tower and a stained-glass skylight. When the town acquired Raynham Hall from the D.A.R. in 1947, it removed the tower and rebuilt the facade of the home to resemble its appearance in the 1700s. While the genuine-appearing Colonial front of the house was actually built during the Truman administration, the rear of Raynham Hall and the floorboards and walls are original. And the home’s rooms feature period items owned by the family — although visiting “Turn” fans expecting to find Robert Townsend’s cipher book or bottles of the invisible ink used by the ring to write messages, will be disappointed. Townsend did much of his snooping from his merchant family’s store in Manhattan, which he managed. He did not leave a paper trail — certainly not one that would lead straight to his family home. “We were behind enemy lines here,” said Claire Bellerjeau, director of education at Raynham Hall Museum. Interpreting the tools or products of intelligence work is a challenge for any museum that deals in espionage. “When anything is kept secret, it’s ripe for imagination,” said Jackie Eyl, youth education director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. “We try to fill in the gaps in the imagination.” That museum tells the story of spying (including the Culper Ring) through many interactive exhibits. While Raynham Hall can’t duplicate that, it does have an inherent advantage over other museums. “There’s something to be said for the authenticity of standing in a place where a figure of history actually stood,” Ms. Eyl said. But why did these important figures in the Revolution’s clandestine history stand exactly here, in Raynham Hall? “Long Island was a honeycomb of espionage,” explained Barnet Schecter, author of “The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution.” Besides being an important source of food, fuel (in the form of wood) and forage for the British troops occupying Manhattan, he said, the island “was an interface between two enemy camps.” Oyster Bay, on Long Island Sound, was a strategic location. Also, Samuel Townsend, Robert’s father and the owner of the house, was an ardent patriot, a member of New York’s Continental Congress who had been forced to pledge allegiance to the king following his arrest after the American defeat in the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. “I think the British wanted to keep an eye on Samuel,” Ms. Bellerjeau said. If so, they were watching the wrong Townsend, although Robert, who visited the house frequently during the war, was only one of several spies under this roof: Ms. Bellerjeau has found a letter confirming that while he was at Raynham Hall, André also met with a mysterious American agent in the service of the British. “We had a real nest of spies here,” she said with a laugh — the most famous of them having managed to remain a secret for nearly two centuries. On her house tours, Bellerjeau shows laminated reproductions of maps, portraits and letters. But perhaps the most striking image is a sketch drawn of Robert Townsend by his nephew decades later. After the war, the spy lived in this house, quietly and anonymously, until his death in 1838. Wearing glasses and looking like a contented country barrister, Robert Townsend is shown in his nephew’s drawing at age 59 in 1813. He’s holding a book open to a blank page, a hint perhaps that the real story of his life had yet to be revealed.",The New York Times
2019,A Look at 5 High-Profile Mob Hits Before the Frank Cali Slaying,"Organized crime leaders have long been shrouded in a layer of mystique that has made their deaths a matter of public intrigue and Mafia folklore. But it had been decades since a mob boss was killed in New York City, until Wednesday. Francesco Cali, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, was fatally shot outside his home on Staten Island on Wednesday night. Mr. Cali, 53, was shot six times, a police official has said, and there was a report of a blue pickup leaving the scene around the time of shooting. [Read about Francesco Cali’s death and the neighborhood on Staten Island where he was killed.] Mr. Cali’s sudden, violent death potentially places him in a long line of mob leaders who have been targeted for assassination. Past mob figures have often been shot in moments of vulnerability — while eating out, or relaxing at the barber. Their killers were rarely brought to justice. In fact, the slayings often led to more violence, and in some cases, the killers ended up being killed themselves. Here’s a look at some other high-profile mob hits in New York. Paul Castellano led the Gambino crime family for years, conducting business from a mansion in Todt Hill — the same Staten Island neighborhood where Mr. Cali was killed Wednesday. In December 1985, Mr. Castellano, 70, and an associate stepped out of a limousine outside Sparks Steak House, on East 46th Street near Third Avenue, when three men approached. The assassins drew semiautomatic weapons from under their trench coats and opened up a barrage of gunfire at close range, striking both Mr. Castellano and his associate about six times. Bystanders were sent screaming and diving into doorways. The gunmen fled on foot and jumped into a waiting dark car that sped away. Mr. Castellano and the associate fell dead beside the open doors of their black Lincoln limousine. Mr. Castellano was face up, his head slouched against the seat of the limousine, his feet sprawled on the pavement. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] ____ Carmine Galante, who had been described by the police as the head of a 200‐member crime family, was considered to be one of the most powerful organized crime figures in the nation. He had been a target for a year or more because of his supposed aspirations to succeed Carlo Gambino as head of the Gambino crime family — the job given to Mr. Castellano instead. In July 1979, Mr. Galante, 69, was slain in a hail of bullets fired by three ski‐masked gunmen, apparently on the orders of a rival crime family. He had been dining on the patio of a small Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. Two other men — a bodyguard for Mr. Galante and the owner of the restaurant — also were killed. The owner’s 17‐year‐old son was also seriously wounded in the attack. All three of the slain men were unarmed and caught by surprise when they were shot at point‐blank range by the killers, who escaped the scene. A cigar Mr. Galante had been puffing was still clenched in his teeth when the police arrived. ____ In April 1972, Joseph Gallo, a Mafia figure known as Crazy Joe, was assassinated as he celebrated his 43rd birthday at a restaurant in Little Italy. Almost immediately, some sources said his slaying was a result of the wars between Colombo family factions, after the Colombo leader had been shot the prior year. As the story goes, Mr. Gallo and his associates were sitting in the back of the restaurant, drinking soda and eating Italian delicacies, when his assassin strode silently through the door. As he opened fire, there were screams and customers hit the floor. Mr. Gallo, mortally wounded, staggered out of the front door and collapsed in the street. His killer hopped into a waiting car and escaped into the darkness. No one was convicted in the murder. ____ In 1971, Joseph A. Colombo Sr., who was believed to be the head of a Brooklyn Mafia family, was shot three times in the head while he stood in Columbus Circle in Manhattan waiting for a rally of the Italian-American Civil Rights League, which he had founded. Seconds later, the man who the authorities said shot him, Jerome A. Johnson, was mysteriously shot to death with a stolen weapon. The perplexing case led the police to believe that “rivals of Colombo” in the “Italian underworld community” had hired Mr. Johnson as an assassin, a police official said at the time, and then ordered the execution of Mr. Johnson to silence him. No one was ever charged in Mr. Johnson’s death, and no one was indicted in Mr. Colombo’s shooting. But some believed that Mr. Gallo was involved and that his assassination the next year was retribution for the attack on Mr. Colombo. Mr. Colombo, 48 at the time, did not die immediately, but fell into a coma and was left almost totally paralyzed. The once robust leader, who dressed expensively and was known for seeking the spotlight, spent his remaining years incapacitated at his estate. He died seven years later, in 1978, from a condition stemming from his gunshot wounds. ____ Albert Anastasia, a feared mob boss who was known as the head of Murder Inc., an execution squad accused of dozens of murders in the early 20th century, had managed to escape death by the electric chair. But death found him in a barber’s chair, as he relaxed under a pile of hot towels. Mr. Anastasia had been convicted of murder in 1921 and sentenced to death, but was freed in a retrial. He was killed on Oct. 25, 1957, when two men walked into the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel and drew their guns. The men, wearing scarves to hide their faces, shot Mr. Anastasia five times. No arrests were made. But the authorities believed that Carmine J. Persico, a mob boss who died this month in prison, had a strong hand in his and other murders. In a sentencing memorandum about Mr. Persico in 1986, federal prosecutors said he had admitted to a relative, “I killed Anastasia.”",The New York Times
2019,A Lush Urban Garden or Senior Citizen Housing: Which Would You Choose?,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Elizabeth Street Garden’s paved paths meander around a granite balustrade from the early 20th century, limestone lion statues, benches and beds of roses and daffodils. For years, the half-acre of green grass and leafy trees, tucked in between Spring and Prince Streets in Manhattan, has been a lush backdrop for fashion shows, photo shoots, games of hopscotch and quiet afternoons. But the city plans to sell the land soon to build a seven-story, 123-apartment elevator building for low-income seniors. The plans have spurred a clash in the neighborhood, turning the garden in Little Italy into a quintessential New York City power struggle that pits two of the city’s scarcest resources — affordable housing and green spaces — against each other. On Tuesday, a coalition of the garden’s supporters filed a lawsuit against the city in an attempt to halt the project. “We need affordable housing in the community and all around the city, but it shouldn’t be coming at the expense of community green spaces, especially something so unique and iconic as Elizabeth Street Garden,” said Joseph Reiver, the executive director of a volunteer-based nonprofit that manages the upkeep of the land, which the city owns but has leased to his father for decades. The fight is a familiar one in the city: As the amount of available land dwindles, the real estate market booms and the demand for housing increases, green spaces become easy targets for new construction. In a city where an estimated 200,000 seniors are on the waiting list for an affordable apartment, supporters of the project see the garden as a palatable sacrifice in order to house older adults on fixed incomes who are burdened with high rents or isolated in walk-ups. Opponents say the garden is the last green space in Little Italy and SoHo, and that it’s an integral part of the neighborhood’s character, attracting more than 100,000 visitors each year. The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a yearslong feud that has fueled petitions and raucous meetings held by Community Board 2, a group of residents who weigh in on land use issues in the neighborhood and which recently condemned the project. Councilwoman Margaret Chin, who represents the district where the garden is, supports the project, which is currently undergoing the city’s public review process. It is expected to win the approval of the City Council — which gives great deference to the position of the local Council member — and be built by 2021, unless the lawsuit succeeds. “I feel that people are upset and it pains me that I have to disagree with people that are so committed to their point of view,” Ms. Chin said. “But there are seniors that don’t have affordable housing and they helped build up our city. They helped build up our neighborhood.” Ms. Chin, who chairs the Council’s committee on aging, said that about 5,000 seniors are on the waiting list for affordable units in her district, which also includes Chinatown, TriBeCa, the Financial District and parts of the Lower East Side. Half of the units at the development, named Haven Green, will be reserved for seniors who live in the area and 37 apartments will be allotted to homeless seniors. Pennrose, one of the developers, will also lease four retail spaces and RiseBoro Community Partnership will offer support services for tenants and neighbors. “It’s easy to oppose change and the loss of something, but if we could put 123 very low income and currently homeless seniors in front of you now, I think they would tell you a very different story,” said Karen Haycox, the chief executive officer of Habitat for Humanity New York City, which will be headquartered on the ground floor and cellar of the development. “We feel a very strong passion to speak on their behalf.” The development would preserve around 6,600 square feet of outdoor green space — about one-third of the garden’s current size — which the developers say will be open to the public. But opponents of the project said that’s not enough. They argue that the garden’s educational, artistic and eco-gardening programs make it a cultural cornerstone of the community. They have proposed building the development on a city-owned gravel lot about a mile away on 388 Hudson Street that could fit five times as many units, as well as more open space. Matthew Creegan, a spokesman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the city is exploring building affordable housing there, too, in addition to the proposed development on Elizabeth Street. Emily Hellstrom, a board member of Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden, a community group that supports designating the garden as parkland, said her group is filing a separate lawsuit against the city this week. “The mayor when he was elected said he would listen to grass-roots communities,” said Ms. Hellstrom. “People here want to have faith that their institutions are listening to them.” Elizabeth Street Garden became regularly accessible to the public about six years ago, around the same time the development plans for the site became known. It was previously the site of a public school that was demolished in the 1970s, which sparked a contentious debate over what to build on the vacant lot. In 1981, a 151-unit building of federally-subsidized apartments was built on one end of the parcel. But the remaining 20,000-square-foot lot languished for a decade until the city leased it for $4,000 a month to Joseph Reiver’s father, Allan Reiver, the owner of an adjacent gallery. He transformed it into a garden and outdoor showroom for architectural garden ornaments. Cherry and Bradford pear trees were planted, the grass was manicured and the whole space was dotted with marble columns and sculpture fountains, giving it a Narnia-esque feel. The garden was fenced off, but open to visitors at the gallery’s discretion. In 2012, Ms. Chin, while negotiating the neighboring Essex Crossing development, obtained a commitment from the Bloomberg administration to build senior housing on the garden site. The city would sell the land for $1 to the developers in exchange for the affordable housing. About a year later, a group of neighbors mobilized to save the green space and worked with Mr. Reiver to open the garden to the public seven days a week, organizing volunteers to supervise the front gates. It soon became an escape for tourists and neighbors alike, and a venue for art exhibitions, live music, yoga classes and gardening plots. Supporters have garnered thousands of signatures and raised money to hire Norman Siegel, a well-known civil rights attorney and former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, to represent them. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday alleges, in part, that the city failed to adequately consider the environmental impact of the garden’s possible disappearance. The lawsuit further points out that the city seeks to apply a state law intended to facilitate improving “slums or blighted areas,” which would make tax incentives available to the developers. “How can you argue this garden is a slum?” Mr. Siegel said. “This issue is not just about Community Board 2 and Elizabeth Street Garden. If they can take your space away in Little Italy, they can take it away in your neighborhood, too.” Critics argue there are other green spaces just two blocks away from the garden, like the Liz Christy Community Garden and the expansive Sara D. Roosevelt Park. And the well-funded campaign to save the garden, by residents of a predominantly white and gentrified neighborhood, has been portrayed by some as a classic case of the not-in-my-backyard, or Nimby, attitude. “We are in a crisis of housing and I don’t think that the desires of a small group of collectively well-off people, some of whom own homes, can really determine the future for a desperate need here,” said Kathleen Webster, 65, a community gardener and Little Italy resident. “Everyone keeps saying build it on Hudson Street.” Since 2014, only 93 units of affordable housing have been built in Community Board 2, which also includes Greenwich Village and the West Village. Joseph Reiver, who has ambitious plans to build a greenhouse and community compost in the garden, denied that characterization. “We shouldn’t be pitting senior affordable housing against community green spaces,” he said. “We don’t have to divide the community.”",The New York Times
2019,A Mar-a-Lago Weekend and an Act of God: Trump’s History With Deutsche Bank,"As President Trump delivered his inaugural address in 2017, a slight woman with feathered gray hair sat listening, bundled in a hooded white parka in a fenced-off V.I.P. section. Her name was Rosemary T. Vrablic. She was a managing director at Deutsche Bank and one of the reasons Mr. Trump had just taken the oath of office. It was a moment of celebration — and a moment of worry for Ms. Vrablic’s employer. Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank were deeply entwined, their symbiotic bond born of necessity and ambition on both sides: a real estate mogul made toxic by polarizing rhetoric and a pattern of defaults, and a bank with intractable financial problems and a history of misconduct. The relationship had paid off. Mr. Trump used loans from Deutsche Bank to finance skyscrapers and other high-end properties, and repeatedly cited his relationship with the bank to deflect political attacks on his business acumen. Deutsche Bank used Mr. Trump’s projects to build its investment-banking business, reaped fees from the assets he put in its custody and leveraged his celebrity to lure clients. Then Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, and the German bank shifted into damage-control mode, bracing for an onslaught of public scrutiny, according to several people involved in the internal response. In the weeks before Ms. Vrablic attended his swearing-in, the bank commissioned reports to figure out how it had gotten in so deep with Mr. Trump. It issued an unusual edict to its Wall Street employees: Do not publicly utter the word “Trump.” More than two years later, Mr. Trump’s financial ties with Deutsche Bank are the subject of investigations by two congressional committees and the New York attorney general. Investigators hope to use Deutsche Bank as a window into Mr. Trump’s personal and business finances. Deutsche Bank officials have quietly argued to regulators, lawmakers and journalists that Mr. Trump was not a priority for the bank or its senior leaders and that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former Deutsche Bank executives and board members, most of them with direct knowledge of the Trump relationship, contradict the bank’s narrative. Over nearly two decades, Deutsche Bank’s leaders repeatedly saw red flags surrounding Mr. Trump. There was a disastrous bond sale, a promised loan that relied on a banker’s forged signature, wild exaggerations of Mr. Trump’s wealth, even a claim of an act of God. But Deutsche Bank had a ravenous appetite for risk and limited concern about its clients’ reputations. Time after time, with the support of two different chief executives, the bank handed money — a total of well over $2 billion — to a man whom nearly all other banks had deemed untouchable. Kerrie McHugh, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, said: “We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.” The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A company spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, declined to comment. In the late 1990s, Deutsche Bank, which is based in Germany, was trying to make a name for itself on Wall Street. Its investment-banking division went on a hiring binge. The bank recruited a handful of Goldman Sachs traders to lead a push into commercial real estate. One was Justin Kennedy, the son of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Another was Mike Offit, whose father was the writer Sidney Offit. At Deutsche Bank, Mr. Offit’s mandate was to lend money to big real estate developers, package the loans into securities and sell the resulting bonds to investors. He said in an interview that one way to stand out in a crowded market was to make loans that his rivals considered too risky. In 1998, a broker contacted him to see if he would consider lending to a Wall Street pariah: Mr. Trump, who was then a casino magnate whose bankruptcies had cost banks hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Offit took the meeting. A few days later, Mr. Offit’s secretary called him. “Donald Trump is in the conference room,” she whispered. Mr. Offit said he rushed in, expecting to find an entourage. Mr. Trump was alone. He was looking for a $125 million loan to pay for gut renovations of 40 Wall Street, his Art Deco tower in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Offit was impressed by the pitch, and the loan sailed through Deutsche Bank’s approval process. Mr. Trump seemed giddy with gratitude, Mr. Offit recalled. He took Mr. Offit golfing. He flew him by helicopter to Atlantic City for boxing matches. He wrote a grateful note to Sidney Offit for having “a great son!” Mr. Offit commissioned a detailed model of 40 Wall Street. A golden plaque on its pedestal bore the names and logos of Deutsche Bank and the Trump Organization. Mr. Offit gave one to Mr. Trump and kept another in his office. Mr. Trump soon came looking for $300 million for the construction of a skyscraper across from the United Nations headquarters. The loan was approved. He wanted hundreds of millions more for his Trump Marina casino in Atlantic City. Mr. Offit pledged to line up cash for that, too. Not long after, Edson Mitchell, a top bank executive, discovered that the signature of the credit officer who had approved the Trump Marina deal had been forged, Mr. Offit said. (Mr. Offit was never accused of forgery; the loan never went through.) Mr. Offit was fired months later. He said it was because Mr. Mitchell claimed that he was reckless, a charge Mr. Offit disputed. It was the first hiccup in the Trump relationship. It would not be the last. Over the next few years, the commercial real estate group, with Mr. Kennedy now in a senior role, kept lending to Mr. Trump, including to buy the General Motors building in Manhattan. Occasionally, Justice Kennedy stopped by Deutsche Bank’s offices to say hello to the team, executives recalled. At an annual pro-am golf tournament the bank hosted outside Boston in the early 2000s, Mr. Trump sat down for a recorded interview with the bank’s public relations staff, who asked about his experience with Deutsche Bank. “It’s great,” Mr. Trump exclaimed, according to a person who witnessed the interview. “They’re really fast!” In 2003, a Deutsche Bank team led by Richard Byrne — a former casino-industry analyst who had known Mr. Trump since the 1980s — was hired to sell bonds on behalf of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts. Bank officials escorted Mr. Trump to meet institutional investors in New York and Boston, according to an executive who attended. The so-called roadshow seemed to go well. At every stop, Mr. Trump was greeted by large audiences of fund managers, executives and lower-level employees eager to see the famous mogul. The problem, as a Deutsche Bank executive would explain to Mr. Trump, was that few of them were willing to entrust money to him. Mr. Trump requested an audience with the bank’s bond salesmen. According to a Deutsche Bank executive who heard the remarks, Mr. Trump gave a pep talk. “Fellas, I know this isn’t the easiest thing you’ve had to sell,” the executive recalled Mr. Trump saying. “But if you get this done, you’ll all be my guests at Mar-a-Lago,” his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The sales team managed to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds. Mr. Trump was pleased with the results when a Deutsche Bank executive called, according to a person who heard the conversation. “Don’t forget what you promised our guys,” the executive reminded him. Mr. Trump said he did not remember and that he doubted the salesmen actually expected to be taken to Mar-a-Lago. “That’s all they’ve talked about the past week,” the executive replied. Mr. Trump ultimately flew about 15 salesmen to Florida on his Boeing 727. They spent a weekend golfing with Mr. Trump, two participants said. A year later, in 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts defaulted on the bonds. Deutsche Bank’s clients suffered steep losses. This arm of the investment-banking division stopped doing business with Mr. Trump. Around that time, Mr. Trump returned to Deutsche Bank’s commercial real estate unit — which was housed in a separate part of the sprawling investment-banking division — for another loan. This one was to build a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Josef Ackermann, the bank’s chief executive, had publicly promised soaring profits, and with many of the company’s businesses sputtering, the investment-banking group was under intense pressure to grow. As Deutsche Bank considered making the loan, Mr. Trump wooed bankers with flights on his private plane, according to a person familiar with the pitch. In a Trump Tower meeting, he told Mr. Kennedy that his daughter Ivanka would be in charge of the Chicago project, a sign of the family’s commitment to its success. But there were warning signs. Mr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former New York Times journalist Timothy O’Brien. And a senior investment-banking executive said in an interview that he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime. Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank agreed in 2005 to lend Mr. Trump more than $500 million for the project. He personally guaranteed $40 million of it, meaning the bank could come after his personal assets if he defaulted. By 2008, the riverside skyscraper, one of the tallest in America, was mostly built. But with the economy sagging, Mr. Trump struggled to sell hundreds of condominium units. The bulk of the loan was due that November. Then the financial crisis hit, and Mr. Trump’s lawyers sensed an opportunity. A provision in the loan let Mr. Trump partially off the hook in the event of a “force majeure,” essentially an act of God, like a natural disaster. The former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had called the financial crisis a tsunami. And what was a tsunami if not a natural disaster? One of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Steven Schlesinger, told him the provision could be used against Deutsche Bank. “It’s brilliant!” Mr. Schlesinger recalled Mr. Trump responding. Days before the loan was due, Mr. Trump sued Deutsche Bank, citing the force majeure language and seeking $3 billion in damages. Deutsche Bank countersued and demanded payment of the $40 million that Mr. Trump had personally guaranteed. With the suits in court, senior investment-banking executives severed ties with Mr. Trump. Not long after Mr. Trump got the Chicago loan — but before it went south — Deutsche Bank was expanding its private-banking division, which served the superrich. Executives said they set out to hire Ms. Vrablic, whom they viewed as the best private banker in New York. Traditionally, private bankers discreetly manage customers’ wealth and act as high-end concierges. Ms. Vrablic, who started her career as a bank teller and then worked at Citigroup and Bank of America, did that and more. She also arranged large real estate and commercial loans for her best clients. To lure her, Deutsche Bank guaranteed that she would earn at least $3 million a year, unusually rich terms for a private banker, and would bypass a layer of management to report directly to Thomas Bowers, the head of the American wealth-management division, according to people familiar with her contract. “Rosemary is widely recognized as one of the top private bankers to the U.S. ultra high-net-worth community,” Mr. Bowers said in a September 2006 news release. Deutsche Bank took out an ad in The Times to celebrate the arrival of her and a few colleagues. Ms. Vrablic’s superiors encouraged her to make loans that rival banks dismissed as too large or complex. They saw it as a way to elbow into the hypercompetitive New York market. In 2010, Deutsche Bank and Mr. Trump settled their litigation over the Chicago loan. Mr. Trump agreed to repay most of what he owed by 2012, Mr. Schlesinger said. One of Ms. Vrablic’s clients was Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009. Mr. Kushner regarded Ms. Vrablic as the best banker he had ever worked with, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Shortly after the Chicago lawsuit was settled, Mr. Kushner was told that Mr. Trump was looking for a loan and introduced him to Ms. Vrablic, according to people familiar with the relationship. Mr. Trump flew Ms. Vrablic to Miami to show her a property he wanted to buy: the Doral Golf Resort and Spa. He needed more than $100 million for the 72-hole property. Deutsche Bank dispatched a team to Trump Tower to inspect Mr. Trump’s personal and corporate financial records. The bankers determined he was overvaluing some of his real estate assets by as much as 70 percent, according to two former executives. By then, though, Mr. Trump had become a reality-TV star, and he was swimming in cash from “The Apprentice.” Deutsche Bank officials also were impressed that Mr. Trump did not have much debt, according to people who reviewed his finances. Aside from his history of defaults, he was an attractive borrower. Mr. Trump also expressed interest in another loan from the private-banking division: $48 million for the same Chicago property that had provoked the two-year court fight. Mr. Trump told the bank he would use that loan to repay what he still owed the investment-banking division, the two former executives said. Even by Wall Street standards, borrowing money from one part of a bank to pay off a loan from another was an extraordinary act of financial chutzpah. Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Bowers tentatively agreed to both loans. Because these would be the private bank’s first transactions with Mr. Trump, they needed approval up the chain of command. Investment-banking executives, including Anshu Jain, who would soon become Deutsche Bank’s co-chief executive, pushed back. Lending to Mr. Trump again would be foolish, they argued, and signal to clients that they could default and even sue the bank. Executives in the private bank countered that the proposed loans had Mr. Trump’s personal guarantee and therefore were low risk. And the Chicago loan, they noted, would lead to the repayment of tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump still owed the investment-banking division. A top executive with responsibility for the private bank discussed the loans with Mr. Ackermann, the chief executive, who supported them, according to two officials. A powerful committee in Frankfurt, which evaluated loans based on risks to the bank’s reputation, signed off. “There is no objection from the bank to proceed with this client,” wrote Stuart Clarke, the chief operating officer for the Americas, in a Dec. 5, 2011, email, according to a recipient. Deutsche Bank wired the money to Mr. Trump. The loans carried relatively low interest rates, executives said, but the business promised to be profitable: As part of the deal, Mr. Trump would hold millions of dollars in a personal account, generating fees for the bank. “I have no recollection of having been asked to approve that private-banking loan,” Mr. Ackermann said in an interview. He added: “I would have approved it, if it came to me, if it was commercially sound.” Ms. Vrablic’s relationship with the Trumps deepened. Deutsche Bank lent money to Donald Trump Jr. for a South Carolina manufacturing venture that would soon go bankrupt. It provided a $15 million credit line to Mr. Kushner and his mother, according to financial documents reviewed by The Times. The bank previously had an informal ban on business with the Kushners because Jared’s father, Charles, was a felon. In 2012, Jared Kushner recommended that the editor of The Mortgage Observer, one of the publications he owned, write a profile of Ms. Vrablic. The editor, Carl Gaines, knew Mr. Kushner was her client and objected, according to a person familiar with the exchange. “Just go meet with her,” Mr. Kushner said. “You’ll figure something out.” A gauzy profile of Ms. Vrablic was published in February 2013. Shortly afterward, the private bank produced a promotional video featuring some of its marquee clients. The video was played at a retreat for Deutsche Bank’s senior leadership in Barcelona. In it, Ivanka Trump extolled the private bank’s work with her family and thanked their relationship manager, according to two people who saw the video. In early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans. The owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion. Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion. Mr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trump’s wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had reached a similar conclusion. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trump’s bid, according to an executive involved. Mr. Trump’s bid did not win, but another lending opportunity soon arose. A federal agency had selected Mr. Trump to transform the Old Post Office Building in Washington into a luxury hotel. But his financial partner — the private equity firm Colony Capital, run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr. — pulled out. Mr. Trump needed nearly $200 million. Because of his decades-long pattern of defaults and his increasingly polarizing political rhetoric — among other things, he had been spreading a lie about President Barack Obama being born overseas — Mr. Trump remained untouchable for most banks. Ms. Vrablic was willing to help. In a memo outlining the rationale for the Old Post Office loan, Ms. Vrablic said Mr. Trump was expected to add large sums to his brokerage account if he received the loan, according to an executive who read the document. This time, there was less internal opposition. One reason: Mr. Jain — by then the bank’s co-chief executive — had a solid relationship with Ms. Vrablic. Mr. Jain accompanied her to meetings with high-profile clients, and he praised her work to colleagues, multiple executives said. On a foggy Wednesday in February 2013, Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Jain went to Trump Tower to meet with Mr. Trump, according to two executives with knowledge of the meeting. Ms. Vrablic’s rapport with the client was immediately clear: Mr. Trump’s assistant greeted her as an old friend, and she seemed relaxed with Mr. Trump and his daughter, one executive said. They discussed Mr. Trump’s finances over lunch, and Mr. Jain said he was surprised by his low level of debt, the executives said. After lunch, Ms. Vrablic told her colleagues that Mr. Jain had sounded upbeat about Mr. Trump’s finances. A $170 million loan to pay for the overhaul of the Old Post Office went through in 2015, and Mr. Trump added more money to his brokerage account. (In May 2016, he reported up to $46 million of stocks and bonds in the account.) On Aug. 6, 2015, Mr. Trump participated in the first Republican presidential debate. He clashed with the Fox News moderator, Megyn Kelly. He flew back to New York early the next morning. That evening, he called in to a CNN talk show and said of Ms. Kelly that there was “blood coming out of her wherever.” In the intervening hours, Mr. Trump had used a black Sharpie to sign documents for another loan from Deutsche Bank: $19 million for the Doral resort. That brought to more than $300 million the total lent under Ms. Vrablic. On the campaign trail, rivals assailed Mr. Trump’s financial history. In response, he pointed to Deutsche Bank-funded successes like the Old Post Office project, now a gleaming hotel a few blocks from the White House. In early 2016, Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic for one final loan, for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. Ms. Vrablic said yes, but a fight soon erupted. Jacques Brand, who was in charge of Deutsche Bank’s American businesses, angrily objected, partly because of Mr. Trump’s divisive rhetoric. Ms. Vrablic appealed the decision. Senior executives in Frankfurt, including Christian Sewing, who would become chief executive in 2018, were shocked that the private bank would consider lending Mr. Trump money during the campaign, bank officials said. The bank’s reputational risk committee killed the transaction in March 2016. That same month, as The Times was preparing an article about Mr. Trump’s excommunication from Wall Street, he cited his warm relationship with Deutsche Bank. “They are totally happy with me,” he said to The Times. “Why don’t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic. She is the boss.” After Mr. Trump won the election, Deutsche Bank’s board of directors rushed to understand how the bank had become the biggest lender to the president-elect. A report prepared by the board’s integrity committee concluded that executives in the private-banking division were so determined to win business from big-name clients that they had ignored Mr. Trump’s reputation for demagogy and defaults, according to a person who read the report. The review also found that Deutsche Bank had produced a number of “exposure reports” that flagged the growing business with Mr. Trump, but that they had not been adequately reviewed by senior executives. On Deutsche Bank’s trading floor, managers began warning employees not to use the word “Trump” in communications with people outside the bank. Salesmen who violated the edict were scolded by compliance officers who said the bank feared stoking public interest in its ties to the new president. One reason: If Mr. Trump were to default on his loans, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between seizing his assets or cutting him a lucrative break — a situation the bank would rather resolve in private. Two years after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The chamber’s financial services and intelligence committees opened investigations into Deutsche Bank’s relationship with Mr. Trump. Those inquiries, as well as the New York attorney general’s investigation, come at a perilous time for Deutsche Bank, which is negotiating to merge with another large German lender. Next month, Deutsche Bank is likely to start handing over extensive internal documents and communications about Mr. Trump to the congressional committees, according to people briefed on the process. Ms. Vrablic, who is intensely private and rarely discusses her personal life with colleagues, declined to comment. People familiar with her thinking said she expected to be called to testify publicly on Capitol Hill.",The New York Times
2019,"A Mass Murder of, and for, the Internet","The Shift Before entering a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, the site of one of the deadliest mass murders in the country’s history, a gunman paused to endorse a YouTube star in a video that appeared to capture the shooting. “Remember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie,” he said. To an untrained eye, this would have seemed like a bizarre detour. But the people watching the video stream recognized it as something entirely different: a meme. Like many of the things done before the attack on Friday — like the posting of a 74-page manifesto that named a specific internet figure — the PewDiePie endorsement served two purposes. For followers of the killer’s videostream, it was a kind of satirical Easter egg. “Subscribe to PewDiePie,” which began as a grass-roots online attempt to keep the popular YouTube entertainer from being dethroned as the site’s most-followed account, has morphed into a kind of all-purpose cultural bat signal for the young and internet-absorbed. For everyone else, it was a booby trap, a joke designed to ensnare unsuspecting people and members of the media into taking it too literally. The goal, if there was one, may have been to pull a popular internet figure into a fractious blame game and inflame political tensions everywhere. In a tweet early Friday morning, PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, said, “I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person.” New Zealand authorities have identified an accused gunman as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, but it remains unclear if he acted alone. The details that have emerged about the Christchurch shooting — at least 49 were killed in an attack on two mosques — are horrifying. But a surprising thing about it is how unmistakably online the violence was, and how aware the shooter on the videostream appears to have been about how his act would be viewed and interpreted by distinct internet subcultures. In some ways, it felt like a first — an internet-native mass shooting, conceived and produced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism. The attack was teased on Twitter, announced on the online message board 8chan and broadcast live on Facebook. The footage was then replayed endlessly on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit, as the platforms scrambled to take down the clips nearly as fast as new copies popped up to replace them. In a statement on Twitter, Facebook said it had “quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,” and was taking down instances of praise or support for the shooting. YouTube said it was “working vigilantly to remove any violent footage” of the attack. Reddit said in a statement that it was taking down “content containing links to the video stream or manifesto.” transcript Even the language used to describe the attack before the fact framed it as an act of internet activism. In a post on 8chan, the shooting was referred to as a “real life effort post.” An image was titled “screw your optics,” a reference to a line posted by the man accused in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that later became a kind of catchphrase among neo-Nazis. And the manifesto — a wordy mixture of white nationalist boilerplate, fascist declarations and references to obscure internet jokes — seems to have been written from the bottom of an algorithmic rabbit hole. It would be unfair to blame the internet for this. Motives are complex, lives are complicated, and we don’t yet know all the details about the shooting. Anti-Muslim violence is not an online phenomenon, and white nationalist hatred long predates 4Chan and Reddit. But we do know that the design of internet platforms can create and reinforce extremist beliefs. Their recommendation algorithms often steer users toward edgier content, a loop that results in more time spent on the app, and more advertising revenue for the company. Their hate speech policies are weakly enforced. And their practices for removing graphic videos — like the ones that circulated on social media for hours after the Christchurch shooting, despite the companies’ attempts to remove them — are inconsistent at best. We also know that many recent acts of offline violence bear the internet’s imprint. Robert Bowers, the man charged with killing 11 people and wounding six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, was a frequent user of Gab, a social media platform beloved by extremists. Cesar Sayoc, the man charged with sending explosives to prominent critics of President Trump last year, was immersed in a cesspool of right-wing Facebook and Twitter memes. People used to conceive of “online extremism” as distinct from the extremism that took form in the physical world. If anything, the racism and bigotry on internet message boards felt a little less dangerous than the prospect of Ku Klux Klan marches or skinhead rallies. [Read about the challenges of reporting on a shooting that was set up “as almost an internet performance.”] Now, online extremism is just regular extremism on steroids. There is no offline equivalent of the experience of being algorithmically nudged toward a more strident version of your existing beliefs, or having an invisible hand steer you from gaming videos to neo-Nazism. The internet is now the place where the seeds of extremism are planted and watered, where platform incentives guide creators toward the ideological poles, and where people with hateful and violent beliefs can find and feed off one another. So the pattern continues. People become fluent in the culture of online extremism, they make and consume edgy memes, they cluster and harden. And once in a while, one of them erupts. In the coming days, we should attempt to find meaning in the lives of the victims of the Christchurch attack, and not glorify the attention-grabbing tactics of the gunman. We should also address the specific horror of anti-Muslim violence. At the same time, we need to understand and address the poisonous pipeline of extremism that has emerged over the past several years, whose ultimate effects are impossible to quantify but clearly far too big to ignore. It’s not going away, and it’s not particularly getting better. We will feel it for years to come.",The New York Times
2019,A Memoir of Black Life in the ‘Other America’,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SURVIVAL MATH Notes on an All-American Family By Mitchell S. Jackson In a conversation published in Essence magazine in 1984, Audre Lorde and James Baldwin engaged in an impassioned debate centered on the plight of black people living under the weight of racism in America. Baldwin thought Lorde was too hard on black men — who he argued are beset by racism in exceptionally pernicious ways — when she criticized their treatment of black girls and women. Lorde was as concerned about misogyny as racism, but Baldwin demanded to know how she could “blame the black man for a situation which has nothing to do with him.” Ever the master of black feminist poetics, Lorde was also a sage who knew how to reframe fragile arguments into teachable observations. “I’m not interested in blame,” she said. “I’m interested in changing.” This was Lorde’s challenge, her mandate to black male writers: an insistence that black men reckon with both racism and their complicity in patriarchy. Mitchell S. Jackson’s memoir, “Survival Math,” is his response. Jackson’s work is a model of autobiographical writing that demonstrates how reportage and critical attention to the complexities of black life — its intersectional textures — can be the source material for an inimitable memoir. He offers an account of his own family’s existence in Oregon, a predominantly white state where, until 1926, it was still illegal for black people to take up residence. Jackson’s maternal great-grandparents, Mama Edie and Bubba, would later make their home in a “white house the size of a small palace” on the corner of Sixth and Mason in Portland after the exclusionary law was overturned. Like so many other black people, Jackson’s progenitors “transformed themselves — in no small part by forging lives for themselves outside of the South — into as much of a nation as they have ever been (it seems sometimes into as much of one as they may ever be) in the Other America.” Jackson’s story of a black family living in Oregon feels particularly timely. He grew up surrounded by the kind of white, working-class and overlooked people who make up Donald Trump’s base and have been seen as responsible for his rise. “Survival Math” reminds us that a place like Oregon, where part of that “Other America” lives, is not uniformly white. Black people are also part of its history. And their quests to live, survive and be remembered are as worthy of book-length treatments as those of their white counterparts. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list. ] Throughout “Survival Math,” Jackson writes with a keen attentiveness to the social contexts shaping the lives of his family, offering nuanced depictions that upend the stereotypes that often cage us in. His is, after all, “the generation of babies born-and-raised in the ’70s and ’80s whose lives were transformed by an unprecedented phenomenological portent. We being the first generation of crack dealers who were the children of crack addicts.” Some of his family members were indeed crack dealers and crack addicts; some were also pimps, gangbangers and prostitutes. And he pairs the vivid everyday insights of those black people — especially those imagined as incapable of depth, of appreciating virtue and its manifestations — with those of lauded white philosophers and theorists, like Plato, Kant and Baudelaire. Jackson refuses to describe his people as lacking love or being unworthy of love. In one of many heartbreaking scenes, he recalls the death of his aunt Essie Carie Jackson, who was a prostitute. She was murdered at a young age, but he describes her as a “beloved aunt, cousin, sister, daughter, mother.” It takes courage not to shy away from writing what is true — even when the truth is painful. In his notes, Jackson writes to his “fam” to justify including the story of Essie’s life and tragic murder. He laments that “it ain’t easy writing about folks you love and about the loved ones of folks you love. There’s often a decision between protecting who you love and protecting the integrity of what you set out to do.” Jackson characterizes neither his people nor himself as perfect, but at the same time he refuses to treat them as disposable. He exposes their inner lives, then approaches them with radical love. And to love, as Jackson seems to understand, is to avoid lying. So he grapples honestly, for instance, with the role of the father figures in his life: “I had a father,” he writes, “because I made one. Or rather, I composed a father from the men at hand, brothers who kept me long before Obama made it a project.” His composite father consisted of his mother’s boyfriend Big Chris; his maternal grandfather, Sam; his maternal uncle, Anthony; his basketball coach Dixon; and his biological father, Wesley. Yet their part in raising and mentoring Jackson did not mean these men always made the best choices. He is clear that “not a single man I mentioned has existed in my life beyond critique.” Nor has Jackson himself existed beyond critique, and he freely admits to being “a flawed human striving, striving.” One of the most striking facets of Jackson’s book is the way he bares himself — and here he most clearly answers Audre Lorde’s request of black men to commit to internal work that can result in change and accountability. Jackson, like his contemporary Kiese Laymon, author of the recent memoir “Heavy,” has produced a work that faces this task head on, work Jackson refers to as “revision.” He seeks to determine “if it’s possible to apply the skills for revising the page to revising a life, and if that revision or revisioning could transform what someone had misperceived or forecasted as their fate.” His book is a testament that revision is not only possible but necessary. Where Jackson demonstrates this most plainly is in his worthy decision to include “victim statements” from five of his previous intimate partners, who attest to the ways he too has oppressed. The result is unlike anything readers may have come upon before in a memoir: a stunning move from blame to an honest calculation of how one black man’s actions and inactions hurt the black women he claimed to love. The epilogue, which is a letter to Jackson’s daughter, Justice, is bountiful in sweetness, but it too contains the words of a person who has come to realize that the inheritances we leave — our presences, absences, lies, gifts, hurts, truths — are never passed along without consequences. The choices we make, the manipulations and contortions we go through in order to survive in these United States, are always shaped by what the scholar Saidiya Hartman has described (in her book “Lose Your Mother”) as an entrenched “racial calculus and a political arithmetic.” “Survival Math” makes it clear that blackness is never a deficit. And yet as Jackson reminds us, even those of us who are black men must be certain not to rely on a computational system, steeped in anti-black racist patriarchy, to save ourselves while harming others.",The New York Times
2019,A Mini History of Our Mini Crossword,"Times Insider The Times’s little crossword puzzle started out as a big experiment. We never expected that the form would find a devoted following all its own. Andrew Sondern/The New York Times It wasn’t exactly an auspicious start. Within hours of publishing The Times’s first Mini crossword, I’d set off a round of social media hand-wringing for including an abbreviated internet profanity, leading to some nervous moments when I wondered whether my first day on the job would also be my last. (I quickly edited the clue to reference a musical group — “Pop duo with the 2011 #1 hit ‘Party Rock Anthem’” — instead of the slang.) This was back in the summer of 2014 — Aug. 21, to be exact. In the preceding months, The Times had designed and launched a new crossword app, and the Mini was part of the new package. The idea was simple: We wanted a way to encourage more people to try the main New York Times crossword puzzle, which is considered one of the toughest — and which many beginner solvers find overly intimidating. Enter the Mini. In consultation with The Times’s crosswords editor Will Shortz, the product director Matt Hural alighted on the concept of adding a 5x5 crossword to the app, essentially a bite-size version of the regular puzzle. It would be offered every day, for free, right next to the main puzzle. The hope was that it would bring beginner solvers back each day until they were prepared to scale up. As luck would have it, I was graduating college that same year. After several summers spent as an intern, I had recently been hired full-time as Will Shortz’s editorial assistant. I was asked if I wanted to take on this Mini crossword gig and, of course, eagerly accepted. I had made 25 full-size puzzles for The Times at that point, but this was a puzzle size and format that I had never tried before. And unlike other new products for The Times that might undergo rigorous user testing and market research, the actual content of the puzzles was left entirely up to me. So the early days of the Mini were experimental, to put it kindly. Many of the initial Minis, for example, contained squares that were only crossed by one answer rather than two, a normally verboten feature in Times crosswords. And while I generally steered clear of text slang after that early fiasco, the rest of that first year was spent fiddling on an almost daily basis with the difficulty, tone and references, not sure what was going to set this little puzzle apart. Over time, however, I grew to realize that the Mini had a few inherent advantages over its bigger counterpart. First, its diminutive size was actually a huge plus for a new generation of solvers. Because it took only a minute or two to complete, it was perfect for this mobile age of scattered attention spans and fractured free time. Second, its relative ease of completion made it the perfect steppingstone for solvers who’d long been intimidated by the difficulty of the main puzzle. A large, untapped audience of beginners were now experiencing the joy of filling in that last square. And finally, because every puzzle was made a few days before its publication date, the puzzle naturally felt more topical, with tie-ins to modern news or politics appearing days after they happened. In late 2015, the Mini was incorporated into the main news app, and the audience for the puzzle took off. Today it’s solved by hundreds of thousands of people across several platforms: in the newspaper, on nytimes.com, in our app. For a while it even appeared in The Times’s daily Snapchat story. As the person responsible for making each puzzle, it’s been both thrilling and stress-inducing. After all, there are only so many vowel-heavy five-letter words. (Thanks, OBAMA!) Sometimes I do genuinely worry that I’ll run out of ideas. My solution has been to draw inspiration for puzzle seed words from all parts of life — a conversation with a friend, the book I’m reading, what’s going on in the news. That way, the puzzle stays just as fresh for me as it does for the solver.

2019,Opinion | A Mini-Revolt by Republican Senators Against Trump,"letters One reader terms the vote to overturn the emergency declaration just “a symbolic slap on the wrist,” while another calls those who sided with the president “spineless.” To the Editor: Re “12 G.O.P. Senators Defect to Block Emergency Move” (front page, March 15): Perhaps, given the times, it is remarkable that 12 Republican senators defied President Trump’s trampling on the separation of powers by voting to block his national emergency declaration over border wall funding. But more remarkable is that 41 Republicans did not join them. It is spineless to fail to challenge this president on a blatant, authoritarian-type power grab that defies the Constitution that the senators have sworn to uphold. It is craven to cast a vote out of fear that Mr. Trump will seek revenge by suggesting that someone else ought to hold your Senate seat if you do not bend to his will. And yet, this is what they did. So while we give a shout-out to those 12 Republican senators who made the principled call, let us ponder what it says about the ones who did not. Felicia MassarskyAtlantic City To the Editor: Re “Cracks in the Senate’s Red Wall” (editorial, March 15): Let us not overreact to this action by a handful of Republican senators. It is not nearly time to suggest Mr. Trump’s unfettered desecration of our democracy is nearing a conclusion. What Mr. Trump did was blatantly defy the will of Congress in his declaration of a national emergency. It was not the policy but merely the procedure, the stripping of the power of Congress to control the purse strings, that was the precipitating cause for this mini-revolt. But fundamentally this was little but a symbolic slap on the wrist, quickly undone by presidential veto. And life will quickly return to the normal that we have unfortunately come to know. There will be no talk, at least no serious talk, of Republicans joining in a call for impeachment. There has been no growing of a backbone, no declaration that this is an irreparable bridge too far. It is a welcome moment when there is even a hint of something other than pure capitulation to Mr. Trump’s whims and tantrums. But unless and until he puts a crown on and announces he is now king, there will be no Republican mutiny. Just the occasional reminder that some in his party will not permit the president to cast all their votes for them. Robert S. NussbaumFort Lee, N.J.",The New York Times

They were staying in a tiny bungalow in Far Rockaway, Queens, that belonged to Kirad’s aunt. The only common space was a kitchen just big enough to squeeze in a love seat and a small table. Every surface was covered with pots and pans, cereal boxes and bags of food. “We fight sometimes over the TV,” Kirad said, “because my mom wants to watch something and I want to watch something different so I go to my aunt’s room.” For the most part, they have made it work. As cramped as it is in this tiny room, Kirad had hoped to have one more family member sharing this space: her older sister, Susan. She and her mother last saw Susan in July, when they crossed the Mexican border into Eagle Pass, Tex. The family of three was seeking asylum. Kirad and her mother, Ana Batiz, were allowed to pursue their case in immigration court, and went on to New York. But Susan was not. She was sent back to Honduras by herself. “I’m sure my mother would sleep on the couch or on the floor or whatever for the three of us to be together,” Kirad said. “I have never been away from them,” Ms. Batiz said of her daughters. This is a story about the brutal math that asylum seekers face at the border today. In this case, a mother and a daughter with virtually identical circumstances try to immigrate to the United States. Each has an interview with an asylum officer that could alter their lives forever. [Read about a family’s experiences in the hours before the father of five children is deported.] One persuades her interviewer that returning to Honduras was too dangerous; she enters the country to pursue an asylum claim. The other, an 18-year-old, fails that same test. As a result, she is separated from her only family and sent back, alone, to an environment where she feels threatened every day. When Ana Batiz and her daughters arrived at the border, she did not even realize they had crossed illegally. She said she did not know there was an official point of entry at Eagle Pass, she said, so they waded across the dangerous waters of the Rio Grande with other migrants. Ms. Batiz left her small village on the Atlantic coast of Honduras with plans to seek asylum, because she was persecuted for having H.I.V. “I don’t think it’s right,” she said, “for someone to tell you, ‘You should die.’” The family did not join a caravan. She said they hitched rides with other Hondurans heading north. It all fell apart when they got to the Texas border. Ms. Batiz and her two daughters were taken to what immigrants call a hielera, Spanish for “icebox,” a processing center run by Customs and Border Protection. That night of their arrival at Eagle Pass, according to Kirad, border agents took Susan, along with about 10 others, all young men, out of the room. “They told my mother that they were going to take me out and bring me right back,” Susan recalled. But she didn’t return. Long before the Trump administration’s recent policy of separating migrant children from their parents, Customs and Border Protection agents have been taking children ages 18 and over away from their parents. This is because the agency considers them to be legal adults, who should be sent to adult detention centers instead of staying with families. With the current surge in families crossing the border, this means even more 18-year-olds could find themselves separated from their parents. But there’s a paradox here. Although Susan was considered an adult at the border, she would have been considered a child in the United States as an immigrant seeking asylum. That’s because older teens like Susan fall into conflicting categories under U.S. immigration policies. The Immigration and Nationality Act defines anyone under 21 and unmarried as a child. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also uses this definition and allows children under 21 to accompany their parents to asylum interviews. These interviews are crucial because they determine whether a migrant can stay in the country and pursue their case in immigration court. As an adult at the border, Susan had been separated from her family, so she couldn’t attend her mother’s asylum interview. She would have to fend for herself. Until 2010, people with H.I.V. were actually banned from entering the United States. When that changed, people with H.I.V. could also seek asylum in the U.S. if they were persecuted for it in their home country. Ms. Batiz and her daughters made a strong case that they were. She has asked that we not use the last names of her daughters out of fear for their safety. In their small Honduran town, Ms. Batiz’s family was part of the Garifuna community, descendants of enslaved Africans and indigenous Central Americans. The Garifuna tend to be extremely poor, and they have the highest rate of H.I.V. transmissions in Honduras. Ms. Batiz said she learned she was infected only after Kirad was born. She felt ill and went to a doctor, who told her the news: She was H.I.V. positive and had been for years. Her boyfriend, who most likely infected her, left. “He abandoned us,” she said. He’s the father of her three youngest daughters (she has two older children from a previous relationship). She had the girls tested. Susan, the middle child, was H.I.V. positive too. Ms. Batiz turned to a nongovernmental organization in Honduras that helps people with H.I.V. She became an H.I.V. educator. Soon, Ms. Batiz was working for the organization, attending protests to demand more medicine. One time, she said, police used tear gas and hoses on demonstrators. She was also featured in a 2013 video by the Pulitzer Center about what it’s like to be Garifuna and living with H.I.V. Her descriptions are reminiscent of AIDS activists in the U.S. during the 1980s who were part of the protest movement Act Up. Ms. Batiz said this activity made her an easy target in Honduras. She was a black woman with H.I.V., protesting for better conditions, and living in a place where people are terrified of AIDS. “Sometimes I was walking down the street and some people would see me and say, ‘Here comes the one with SIDA,’” she said, using the Spanish word for AIDS. “It’s very difficult situation to be there as an activist.” Officially, Honduras has stronger protections for people with H.I.V. than some of its neighbors. But the reality, according to Amnesty International and the U.S. State Department, is that people with H.I.V. are routinely denied access to jobs, education and health services. “The women who are infected are considered to be dirty,” said Deborah Ottenheimer, a Manhattan-based gynecologist who does exams for women seeking asylum because of human rights abuses. She has met Honduran women with H.I.V. who experienced all types of persecution, including forced sterilization. “They can’t get jobs, they often are attacked. Their children — especially if their children are thought to be, not even known to be, but thought to be H.I.V. positive — will also be discriminated against. They won’t be allowed to go to school.” Ms. Batiz’s daughters suffered at school, especially Susan. “Everybody, all my classmates, knew about my mother and my sister, too,” Kirad recalled. She said they called Susan “sidosa,” a slur against people with AIDS. There were also vicious attacks. “They would take her to the bathroom and would put her head in the toilet,” Kirad said, adding that these were filthy toilets without modern plumbing. Kirad said she saw students push her sister’s head into a toilet on about five different occasions, and that she would try to fight the other kids in the bathroom. Susan didn’t want to tell their mother, but Kirad did. When Ms. Batiz confronted the school, she said the director behaved as though it was no big deal. At some point around 2016, things got so bad that she took both of her girls out of school and kept them at home. The next year, Ms. Batiz said her house was burned down under mysterious circumstances. No one was home at the time. She didn’t know who did it, and she didn’t contact the police because she was certain they wouldn’t investigate. But she said she knew it was arson because she smelled the gasoline. “I think they were trying to get me to leave,” she said. The family moved in with neighboring friends, but Ms. Batiz started making plans to take Kirad and Susan to stay with her sister in New York. When asylum officers conduct a credible fear interview, they ask basic questions about how a migrant was persecuted and what role the authorities played. The Trump Administration claims the bar is too low because most easily pass, even though less than a quarter actually wind up getting asylum. Migrants who pass the test can wait years for their asylum cases to go to immigration court, because of an enormous backlog. In the meantime they can qualify for working papers. The president has criticized this as “catch and release.” Ms. Batiz said her interview happened the same day she arrived at the “icebox.” She recalled the two officers who questioned her gasping when she told them how she faced discrimination for having H.I.V. “I think that’s why they took me out quickly,” she said. The next morning, Ms. Batiz and Kirad were released to go on to New York. They didn’t know what happened to Susan, only that she had been taken away hours earlier. Kirad said they asked people at the processing center but were told only that Susan was taken to a different place. “My mother started crying,” she recalled. With no additional information, they took a bus to San Antonio where they got assistance from a Catholic aid organization, which paid for them to fly to New York. Soon after arriving at her sister’s home in Far Rockaway, Ms. Batiz got a call from Susan. She was 1,900 miles away at an adult detention center in Pearsall, Tex., run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was examined by a doctor and given H.I.V. medications. But it took three weeks for her to get her credible fear interview. During that waiting period, Susan said a doctor told her that the H.I.V. drugs she was given in Honduras were not working well. She said she was also under great distress, begging other detainees in her room to let her sleep on the bottom bunk because she was afraid of heights. She had never been away from her mother before and said she was scared of the women who worked at the detention center, claiming they said cruel things to her because she was black and from Honduras. The credible fear interview took place on Aug. 8, with an asylum officer speaking English in person and a Spanish interpreter on the phone. When we spoke in January, Susan recalled telling the officer about the persecution she suffered at school. She said she described how classmates would abuse her in the bathrooms. “They would put my head in the toilet and urinate on me.” The transcript of Susan’s credible fear interview does not include this graphic incident. Regardless, it shows that Susan clearly stated that she was threatened and discriminated against, and that students wanted to kill her. “Because I am H.I.V.-positive,” she said, “and because I am black.” She said students feared she would “contaminate” them. Susan also described an episode in which her classmates beat her legs with a stick so badly that she was taken to a hospital. There, she said, the nurses gave her “dirty looks” because they “discriminate against black girls.” Police officers spoke with Susan at the hospital. She said she told them about the attack, and that they helped her by talking to the school. When asked by the asylum officer how the police treated black people and those with H.I.V., Susan answered, “They treat them well.” The asylum officer found Susan’s overall account credible. But she made a distinction that prevented Susan from moving forward with her asylum case. She checked a box that said “credible fear of persecution NOT established.” She left unchecked all of the boxes designating asylum eligibility because of persecution. These are race, religion, political activity, nationality and membership in a particular social group. This last category could include people with H.I.V. A couple of immigration and asylum experts who viewed the transcript said Susan was rightfully rejected because she said the police were helpful. Stan Weber, an immigration lawyer in Brooklyn who previously worked for ICE, said he could see that argument, in part. Mr. Weber explained that the persecution Susan described was not from “a government actor or an agent of the government.” He added, “The parties that were inflicting the persecution or the threat of persecution were private actors.” In other words, Susan was being bullied by her classmates. Nonetheless, Mr. Weber is among several experts who believe the asylum officer was unfair to Susan, noting her youth, the possibility of a language barrier and her emotional state. Early in the transcript it notes “applicant is crying.” Shortly after, there’s another red flag. “Interpreter notes that the applicant doesn’t seem to connect terms in Spanish,” the transcript read, adding that the interpreter and applicant “might not be able to understand each other clearly.” Susan speaks both Spanish and Garifuna. She was asked if she preferred a Garifuna interpreter but she responded that she was fine continuing in Spanish. Mr. Weber said that should have given the asylum officer pause. “You have an 18-year-old child separated from her parent that doesn’t speak a primary language that you’re conversing in, that the interpreter’s indicated that there’s problems understanding, and she’s crying and she has a very stigmatized condition, H.I.V. positive,” he said. “The officer, I think, blew it.” He said the asylum officer also missed an obvious opportunity to ask about Susan’s mother, because Susan stated that they came together and that her mother had gone on to New York. Susan now claims the asylum officer pressured her to say the police were helpful. Within the transcript, she also said she was threatened at school by students about 20 times and never reported these incidents to the police “out of fear, because they told me they would hurt me more if I reported it.” Later in August, Susan asked an immigration judge to review the asylum officer’s decision. But she had no lawyer, and the hearing was conducted by video. The judge denied her appeal. Susan’s family then scraped up the money to hire Elizabeth Caballero, a lawyer in Texas, who asked U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a new credible fear interview. Despite additional written testimony from Susan’s mother and sister about her persecution, she was deported. Susan was put on a plane back to Honduras in November without any advance notice, Ms. Caballero said, giving her no chance to legally intervene. In her 12 years practicing immigration law, she said, only one other client was deported without any warning. She’s still angry about it. “Here we have somebody that can actually be considered part of a particular social group,” Ms. Caballero said. “And she got denied.” A spokeswoman with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it can’t comment on individual cases. But she noted the 2010 law that allowed people with H.I.V. to enter the country. She also said the agency reviews each case on its own merit, with decisions based on relevant laws and evidence. “They didn’t want her here,” Ms. Caballero concluded, adding she suspects it’s because Susan has H.I.V. “They’re just as ignorant as the people who discriminate against her over there, in her home country.” In Queens, Ms. Batiz describes feeling at ease without the discrimination she suffered in Honduras. But she constantly worries about Susan. In January, Ms. Batiz met with her lawyer, Cristina Velez, at the Jamaica office of Queens Legal Services. They sat at a small table in a sparsely furnished conference room and made a video call to Susan in Honduras, so Ms. Velez could learn more about what happened to prepare for Ms. Batiz’s asylum claim. Susan’s oval face filled the screen of her mother’s cellphone. Now 19, she is staying with the same friends who put her family up after the 2017 fire. The two-room house is crowded, with a bedroom where seven people are sleeping. It’s crammed with belongings, and the windows are covered by wooden shutters and fabric. Susan pointed the phone to show her mother and lawyer the bright blue Caribbean sky and the bed where she sleeps. A paralegal who is fluent in Spanish was translating for Ms. Velez and everyone wanted to know one thing: Is she safe? “I do not feel safe,” Susan said through the interpreter, her voice growing animated. When Ms. Velez asked why, she described people coming to the house and threatening her. “They wear ski masks on their head and they told me that they’re going to kill me if they see me alone, and why did I come back here? I should have stayed with my mother where I was.” Susan said it has happened about six times since she returned in November, and that they sometimes pointed guns at her. “They want to kill me because I have H.I.V.,” she said. She locks herself in the house when they come. She said she doesn’t know who they are, but speculated that the men could be members of the local gangs, so common in Honduras, who have threatened her family and others in the past for refusing to cooperate with them. Susan said she only goes out with a friend occasionally, or to take a taxi to the hospital once a month for her H.I.V. medicine. After listening to this account, Ms. Velez said that Ms. Batiz has a very strong case for asylum and that Susan would have, as well. She can’t understand the logic in separating the mother and daughter. “I haven’t seen a case in which a family member who is really still dependent on the parent and whose cases overlap so entirely be separated from the family unit and not permitted to make her case,” she said. Kirad is now starting over as a freshman at a public high school in Queens with a bilingual program. She has a backpack filled with notebooks for math, history, biology and English. She thinks Susan would love the high school, and wishes they could go together. But the odds are against Susan ever joining her sister. Because she failed to persuade an asylum officer of her credible fear, and her appeal to a judge was then denied, Susan can’t try seeking asylum again. Even if she were somehow able to make the trek by herself from Honduras to the border, she would face a different process for being allowed to stay in the country because of her prior removal. The bar for passing this test would be much higher, making that “a risky proposition” according to Ms. Velez, her mother’s lawyer. Now Susan’s only hope of coming to the U.S. lies with her mother’s case. If Ms. Batiz is granted asylum, she could bring her daughter here as a dependent. Her next court date is in May, but it’s just a procedural hearing. The immigration court in New York is so backlogged it could take another year or more for her trial. Speaking from Honduras, Susan said she’s not giving up hope. She hasn’t been able to go to school for about three years. But if she makes it to the U.S., she said, she wants to go to a technical school and become a nurse. “I want to keep studying and doing something with my life,” she said.

2019,A Museum Tackles Myths About Jews and Money,"LONDON — Wrapped in a turban and a mink-lined robe, the old man sits in his opulent home, smiling wryly. The pouch in his hand is full to bursting. Gold coins are scattered across his desk. The elderly figure is pictured at the center of a board game called the New and Fashionable Game of the Jew, which was popular in early 19th-century England. An 1807 original is on view at an exhibition running through July 7 at the Jewish Museum in London called “Jews, Money, Myth.” The show explores the ways in which Jews have been associated with money over the past 2,000 years. Displays include objects that belonged to British Jews — buried medieval coins, tally sticks used as proof of loans, soup-kitchen tokens — and representations of Jews in painting; in literature, such as Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice” and Charles Dickens’s “Oliver Twist”; in caricatures; and in fascist propaganda. The Jewish Museum’s aim is to “debunk a lot of the myths that still circulate today,” said Joanne Rosenthal, the exhibition’s curator, “such as Jews exerting a kind of sinister influence on world events, Jews financing disastrous wars around the world for profit, Jews being naturally drawn to money making.” These centuries-old “tropes and stereotypes” still circulate on social media and beyond, Ms. Rosenthal added, and the exhibition invites visitors to look in a “calm and levelheaded way at the historical realities.” The show opens amid signs of a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. In a 12-country survey of Jewish respondents last year by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 89 percent said anti-Semitism was on the rise. France reported a 74 percent surge in anti-Semitic acts last year, and President Emmanuel Macron said in February that anti-Semitism was at a postwar peak. In Britain, there were 1,652 anti-Semitic incidents in 2018, up 16 percent from the year before, according to the Community Security Trust, an organization that monitors anti-Semitism in the country. The opposition Labour Party in Britain has expelled a dozen members since last April as it investigates 673 complaints of anti-Semitism. Since 2015, numerous members have been expelled or suspended for making anti-Semitic remarks publicly or on social media, or for joining hate groups. A 2016 inquiry concluded that there was an “occasionally toxic atmosphere” in the party. The “Jews, Money, Myth” exhibition is the brainchild of the Jewish Museum’s chief executive, Abigail Morris, who took over in 2012 and has since programmed a string of popular exhibitions. In 2015, she staged a show on the subject of blood in the Jewish religion and culture, a sensitive theme. But for many, the issue of Jews and money has proved far more unsettling, Ms. Morris said. “I’ve never done anything in my life where people have been so scared,” she said in an interview at the museum. “Even the title scares people.” She and her team noticed “a real shift” in anti-Jewish sentiment over the last two or three years, Ms. Morris said. Negative comments were now constant, rather than sporadic and linked to news coverage of Israel, she noted. “My contention is, it’s there, it’s getting bigger,” she said. “Not drawing attention to it won’t make it go away.” The exhibition draws primarily on the museum’s own collection of historical objects from Britain, though there are also many from elsewhere in Europe. It opens with an entry from the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary that lists one of the definitions of the word “jew” as a verb meaning “to cheat.” The myth of Jews and money can be traced back to the biblical figure of Judas, who betrayed Christ in exchange for some silver coins. In the show’s star attraction, Rembrandt’s “Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver,” on loan from a private collection, Judas is pictured on his knees, begging a group of priests for forgiveness. The exhibition then recounts the arrival of the first Jews to England, soon after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Some worked in money lending and finance. One of the displays has a claim to being the world’s earliest anti-Jewish caricature: a doodle at the top of a 1233 record for taxes paid by Jews in Norwich, England. It depicts the wealthy Isaac of Norwich, a local money lender, as a three-headed Antichrist figure. By the 19th century, Jews were regularly portrayed as beggars or poverty-stricken peddlers — the exhibition describes how most Jews in England at that time were economic migrants with limited financial means who were forced to scrape together a living any way they could. Conversely, Jews were also portrayed as greedy bankers. One of the financiers who came in for much negative representation was Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who arrived from Germany in 1798, opened his namesake bank soon after, and went on to finance British military campaigns. The exhibition includes an 1837 portrait of Rothschild — as well as an 1829 caricature depicting him as an overweight figure with a sack of money slung over his shoulder, titled, “The Man Wot Knows How to Drive a Bargain.” As well as historical items, “Jews, Money, Myth” features two works of contemporary art specially commissioned for the exhibition, including one by a Turner Prize winner, Jeremy Deller. Mr. Deller’s contribution is a film: a compilation of excerpts from homemade propaganda videos from the United States and Europe, cartoons, televangelist programs, presidential speeches and political campaign ads, all of which make oblique or overt references to Jews and money. The video also features campaigners in favor of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, who were filmed outside the Houses of Parliament in London recently. One of the protesters holds a placard that equates the Jewish financier George Soros and the Rothschilds with the European Union, saying they run Britain’s “fake news” television channels. “If you go down to Parliament Square, you don’t have to try too hard or wait around too long before you see or maybe hear someone talking about Jews,” Mr. Deller said in an interview. Anti-Semitism “is here: It’s very much on the streets.” Pictured in his film and elsewhere in the exhibition is a 2012 mural in the East End of London that shows six elderly financiers seated around a Monopoly board that rests on the backs of what appear to be naked slaves. When the mural’s creator complained of its removal by local authorities in 2012, he was defended on Facebook by the Labour leader Mr. Corbyn, stoking the criticism of his party’s attitudes toward Jews. Mr. Corbyn later apologized and said he had not examined the image closely, describing the mural as “deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic.” David Feldman, a professor of history at Birkbeck, University of London who is director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism (which was consulted for the exhibition), said the left sometimes did not initially identify certain patterns of behavior as racist or anti-Semitic. Jews are “predominantly a middle-class population in Britain, so they don’t fit the idea of what a victim of racism ought to look like,” Professor Feldman said. “There is an expectation that the victims of racism are people of color, that they’re poor, and that in the case of Europe, either they or their forebears were colonial subjects.” Professor Feldman added that anti-Jewish sentiment was creeping more into the mainstream. “We have a situation in which people with anti-Semitic views are becoming bolder and more visible,” he said. “It is this which creates concern.”",The New York Times
2019,A NASA Journey to the Moon May Need to Find Another Rocket or Two,"Mounting delays to the Space Launch System, primarily built by Boeing, are leading the agency to consider alternative forms of transport. Struggling to get its new giant rocket ready in time for a scheduled launch next year, NASA might just leave it on the ground and turn to commercial alternatives. “NASA has a history of not meeting launch dates,” said Jim Bridenstine, NASA’s administrator, at a Senate committee hearing on Wednesday, “and I’m trying to change that.” NASA plans to send its Orion capsule, designed to carry astronauts on deep space missions, on a crewless test trip around the moon next year. But the schedule for completing the rocket that is to carry Orion — known as the Space Launch System — has slipped repeatedly despite NASA’s spending more than $10 billion on the program so far. Last year, in announcing the latest delay, NASA said that the mission was penciled in for the end of 2019 but even then conceded that June 2020 was a more realistic target date. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] In October, NASA’s inspector general issued a report that was sharply critical of Boeing, the rocket’s prime contractor. “Cost increases and schedule delays of core stage development can be traced largely to management, technical, and infrastructure issues driven by Boeing’s poor performance,” the report said. “For example, Boeing officials have consistently underestimated the scope of the work to be performed and thus the size and skills of the work force required.” On Wednesday, Mr. Bridenstine said that last week it had become clear that the rocket would probably not be ready even by June 2020. He said he had directed managers to explore whether there would be another way to launch. “The goal is to get back on track,” Mr. Bridenstine said. He said the space agency would make a decision “in the next couple of weeks,” and that it might require additional money from Congress. The largest rockets currently built by private companies are smaller than the Space Launch System, so if NASA decides on this approach, the payload for the mission would need to be split between two rockets. The Orion capsule and its service module, a component built by the European Space Agency to provide power and propulsion, would ride to orbit on one rocket. A fueled rocket stage for propelling Orion to the moon would go up separately. The two pieces would then rendezvous and dock in orbit before heading to the moon. Mr. Bridenstine noted that Orion currently lacks the ability to dock with another spacecraft in orbit. “Between now and June of 2020, we would have to make that a reality,” Mr. Bridenstine said. Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi and chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, noted: “This is 2019.” A commercially launched mission would allow extended testing of Orion and the service module, one of the main goals, but it would push the first flight of the Space Launch System further into the future. Mr. Bridenstine did not name which commercial rockets might be used, but the two that are powerful enough are the Delta 4 Heavy from the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and the Falcon Heavy from SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Elon Musk. The Orion has been launched once already on top of a Delta 4 Heavy, in 2014, for a crewless test flight, but that did not go to the moon. The Falcon Heavy has only flown on its February 2018 test launch. At the hearing, Mr. Bridenstine continued to describe the big NASA rocket as a core component of the space agency’s plans. But if the commercial approach works for the test flight, some space watchers wonder why the same strategy would not work for missions carrying astronauts. NASA may move away from the Space Launch System and use less expensive commercial rockets for other missions as well, including for pieces of the Lunar Gateway, a planned outpost in orbit around the moon, and the launching of the Europa Clipper, a robotic mission to study one of Jupiter’s moons. In its budget proposal for fiscal year 2020, the Trump administration is also proposing the delay of an upgrade to the second stage of the Space Launch System that Boeing is working on. That is not needed for the early missions but will enable the transport of heavier payloads to space.",The New York Times
2019,A New Age of Warfare: How Internet Mercenaries Do Battle for Authoritarian Governments,"Sophisticated surveillance, once the domain of world powers, is increasingly available on the private market. Smaller countries are seizing on the tools — sometimes for darker purposes. NSO, a private company based in Herzliya, Israel, has hired former government hackers to ply their trades for foreign governments.CreditCreditCorinna Kern for The New York Times The man in charge of Saudi Arabia’s ruthless campaign to stifle dissent went searching for ways to spy on people he saw as threats to the kingdom. He knew where to go: a secretive Israeli company offering technology developed by former intelligence operatives. It was late 2017 and Saud al-Qahtani — then a top adviser to Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince — was tracking Saudi dissidents around the world, part of his extensive surveillance efforts that ultimately led to the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In messages exchanged with employees from the company, NSO Group, Mr. al-Qahtani spoke of grand plans to use its surveillance tools throughout the Middle East and Europe, like Turkey and Qatar or France and Britain. The Saudi government’s reliance on a firm from Israel, an adversary for decades, offers a glimpse of a new age of digital warfare governed by few rules and of a growing economy, now valued at $12 billion, of spies for hire. Today even the smallest countries can buy digital espionage services, enabling them to conduct sophisticated operations like electronic eavesdropping or influence campaigns that were once the preserve of major powers like the United States and Russia. Corporations that want to scrutinize competitors’ secrets, or a wealthy individual with a beef against a rival, can also command intelligence operations for a price, akin to purchasing off-the-shelf elements of the National Security Agency or the Mossad. [For more stories about the changing nature of warfare, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] NSO and a competitor, the Emirati firm DarkMatter, exemplify the proliferation of privatized spying. A monthslong examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with current and former hackers for governments and private companies and others as well as a review of documents, uncovered secret skirmishes in this burgeoning world of digital combat. The firms have enabled governments not only to hack criminal elements like terrorist groups and drug cartels but also in some cases to act on darker impulses, targeting activists and journalists. Hackers trained by United States spy agencies caught American businesspeople and human rights workers in their net. Cybermercenaries working for DarkMatter turned a prosaic household item, a baby monitor, into a spy device. The F.B.I. is investigating current and former American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The inquiry intensified after a former N.S.A. hacker working for the company grew concerned about its activities and contacted the F.B.I., Reuters reported. NSO and DarkMatter also compete fiercely with each other, paying handsomely to lure top hacking talent from Israel, the United States and other countries, and sometimes pilfering recruits from each other, The Times found. The Middle East is the epicenter of this new era of privatized spying. Besides DarkMatter and NSO, there is Black Cube, a private company run by former Mossad and Israeli military intelligence operatives that gained notoriety after Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood mogul, hired it to dig up dirt on his accusers. Psy-Group, an Israeli company specializing in social media manipulation, worked for Russian oligarchs and in 2016 pitched the Trump campaign on a plan to build an online army of bots and avatars to swing Republican delegate votes. Last year, a wealthy American businessman, Elliott Broidy, sued the government of Qatar and a New York firm run by a former C.I.A. officer, Global Risk Advisors, for what he said was a sophisticated breach of his company that led to thousands of his emails spilling into public. Mr. Broidy said that the operation was motivated by hard-nosed geopolitics: At the beginning of the Trump administration, he had pushed the White House to adopt anti-Qatar policies at the same time his firm was poised to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts from the United Arab Emirates, the archrival to Qatar. A judge dismissed Mr. Broidy’s lawsuit, but suspicions have grown that Qatar had a hand in other operations, including the hacking and leaking of the emails of Yousef al-Otaiba, the influential Emirati ambassador in Washington. The rapid expansion of this global high-tech battleground, where armies of cybermercenaries clash, has prompted warnings of a dangerous and chaotic future. “Even the smallest country, on a very low budget, can have an offensive capability,” or initiate online attacks against adversaries, said Robert Johnston, founder of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin and a key investigator on Russia’s 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. “Qatar and U.A.E. are going after each other, and that war is getting very, very bloody. “The barriers to entry in this space are getting lower and lower.” Before NSO helped the Saudi government track its adversaries outside the kingdom, and helped the Mexican government hunt drug kingpins, and earned hundreds of millions of dollars working for dozens of countries on six continents, the company consisted of two high school friends in northern Israel with one relatively mundane idea. Using technology developed by graduates of Intelligence Unit 8200 — Israel’s equivalent of the N.S.A.— Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie started a company in 2008 that allowed cellphone firms to gain remote access to their customers’ devices to perform maintenance. Word spread to Western spy services, whose operatives spotted an opportunity. At the time, American and European officials were warning that Apple, Facebook, Google and other tech giants were developing technologies that allowed criminals and terrorists to communicate through encrypted channels indecipherable to intelligence and law enforcement agencies. They called the phenomenon “going dark.” Mr. Hulio and Mr. Lavie offered a way to circumvent this problem by hacking the end points of the communications — the phones themselves — after the data were decrypted. By 2011, NSO had developed its first prototype, a mobile surveillance tool the company called Pegasus. Like its namesake, the Greek mythological winged horse, NSO’s tool could do something seemingly impossible: collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace — including phone calls, texts, emails, contacts, location and any data transmitted over apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype. “Once these companies invade your phone, they own it. You’re just carrying it around,” Avi Rosen of Kaymera Technologies, an Israeli cyberdefense company, said of NSO and its competitors. The company soon had its first client for Pegasus: the government of Mexico, which was engaged in a crackdown on drug cartels. By 2013, NSO had installed Pegasus at three Mexican agencies, according to emails obtained by The Times. The emails estimated that, altogether, the firm had sold the Mexican government $15 million worth of hardware and software. Mexico was paying the firm some $77 million to track a wide array of targets’ every move and swipe of their phone. NSO products were important to Mexico’s war against the cartels, according to four people familiar with how the Mexican government used Pegasus, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. Mexican officials have credited Pegasus as instrumental in helping track and capture El Chapo, the famed drug kingpin who was convicted last month in New York and sentenced to life in a maximum-security prison. Soon enough, NSO was selling to governments throughout the world, with the company claiming clients on every continent except Antarctica. NSO products — particularly Pegasus — helped break up terrorist cells and aided investigations into organized crime and child abduction, European intelligence and law enforcement officials said in interviews. NSO’s first client, the Mexican government, was also using the hacking tools for darker purposes — as part of a broader government and industry surveillance effort. The government used NSO products to track at least two dozen journalists, government critics, international investigators looking into the unsolved disappearance of 43 students, even backers of a soda tax, according to Times investigations and research by Citizen Lab, part of the University of Toronto. Those targets were subjected to a stream of harassing text messages that contained malware. Some messages warned that their spouses were having affairs, others that a relative had passed away. In one case, when government officials were not able to infiltrate the phone of a journalist, they targeted her 16-year-old son’s. Though NSO says it sells its services for criminal and antiterrorism investigations, none of the Mexicans known to have been targeted were suspected in criminal or terrorism investigations. “NSO technology has helped stop vicious crimes and deadly terrorist attacks around the world,” the company said in a statement. “We do not tolerate misuse of our products and we regularly vet and review our contracts to ensure they are not being used for anything other than the prevention or investigation of terrorism and crime.” The company has established an ethics committee, which decides whether it can sell its spyware to countries based on their human rights records as reported by global organizations like the World Bank’s human capital index, and other indicators. NSO would not sell to Turkey, for example, because of its poor record on human rights, current and former employees said. But on the World Bank index, Turkey ranks higher than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, both NSO clients. A spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which needs to authorize any contract that NSO wins from a foreign government, declined to answer questions about the company. A lawsuit alleged last year that in the months before his death, Saudi Arabia used NSO products to spy on Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist strangled and dismembered in October by Saudi operatives inside the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. NSO denies the accusation. Several of Mr. Khashoggi’s closest contacts were targets of NSO hacking tools, Citizen Lab reported. Without access to Mr. Khashoggi’s devices, researchers have not confirmed whether he was a direct target of NSO surveillance. Even in cases of blatant abuse, NSO continued to renew contracts with its government clients. In 2013, for instance, NSO inked its first deal with the United Arab Emirates. Within a year, the Emirati government was caught installing NSO spyware on the mobile phone of Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist. After receiving an onslaught of text messages containing links, Mr. Mansoor — a frequent target of Emirati surveillance — grew suspicious and passed the texts to security researchers, who determined the links were NSO lures that exploited vulnerabilities in Apple software to take over Mr. Mansoor’s phone. It was, researchers said, the most sophisticated spyware they had ever uncovered on a mobile device. The discovery forced Apple to release an emergency patch. But by then, Mr. Mansoor had already been fired from his job, had his passport confiscated, his car stolen, his email hacked, his location tracked, his bank account emptied of $140,000, and was beaten by strangers twice in the same week. “You start to believe your every move is watched. Your family starts to panic,” he said in an interview before he was arrested in 2017. “I have to live with that.” Even after the U.A.E. was caught spying on Mr. Mansoor, leaked invoices showed that NSO continued to sell the Emiratis millions of dollars’ worth of spyware and services. As for Mr. Mansoor, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for damaging national unity and is being held in solitary confinement, where his health is deteriorating. A flurry of news reports followed about countries using NSO products to spy on their citizens, prompting the company to temporarily rebrand itself “Q,” after James Bond’s gadget guru. Despite the bad news coverage, NSO’s value continued to skyrocket. Francisco Partners, a private equity firm, purchased a 70 percent stake in NSO for $130 million in 2013. Last month, NSO’s co-founders raised enough money to buy back a majority stake in NSO at a valuation of just under $1 billion. The London private equity firm Novalpina Capital backed the deal — making its major investors, including the Oregon state employees’ pension fund and Alaska’s sovereign wealth fund, part owners of NSO, according to public records. The proliferation of companies trying to replicate NSO’s success and compete in an estimated $12 billion market for so-called lawful intercept spyware has set off a fierce competition to hire American, Israeli and Russian veterans of the world’s most sophisticated intelligence agencies — and for the companies to poach talent from one another. In late 2017, NSO executives grew concerned about a spate of resignations. Private detectives hired to investigate soon found themselves on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, tailing a group of former NSO employees — all veterans of Israel’s Intelligence Unit 8200 — going back and forth to work at a research facility. The building was owned by a company affiliated with DarkMatter, an Emirati firm that had quietly hired the Israelis to develop technologies for the U.A.E. to conduct cyberoperations against perceived enemies at home and abroad. DarkMatter also has offices inside a gleaming tower on the highway connecting Abu Dhabi to Dubai, the same building that houses the U.A.E.’s Signals Intelligence Agency, the Emirates’ version of the N.S.A. This is not by accident. DarkMatter is effectively an arm of the state that has worked directly with Emirati intelligence operatives on numerous missions such as hacking government ministries in Turkey, Qatar and Iran and spying on dissidents inside the Emirates. DarkMatter has origins in another company, an American firm called CyberPoint that years ago won contracts from the U.A.E. to help protect the Emirates from computer attacks. CyberPoint obtained a license from the American government to work for the Emiratis, a necessary step intended to regulate the export of military and intelligence services. Many of the company’s employees had worked on highly classified projects for the N.S.A. and other American intelligence agencies. But the Emiratis had outsize ambitions and repeatedly pushed CyberPoint employees to exceed the boundaries of the company’s American license. CyberPoint rebuffed requests by Emirati intelligence operatives to try to crack encryption codes and to hack websites housed on American servers — operations that would have run afoul of American law. So in 2015 the Emiratis founded DarkMatter — forming a company not bound by United States law — and lured at least a half-dozen American employees of CyberPoint to join. Marc Baier, a former official with the N.S.A. unit that carries out advanced offensive cyberoperations, became one of the firm’s top executives. DarkMatter employed several other former N.S.A. and C.I.A. officers, according to a roster of employees obtained by The Times, some making salaries of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. “The assumption used to be that when you left the N.S.A., you’d never do that kind of offensive work again. Now, clearly there is a market for it,” said Mr. Johnston, the security expert. He worked in the military’s Cyber Command, which works closely with the N.S.A., while serving in the Marines. “The N.S.A. should consider it their responsibility to ensure that the hacking techniques taught to employees cannot be used against the United States,” he said. The company did not respond to a request to comment, nor did a spokesman for the Emirati government. Asked whether the ministry had given a license for the former Israeli intelligence operatives working for DarkMatter, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Baier also declined to comment. Current and former employees of the spy agency have a lifelong obligation to protect the United States’ secrets, said Greg Julian, a spokesman for the N.S.A. They are also required to report employment or representation with foreign governments for two years after they leave the agency, he said. Besides its breaches of foreign government ministries, DarkMatter also broke into Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts, according to former employees. DarkMatter operatives posed as family and friends of the people they targeted to lure them into opening emails that contained malware. Former employees said that DarkMatter targeted Mr. Mansoor, hacking his child’s baby monitor to eavesdrop on his family. In another operation, the company’s operatives pursued Rori Donaghy, a British activist critical of the Emirati government and its human rights record, who had also been a target of NSO spyware. DarkMatter also targeted Citizen Lab, the Canadian research organization, a former employee said. DarkMatter told the employees that spying on American citizens would be off limits, but it proved to be an empty pledge. In one operation, not previously reported, a DarkMatter subsidiary began an expansive effort to intercept cellular communications in Qatar, occasionally catching communications of Americans in the surveillance net in late 2015. One American working on the project said he raised concerns with his superiors, including a former C.I.A. officer in charge of the effort. The American, along with another, was pulled off the project and asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement. In repeated instances, DarkMatter collected information about Americans, a second former employee said. Most of those cases involved Americans who worked for foreign organizations — including human rights groups — that DarkMatter targeted because they had been critical of the Emirati government, the former employee said. DarkMatter operatives would occasionally collect passport information, applications or résumés belonging to Americans who applied to work at these organizations. One former employee said that the collection was accidental, and the records were expunged from the company’s databases. In 2017, a former N.S.A. hacker began providing F.B.I. agents with information about the company’s activities, according to the Reuters report. Foreign Policy first reported the F.B.I. investigation. The informant, Lori Stroud, said she had become concerned about the company’s surveillance of Americans. She later left the firm along with several other Americans because they could not be sure that DarkMatter was not deliberately targeting citizens. Soon, F.B.I. agents began stopping American employees at airports as they entered the United States and questioned them about DarkMatter’s operations, according to former company employees. The Justice Department’s case, run by prosecutors in Washington, focuses on internet fraud and the possibly illegal transfer of spying technology to a foreign country. But the prosecutors face headwinds, including diplomatic concerns about jeopardizing the United States’ relationship with the U.A.E. — an influential country that has developed close ties to the Trump administration — and worries about how pursuing the case could expose embarrassing details about the extent of the cooperation between DarkMatter and American intelligence agencies. And there is the reality that American laws governing this new age of digital warfare are murky, outdated, and ill-equipped to address rapid technological advances. The rules governing what American intelligence and military personnel can and cannot provide to foreign governments were meant to keep a leash on 20th-century warfare — selling missiles or planes overseas or training foreign forces on Army tactics. But they do not address hacking skills that can be honed in front of a laptop, or at the world’s most advanced intelligence agencies, and sold to the highest bidder. “The worst part of it is the weapons are easier to get,” said Brian Bartholomew, the principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, a digital security company. “You’ve got a lot of people entering the arena that are new and don’t play by the same rules,” he said. “It’s like putting a military-grade weapon in the hands of someone off the street.” An earlier version of this article misattributed the source of a valuation for the market of so-called lawful intercept spyware. The $12 billion market estimate cited by Moody’s originated from the company NSO, not Moody’s.",The New York Times
2019,A New Cheese for Your Melts,"Front Burner Quicke’s new Cheddar-style goat-and-cow milk cheese is a good melter named Lady Prue. Quicke’s, a cheesemaker in Devon, in Southern England, specializes in Cheddar and Cheddar-style cheeses. It has just released a new one, the first it’s made from a mixture of cow and goat milk. It’s not called a Cheddar, though the curds are treated by Cheddaring; they are heated, drained, piled in the cheese vat and cut in slabs. The slabs are cut again, then sliced into strips, salted and formed into wheels. The new cheese, called Lady Prue, is aged six months and clothbound, for a pale, mild-mannered and buttery slab, with a light, herbaceous tang and a sweet hint of caramel. It was designed for the American market and is a good melter. Quicke’s Lady Prue, $19.95 to $22.99 per pound, at some Whole Foods Markets.

2019,A New Editor for People Magazine,"A changing of the guard is underway at People magazine under its new ownership. Jess Cagle is stepping down after a five-year run as editor in chief. Taking his place at the publication known for its mix of celebrity news, royal gossip and heartwarming or salacious stories about ordinary Americans will be Dan Wakeford, a 44-year-old from Britain who has been deputy editor since 2015. Meredith Corporation, which acquired People’s former parent company, Time Inc., more than a year ago, announced the promotion of Mr. Wakeford on Thursday, a day after Mr. Cagle informed his staff about his departure. “I’ve decided it’s time to do some other things while I’m still young — or at least alive,” Mr. Cagle, 53, wrote in a staff memo on Wednesday. “It’s also time for me to live in Los Angeles full time under the same roof as my husband and dog.” In addition to his role at People, which is based in New York, Mr. Cagle has served as the editorial director of Meredith’s entertainment group, a job that gave him oversight of Entertainment Weekly and People en Espanol. He will leave that post, too, when his contract is up on March 31. Mr. Cagle started his career at People in 1987 as a reporter, then left to help with the launch of Entertainment Weekly in 1990. After a second go-round at People and a stint at Time magazine, he became the top editor at Entertainment Weekly in 2009. In 2014, he succeeded Larry Hackett as the People editor in chief. Under Mr. Cagle’s leadership, People reached an audience of over 100 million across all platforms. As of December, readership for digital and print issues stood at 35 million, an 8.5 percent drop from the previous year, according to Magazine Media 360’s brand audience report. “Jess is the most accomplished entertainment journalist of his generation,” Mr. Wakeford said. “It’s been an honor to work with him. I’m excited to take the mantle from him.” Mr. Wakeford, who will take over April 1, got his start in London in the late 1990s, when he worked in TV production and covered celebrity news for UK News, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. In 2000, he revamped a British magazine, Heat, increasing its circulation to nearly 600,000 from 40,000. In 2002, Mr. Wakeford moved to the United States to become the news director of In Touch Weekly, a celebrity gossip magazine started that year by Bauer Publishing and sold last year to American Media Inc., the company behind The National Enquirer. He became the editor in chief of In Touch Weekly in 2012. “It was an amazing training ground,” Mr. Wakeford said. At People, he oversaw 11 online offshoots, including Crime and Style, and expanded the magazine’s human interest storytelling and coverage of the British royal family. “We are so trusted with our readers,” Mr. Wakeford said. “And our subjects trust us. Whether we are approaching an A-lister for an interview or a crime victim, they open their doors to us.” Bruce Gersh, the president of People, Entertainment Weekly and People en Espanol, said in a statement, “Dan has an impeccable track record for shaping the editorial direction and content strategy for some of the largest brands, and that makes him the ideal choice to lead Meredith’s most profitable brand.” In recent years, Mr. Wakeford spearheaded the publication’s forays into other media, developing “People Magazine Investigates,” a crime series on the Investigation Discovery channel, among other projects. “I’m really focused on taking our brand off the printed page and into other places,” he said. After acquiring Time Inc. last year, Meredith announced that it was looking to sell Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. After a six-month search, it sold Time to the software titan Marc Benioff for $190 million. The Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon later bought Fortune for $150 million. Sports Illustrated is still on the market. The prospect of owning People, as well as its siblings Entertainment Weekly and InStyle, was one of the reasons behind Meredith’s decision to acquire Time Inc. It fits in snugly with the Iowa-based publisher’s other magazines, which include Better Homes and Gardens and Family Circle.",The New York Times
2019,A New Luxury Retreat Caters to Elderly Workers in Tech (Ages 30 and Up),"EL PESCADERO, Mexico — At a luxury resort in Baja California Sur, everyone was recovering from a long day sharing how hard it felt to be getting older. Some of the participants walked pensively along the Pacific Coast at sunset. Others read from the resort bookshelf, choosing from sections labeled: “What can death teach me about life?” and “What are the unexpected pleasures of aging?” The next day, the group would place stickers with ageist slurs all over their chests, arms and faces, and then hurl the stickers into a fire. Later, there would be healing sessions focused on intergenerational collaboration and accepting mortality. That some of those on retreat were in their 30s and 40s did not strike them as odd. The resort, called Modern Elder Academy and located in El Pescadero, Mexico, opened in November. Guests don’t check in and out as at a traditional retreat; they submit “applications” for one-week programs and, if accepted, pay “tuition” of $5,000 to secure a room and three locally sourced meals a day. Modern Elder was started by a hotelier turned Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and it is aimed at workers in the digital economy — those who feel like software is speeding up while they are slowing down, no matter how old they really are. Tech is a place where investors are wary of funding any entrepreneur born before Operation Desert Storm, where Intel is under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for age discrimination, where giants like Google and IBM regularly face the specter of class-action lawsuits from workers north of 40. In and around San Francisco, the conventional wisdom is that tech jobs require a limber, associative mind and an appetite for risk — both of which lessen with age. As Silicon Valley work culture becomes American work culture, these attitudes are spreading to all industries. More workers are finding themselves in the curious position of presenting as old while still being — technically, actuarially — quite young. And Modern Elder sees a business opportunity in selling them coping workshops, salt-air yoga and access to a shaman. Come to Baja, the sales pitch goes. It’s hard getting old, especially when the elder years start at 30. Chip Conley was surprised when he first realized his colleagues saw him as old. It was 2013, and he was 52. A longtime hotelier — he had founded the Joie de Vivre boutique hotel chain in 1987, and had a string of iconic properties to his name — he had taken a job at Airbnb, the San Francisco start-up fast upending the hospitality industry. His younger co-workers, with their zippy metabolisms and surplus collagen, started referring to him as “the elder.” Mr. Conley — who in his 20s started San Francisco’s best party motel and is a longtime Burning Man and local night-life fixture — was a little confused but resigned himself to the idea. “We are all elders in the making,” Mr. Conley said. “If you’re 40 years old and surrounded by 25-year-olds, you’re an elder.” What was hardest, though, was the loneliness. He was the oldest person he would see at work for days. “It can feel strange,” he said. As Airbnb grew, and his stock vested, Mr. Conley decided to start a new hotel with a simple premise: Embrace the term “elder.” He found a plot of land about 40 miles north of Cabo San Lucas and set to work. He remodeled a house — a grand Mexican hacienda with big wooden doors, a fountain and a courtyard. There are 18 rooms, several arranged around a pool, and the kitchen, living room and a long outdoor wooden table are communal. It all sits on a bluff overlooking the beach. As Mr. Conley began bringing friends south to test the experience, he imagined that his resort’s core demographic would be 45 to 60. But after announcing a public opening last fall, he was surprised to field interest from people in their 30s. In the nine Modern Elder sessions he’s hosted to date, the oldest participant was 74, the youngest was 30, and the average has been 52. “People feel irrelevant younger, especially in places like Silicon Valley,” Mr. Conley said. “But they’re going to live longer, so there’s excitement and bewilderment. And everyone is wondering, ‘What do we do now?’” In November, a group of 16 people, ages 37 to 67, traveled to El Pescadero to be the first Modern Elder class. I tagged along. In a van heading down an unpaved road to the facility, Cheryl Crippen, a 50-year-old clinical psychology professor, was worried. “I said before coming down, ‘I don’t do woo-woo,’ and my mom was like, ‘Don’t drink the Kool-Aid and get in a Jim Jones situation,’” Ms. Crippen said. “But I wanted a week to think. I’ve got 40 years left. What’s next? There’s always got to be something next, right?” She told her students she was going on a business trip. Mr. Conley, who is lean and sinewy, with a shaved head and bright blue eyes, greeted everyone at the doors in a tank top and flip-flops. The shaman blessing ceremony would be Tuesday morning, he said, and there was an option for private sessions that he highly recommended. (These involved sitting on a cliff and screaming.) Ms. Crippen looked nervous but put her bags away. That evening, the group had beer and white wine on the veranda. Attendants lit bug candles for the mosquitoes, and I asked a few of the guests why they had come. “I’m approaching 50 at a software company,” said Tracy Stevens, 48. “All my colleagues are 30, and I’m almost 40,” said Margareet Paauwe. “Marketing used to be about feeling. Now it’s all data and I have to speed up with the data. So I do feel older.” Those in their mid-30s today came of age on the cusp of the digital revolution. Many older Millennials didn’t have internet at home until high school, didn’t join social networking sites until college, and didn’t get an iPhone until they had already begun their careers. The arrival of Generation Z into the workplace is showing Millennials what a true digital native looks like. Their anxieties are well founded. In Silicon Valley, the hiring rate seems to slow for workers once they hit 34, according to a 2017 study by Visier, a human-resources analytics provider. The median age of a worker at Facebook, LinkedIn and SpaceX is 29, according to a recent analysis by the workplace transparency site PayScale. At Modern Elder, several people introduced themselves by rounding up their ages — one woman said she was “soon to be 39,” another was “almost 42,” and a third was “pretty soon looking at 50.” Some said they chose to come south because they thought vacationing would be more serene without 20-somethings in the mix. “I wasn’t having to think, ‘Oh, this is going to be a fashion show every day,’” said Libby Wann, 38. “It’s relaxing to know I’ll be with a group of older folks. There’s less to prove.” Dinner was meaty pasta: Modern Elder is not a health/detox retreat. Pretty soon, a majority of the group was yawning. “For those thinking it’s 11 — I’m tired! — actually, it’s just after 8 o’clock,” Mr. Conley said. He wanted them to know that here, early bedtimes were cool. “Baja midnight is at 9 p.m.” On the second day of the retreat, at 7 a.m., everyone gathered in the living room, where the tables were covered in white lilies. “We as a society do a really good job helping people through transitional times: quinceañera, graduation, wedding, baby shower,” Mr. Conley began. “But between baby shower and funeral? Nada. What we’re going to do now is create a midlife atrium.” We took turns giving emotional check-ins. Mr. Conley shared a recent cancer diagnosis. Ms. Crippen talked about a cat sanctuary she runs at her home. Others talked about divorces. A few joked about being unsure if they’re in menopause. Each elder got a binder with the week’s curriculum. Thursday, there would be a session on Millennials. This was illustrated with a young man with groomed facial hair holding a disposable coffee cup. One handout was a rainbow chart showing a life span. It began at “growth mind-set” (0-15 years old), illustrated by an egg. It went to “embodied elder” (65-85), illustrated by a butterfly. After that was just a flower — the elderflower. “The flower of a human,” Mr. Conley called it. He added that elderflower juice is quite healthy. Some of the attendees said their friends had been confused by the word. “People interpret ‘elder’ as you’re old, you’re senior,” said Lorenzo Jones, 55, an executive coach. “‘Time to go out to pasture and let us run things.’ But ‘elder’ in this context has a whole different meaning. To me, it means being relevant.” Many of the attendees said they felt shocked that age had crept up on them. “I’ve always been the youngest, and I’m kind of surprised that I’m actually getting older,” said Ms. Wann, 38, a little later, as she walked through the contemplation garden. “Now people are coming to me for advice, and I’m seeing myself as someone whose lived experience is worth passing on.” Mr. Conley had established an open kitchen, and we were encouraged to eat any snacks we liked (almonds, prunes, dates) and also to do our own dishes. He also issued us Modern Elder flip-flops. The bottom of one read “GROW,” and the other “WHOLE.” People put them on and headed to the beach. Ms. Stevens observed that talking about aging was enlivening. “It’s not making me think about death at all,” she said. “It’s making me think about the life I have left.” After beach meditation (“Our bodies are made of water and minerals and we are sitting here with water and minerals,” said the guide), the group wandered the shore collecting sticks. They dug them into sand at the high-tide line, making a stick wall. We watched them fall all week as the water rose up, picking off sticks a few at a time and dragging them out to sea. Mr. Conley said this was one of the most important symbols. The next morning, there was another circle with more sharing. The main activity that day, Mr. Conley said, would be “a purge with the fire.” When the time came, Mr. Conley and his assistants filled a table with stickers that had ageist anxieties scrawled on them. The elders were told to pick any they felt applied to them and affix them to their chests. Ms. Stevens put on “Millennials rule the world” and “I wish I was a digital native.” Jeff Hamaoui, 47, who ran a supply-chain consultancy before joining Modern Elder as its director of education, wrote his own: “I am not practical or handy.” Others covered their chests and arms with stickers. “I fear being an old lady or man on the streets.” “I’m out of time to try something new.” “I feel increasingly invisible.” The group members wandered silently, looking at each other and reading the notes. One by one, they peeled the messages off and burned them in a fire pit on the veranda. Lunch was lentil soup, beer and cheese. At 5:30, the schedule called for restorative yoga, and as a small panic spread it became clear this was not a cohort accustomed to retreat culture. “For those frightened of yoga,” Mr. Conley said, “this is not yoga, this is lying down.” The instructor, Teddi Dean, showed up. He had long, shaggy blond hair. “Recognize that you’re in a body, recognize the weight of a body,” he told the group as the sun set. Mr. Conley had packed the days with activities, circle after circle. To speak, the members passed a long and knotty talking stick with deep holes all the way though, like Swiss cheese. Soon, many in the group were seeing their boundaries fall. Some cried. Others said they were sharing things for the first time. One person disclosed terminal cancer that few at home knew about. Another circle started, this one about “liminality.” Mr. Hamaoui said, “I feel like I’m just not getting it. I watch YouTube stars and all these things, and intellectually I get it, but emotionally I just can’t connect.” Snaps of agreement came from around the circle. No one else connected with the YouTube stars either, and it was O.K. There was a growing sense of empowerment and camaraderie — almost rebellion. Mr. Conley talked about reclaiming the term elder like the gay community has reclaimed queer. “The social narrative is basically, midlife is a crisis and after a crisis you have decrepitude,” Mr. Conley said. “But you actually are much happier in your 60s and 70s, so why aren’t we preparing for that?” Later in the week, Caroline Czirr, 49, a brand manager in Colorado, got the talking stick. “This feels good,” said Ms. Czirr. “It feels good. I’m turning 50 next month, and I was just going to have dinner with friends.” Her voice rose. “But now I want cake,” she said. “I want champagne. And I want to see a D.J., and I want to make out with a guy at a bar.” Mr. Conley’s expansion plans include building a Modern Elder retirement community near El Pescadero.

2019,A Painting Looted by and Returned to Nazis Finally Goes to Its Jewish Owners,"AMSTERDAM — A cathedral in Germany has agreed to return a Nazi-looted painting to the heirs of Gottlieb and Mathilde Kraus, an Austrian Jewish couple from whom it was stolen in 1941, according to the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has spent the last eight years negotiating the restitution. The painting, “View of a Dutch Square,” attributed to the Golden Age painter Jan van der Heyden, was one of about 160 looted from the Kraus family in 1941, retrieved by the Allies after the war and returned to the Bavarian State. But instead of ensuring its restitution to the family from which it was stolen, the Bavarian government sold it back to the heir of the Nazi official who bought it during the war. “I’m excited and happy that it’s coming to a resolution, but I’m struck both by the weight of my family and the solemnity of the occasion,” John Graykowski, an American great-grandson of the Krauses, said in a telephone interview from Xanten, Germany, where church officials were expected to turn over the painting on Thursday. The Kraus family fled Austria in March 1938, when Nazi Germany annexed Austria, leaving their collection behind. Three years later, the Gestapo seized it and sold it; the van der Heyden painting went to Hitler’s friend and photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. “I’m the first one in my family to actually see this painting in 80 years, since 1938,” Mr. Graykowski added. “It took 80 years, but it shouldn’t have even taken eight, since the first time we presented the incontrovertible evidence and that it belonged to my family.” The painting has belonged to the Roman Catholic Xanten Cathedral, also known as St. Victor’s Cathedral in Xanten, since it purchased the work in 1963, without knowing that it had been looted, church officials said. The painting features St. Victor’s in the background. “I have certain difficulties to speak of a ‘return’ of the painting,” Hans-Wilhelm Barking, the chairman of the cathedral foundation, known as the Dombauverein Xanten, wrote in a statement. “This term may imply that the Dombauverein may not have acquired the painting lawfully and may not have become the lawful owner. I therefore prefer the term ‘surrender,’ which is done voluntarily in recognition of the Nazi injustice.” The case is part of a larger scandal that came to light in 2016, after research by the Commission for Looted Art in Europe discovered that hundreds of artworks had been restituted by the Bavarian State to former Nazi owners and their heirs. After the war, the state sold the work back to Henriette Hoffmann-von Schirach, Hoffmann’s daughter and Hitler’s secretary, for 300 Deutschmarks, which was then roughly $75. She sold the painting at an auction house in Cologne to the cathedral for 16,100 Deutschmarks, about 54 times as much. “It’s a very extraordinary case that revealed this remarkable, previously unknown history,” said Anne Webber, founder and co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe. “Almost 78 years since these paintings were seized from the family, this is only the seventh painting to be returned to them. But there are another 160 missing.”",The New York Times
2019,A Pakistani-Indian Journalist Attempts to Rediscover His Roots,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE TWICE-BORN Life and Death on the Ganges By Aatish Taseer The “twice-born” in Aatish Taseer’s title are the Brahmins who are “reborn” when they undergo initiation as young men into India’s highest caste. But the word could refer equally well to Taseer himself. His story is a variant of the much-told tale of the American man (or Englishman or European man, seldom a woman) who revolts against the shallowness of Western materialism and goes to India to find his soul, to reinvent himself, to be spiritually reborn. Cross this genre — epitomized by W. Somerset Maugham’s 1944 novel, “The Razor’s Edge” — with the equally shopworn story of the American in search of his ethnic identity and you get a man of Pakistani and Indian heritage who (re)turns to India to find his roots (and/or soul). But Taseer’s is a far more convoluted authorial voice: Born in 1980 in London to a Muslim father (the governor of Pakistan’s Punjab Province, assassinated by an Islamist fanatic in 2011) and a Sikh mother (a famous Indian journalist), Taseer was educated at a posh international school in India and then in America, where he graduated from Amherst College. A successful, often controversial, journalist, he was much praised for his first book, a blend of memoir and travelogue called “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” and for his three novels, which deal with a young Indian who returns to his country after some years abroad. It’s not very hard to see an obsessive pattern here, in which “The Twice-Born” forms the final element, since it aims to do for Hinduism (and India) what Taseer’s first book did for Islam (and Pakistan). It was a difficult re-entry. Taseer describes his own cultural schizophrenia in India: “I saw everything as an Anglicized Indian watching an imaginary European or American visitor watch India, and I had my heart in my mouth as I tried to guess what he would make of it. It was an embarrassment twice removed.” Part of the problem was that he had chosen to view his rediscovered country through the lens of Sanskrit, the ancient language of India, which he had studied for a decade. Taseer is rightly enthralled by the great richness of Sanskrit literature and by its amazing survival over thousands of years in the minds and lives of Indian scholars, primarily in one community: the Brahmins. He loves the Brahmins for both their knowledge and their disdain for materialism. And his admiration for these unworldly intellectuals, who seem at first to be his kind of people, inspires his appreciation of traditional India, which for him is Hindu India. But this gives him an idealized, airbrushed image of Hinduism and India, which he views en saffron, the color of the robes of ascetics and hence originally a symbol of ascetic Hinduism — but nowadays an emblem of right-wing, nationalist Hinduism. He therefore decides to live in the holiest city of Hindu India, Varanasi. Actually, Taseer calls it Benares, the British name Indians have replaced with the original Sanskrit. Elsewhere he comments obliquely on this choice: “One forms an idea of India by balancing what India knows about herself with what outsiders, from Megasthenes and Fa Hsien to Al-Biruni and Niccolo de Conti, have written about her. It makes the country ripe for being defined from the outside.” Yet he largely ignores the many Indian writers who, pace Taseer, have managed to define it quite well from the inside. Taseer’s discovery of India results in a detailed, learned and highly readable tour of Hindu history, noting many of the positive contributions of the centuries of Muslim rule and dwelling at some length on the degrading and demoralizing effects of the British Raj. But along the way, the saffron scales seem to fall from his eyes as he describes the rise of Hindu nationalism, with its anti-Muslim violence, and the failure of liberal Hinduism to apply more than an ineffectual Band-Aid to the deep, septic wound of the people once called Untouchables, now known as Dalits. He excoriates the rise of the present ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and its prime minister, Narendra Modi, charting the way they have exploited both anti-Muslim passions and the wounded pride inflicted by British rule, riding to power on a wave of religious bigotry. He watches Modi manipulating precisely those high-minded Hindu values that he, Taseer, has so admired. He is particularly eloquent when he bemoans the weird claims that have been made for Indian (that is, Hindu) science, including the assertion that ancient Indians used nuclear weapons and mastered air travel. By this time, Taseer has realized that a much-admired Brahmin friend named Tripathi is speaking “a cut-rate version of the banalities one hears every day on American college campuses,” and Taseer fears that his former awe of this man may have been “an extension of my romantic idea of Tripathi.” Finally, near the very end of his narrative, Taseer comes up against the issue of caste. After a seemingly jolly dinner at a Brahmin home, he is shocked, shocked, to see his friends insist that a non-Brahmin dinner companion must wash his own plates and utensils. At that moment, “a deep shame came up in me, as if from the recesses of childhood, like the shame of wetting one’s pants.” Despite his sharp-eyed condemnation of the evils of Hindu nationalism and caste, Taseer manages to salvage his admiration for the Brahmin world by making a rather artificial, though quite common, distinction between two aspects of religion, spirituality and magic. Spirituality — love of the gods, of ancient texts, of uplifting and comforting ceremonies and magnificent architecture — is high-minded, moral, inspiring, and Taseer praises the Brahmins for their spirituality. However, magic — the superstitious belief in the efficacy of rituals and astrology, along with the measures taken to avoid pollution from contact with lower castes — is stupid, destructive, cruel. Taseer’s damning critique of Modi’s “pseudoscientific impulse” culminates in his dismissal of Hindu magical thinking, which he sees as opposed not only to science but to religion. Though he admits that “I had tried to sidestep the subject of magic until now, even though it had encroached many times,” it is magic that finally drives Taseer out of India. After months spent hanging out in ashrams, he realizes, as he is about to visit yet another, that “I did not want to enter its crowded spaces where religious feeling was at a fevered pitch. I made some excuse about not wanting to remove my shoes.” He had undergone a kind of reverse enlightenment, from the purified life of the mind to a realization of the material tragedy of present-day India. He puts it well: “Maybe all my questing after India had been the precursor to my moving more honestly away from it.” As he encounters more anti-Muslim violence, more anti-Dalit violence, as well as the “vigilantes” falsely proclaiming the sanctity of cows, he recoils from the sort of fanaticism that killed his father. But he salvages some of his original idealism by remarking, “It was an age that spelled the destruction of the very ideal of the Brahmin.” And what of his own ideals? “After Amherst,” he writes, “I had planned to come back to India forever, but I was unable to fit back in.” He returns to New York, to the man to whom he is married (as he tells us, though he sometimes lies about it in Benares). All that he has been able to salvage from the saffron days is his love of Sanskrit, which he continues to study, now at Columbia University. There he encounters a “left-wing Indian intellectual” who insists, “I am not a Brahmin. … For me that word is the same as Nazi.” This encounter makes Taseer recall the horrors of “castebound” India and Modi’s manipulation of “the old Indian disease of symbolic action.” Two more deaths rekindle his grief over his father. In mourning all three, he explains, “I was also mourning the end of my life in India.” And that death was his rebirth. OpinionAatish Taseer OpinionAatish Taseer",The New York Times
2019,A Passenger Missed the Fatal Ethiopian Airlines Flight by 2 Minutes,"Antonis Mavropoulos did everything he could to catch his connection, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302: He didn’t bring a suitcase. He was the first passenger off his plane. And when he got to the airport in Ethiopia, he ran. He didn’t make it. A few hours later, he learned that what he thought was his misfortune was, in fact, the kind of spectacular good luck that can make you spend the rest of your life wondering about fate and chance. Shortly after takeoff on Sunday, Flight 302 crashed en route to Nairobi, Kenya, killing all 149 passengers and eight crew members on board. Mr. Mavropoulos would have been the 150th passenger, window seat 2L. “March 10 2019 — my lucky day,” Mr. Mavropoulos, the chief executive of a waste management company in Athens and president of the International Solid Waste Association, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable consumption, wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. He was on his way to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly when he missed his connecting flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. His flight landed there at 7:40 a.m., and his flight to Nairobi left 35 minutes later, so he knew he had to hurry, he said in a telephone interview on Monday. He was the first passenger to exit his flight at Addis Ababa, but an airline representative who had come to get him could not find him, he said. He also did not have a suitcase, which meant he could move more quickly — but also that his connecting flight would not wait for his luggage to be transferred. So he ran around the airport — “I was mad because there was no one to help me get there faster,” he wrote — trying to make it to Flight 302. He reached the gate two minutes after the doors had closed. “When I got there, boarding had closed and I could see the last passengers in the bellows boarding the plane. I was demanding to get in too, but they didn’t allow it,” Mr. Mavropoulos said on Monday. Three hours later, as he was boarding the next flight to Nairobi, two security guards escorted him to the airport’s police station, over his loud protests — he did not want to miss his meetings in Nairobi. But an official explained that he should “stop protesting and thank God,” instead. They could not let him leave before they had established who he was and why he had not boarded the flight, which had crashed. Mr. Mavropoulos was shocked. “The thoughts came like streaks of lightning: ‘Oh my God,’ ” he said. “I’m alive because the connection ambassador was a few minutes late, and then that I was demanding they’d let me in the flight — imagine what would have happened if they had done so.” He realized he should contact his family, let them know that he was not on Flight 302, that small, random events had made him miss it: not having a suitcase, missing the airline representative, running late. A spokesman for Ethiopian Airlines confirmed on Monday that Mr. Mavropoulos’ booking was changed to the 4:25 p.m. flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. He thanked his good fortune for what he had berated as bad luck. “I broke down the moment I had that thought,” he wrote. Mr. Mavropoulos, a 52-year-old engineer, said he tried to think logically when he finally did board a flight to Nairobi, a few hours after the crash. “I thought maybe I shouldn’t go to Nairobi, that I should stay in Ethiopia, or go back to Athens,” he said on Monday. “But then I thought that there is no way that a second flight of the same airline, and the same route would crash on the same day.” In Nairobi, he met two colleagues at the airport. “They weren’t my wife or daughter, but I hugged them, and they hugged me,” he said. But the moments since have been tough. He did not sleep at all on Sunday night. He spent hours thinking that he should not travel as much as he does, to spare his family the stress, and thinking over what felt like a second chance at life. “I’m devastated for the people who are now gone, but I also feel so lucky to have not been among them,” he said.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | A Pause on the Nation’s Biggest Death Row,"The California governor’s moratorium on executions in the state should signal the demise of a barbaric practice. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced Wednesday that no executions will occur on his watch, granting temporary reprieves to all 737 inmates on the state’s death row. Mr. Newsom’s executive order also withdraws California’s lethal injection protocol, which has been mired in litigation for years. “I do not believe that a civilized society can claim to be a leader in the world as long as its government continues to sanction the premeditated and discriminatory execution of its people,” Mr. Newsom said. “In short, the death penalty is inconsistent with our bedrock values and strikes at the very heart of what it means to be a Californian.” The governor can stop executions only at the back end — once sentences have been imposed. The law still empowers local prosecutors, many of whom remain staunchly supportive of the death penalty, to seek the ultimate punishment. In 2016, voters narrowly approved a ballot measure to speed up executions, and in the past they have defeated attempts to repeal the death penalty statute. Yet this act of executive mercy recognizes the extreme failures of the death penalty. In announcing his order, Mr. Newsom noted a National Academy of Sciences report estimating that one out of every 25 people on death row is innocent. “If that's the case, that means if we move forward executing 737 people in California, we will have executed roughly 30 people that are innocent,” he said. Other research suggests that it also does not deter crime. While the state hasn’t executed anyone since 2006, it has the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere, a quarter of America’s death row population. Six in 10 prisoners on California's death row are people of color, a disparity Mr. Newsom cited in his rationale for the moratorium. What’s more, the death penalty system is so dysfunctional and costs so much to run that Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court wondered in 2016 whether these “fundamental defects” warrant a deeper look at the constitutionality of letting inmates languish on death row for decades. Take, for instance, Richard Boyer, a death row inmate at San Quentin State Prison — where the state’s only death chamber was closed under Mr. Newsom’s order. Mr. Boyer, who was sentenced in 1984 for the murder of a couple in their 60s, has spent 34 years on death row and is one of 25 inmates who have exhausted all appeals, which would put them next in line to be executed, if not for the moratorium. Without explanation, in 2016, the Supreme Court declined to hear Mr. Boyer’s case, which had asked the justices to address whether prolonged execution delays caused by the state were unconstitutional. Since 1976, California has executed only 13 inmates. Mr. Newsom said the state has spent $5 billion to keep the death penalty on life support in the last 40 years. Far more death row prisoners have died of illness or old age than in the death chamber. Mr. Newsom’s decree means those who remain will be spared while he remains in power. “The intentional killing of another person is wrong,” the governor said. “And as governor, I will not oversee the execution of any individual.” Though their lives will be spared, no inmates will be released or have their sentences reduced. If he is re-elected, Mr. Newsom’s moratorium could last up to eight years, barring legal challenges, which capital punishment advocates have threatened. They argue that the governor is subverting the will of voters, but electing a governor who has a consistent record on society’s harshest penalty is also an expression of voters’ wishes. Within certain limits, after all, the governor also has the power to pardon or commute the sentences of even the worst offenders. This move is also not out of step with trends in California or around the country. In 2018, California sentenced only five people to die — its lowest number since reinstating the death penalty in 1978. Last year, for the first time, no single county imposed more than two death sentences, bucking a trajectory that placed jurisdictions such as Los Angeles County as the most death-seeking in the nation. This helped contribute to a national decline. The death penalty has been abolished or paused in a number of states in recent years, including Colorado, Oregon and Pennsylvania. In due time, this growing chorus against a system of punishment that has been shown to be discriminatory, prone to error and ineffective as a crime-fighting tool should spell its demise once and for all.

2019,Opinion | A Peace Plan for India and Pakistan Already Exists,"A path toward resolving the Kashmir dispute, negotiated in the mid-2000s, deserves another look. Mr. Rashid is the author of “Pakistan on the Brink: The Future of America, Pakistan and Afghanistan.” LAHORE, Pakistan — India and Pakistan don’t have to be on the brink of war. Negotiators painstakingly put together a way out of the crisis and a road map for resolution of the Kashmir dispute in the mid-2000s, and we need to get back to it. Kashmir has been disputed since 1947, with India holding around two-thirds and Pakistan one-third of its territory and both claiming all of it. The unresolved future of the largely Muslim region has led to three wars between the two countries, while frustration with Indian misrule in Indian-controlled Kashmir led to an insurgency supported by Pakistan in 1990. India and Pakistan have alternated between phases of intense hostility and moments of calm since 1947. At various points, their leaders have — although unsuccessfully — sought to find ways to resolve their disputes. The insurgency in Kashmir was ebbing by the mid-2000s and India’s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and Pakistan’s president, Pervez Musharraf, initiated a secret dialogue through trusted aides. Indian and Pakistani envoys agreed to make the Line of Control, the heavily militarized border between the Indian and Pakistani-controlled portions of Kashmir, irrelevant by giving the Kashmiris the right to free movement and trade across the line. They agreed upon providing autonomy to Kashmir’s subregions and drawing down forces as violence receded. They also agreed to establish a body of Kashmiris, Indians and Pakistanis, vaguely described as a “joint mechanism,” to oversee the political and economic rights of the Kashmiris on both sides of the line. Unfortunately, negotiators had little time to build support for the deal. In the spring of 2007, President Musharraf, stung by rulings that challenged his military government, fired the chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court, setting off nationwide protests by lawyers that led to his ouster in August 2008. With General Musharraf gone, the peace plan fell apart. It was the closest the two countries came to resolving the dispute. Around three months later, militants belonging to the Pakistan-based group Lashkar-e-Taiba mounted attacks in Mumbai that resulted in the deaths of at least 174 people and killed any remaining hopes of renewed peace talks. Relations between the two countries deteriorated further as Pakistan refused to hand over suspects in the attacks. In 2014, the Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi became prime minister of India. In his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, in September 2014, he announced that India was withdrawing from peace talks with Pakistan until it agreed to talks in “an atmosphere of peace without a shadow of terrorism.” Mr. Modi proceeded to adopt a scorched-earth strategy in Kashmir and closed all doors for dialogue with Kashmiri politicians. His use of brute force signaled that no discussion on the unresolved future of Kashmir is allowed and it is considered a settled, integral part of India. A crackdown by Indian security forces led to hundreds of Kashmiris being killed, blinded and arrested. Not surprisingly, since Mr. Modi has come to power an increasing number of young Kashmiris have joined the militants. Across the border, despite international opprobrium, Pakistan failed to keep its numerous pledges to curtail Islamic extremist groups — Kashmir-focused groups such as Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba and also the Afghan Taliban — operating from the country. The United States stopped economic aid to Pakistan and made sales of military equipment to the country conditional on its cooperation with counterterrorism efforts. The intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force put Pakistan on its “gray list” of countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to curb terrorist activities; Islamabad has allowed organizations listed as terrorist groups by the United Nations to operate as charities. Pakistan has been suffering from a severe economic crisis and has been desperately trying to raise some $20 billion from friends, allies and the International Monetary Fund. And then, in February, came a suicide attack in Kashmir, claimed by Jaish-e-Muhammad, that killed dozens of Indian soldiers. Several Western diplomats in Islamabad believe the Pakistani Army’s insistence that it had nothing to do with the attack in Kashmir, which might have been independently carried out by the militant group. But that raises a troubling question: If Islamabad had nothing to do with the attack, does that mean it has lost control of the militants? Prime Minister Imran Khan has shown willingness to discuss all questions including terrorism with New Delhi. On Tuesday, Pakistan announced that it would seize and freeze the assets of militant groups and individuals designated as terrorists by the United Nations. Pakistan arrested 44 people, including Mufti Abdul Rauf, the brother of Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad. There was no word of Mr. Azhar himself, who remains in Pakistan. Although India indicated that it wouldn’t pursue military options for now, New Delhi has shared a list of suspects with Pakistan and wants it to take credible, verifiable action to undermine militant groups’ capacity for cross-border terrorism. Islamabad has also placed Jamaat-ud-Dawa and the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, two offshoots of Lashkar-e-Taiba operating as charities, on its list of proscribed organizations. It is unlikely that Mr. Modi, who faces an election in April and feels the political need to act tough on Pakistan, will budge from his hard-line position until after the elections. Pakistan should prosecute the perpetrators of the Kashmir attack. And once India forms a new government, the United States, Britain and the United Nations, whose response to the current crisis has been slow, must encourage India to restart dialogue with Mr. Khan. Simultaneously, Islamabad must start dismantling the terrorist groups operating from its soil. Mr. Modi must stop his relentless use of lethal force in Kashmir and end his stubborn refusal to hold talks. A return to back-channel diplomacy is necessary, and the Musharraf-Manmohan peace process needs to be dusted off and looked at again. It offers a way forward, an alternative to a war that would put both India and Pakistan in jeopardy.

2019,Opinion | A Perfume Called Fascism,"When an Israeli minister sprays herself in Fascism to make her rightist party more popular, you know that words have achieved weightlessness. Opinion Columnist TEL AVIV — Let’s talk Fascism, the perfume I mean. Israel has an election on April 9. The right-wing justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, who has sought to curb the powers of the Supreme Court and portray it as a kind of liberal-elite supergovernment, has a campaign ad. It’s an interesting exercise in branding and the unbearable lightness of our times. A piano tinkles. A flacon of Fascism appears. Shaked looks sultry, running a hand through her hair, affixing an earring, draping a white jacket on her shoulders, caressing a banister as she descends the stairs. The narration in Hebrew runs through her “judiciary revolution,” her “reducing activism” and her “restraining of the Supreme Court” in a tone of soft sensuality. At last, she grabs her Fascism, sprays the perfume, and in a good no-nonsense gravelly Israeli tone that breaks with what has preceded it, proclaims: “Smells like democracy to me.” O.K., I’m writing about this, so it’s effective marketing. People talk about the ad, and that could benefit her New Right party. Her point, I think, is this: You Israeli liberals label me a fascist, but there’s nothing undemocratic about lambasting the Supreme Court’s powers, vowing to dismantle its oversight of the Knesset or accusing it of a “coup” against democracy. Shaked is playing with fire. Perfumes are seductive. That’s the point of them. You sniff them and swoon. You become captive to them. What she’s intimating, even as she dismisses it, is that she’s a little fascist on the side and that’s a turn-on. Certainly, Europe swooned to fascism once upon a time. This led to the death of six million Jews. Let’s be careful with words. They have meaning. Let’s be careful with facts. They have weight. Let’s not turn the stench of the Nazi crematories into a come-hither scent. It may be too late. When an Israeli minister sprays herself in Fascism to make her rightist party more popular, you know that words have achieved weightlessness. Truth has no meaning any longer. It’s gone. After all, tens of millions of Americans consider Donald Trump to be the most honest president ever because he “tells it like it is” and, as his move of the American Embassy to Jerusalem illustrates, does what he says he will do. Representative democracy, mediated through institutions created to uphold the rule of law and protect civic discourse, is giving way to a form of social-media-driven direct democracy where the premium is on hatefulness. It’s open season on any democratic institution like the Israeli Supreme Court, or indeed a free press (a.k.a. “enemy of the people”) that is seen as standing between genuine folk outside of “elites” and their desires. Brexit is many things, among them a train wreck caused by the clash of parliamentary democracy (which is what Britain was last time I checked) and plebiscitary democracy driven by lies or so-called fake news, which is where the world seems to be headed. An outright disaster may be required before this wave is checked. Smells like democracy, Shaked says. Benjamin Netanyahu, seeking a fifth term as Israeli prime minister, facing indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, is campaigning for his political survival and, beyond that, his personal freedom. Let’s do a little imagining. Imagine that Netanyahu wins. Imagine that for parties joining his coalition he sets a condition that they support passing a law in the Knesset that would prohibit the prosecution of an elected official — like the prime minister, for example. Imagine that he offers various blandishments to rightist parties like Shaked’s to secure this allegiance — annexation of part of the West Bank, for example. Imagine that the Supreme Court’s power to declare such a move unconstitutional is overturned as part of Shaked’s push to delegitimize and eviscerate one of the most important foundations of Israeli democratic life. Smells like democracy? You tell me if the independent judiciary in Nazi Germany did not fold to Hitler, one step at a time. But I don’t want to sound alarmist. We’re talking only about a perfume. Let me offer a word about Trump in conclusion. The obsessive focus on him tends to obscure the fact that he may not represent the antithesis of American values but be more representative of them than people think. What if, as the former ambassador Peter Mulrean, who quit the State Department after Trump was elected, put it to me, Trump “is just an extreme version of what we’ve become, our society’s ‘Picture of Dorian Gray’?” And, Mulrean added, “I mean all of us, not just those who voted for him.” I find that a provocative thought — and the resemblance between Trump and Netanyahu in their hold on their societies’ imaginations is striking. We have succumbed to the weightlessness of words. Doesn’t Ivanka Trump have a line of perfumes and big political ambitions? The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,A Photographer’s Quest to Discover His Nubian Ancestry,"lens After his father’s death, the photographer Mohamed Altoum went on a journey to understand what it means to be Nubian. Mohamed Altoum had faint childhood memories of his father’s stories about their Nubian culture from their ancestral village in north Sudan. Yet when his father, Osman, an accountant who also wrote poetry, recounted them again in 2010, Mohamed paid close attention. His father was dying from liver cancer. So while Mohamed and his family cared for Osman around the clock at their home in Khartoum, Sudan, his father’s stories rekindled something deep inside him. “He spoke about the music, literature and culture,” Mohamed said, “and told me that I needed to discover my roots in the Nubian community.” Mohamed had grown up in Khartoum, Sudan’s mainly Arab capital, and though his mother, Majda, is also Nubian, he rarely had contact with the Nubian culture other than listening as his father fell asleep to the sound of Nubian songs on the radio. But when Osman died, Mohamed started a quest to find out more about his father and what it means to be Nubian. He traveled throughout north Sudan to Aswan in southern Egypt, as well as to Kenya and Uganda, where there are large Nubian communities. While visiting his uncle Al-Haj in the family house in the town of Hoshmar in north Sudan, Mohamed found a photo of himself as a boy dressed in traditional clothing. “I realized that my father had always tried to pass on this culture,” he said, “but I wasn’t making connections between the history and the present.” Nubia is a region along the Nile, stretching from Aswan a thousand miles south to Khartoum, and its rich culture dates back to at least 2500 B.C. It was home to several powerful empires. By the sixth century A.D. most Nubians had converted to Christianity. After almost a millennium of rule, the last of three Christian kingdoms fell around 1500, and most Nubians converted to Islam. Mohamed participated in the Arab Documentary Photography Program started by the Magnum Foundation, the Prince Claus Fund and the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture, and he continued his project under the mentorship of the photojournalist Randa Shaath. He photographed weddings and festivals as well as everyday life on the street and inside houses. In Khartoum, he photographed Nuba wrestling matches, a sport he recognized from the games his father taught him and his younger brother Maaz as children. In the countryside he learned about the importance of nature in the Nubian culture. His journey made him more “relaxed and peaceful” and also affected his photography, emphasizing the importance of storytelling, which, he said, is central to Nubian culture. “I have a responsibility as a Nubian person to tell our story in the right way and counter the stereotypes from colonial days,” he said. “I tried to reflect the identity, and the humanity of Nubians. It is a very strong culture, and the people are really helpful to each other and respectful of every living thing.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @JamesEstrin on Twitter.

2019,A Pied-à-Terre Becomes Home,"renters A Hudson Valley couple rented a studio so they could spend weekends in New York City. They weren’t planning to move here full time. When Jeff Karliner and Henry Johnson retired in 2017 and closed a jewelry business they had run together in New Paltz, N.Y., they decided to find a pied-à-terre in New York City. They had lived in New Paltz since the 1970s, when they both arrived in the upstate town as freshmen at SUNY New Paltz, and they loved their five-bedroom Victorian house, but they were eager for a more energetic environment. “We’re not Florida people,” said Mr. Johnson, who was a high school biology teacher, explaining that afternoons spent poolside and balmy winters held little appeal — for decades the couple had kept the thermostat of their drafty house, which they shared with two cats, set to 61 degrees. “What we wanted was a place we could spend weekends at, in the city. We’ve always loved film, theater, dance.” “Well, we did seriously consider Hawaii, where we went every Christmas for 15 years,” said Mr. Karliner, a jeweler and metalsmith, who ran Jeffrey Allen Jewelers with Mr. Johnson, and also taught technology classes at a high school in Kingston. “But New York is New York.” They decided to test the waters by renting a Manhattan studio and wound up at the Nicole, a Gotham Organization rental building on West 55th Street. “It was just the perfect fit for us here,” Mr. Johnson said. “All the other places we saw, the buildings were so massive; there were like eight concierges in the lobby.” “They try to lure you with things like a bowling alley in the building,” Mr. Karliner said. “But what we really wanted was a place where the concierges knew us. We’re not coming to New York to bowl in the building. We’re coming to New York because of the people.” But if the building was a perfect fit, it soon became clear that a studio apartment wasn’t. Shortly after signing their lease in May 2017, the couple began spending more time there than they anticipated. $5,845 | Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan Occupations: Mr. Karliner is a former high school teacher and a retired jeweler and metalsmith, who used to own and operate Jeffrey Allen Jewelers; Mr. Johnson is a retired high school biology teacher who helped run the business.On being close to the Port Authority: Catching a bus to New Paltz is a breeze, and they love being close to the city’s performing arts scene. “We saw one show that was so close to our apartment that if the bathroom line was too long during intermission, I could have come back here,” Mr. Karliner said.Making friends: The building’s monthly events have been a great way to meet and hang out with their neighbors.Anniversaries: The couple met in college and have been together 43 years. They married in New Paltz in 2004, when the village mayor married a number of same-sex couples before it was legal in New York. They married again, legally, in 2009 in Connecticut. Mr. Johnson would travel to New Paltz to pick up the mail and check on the house, only to find himself heading back to the city 15 minutes later. Mr. Karliner had come out of retirement for the third time to teach at a high school in Orangeburg, N.Y., a 30-minute reverse commute from their Hell’s Kitchen apartment. The drive from New Paltz, though, was an hour and a half. “The studio would have been O.K. if we were just there every few weekends, but we were living here full time,” Mr. Karliner said. “We don’t think the cats were happy there, either — they couldn’t get away from each other. And we couldn’t get away from each other, either.” Upgrading to a one-bedroom seemed an obvious solution, especially after a penthouse apartment in the building became vacant. Delighted to not be so cramped, Mr. Johnson started going on “shopping expeditions” to their house in New Paltz, bringing back artifacts from the 57 countries they visited together. With their curios around them, a growing number of New York friends and a Hudson River view from the kitchen — a feature especially prized by Mr. Johnson, who loves to cook and tries to find a cooking class whenever they travel — New Paltz beckoned less often. Mr. Karliner still visited for long spells in the warmer months, as he loved to lounge by the pool. But as for Mr. Johnson, “I’m not a lounging type,” he said. “When I’m there, there are only a few things to do. Here, there are so many things to do.” By last fall, there was no denying that their pied-à-terre had become home. Mr. Karliner, who had retired again at the end of the school year, was spending more time in the apartment, developing a photography practice. Mr. Johnson wasn’t visiting New Paltz even once a month, and their cats, who spent many contented hours staring at the traffic and the pigeons, hadn’t left Manhattan in more than a year. In October, the couple moved again, into a sunny two-bedroom one floor below their penthouse apartment. While not approaching the dimensions of their place in New Paltz, which has 48 windows and a three-story turret, their current apartment feels like the right size for a full-time residence. “All the windows make it feel bigger,” Mr. Karliner said. “We love that the cityscape is part of the decoration here.” The new apartment also has nine closets — six more than in their house. There are so many, in fact, that they were able to dedicate one to the litter box and another to Mr. Karliner’s shoes. And after living in a Victorian for 35 years, moving into a relatively new building — the Nicole was built in 2003 — has been a nice change in other ways, as well. “Our house in New Paltz has lots of oak furniture. It’s very comfortable, very antique-y,” Mr. Johnson said. “We were looking forward to having something with a completely different feel.” When they had a Christmas party, they were surprised to find that their friends from the building outnumbered their friends from New Paltz. But they aren’t inclined to put their upstate house on the market anytime soon. At least, one of them isn’t. “He’s ready,” Mr. Karliner said. “I’m not.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2019,Opinion | A Pied-à-Terre Tax Will Bring Revenue New York Needs,"A tax on second homes of over $5 million won’t solve income inequality, but it could help boost the city’s coffers. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Two months ago, the hedge fund magnate Kenneth C. Griffin paid a record-breaking $238 million for a penthouse on Central Park South, and it wasn’t even what most people would call home. Mr. Griffin is from Chicago, where he can put his feet up in a penthouse he bought for $59 million, or in one of the rooms on two floors he bought for $30 million in a hotel there. He also has a $60 million Miami condominium and a $122 million London mansion. The New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer, estimates about 5,400 properties in the city are worth more than $5 million and are not the owner’s primary residence. Some, like Mr. Griffin’s pad, are luxurious pieds-à-terre for out-of-towners. Many others were bought by shell companies that don’t reveal their true owners, meant to allow overseas tycoons to stash money out of sight. At a time of soaring inequality and towering infrastructure needs, taxing these gleaming penthouses is an enticing idea. The logic is straightforward: It is one way in which New Yorkers can benefit from the desire of other people to visit the city that New Yorkers own and operate. New York certainly needs the money. There’s the added benefit that so-called pied-à-terre taxes are politically palatable. Sending a higher tax bill to wealthy homeowners who don’t live, pay taxes or vote in New York will be far more popular with lawmakers than broader assessments on wealthier residents, such as raising income taxes on millionaires or property tax rates on all luxury homes. Democrats, having won full control of the state government in November’s elections, are seriously considering a pied-à-terre tax in this year’s budget. The proposal, which could be revised, would allow New York City to impose an additional tax on homes that are not an owner’s primary residence and are worth more than $5 million. These properties would be taxed on an ascending scale, from 0.5 percent on a market value of more than $5 million, up to 4 percent on the values above $25 million. Mr. Stringer estimates the tax could generate roughly $650 million in annual revenue based on current conditions. Cities that have adopted such taxes have seen drops in prices and construction of high-end homes. New York City would almost certainly see similar results — it’s just a question of by how much. In cities that have tried it, other factors also affected prices. Still, the tax is one small way to make New York City a little fairer and raise revenue that could be used for the city’s subways, schools or affordable housing. It’s no substitute, though, for more difficult reforms of the property tax system. Rental apartment buildings bear a disproportionate share of the city’s tax burden while multimillion-dollar brownstones and co-ops and condos at the high end of the market get steep breaks. In 2017, for example, the owners of a $500,000 home in Elmhurst, Queens, had a $4,297 tax bill — the same as a $9 million home in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, according to data from the city’s Finance Department. Home buyers who need a mortgage in New York pay a mortgage recording tax, while wealthier buyers who purchase property in cash pay none. Mr. Stringer, the comptroller, has proposed eliminating the mortgage recording tax and instead increasing the transfer taxes on high-priced properties. That would put New York in line with other cities better at capturing revenues from the super wealthy. “They’ve gotten a free ride in New York,” Mr. Stringer said. In terms of generating a new revenue stream, when funds are urgently needed, the pied-à-terre tax is a good start. Many governments worldwide have moved to capture a piece of soaring real estate prices through similar schemes. Paris has a tax aimed at second homes used as investment properties. So does Melbourne. In 2016, Britain imposed a 3 percent surcharge on the purchase of second homes. While the British tax raised 1.68 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) from 2016 to 2017, higher taxes on home sales in general may have contributed to a slowdown in the real estate market, according to a report from the London School of Economics. It’s also widely believed that turmoil over Brexit could have weakened the market. Housing sales around Vancouver, British Columbia, which recently adopted several new taxes on nonresident buyers and the owners of empty homes, declined by more than 30 percent in 2018, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Yet that decline could also have been caused, or exacerbated, by rising interest rates. Vancouver officials said they expected one of the taxes, a 1 percent levy on vacant homes, to raise $38 million annually. The Real Estate Board of New York, an industry lobbying group, says the proposed tax would cripple the housing market, where luxury sales already sharply declined last year. The industry group also says the tax would bring in about half the revenue the comptroller estimates. Concerns about the tax’s effect on the real estate market are worth considering, since the industry has provided New York with tax revenue and jobs. But the money the tax would generate, even if less than now estimated, makes it worthwhile. With the state projecting lower income tax revenue, and the fate of an effort to legalize — and tax — marijuana in question, the pied-à-terre tax is gaining steam. Lawmakers are pushing to include the proposal, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, in the state budget. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said the revenue should go toward the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Wealthy people from around the world who invest in New York City real estate reap rewards on that investment because of the goods and services the city provides. Asking them to pay more is common sense. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

2019,A Pinter Marathon Saves the Best for Last,"London Theater Reviews LONDON — Talk about saving the best for last. For six months, the Harold Pinter Theater has been given over to a unique sequence of Pinter one-acts, presented under the curatorial eye of Jamie Lloyd, who directed some of these lesser-known plays himself. The results tested the receptiveness of theatergoers in the West End, not exactly a climate for classy esoterica. Now Mr. Lloyd is back at the same address with a starry revival of “Betrayal,” one of the most frequently performed plays by the Nobel laureate, who died in 2008. And lest anyone assume that casting the movie star Tom Hiddleston in a familiar Pinter title was a cynical cash grab, think again. Extended through June 8 to meet ticket demand, this “Betrayal” represents a benchmark achievement for everyone involved, and shows Pinter’s 1978 play in a revealing, even radical, new light. The play famously begins at the end of a prolonged love affair and winds backward to the impetuous gesture that started the relationship nine years earlier. But Pinter twice moves the action forward, too, and the jagged narrative traces the gathering anxiety and animosity as Robert (Hiddleston) learns during a holiday in Venice of the entanglement between his wife, Emma (Zawe Ashton), and his best friend, Jerry (a wonderfully open-faced Charlie Cox). Jerry and Emma meet regularly, in secret, at a North London apartment. Years after the play’s premiere at the National Theater, it became clear that Pinter based the play on his own affair with the English broadcaster Joan Bakewell. Mr. Lloyd, in a masterstroke, gives us the invisible presence of the third party who inevitably hovers over such scenarios: All three actors are onstage virtually throughout, shadowing or silently observing when they’re not part of a scene. So, when the two men are dining at an Italian restaurant without the woman they share, Emma is visible, too; when she is in the clutches of her husband or lover, the other man is never far from view. Jon Clark’s masterful lighting picks out the characters and throws their shimmering silhouettes against the back wall of Soutra Gilmour’s gorgeous if largely unadorned set: With the exception of a few chairs, there are hardly any props to get in the way. The elemental staging lets us peer deep into the sorrowful heart of this most wounding play. Mr. Lloyd shows that desolation is the actual bond between three restless people who cannot come to peace. The actors engage in a poignant ballet. At one point, they link bodies as if engaged in an actual dance. Ms. Ashton’s smile at the start (which, in narrative terms, is also the end) falls away to reveal an ache you sense will never subside, while Mr. Hiddleston has charisma and ferocity as Robert, the most feral of the three. The actor appears misty-eyed on more than one occasion, and I’d be surprised if his enthralled audience weren’t similarly affected. Pinter’s influence extends far and wide and includes, perhaps against expectation, the French playwright Florian Zeller, who has made clear his admiration for this most English of writers. Mr. Zeller also likes to play with time and perspective, and his writing shares a lean, bare-bones aesthetic familiar to admirers of Pinter, whose “Old Times” is a three-hander in which we aren’t always sure whether the characters are actually alive. (That same ambiguity courses through Mr. Zeller’s “The Height of the Storm,” which premiered in Paris in 2016 and will be seen on Broadway next fall.) It thus comes as something of a surprise to encounter the narrative straightforwardness of “The Son,” Mr. Zeller’s latest London opening after such titles as “The Father,” “The Mother,” “The Truth” and “The Lie.” The clean, streamlined production, directed by Michael Longhurst, will run at the Kiln Theater in North London until April 6. What you see is what you get in this account of a teenage son, Nicholas (Laurie Kynaston), whose psychological free fall brings calamity to his parents. Unable to understand, in his words, “the point of life,” Nicholas ricochets between his divorced mother and father, and their son’s distress only amplifies their own. Particular weight is given to the father, Pierre (John Light at his most intense), whose efforts to allay his son’s malaise, or even to understand it, backfire in ways that should not be given away here. You could even imagine this play’s being called “The Father,” had that title not already been used for the drama that first brought Mr. Zeller to attention in Britain and the United States, winning Olivier and Tony awards for its leading actors. “The Son” doesn’t offer its performers the same opportunities to burrow into their characters, who devolve into more agitated versions of themselves, without the depth of the trio in “Betrayal.” I found myself wishing for the nuance and complexity of Mr. Zeller’s earlier works, next to which “The Son” feels like a dramatized case study. This latest play does hold back one trick, setting up a preposterously sentimental ending that, it won’t surprise you, isn’t what it seems. By that point, though, the baldfaced quality of the play has the effect of running in place: You emerge impressed by the commitment of the actors, but little the wiser about the recesses of the human mind that Pinter makes endlessly provocative, sexy and moving.",The New York Times
2019,"A Pledge to End Austerity, After Brexit","Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, delivered a statement on the country’s economy on Wednesday that was something of a fiscal nonevent, with the specter of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, hanging over every economic projection. Mr. Hammond’s main message — that he could deliver more funds for public spending only if the British Parliament reaches a deal on Brexit — came a day after lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan by a large margin. With Mrs. May sitting behind him, Mr. Hammond conspicuously called for lawmakers “to put aside our differences and seek a compromise” on Brexit, something neither the prime minister nor the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has yet accepted. “Higher unemployment, lower wages, higher prices in the shops. That is not what the British people voted for in June 2016,” he said, referring to the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. Here are five takeaways from the chancellor’s spring statement. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a slowdown in the global economy has cut growth in 2019 to 1.2 percent from the 1.6 percent projected in last year’s autumn budget. The British economy is set to grow by 1.4 percent in 2020 and by 1.6 percent in the following two years, according to official forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. One bright spot is wage growth, which has been revised upward to at least 3 percent each year, with the work force expanding by 600,000 by 2023, Mr. Hammond said. With public sector borrowing trending down, Mr. Hammond pledged to increase the Brexit dividend to 26.6 billion pounds, about $35 billion, but that comes with a catch: British lawmakers would have to vote pronto to leave the European Union with a deal. In a statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility attributed the improved fiscal climate to higher income tax receipts and lower than expected interest costs. Once again, Mr. Hammond hedged the good news with a familiar caveat: Parliament first has to agree on a deal for Brexit. A smooth Brexit will see a “deal dividend,” an economic boost that will free up resources for schools, police and social care, areas that have suffered significantly from over a decade of budget cuts under the conservative government’s austerity policy. Analysts were quick to point out that the government has been making such promises for some time now, but the promised spending increases have failed to materialize. “The repeated promise that austerity is coming to an end will ring hollow for the millions of low wage, disabled and unemployed people who will see their social security and tax credits frozen for another year from April,” Dr. Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said on Wednesday. The government will fund free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges in England in response to concerns that some girls are missing school because they cannot afford to buy their own products, Mr. Hammond said. The announcement comes after a two-year campaign started by Amika George, 19, who had read reports that schoolgirls in the northern city of Leeds were using newspaper, socks and toilet paper because they could not afford sanitary products and would sometimes miss school to avoid embarrassment. “It’s definitely a really huge number,” Ms. George said in a phone interview. “This isn’t a small minority of people that it’s affecting at all. It’s definitely prevalent, and it’s something that the government needs to take action on.” Knife crime, which rose for the fourth straight year in 2018, is a hot-button issue these days. To help address it, an additional 100 million pounds, or $130 million, will be made available for police forces across England and Wales to help tackle knife crime, which has risen for a fourth consecutive year. Police funding in England and Wales fell by 19 percent between 2010-11 and 2018-19, the National Audit Office says. The extra funding will be spent on additional overtime targeted on knife crime and new violent crime reduction units, Mr. Hammond said. The announcement falls short of the 200 to 300 million pounds, about $260 million to $390 million, requested by the National Police Chief’s Council last week.",The New York Times
2019,A Poet Remembers Her Impulsive Trip Into a Civil War,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Who is Gómez? Nobody knows.” The person who issued this cryptic statement was none other than Gómez himself — Leonel Gómez Vides, a coffee farmer from El Salvador who showed up in Southern California on the doorstep of the poet Carolyn Forché in 1977, with a bundle of papers under his arm and his two young daughters in tow. Within a few days he persuaded Forché to make her first trip to El Salvador, just as the country was on the verge of civil war. In “What You Have Heard Is True,” Forché traces how this initial encounter with a stranger irrevocably changed the course of her art and her life. Forché was 27 at the time, a Midwesterner living in San Diego, with a budding reputation for her work. She had heard Gómez’s name before, when she traveled to Spain to translate the poems of his cousin Claribel Alegría, though nobody could say for sure whether Claribel’s cousin was working with the Salvadoran guerrillas or with the C.I.A. Until the publication of this memoir, Forché’s experiences in El Salvador — seven “extended stays” between 1978 and 1980 — have mostly stayed distilled in her poetry. “The Colonel,” collected in “The Country Between Us” (1981), begins with an elegant dinner at a colonel’s home (rack of lamb, green mangoes) and ends with him emptying a grocery sack full of human ears onto the table — ghastly trophies from a dirty war. Taking its title from the first line of that poem, Forché’s memoir starts off slowly, as she describes in minute detail how she made the fateful and seemingly inexplicable decision to follow a mysterious stranger’s directive to take such a perilous trip. But once Forché’s story gathers momentum, it’s hard to let the narrative go. “What You Have Heard Is True” is billed, per its subtitle, as “a memoir of witness and resistance.” That’s fair enough, but it does this riveting book a mild disservice; the memoir I read was more intricate and surprising than such an earnest descriptor lets on. For a while, it isn’t at all clear how much Gómez can be trusted. When he first shows up, he draws Forché pictures of Spanish galleons, explains how the conquistadors brutalized the Indians, and uses a toothpick holder and a saltshaker to dramatize the infighting among Salvadoran officers after nearly 50 years of a military dictatorship. He offers grisly disquisitions on the death squads, on the disappeared, on body parts washing up on the beach. Forché tells him that he would be better off enlisting a journalist to document what is happening in his country. “I want a poet,” he insists. “Why do you think I came all this way?” Once Forché arrives in El Salvador, Gómez drives her around in his white Toyota Hiace, constantly glancing in the rearview mirror, a handgun tucked into a copy of Time magazine between them. He takes her to the countryside to meet with peasant farmers, or campesinos, who don’t have enough to eat. He takes her to the United States embassy, where the ambassador warns her against Gómez because “we don’t know who he is.” Gómez even takes her to El Salvador’s military headquarters, where he talks candidly to a lieutenant colonel about how all the disappearances are making the army look bad — before he asks whether he might use the lieutenant colonel’s shower. The whole thing comes across as baffling — much as it does to Forché herself, at least at first. We gradually become acquainted with Gómez and his country through Forché’s eyes, as she starts off knowing almost nothing, then learns a little bit, and then a little bit more. Gómez is incensed by the abject poverty in most of his country, where campesinos live in huts made of mud and junkyard scraps. “If the Salvadoran campesinos fight,” he says, “they must win. If they do not win, they will suffer for another 200 years.” But he’s also a landowner. He’s against corruption and in favor of reform, yet he claims “no doctrinal allegiances.” His copy of Machiavelli has been thumbed through so many times that it’s held together with a rubber band. When Forché remarks on the Che Guevara poster in his home, he says: ‘Yes, well, I have posters of Mussolini too, if the need arises.” She realizes that what Gómez calls his “symphony of illusion” — “He talks to this one. He talks to that one.” — turns out to be the only way for him to help reformist efforts against a murderous regime while trying, as much as he can, to protect himself. “Terror is the given of the place,” Joan Didion wrote in her 1983 book “Salvador.” Forché describes being chased by death squads — not once, but twice. The killings become so indiscriminate that she grows familiar with the “rotting, sweet, sickening” smell of dead bodies left by the side of the road. An excerpt from the unpunctuated notes she took at the time — scribbled in pencil, “to keep the writing light and erasable” — captures how corpses were mutilated into instruments of intimidation: “When mere death no longer instills fear in the population the stakes must be raised the people must be made to see that not only will they die but die slowly and brutally.” Behind most of the killings during El Salvador’s 12-year civil war were government forces, which were in turn bolstered by American money and American training. Forché alludes to the political context in the book, but the shape of her memoir hews closely to what she herself saw and heard — and how, out of the horror, she began to discern what she needed to do. Forché returned to the United States to write what she called “a poetry of witness” (“born to an island of greed / and grace where you have this sense / of yourself as apart from others”), married a war photographer, had a child. “You have to be able to see the world as it is, to see how it is put together, and you have to be able to say what you see,” Gómez said, but he left it up to Forché to figure out the rest for herself. “I do not have your answers,” he told her. “I am just a man.”",The New York Times
2019,A Possible Alzheimer’s Treatment With Clicks and Flashes? It Worked on Mice,"Researchers hope the techniques can be applied to help people with Alzheimer’s. Could people’s eyes and ears help fix the damage Alzheimer’s disease does to the brain? Just by looking at flashing light and listening to flickering sound? A new study led by a prominent M.I.T. neuroscientist offers tantalizing promise. It found that when mice engineered to exhibit Alzheimer’s-like qualities were exposed to strobe lights and clicking sounds, important brain functions improved and toxic levels of Alzheimer’s-related proteins diminished. What’s more, the rapid-fire soundtrack appeared to make mice better at cognitive and memory skills, like navigating mazes and recognizing objects. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Of course, mice are not people. And many drugs that have helped Alzheimer’s-engineered mice haven’t done much for people with Alzheimer’s, which affects 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million Americans. Also, because the technique didn’t have long-lasting effects — results faded about a week after the sensory stimulation was stopped — any therapy developed from the research might have to be repeated regularly. Still, seeing that a noninvasive daily dose of light and sound could have such significant effects in mice give some experts reason for optimism. “It’s exciting, I think,” said Dr. Lennart Mucke, director of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, who was not involved in the study. “Reading the paper made me quite enthusiastic about seeing this move forward into some well-crafted clinical trials.” The experiments were led by Li-Huei Tsai, director of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. She and her colleagues showed that light and sound delivered to mice at a certain frequency — 40 hertz or 40 flashes or clicks per second — appears to synchronize the rhythm of the brain’s gamma waves, which is disrupted in patients with Alzheimer’s. Gamma waves are among several types of electrical brain waves believed to be involved in concentration, sleep, perception and movement. Somehow — neither Dr. Tsai nor outside experts are quite sure how — 40 hertz produces a gamma-wave oscillation that appears to increase activation of cells called microglia, which perform trash-clearing and immune-regulating functions. The microglia became more efficient at chewing up the amyloid protein that forms toxic plaques in Alzheimer’s. Another Alzheimer’s-related protein, tau, which forms tangles, also decreased. And in the sound experiments, brain blood vessels also worked better, further helping clear harmful proteins. Especially striking was that these effects occurred in brain areas active in memory formation, planning and decision-making, and that the mice became better at learning and remembering. “The effects on cognitive function are pretty big,” said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which funds some of Dr. Tsai’s work. He said the results of the study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, are “definitely something that I don’t think anybody could have predicted.” Enhancing or regulating electrical brain activity through techniques like surgically implanted electrodes is used to treat some other conditions, like Parkinson’s and obsessive-compulsive disorder. And previous research has shown that the activity of gamma waves, the highest-frequency waves ranging from 25 to 140 hertz, decreases in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s. Intrigued, Dr. Tsai began experimenting with light, and in 2016, she and colleagues showed, after trying different frequencies, that light flickering at 40 hertz, beamed at mice an hour daily for a week, decreased amyloid and tau and revved up microglia in the brain’s visual cortex. Aiming to reach other brain areas, she tried sound, settling on clicks because “your brain seems to be able to perceive clicks more than a tone,” she said. Her team found that 40 hertz clicks, broadcast from speakers over mouse enclosures, produced the same brain changes in the auditory cortex and the nearby hippocampus, an area active in forming memories that is damaged early in Alzheimer’s. The mice also performed better at maze navigating and recognizing objects they had seen before. Light and sound combined magnified the brain effects and extended them to the prefrontal cortex, a key area for planning and executing tasks. “it’s stunning that the intervention had beneficial effects on so many different aspects of Alzheimer-like pathology,” said Dr. Mucke, who is also a professor of neurology and neuroscience at University of California San Francisco. “On the other hand, it shouldn’t be surprising that the brain is influenced by outside stimuli because what it was designed for was to adapt to a changing environment.” The results also dovetail with findings by Dr. Mucke and his colleagues, who have genetically altered brain cells called interneurons, which he likened to conductors of the brain’s orchestra. The altered interneurons enhanced gamma rhythm activity, generating cognitive improvement in mice. “When there isn’t proper brain rhythm, there is disharmony and everyone is sort of playing when they want to, a little like the tuning up of an orchestra,” he said. His colleagues are also developing a drug that would have similar effects. So there might be several ways to enhance gamma rhythms, he said. Because the brain changes subsided somewhat after a week without the light or sound treatment, experts said it’s likely that people would need such stimulation consistently, essentially a sensory version of a daily pill to control a chronic condition. Dr. Tsai’s team has tested light and sound on healthy people, using a four-by-three-foot light panel and high-quality stereo speakers, “so the sound is more tolerable to humans, because it’s not melody, it’s clicks,” she said. Electroencephalogram measurements show the desired gamma-wave effect, she said, and “nobody complains about any discomfort or headache or anything.” They will soon start testing on people with mild Alzheimer’s. Dr. Tsai and a co-author, Edward Boyden, co-director of the M.I.T. Center for Neurobiological Engineering, have also co-founded a company, Cognito Therapeutics, which is testing a goggles-like light-and-sound device on Alzheimer’s patients, she said. Dr. Tsai said the company is not involved in her team’s academic research, which was funded by several foundations and the National Institutes of Health. Experts cautioned that people should wait for clinical trial results and shouldn’t suddenly start illuminating their homes with disco strobes or pipe clicking sounds through their earbuds. Still, said Dr. Koroshetz, sensory treatment is likely to be safe for most people. “Can’t think of any harm that can come out of this one,” he said. And because Alzheimer’s is so devastating, he added: “I think people would participate in studies, even if they require flashing lights for an hour and listening to a very quick drummer.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Race to Save Children After Nigeria Building Collapse, but 8 People Are Dead","LAGOS, Nigeria — Sunday Adeyemo left his home on crowded Lagos Island early Wednesday as he always does, only to receive devastating news just hours later: The three-story building that housed not just his family’s apartment, but a primary and nursery school, had collapsed. His 7-year-old daughter was inside. She did not survive. At least eight people have died, Nigerian officials said by late Wednesday evening. “I’m totally devastated,” said a badly shaken Mr. Adeyemo, who was on the way to the hospital to collect the body of his daughter, Taiwo, a second-grader. Scenes of horror and grief surrounded the building that had housed the Ohel Nursery and Primary School on Wednesday, as terrified parents and hundreds of onlookers hoped for the best. At least 70 people were inside the building at 10 a.m. when it fell, and possibly many more, neighbors said. Rescue efforts continued into the night. Workers had pulled at least 37 people alive from the site, government officials said, tossing aside backpacks and classroom equipment to dig through the rubble. Many were dusty and dazed toddlers who were slung over the shoulders of workers and carried to waiting ambulances. Some were limp. Fashanu Kudus, who lives in a house overlooking the rescue site, said he had watched the building collapse. “We just heard ‘wham’ and the three-story building was reduced to rubble,” he said. It’s a scene that has been repeated through the years in Lagos, Africa’s most populous city and one of the largest in the world, with an estimated 23.4 million people. Construction here is regulated poorly, if at all, residents have long complained. Some occupied buildings have cracked foundations and tilted floors, creating a sensation of walking on a listing ship. Lagos Island in particular is known for its poor urban planning, narrow access roads and lack of public water supply. “The developers just do whatever they like,” said Ruka Salami, who lives near the collapsed building. Akinwunmi Ambode, the governor of Lagos State, said the school had been operating illegally in a residential building, according to a statement. In fact, he added, most of the buildings in the area had been marked for demolition. He called for a “full scale investigation” into the cause of the collapse. But some residents at the scene blamed government negligence, saying the school building had been marked for demolition with a large “X,” but instead of being demolished, it was recently refurbished. Residents had complained of high rent, and some said they noticed signs of strain on the structure. On Wednesday morning, it took rescue crews a full hour to arrive at the scene, according to residents, who said they immediately started digging through the debris. “We started the rescue efforts and had rescued over 20 children alive before the emergency agencies came,” Adegoke Sharafa said. The construction company Julius Berger sent equipment to help the effort. At one point, one rescuer said he saw 20 children inside and feared the debris would collapse on them before they could be saved. Some workers demanded oxygen masks from an ambulance, but none were available. Onlookers became increasingly angry that rescuers were ill-equipped. A sea of spectators at the scene cheered and patted the backs of rescuers when they found victims, but created chaos for work crews and security officials. A video that circulated on social media showed a security official blocking one parent from the site. Dozens of traumatized parents gathered in the compound outside the General Hospital in Lagos Island, close to the collapsed school. Some wept and crumpled to the ground, while others called out for help when the hospital staff had no information. Dr. Titi Goncalvin, the minister of health for Lagos State, said the General Hospital had received 20 patients from the site. “Today’s a really tragic day for us,” said Dr. Goncalvin, speaking to reporters outside the hospital. One father clung to a lamppost while relatives tried to console him. His 8-year-old son had died, they said. “My child! My child!” he shouted over and over. “What will I do?” Nigerians have seen a series of building collapses in recent years. In 2016, a church fell in Uyo, southeast of Lagos, and officials at a local hospital put the death toll at 160, though government agencies cited lower figures. The same year, a five-story building under construction in the Lekki District of Lagos collapsed, killing at least 34 people. Seven were killed when a private residence fell in Ebute-Meta, a poor neighborhood, in 2013. Experts have warned that rising sea levels could cause more problems for Lagos, which is composed of a mainland bordered by the Gulf of Guinea and several islands. Lagos Island, in Lagos Lagoon, is one of them. Concerns about the safety of development abound. Construction is underway on Eko Atlantic, a luxury apartment and shopping development. Officials say the development, created by filling in six miles of land, will alleviate crowding and provide jobs. Developers have proposed building a sea wall to shield it from rising sea levels, but at least one scientist has warned that the wall could send surges to nearby areas. After Wednesday’s building collapse, President Muhammadu Buhari, who was recently re-elected to lead Nigeria, called on the state government “to do all that is needful, so that such tragic developments do not recur.” His calls were echoed by other aid groups including Plan International Nigeria, which demanded those responsible be punished.",The New York Times
2019,A Ragoût to Remember,"City Kitchen Made entirely of spring vegetables and served with lemony couscous, this ragoût is a most satisfying vegetarian supper. Is “ragoût” just a five-dollar word for stew, or is there a difference? To me, the French word sounds more elegant and painstaking. (To be clear, we’re not talking about ragù, an Italian pasta sauce.) And though a ragoût can take many forms, one made entirely of vegetables is something quite special. A good vegetable ragoût takes a bit of nursing. A Dutch oven makes a good cooking vessel, or a wide, heavy-bottomed pot. Each component is added sequentially, depending on its cooking time. It’s usual to start with an onion, which needs slow cooking to soften. Each successive ingredient adds a layer of flavor; by the end, all the elements have influenced one another, creating a harmonious, integrated whole. Since I wanted a green spring-vegetable ragoût, I chose onions, leeks, zucchini, asparagus, fava beans and peas, along with tender spinach. All of these are becoming available in warmer climates, though, on the East Coast and in northern regions, they may still be a few weeks away. (I’ll confess, I used vegetables from California, because they provided an illusion of the spring weather that has not yet arrived in New York.) But you can make a vegetable ragoût in any season, with whatever vegetables are available. I wanted my ragoût, though delicate, to have a Moroccan feel, so I included cumin, coriander, cilantro and a touch of green chile, and planned to serve it with a special kind of buttered couscous. Recently, I had the chance to work with the San Francisco chef Mourad Lahlou, who takes a modernist approach to Moroccan cuisine at his restaurant Mourad. He showed me a method for amazingly flavorful couscous. He tosses freshly steamed, saffron-tinted couscous with nutty sizzling brown butter and lots of chopped preserved lemon. This is not at all traditionally Moroccan, but it is fantastic. I used the instant couscous available in many supermarkets — Mr. Lahlou would not approve — but after the initial quick cooking, I steamed it over boiling water for another 30 minutes to make it lighter and fluffier, a compromise that makes a huge difference. Whether called a ragoût or a stew, this was the most satisfying vegetarian supper; a mingling of sweet spring vegetables, paired with the most brilliant golden couscous imaginable.

2019,"A Raised Middle Finger Is Protected Free Speech, Appeals Court Rules","A raised middle finger is a form of free speech, a court has ruled, allowing a lawsuit by a driver who made the vulgar gesture at a police officer. The decision came from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit last week, but it started with a spirited exchange in June 2017, when a woman gave the middle-finger salute to a police officer who had just written her a ticket. The woman, Debra L. Cruise-Gulyas, had been driving over the speed limit in Taylor, Mich. At first, there was a small mercy, according to the opinion written by Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton for a panel of three judges: The officer, Matthew W. Minard, wrote her a ticket for a non-moving violation, which is less serious than a typical speeding ticket. Ms. Cruise-Gulyas was driving away when, “apparently ungrateful for the reduction, she made an all-too-familiar gesture at Minard with her hand and without four of her fingers showing,” the opinion added. “That did not make Minard happy.” So he pulled her over again, the opinion said, and changed the ticket to reflect the more serious violation of speeding. Those were two separate traffic stops — a key point in this case. The judges found that the first stop was justified because Ms. Cruise-Gulyas had committed an infraction. But they added that “any authority to seize her in connection with that infraction ended when the first stop concluded,” meaning that the second stop, apparently in response to nothing more than a vulgar gesture, was not justified. Ms. Cruise-Gulyas claimed in a lawsuit that Officer Minard violated the First Amendment, by retaliating against her because of protected speech; the Fourth Amendment, because of the unreasonable seizure; and the 14th Amendment, for restricting her liberty. In response, Officer Minard argued for “qualified immunity,” a legal doctrine that can protect officials from lawsuits if they can show that the rights they violated were not clearly established; essentially, that they were acting in good faith. But a district court denied that motion, and the appeals court did the same in its decision last week. So, it has been affirmed: Raising your middle finger to a police officer is your First Amendment right. Or rather, it has been affirmed again. There are at least two earlier cases in which federal courts made similar decisions. In 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided against qualified immunity for a police officer who had arrested a teenage girl after she raised two middle fingers in front of him; the girl’s mother had been killed by the police a few years earlier. Also in 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided that an officer should not have been granted qualified immunity after he arrested a man who had raised a middle finger while passing by in a car. The officer had followed the car and a verbal confrontation had ended in the man’s arrest. These courtroom decisions do not necessarily mean that people can be rude to police officers with impunity, or that people would feel safe doing so, especially since police officers have used deadly force against unarmed people and avoided facing charges. Joanna C. Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an expert on police misconduct litigation, noted that Ms. Cruise-Gulyas and a few others had their rights recognized only after they went through the trouble of bringing their cases to court. “The right is there, but the enforcement of that right is a more complicated matter,” she said, noting that many people who experience police misconduct do not report it. “There is a gap between what the Constitution allows and requires, and how police behave on the street. And getting from the street to the courthouse is a long and expensive process.” But Professor Schwartz added that the visibility of these individual cases might be a good thing. “There is research showing that when courts clearly define what the Constitution allows or prohibits, then police departments are more likely to take those rules and incorporate them into their policies and trainings,” she said. In the opinion last week, Judge Sutton drew a line between vulgarity and crime. “Fits of rudeness or lack of gratitude may violate the Golden Rule,” he wrote. “But that doesn’t make them illegal or for that matter punishable.” A lawyer for Ms. Cruise-Gulyas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday, and a lawyer for Officer Minard declined to comment on pending litigation.",The New York Times
2019,A Real-Life Fairy Tale That Crossed the Sea of Japan,"Vows When Hannah Ryles was a junior at a Tokyo high school in 2008, she was determined to attend David Lee’s junior prom. “I loved him,” Ms. Ryles said, “and nothing was going to stop me from being with him that night.” Her father, Richard Ryles, a retired colonel in the United States Army, already knew that neither force nor negotiation would get his 17-year-old daughter to retreat from the idea of seeing Mr. Lee, a former classmate who was also 17. “There was no talking to Hannah when it came to David,” Mr. Ryles said. “She had already proved to us that she would move heaven and earth to see him, so we let her go.” Though Ms. Ryles left heaven and earth intact, she did cross the Sea of Japan — roughly three hours by plane — to attend Mr. Lee’s junior prom, which was held in Shanghai. Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee had met as classmates at the American School in Japan, an international private day school in Chōfu, Tokyo. Over the course of a decade, Hannah Ryles and David Lee traveled more than 100,000 miles to maintain their relationship. Here are the routes they took to be together. Philadelphia Kuala Lumpur Thailand Shanghai Melbourne Tokyo Great Barrier Reef Sydney Mr. Lee New Zealand Ms. Ryles Philadelphia Spring 2009 Attended each other’s senior proms in Shanghai and Tokyo. Fall 2010 Traveled to Philadelphia to attend college near each other. Kuala Lumpur Thailand Shanghai 2005–9 Consistently traveled to see each other while in high school.

Thailand Kuala Lumpur Shanghai 2005–9 Consistently traveled to see each other while in high school. Tokyo Summer 2015 Revisited Tameike- Sanno subway station in Tokyo to recreate their first kiss. Melbourne Great Barrier Reef Sydney 2013 Studied abroad in Australia, visiting Melbourne, Sydney, New Zealand and the Great Barrier Reef. Mr. Lee New Zealand Ms. Ryles By Scott Reinhard “She was the new kid in school and I had a crush on her,” said Mr. Lee, recalling the start of eighth grade in September 2004. “She was so beautiful that I just couldn’t muster the courage to approach her and start a conversation.” She also liked what she saw, hairdo aside. “He was this tall, lanky kid who wore nerdy glasses, and had this ridiculous bowl haircut,” Ms. Ryles said. “But he also had this remarkable confidence about him, which I observed in the second semester that year, when we ended up sitting at the same table in Japanese class.” Ms. Ryles, the daughter of Melissa and Mr. Ryles, a career Army man, had moved with her parents to Japan from St. Louis in 1999. They lived on two military bases, Sagami Depot and Camp Zama, each two hours from Tokyo. Five years later, her family moved to the suburbs of Tokyo, in Setagaya, as Mr. Ryles was transferred to the nearby Hardy Barracks in Akasaka. Mr. Lee, the son of Jin Lee and Yu-Ching Lee, had enrolled at the American School the previous year. His mother, an information technology specialist with the United States Foreign Service, left Davis, Calif., with her family and traveled to Akasaka, as she was assigned to the American Embassy there. Her family was housed on its residential compound. Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee briefly dated other classmates, but eventually began waiting out each other’s relationship as they held a huge, not-so-secret crush on one another. Ms. Ryles’s was the first to break up, and a few days later, when Mr. Lee told her that his relationship had also ended, Ms. Ryles literally pounced on him. “I just kind of jumped on him and gave him this giant hug,” she said. “One half of that hug was meant for being sympathetic, but the other half was meant for celebration.” They continued as friends before they began dating in April 2005, and soon after, “our mutual crush quickly blossomed into full-blown teenage puppy love,” Ms. Ryles said. They shared a first kiss at the ticket booth inside the Tameike-Sannō subway station, neither realizing that their young love was about to be thrown off course. By late summer, 2005, Mr. Lee’s mother had accepted a two-year assignment from the State Department that would take the family to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At around the same time, his father accepted a job in Shijiazhuang, China, working as the chief executive of a Chinese-Indian joint-venture pharmaceutical company and commuting from Kuala Lumpur. “We were both very upset, but despite the geographical distance that was about to come between us, we weren’t going to let each other go without a fight,” Ms. Ryles said. They made a pact to keep in touch, and did that through hourslong Skype sessions, phone calls and emails. “I kept telling David that Hannah lived too far away,” said Mr. Lee’s mother, Jin Lee. “He would look so sad on occasion because he missed her, and I would say, ‘David, there are so many girls out there, why are you doing this to yourself.’” But Mr. Lee would have none of it, and in the winter of 2005, he returned to Tokyo for a week to visit Ms. Ryles and other friends he had missed since his departure. The following spring, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee convinced their respective families to vacation in Thailand, both conveniently forgetting to explain the reason. “As soon as we arrived Hannah says to me, “Oh, by the way mom, David Lee and his family are here as well,” recalled Ms. Ryles’s mother, Melissa Ryles. “It was unbelievable.” The two family vacations overlapped by a single day, so the former classmates made a plan to introduce their parents once they arrived in Bangkok, then sped off to spend their precious time alone. When Mr. Lee’s parents saw that Ms. Ryles had dyed her hair red and was sporting large hoop earrings, they sent Mr. Lee’s younger brother, Jamie, to spy on them. “I guess I wasn’t a very effective spy,” Jamie Lee said, “because all I was able to report to my parents was that Hannah and David seemed to be having the greatest time.” Ultimately, the stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship while not knowing when they might see each other again took a toll, and Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, both 15, reluctantly agreed to start seeing other people. “I was heartbroken,” Ms. Ryles said. “That’s not what I wanted.” In the summer of 2006, Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo but chose not to see Ms. Ryles, because the thought of seeing her with another boy was too much to bear. He decided to call her from the airport, just before boarding a flight back to Kuala Lumpur. Ms. Ryles was heartbroken again. “I felt as if he had stood me up,” she said. Though their pact had come unglued, neither could stay angry, or apart from each other for very long. In January 2007, they patched up their friendship via social media and by February were professing their unwavering love for each other. In April that year, Ms. Ryles, then 16, convinced her parents to allow her to visit Mr. Lee in Kuala Lumpur, where they committed to a long-distance relationship. That summer, Mr. Lee began living with his father in Shanghai — making that decision after his mother decided to take a new assignment in Bangkok — and adding another international stop on a dizzying romantic journey that “mile for mile, began proving how truly committed Hannah and David were to each other,” Mr. Ryles said. Indeed, Mr. Lee and Ms. Ryles continued to pursue each other aggressively. In 2008 Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo for a visit, and this time, the teenagers spent the better part of a week together, catching up on their lives while exploring the city. That spring, Mr. Lee visited Ms. Ryles once more in Tokyo, and she returned the favor by “sneaking out” to his senior prom in Shanghai. This meant crossing the Sea of Japan once more, this time without telling her family. “I told my parents I was going hiking with a friend in the mountains of Japan for three days,” said Ms. Ryles, who played hooky from school one morning to get a visa for her excursion, and paid for round-trip airline tickets with money she had earned as a babysitter and as a school-bus monitor. “I also told my parents that we would have no cellphone reception, so don’t bother trying to call us,” she said. They continued to creatively scheme and boldly plot new ways to continue to see each other. But no scheme was as creative and no plot as bold as the one they would hatch that summer, when they both enrolled in a summer volunteer program to teach English to elementary school students in Ayutthaya, Thailand. By now, each was 18 and a high school senior. They received approval from their parents, who did not know that their children were going together. “David’s parents were very liberal, while my parents were much more conservative, which is why I always had to make up stories to go places,” Ms. Ryles said. “My parents always trusted me, and though they might not have known I was sneaking out, it was always with David, I never took advantage of their trust for any other reason.” For Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, the experience offered a first taste of living together for three months in a house in rural Thailand they shared with a high school teacher from Texas, a French university student, and several others. One month after they returned from Thailand, Ms. Ryles visited Mr. Lee in China once more, and in the spring of 2009, they continued to rack up frequent flier miles as Mr. Lee managed to find a way to escort Ms. Ryles to her senior prom in Tokyo. After high school graduation, they decided to go to nearby colleges in the United States. Ms. Ryles went to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she studied psychology, and Mr. Lee to Haverford College, less than a mile away, where he studied chemistry. They spent one semester of their junior year studying abroad together at the University of Melbourne, in Australia, then went on to Sydney, then New Zealand and on to the Great Barrier Reef before returning to their respective colleges, from which they each graduated in 2013. For the next two years, they lived together in Philadelphia, working as technicians in cancer research laboratories. Life was beautiful, but not quite as easy beneath a roof that did not include their parents. “We would come home from work smelling like mice from working in mouse research laboratories all day,” Ms. Ryles said. “Our apartment also had no working heat.” She took on a second job as a waitress at an Italian restaurant, working nights and weekends to help pay bills. Both applied to medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where they were accepted. But before medical school began in 2015, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee made yet another international voyage, a sentimental trip back to China and Japan, where they revisited the Tameike-Sannō subway station in Tokyo to recreate their first kiss. The next year, Mr. Lee proposed to Ms. Ryles in John F. Collins Park across from where they now live in Philadelphia in front of close friends and family. Mr. Lee’s parents and his younger brother, Jamie, as well as Ms. Ryles’s sister and brother-in-law, Elizabeth and Scott Downie, were all there to witness the moment. Afterward, everyone sat around a photo album that Ms. Ryles had been putting together since the day she met Mr. Lee, flipping through pages filled with pictures of their days in middle school, high school and college, and many other images from across a decade filled with more than 100,000 miles worth of sacrifice, commitment and dedication. “It’s like no other fairy tale I have ever heard of,” Mr. Lee’s father, Yu-Ching Lee, said. In May, Ms. Ryles will graduate from medical school and begin applying for obstetrician/gynecological residency programs, while Mr. Lee completes his Ph.D. in genomics and computational biology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Every day when I see Hannah’s beautiful face,” Mr. Lee said, “I’m reminded that life is an exciting, happy, sad, inspiring, scary, wonderful, beautiful adventure.” Their adventure continued on Feb. 2 in Philadelphia, where Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee were married in a self-uniting ceremony at Union Trust, an events space where the reception was also held. Ms. Ryles’s father presided over the ceremony, which included 112 guests, among them the bride’s paternal grandmother, Tomiko Fujiwara, 83, and her great-aunt in-law, Tamae Onodera, 76. Both women served as flower girls, each toting a basket filled with white rose petals that they scattered down the aisle ahead of the bride’s grand entrance. The bride, immaculate in a lace and ivory Mikado Lazaro dress, began to cry midway through her vows when she said to her new husband, “We’ve grown up together, navigated through stages in our lives together, and grown together into the people we are today.” The groom, suave in a black tuxedo and a slick hairdo returned a bit of sentiment to his new wife. “Before I knew myself, I knew that I wanted to spend as much time with you as I possibly could, I couldn’t get enough of you,” he said. ""You have turned out to be perfect for me in ways that I couldn’t even imagine, and continue to discover every single day.”",The New York Times
2019,A Recipe for Fulfillment: ‘You’ve Got to Be Connected.’,"Letter 98 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. ___ When you’re lucky enough to get a visit from Sam Sifton, The New York Times’s food editor, you eat. And when you eat with Sam, you learn and you gorge. This week, we did oodles of both at Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney, thanks to the chef Paul Carmichael. He cooked for a small group of us. We were seated at the bar by the kitchen, giving us a chance to watch in awe as he and his team delivered a meal unlike any other. It started with a savory plantain doughnut, followed by sea urchin on crunchy cassava, duck, fish heads (they were amazing, really), a cold pork soup and a spiced cake I’m hoping will appear in my dreams. This was the “strong personal imprint” that Pete Wells, The Times’s main restaurant critic, identified when he wrote about Paul in 2017. Somehow, near a casino in Sydney, he wrote, there was a chef from the United States via Barbados, who “treats Australia as a Caribbean island that somehow got loose and wandered thousands of miles into the Pacific.” In our case, Paul added a touch more detail and intrigue with each dish he sent our way. Near the end, when we got to his version of souse — a light pork stew from Barbados that he served cold and elegant — he was clearly in a groove. [Hungry? Read Besha Rodell’s review of Momofuku Seiobo.] We asked him about how or where he works out his concoctions. He turned us a sly smile. “You’ve got to be connected,” he said. “What do you mean?” we asked. He pointed to what we were eating. It had only four ingredients, and because the pork came from oft-unused parts of the pig ( the feet, the face etc.) the flavors and texture changed with each batch. The timing of when to serve it changed too, he said, depending how the ingredients interacted. “If you just sent someone the recipe, and they just did that, it wouldn’t work,” he said. “You’ve got to be connected.” Aha — suddenly, I got it. This was not the usual “connected” — it was the opposite of email, of social media, or of the “connected” sometimes used to refer to mafia figures or real-life power dynamics. This was the connected of concentration — deep concentration and the maintenance of focus in service of creativity. It was the same radioactive element described earlier in the night by Kylie Kwong, the owner and chef behind the restaurant Billy Kwong, who was interviewed by Sam at Carriageworks for Times subscribers. She talked a lot with Sam about becoming “obsessed” — with native Australian ingredients for one — and about how she’s happiest when living in the moment. For both Kylie and Paul, staying connected to what you make seemed to be a prerequisite for fulfillment. I tend to agree: Whether it’s food, fiction, art or journalism, there needs to be time and room for holding on, trying, reflecting, trying and trying again. In today’s world, this is not an easy thing to pull off. Many of us need help. When we looked at February’s most popular Times stories for Australian readers and readers around the world, these two came up: • Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain • Let Children Get Bored Again: Boredom teaches us that life isn’t a parade of amusements. More important, it spawns creativity and self-sufficiency. What that tells me is that something deep in our collective soul — or at least the collective soul of Times readers — seems to know that we need more of what Paul’s talking about. We need to be connected … the question is: How? Next time Sam comes to Australia, I’ll do my best to keep probing. And eating. And learning. Now here are a few stories to chew on, chosen by our bureau’s hungry up-and-comer, Isabella Kwai. ___ • A Rugby Revolution for Asia and the Pacific: An Australian billionaire is pushing a new rugby league aimed at revolutionizing the sport and enhancing its popularity in Asia and the Pacific. • Leaving It All Behind for the Love of Nebbiolo: Luke Lambert in the Yarra Valley makes fine syrahs and chardonnays. But he wants to grow just one grape, make one wine and do it all himself. • Attack on Government Minister Rattles New Zealand’s Friendly Politics: The attack on the minister for climate change stunned a country where only the prime minister has security and constituents don’t shy from approaching their leaders. • In Australia, a 9-Hole Retreat That’s Cost-Free for War Veterans: Greg Carter really likes to golf. The Australian Vietnam War veteran enjoys it so much that one day, he put a hole in the yard of his sprawling 52-acre property in the Gippsland Lakes region. • Congratulations, It’s Twins. The Doctor Is Perplexed: It seems like it should not be possible, but a recent case showed that sometimes a boy and a girl are born as semi-identical twins. ___ On Wednesday, George Pell, an Australian cardinal who was the Vatican’s chief financial officer, was sentenced to six years in prison for molesting two boys after Sunday Mass in 1996. Many say the case has hardened distrust and anger among Catholics in Australia, pushing the country’s once robust church further into a precipitous decline: We investigate that trend. Read about how other countries like the United States, Italy and the Philippines have punished abusive clergy. And how did we report the case while under a strict suppression order that kept it secret from the public? In this Times Insider piece, Damien Cave and our reporter Livia Albeck-Ripka take us behind the scenes and into the courtroom. (And also about being willing going to jail.) ___ This week’s big international news story: All Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft are believed to have been pulled from use worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday that killed over 150 people raised questions about the plane’s safety. It was the second such crash in months. The victims were from around the world, including professors from Kenya, aid workers from Ethiopia, a career ambassador from Nigeria and a fisheries consultant from Britain. Three generations from one Canadian family also perished in the crash. We created a graphic of all flights that used the Boeing aircraft globally, including Fiji Airways and SilkAir, who operated it on routes to and from Australia. Got questions about the aircraft?

2019,Opinion | A Register of Military Women,"letter A retired Army major general talks about preserving their “valuable and varied contributions.” To the Editor: “40 Stories From Women About Life in the Military” (At War, nytimes.com, March 8) comes at the right time. These stories of women who have served their country, and the important roles they have played, are largely unknown. Beginning with the American Revolution, some three million women have served in the United States armed forces. Many are also unaware that there is a registry of servicewomen and female veterans — the largest and only publicly available one — that totals more than a quarter-million. Maintained by the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation, this registry is preserving stories like these so that future generations will come to know the valuable and varied contributions of America’s military women. At a time when the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that female veterans are the fastest-growing veteran population, recognizing the collective service of women is more important than ever. All women who defended the United States should feel proud and know that no matter what they did during their service, it’s an important part of history. Without their stories our history will never be complete.

2019,A Right Hook in Berkeley Revives Debate Over Campus Speech,"SAN FRANCISCO — The University of California Police Department on Friday arrested a suspect in the assault of a conservative activist on the Berkeley campus, reviving a debate over free speech at colleges. Neither the suspect, Zachary Greenberg, nor the man he is accused of punching, Hayden Williams, a field representative of the Leadership Institute, an organization that provides training to conservative campus groups, was a student at the university. The attack on Feb. 19 took place at Sproul Plaza, the birthplace and symbol of the Free Speech movement, the protests by students in the 1960s demanding greater political expression. Mr. Williams was helping a campus group that was recruiting members. Conservative groups said the assault on Mr. Williams served as a symbol of what they say is continued intolerance toward conservative views on college campuses. Mr. Williams appeared on Fox News programs with a black eye, and videos of his assault were widely shared on social media. The episode was only a faint echo of the brawl at the Berkeley campus in February 2017 when a group clad in black clothing and carrying sticks smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building in response to a planned speech by the right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, causing around $100,000 in damage. In an interview Mr. Williams said he and the students he was seeking to train had made signs supporting President Trump and criticizing Jussie Smollett, the actor who has been charged in connection with his own assault in Chicago. One of the signs said, “This is MAGA country,” Mr. Williams said. Two men are seen in multiple videos of the episode approaching Mr. Williams, who begins filming them. One man points to the signs and accuses Mr. Williams of “encouraging violence.” A man is then seen pushing Mr. Williams, showering him with expletives and delivering a powerful right hook to his face. A university spokeswoman said the campus police would present the case to the Alameda County district attorney for the filing of criminal charges. In a statement, Carol Christ, the chancellor of the university, called the attack “reprehensible.” “That sort of behavior is intolerable and has no place here,” the chancellor said. “Our commitment to freedom of expression and belief is unwavering.” Bryan Bernys, the head of the Campus Leadership Program at the Leadership Institute, accused the Berkeley campus of encouraging “a culture that fosters this type of horrible behavior toward anyone or anything that you disagree with.” The Leadership Institute runs a website called Campus Reform, which says it “exposes the liberal bias and abuse against conservatives on America’s colleges and universities.” “What does it say about Berkeley that this gentleman felt that he could go up and basically sucker-punch or cold-cock Hayden in the middle of a public square for no other reason than he disagreed with some of his speech and the signs that were out there,” Mr. Bernys said. Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, described Mr. Greenberg as a “lone actor.” “Many people seem to think that somehow this university of all places should have the ability to prevent all crime even when it’s the responsibility of a lone, crazy individual,” Mr. Mogulof said. As a measure of its commitment to ideological pluralism, Mr. Mogulof said the university spent $4 million last year for security and logistics to host conservative speakers, among them Rick Santorum, the former Republican senator and presidential candidate; Dennis Prager, the conservative talk show host; and Heather Mac Donald, the conservative writer and political commentator.",The New York Times
2019,A Risk Starbucks Won’t Mention: Howard Schultz Could Help Trump,"Strategies Starbucks’ stock has been soaring, its earnings are strong, and it has been expanding rapidly in its fastest-growing major market, China. Yet as shareholders head toward the company’s annual meeting on March 20, there is a cloud on the horizon: the risk that latte lovers will punish Starbucks because they are turned off by Howard Schultz’s prospective campaign for president. Mr. Schultz, who presided over Starbucks when it went public in 1992 and dominated it for years, gave up his last operational position at Starbucks in June. Still, the company embodies his taste and vision. What’s more, Mr. Schultz remains Starbucks’ largest individual shareholder, and the current chief executive, Kevin Johnson, is his chosen successor. In official documents, Starbucks says this is a “pivotal year,” one in which it is making the transition from a “founder-led” to a “founder-inspired” company. That would have been hard enough if Mr. Schultz, 65, had retired quietly, said Nancy F. Koehn, a historian at the Harvard Business School who has studied Mr. Schultz and Starbucks extensively. But his incipient quest for the presidency as a third-party candidate, she said, makes the handover much more difficult. “When a charismatic leader steps away from a company he — or she — has essentially created, it’s not easy for a successor to pick up the reins of energy and inspiration and engagement,” Ms. Koehn said. “But now, with Howard saying he is, or may be, running for president, in a year in which so many people feel so passionately about unseating the current president, Donald Trump, the transition is immeasurably harder.” A longtime Democrat, Mr. Schultz said in late January that he was “seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent.” And since late January, he has been acting like a candidate — crisscrossing the country, promoting a new book and criticizing what he calls ”a broken system where the extreme left and the extreme right will not give the people what they want.” Along the way, he has attracted the enmity of Democrats who fear that if he actually runs as a third-party candidate, he will aid in the re-election of President Trump. In a tweet on Jan. 26, for example, Neera Tanden, the president of Center for American Progress, a liberal nonprofit group, and a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, called Mr. Schultz’s political project “disgusting” and said she would organize a Starbucks boycott if his exploratory effort became a bona fide campaign. “I’m not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win,” she said. Starbucks evidently considers Mr. Schultz’s presidential ambitions toxic enough that it will not comment about him at all. When I contacted the company for this column, it referred me to a statement Mr. Johnson issued to employees on Jan. 28. “Many of us will inevitably be asked if the company supports a possible presidential candidacy of Howard and what changes for Starbucks. As a company, we don’t get involved in national political campaigns,” he said. “And nothing changes for Starbucks.” As a company that must depend on the good will of customers, Starbucks meticulously listed eight pages of “risk factors” in its 2018 annual report. It warned, for example, that “consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly” if the company or its partners “are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially biased or unequal treatment basis or socially irresponsible manner.” Starbucks did not address the risk that, fair or not, consumer demand might “diminish significantly” if Mr. Schultz pursued his presidential ambitions. For anything “Howard Schultz-related” now, the company said, I needed to talk to Mr. Schultz’s personal representatives. So I reached out to the fledgling Schultz political operation. Erin McPike, a spokeswoman, said she worked for a “testing-the-waters operation, which is not yet a formal presidential campaign.” “Let me make perfectly clear that he left Starbucks and left the board of directors and separated himself from the company,” Ms. McPike said. “He has made a complete separation. He’s not tied to it in an active way.” While that appears to be true, Mr. Schultz is tied to the company in countless other ways. Notably, his wealth was derived from Starbucks and remains intimately connected with it. The company’s current proxy describes Mr. Schultz’s finances extensively, for example, citing him by name 93 times — more than the combined total of Mr. Johnson and Myron E. Ullman III, the chairman. With the help of Courtney Yu, director of research for Equilar, an executive compensation firm, I obtained a tally of Mr. Schultz’s compensation and holdings. In the company’s 2018 fiscal year, for the months that he was executive chairman his salary was only $1. But Equilar found that Mr. Schultz’s actual pay — including exercised stock options, vested stock and retirement income — amounted to $76,745,740. I asked Mr. Yu to assess Mr. Schultz’s total Starbucks compensation going back to 2007. It amounted to $774,622,478. And then there was his Starbucks stock: He controlled 37,694,049 shares on Dec. 17. On Friday afternoon, those shares would have been worth about $2.6 billion. It is not just that Starbucks generated Mr. Schultz’s wealth. The company is his main credential as a prospective chief executive for America. “My business experience is not qualification to run for president, but it is what I’ve learned along the way,” he said in a Houston “town hall” carried on CNN. He added: “Look at Starbucks, what I’ve done in the last 36 years.” In politics, Mr. Schultz is positioning himself as socially liberal but fiscally conservative, a status that is consistent with his policies at Starbucks. He points to a socially conscious company that has provided good health care, pay and education benefits for its diverse work force — as well as enormous profits for investors. Since 1992, the annualized return on its shares has been 22.7 percent, according to Bloomberg. Mr. Schultz has made longtime shareholders rich. In an interview, Greg Strimple, Mr. Schultz’s pollster, said: “As core Howard Schultz voters, we see about 25 percent of the Democratic electorate — people who would be in the Biden-Bloomberg-business wing of the party — plus the Romney-Jeb Bush ‘Never Trumper’ part of the Republican Party, plus a lot of independents. And that’s just a start.” Michael R. Bloomberg’s decision not to seek the presidency in 2020 provides Mr. Schultz with running room, his associates said, while his options narrow if Joseph R. Biden Jr. embarks on a campaign. On the other hand, they said, his path widens if someone like Senator Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. That calculus enrages many Democrats: Any Democratic votes he might receive, as an independent, could simply help the Republican candidate, presumably Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Schultz says he opposes. But Mr. Strimple said Mr. Schultz could attract Republican votes and wasn’t aiming to be a spoiler. “When people say he’s a spoiler, we frame it as the ‘two-party system is broken, and it’s time for a centrist leader who will bring the country together,’” Mr. Strimple said. “When people look at it that way, we find he gets a lot of support.” How much support remains to be seen. Mr. Schultz will probably decide whether to run during the summer, Ms. McPike said. Early polls are unreliable, and the presidential race is fluid. No polls that I have seen indicate that Mr. Schultz could win the presidency, though some suggest that he might well disrupt the election. That possibility already troubles some Starbucks customers, who have been using the #boycottstarbucks hashtag to express their opinions on Twitter. Some protesters have called for a boycott using other platforms. Michael Moore, the filmmaker, has called for one until Mr. Schultz says he won’t run. A Bloomberg analysis points out that 70 percent of Starbucks stores in the United States are in counties that tend to vote Democratic, making the coffee chain vulnerable to discontent on the left. In short, it seems safe to say the more attention Mr. Schultz’s nascent independent candidacy gets, the greater the likelihood that Starbucks customers will buy their lattes elsewhere.",The New York Times
2019,A Road-Paving Job Takes On a Sinister Allure in Dave Eggers’s New Novel,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE PARADE By Dave Eggers Place, Eudora Welty wrote, is where an author’s quest for truth starts. A novel doesn’t “begin to glow,” Welty claimed, until its setting comes to be “accepted as true.” For authors inclined to rebel against this kind of dictum, withholding the particulars of a place can be a way to pursue a different kind of truth, less about conjuring place than about conjuring patterns in human failure found all over. Dave Eggers embarks on that alternative quest in his eighth novel, “The Parade.” In an unnamed country, two unnamed employees of a foreign road-building corporation arrive for a 12-day assignment. In time for a planned national parade, they must pave a road extending from the rural south to the urban north of a nation “awake and alive after a civil war its residents assumed would have no end.” To avoid the men being ransomed or killed, the company advises them to withhold their names and nationalities not only from civilians but from each other. In lieu of names, the men reduce themselves to numbers: “Four” for the man who will run the paving machine and “Nine” for his wily assistant. Readers, too, are shut out of any background information on either man, an authorial choice that generates a subtle tension throughout the novel. Without the usual biographical hints tucked into conversations and internal thoughts, Eggers differentiates between Four and Nine solely through their reactions to the post-civil-war devastation around them. How this setup reduces the two men to their willingness — or refusal — to see others is striking. Four’s rote reiterations of company policy establish him as the strict protocol man. He expresses more emotion about the efficiency of the new machine he will be driving than about the legless men on the roadside or the teenagers “carrying unloaded AKs” like some kind of school gear. Four dismisses all the despair around him as “standard for a developing country after a war.” By contrast, his assistant, Nine, is all debauchery — a party boy on the prowl for easy sex among the “million displaced” and “ten thousand orphans.” Each time Four reminds Nine about the need to complete the road quickly per government order, Nine talks about sex, or about the fresh eggs he bought “that taste like life,” unlike the inedible nutrition bars their company stocks for them in the paving machine. With “The Parade” as the novel’s title, a reader knows the event will likely coincide with some kind of occurrence that will shake Four and Nine out of the complacent roles they have assumed, or are playacting. Just as Four and Nine withhold their own names, they also withhold naming how the new government gained control of the country, what crimes the two of them might be wittingly, or unwittingly, helping to perpetuate with the road they’ve come to pave, and along which the new government will soon consolidate its power. “You’re not staying for the parade?” Nine asks in the final pages. “I can’t,” Four replies, citing family obligations, that ever-overused justification for complicity in larger injustices. Most of the dialogue in the novel is stripped down to brief exchanges like this, with nothing distinctive or idiosyncratic in the characters’ voices. To avoid any speech patterns that may hint at a particular language or country contributes to the parable-like feel of the novel but it can also deplete some scenes of their vitality. Even when an escalating crisis obliges Four to leave the safety of his tanker-style paving machine and depend on the good will of several local men, his internal thoughts undergo little change. No release occurs in the word choice or in the syntax that might signal the increasing complexity of Four’s interactions with the people around him. When a local commander says he hasn’t heard about any government parade on the new road, Four’s reaction is to “pause.” In the next line, Eggers writes that Four “had assumed the parade was a national event of historic significance, something on par with an election or inauguration. But the fact that this commander knew nothing about it made him reconsider.” If Four’s impulse to “reconsider” leads to a growing sense of unease, it doesn’t manifest in the unchanged tone of the sentences that follow. To forgo any specific thoughts here about the new government is consistent with the allegorical realm Eggers capably constructs in the novel. But a few unexpected shifts in tone or syntax in a scene like this might have helped point, subtly, to the inner conflicts Four is beginning to experience. The Portuguese novelist Gonçalo Tavares, who has written a number of fascinating parable-like novels set in unnamed cities, created a term for sentences that veer in unexpected directions or dare an unexpected shift in syntax. He calls them “wolf sentences” for their ability to startle both the author and the reader and for the untamed vitality such lines can add to a scene. Readers attentive to wolf sentences may not find many in “The Parade,” but the final scene of the novel contains such ferocity that it offers good reason for all the tame language that precedes it.",The New York Times
2019,A Rock Band Novel — and a Snapshot of the Bell-Bottomed 1970s,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. DAISY JONES & THE SIX By Taylor Jenkins Reid The ’70s are back, apparently. Elton John, Cher and Fleetwood Mac are on world tours. Marie Claire magazine recently argued that the 1970s were “the best fashion decade” with a sequin-and-paisley slide show that included Diana Ross, Debbie Harry, John Travolta and the Osmonds (?!). And in the first “Saturday Night Live” episode of 2019, the retro-rock band Greta Van Fleet appeared on stage looking like the tasseled, psychedelic love children of Yoko Ono and David Bowie. On Weekend Update, the joke was that their name was actually Super Blood Wolf Moon. Our love for the ’70s, equal parts homage and satire, is inseparable from the bell-bottomed music scene of that decade. Taylor Jenkins Reid has written a stylish and propulsive if sometimes sentimental novel set against that backdrop, in the stadiums, studios and pool houses of late-1970s L.A. Though the back cover suggests that “everyone knows Daisy Jones & The Six,” the book is the story of a fake band in a real world. “Daisy Jones & The Six” is a fairly earnest portrait of the ’70s, though, a mockumentary without the mocking. It begins as two stories: that of Daisy Jones, the bangle-wearing, hard-partying young singer-songwriter whose beauty is as powerful as her voice, and that of Billy Dunne, the denim-wearing, hard-partying young guitarist and frontman for the rising rock band The Six. Daisy has recorded a semi-successful solo album of other people’s music, but she wants to write her own songs. Although she drifts in and out of the beds of men she meets on the road, her most reliable romance is with the pills rattling in her pockets. Billy has his own brush with the excesses of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll. Not long after his pregnant wife, Camila, finds him in a compromising position on the tour bus, he comes home and checks into rehab, swearing sobriety and loyalty to his family. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list here. ] Then a prophetic manager plays Cupid, suggesting that Billy and Daisy try a duet on The Six’s second album. The band members — Billy, his brother Graham, Karen, Warren, Eddie and Pete — aren’t thrilled. They resist the decade’s slide into soft rock. But once the duet, “Honeycomb,” becomes The Six’s biggest hit, the only choice is to invite Daisy to join the band. And sure enough, Daisy and Billy enter a love-hate friendship fraught with a will-they-or-won’t-they sexual tension that makes for some of the strongest pages in the book. Even the photographer for the cover of “Aurora,” their third album, feels it: “They were angled in, and there was so much … the negative space between them felt … alive somehow. Electric. There was so much purpose behind the not touching, right?” Romance is Reid’s calling card. Her first four books, including “Forever, Interrupted” and “After I Do,” are first-person, voice-driven novels narrated by women somewhere between heartbroken and madly in love. In her fifth and most recent, “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,” she began to approach the terrain of “Daisy Jones & The Six,” presenting another famous figure — this time a film star — telling her love story to the narrator, a journalist. It’s a pleasure, then, to see Reid tweaking her own formula in “Daisy Jones & The Six” while also leaning on her strength, the love story. Narratively speaking, this is easily her most sophisticated and ambitious novel. Which is not to say that all of its risks pay off. Where this book departs from Reid’s others — and from most rock novels — is in its unconventional structure. Presented almost entirely as an oral history, the novel reads like the transcript of a particularly juicy episode of VH1’s “Behind the Music.” In the brief author’s note at the beginning, the author — Reid? someone else? who? — explains, “This book serves as the first and only time members of the band have commented on their history together.” The mystery author has collected the voices of The Six, Daisy, their manager, music critics and others in a kind of monologue mix tape. And this device works surprisingly well. If we can forget for a minute the question of just who this “as told to” is being told to, it’s easy to fall under the musical spell of these voices, which shift fluidly from speaker to speaker as the characters hand off the microphone. Reid has a great ear, both for the way people talk in interviews and for the music they describe, as when Billy is explaining the B-side of “Aurora”: “‘Young Stars’ is tortured but up-tempo, it’s a little dangerous but you can dance to it. And then you go right into ‘Regret Me,’ which is hard and fast and raw. And then come down off it with ‘Midnights,’ which gets a little sweeter. You lead into ‘A Hope Like You.’ Slow, and tender and wistful and spartan. … And then, you know, the sun comes up at the end. You leave on the high note. You go out with a bang. ‘Aurora.’ Sprawling and lush and percussive.” But while it makes for a heady journey through the band’s ascent, the script format inherently limits our access to the characters’ innermost selves. The camera is locked on a tripod, the interviewees confessing their greatest fears and loves in the same shoulders-up shot for much of the novel. After a while, we long to get closer, to hear what the characters aren’t confessing on the record, or to zoom out, to take in more of the decade than its miniature backstage dramas. When only the characters narrate the story, their reminiscences can fall flat. “It is what I have always loved about music,” Daisy says. “Not the sounds or the crowds or the good times as much as the words — the emotions, and the stories, the truth — that you can let flow right out of your mouth. Music can dig, you know?” Moments like these are a little cheesy, but maybe that’s the point? I felt the same way reading Daisy and Billy’s lyrics, which perfectly channel the cringey, soulful, not-quite-brilliant but damn-catchy lines of every pop song written in the 1970s. Reid is so good at them that she’s written a whole album of lyrics, which is included at the back of the book (“But maybe I should stake my claim / Maybe I should claim my stake / I’ve heard some hopes are worth the break”). It was these songs that convinced me that Reid could see her subject with some critical distance, that for every pastel Polaroid in the book, there’s another moment that is, if not making fun, at least having fun. And here is the ironic thing: It’s at that moment that we start to let our guard down. Maybe we download Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours.” We can’t help singing along. We think: Wow, O.K., it’s really good. We start to feel the feelings of Daisy and Billy, and we forget the nagging question about who is telling this story anyway? And when we finally find out, we might cry a few unironic tears. In the end, that’s the most surprising gift of “Daisy Jones & The Six” — it’s a way to love the rock ’n’ roll of the 1970s, without apology, without cynicism, bell-bottoms and all. An earlier version of this review misstated the author’s name. She is Taylor Jenkins Reid, not Taylor Reid Jenkins.",The New York Times
2019,A Rugby Revolution for Asia and the Pacific,"HONG KONG — What began as an effort to keep alive an Australian team that was bounced from the elite Super Rugby league has become an experiment that organizers hope will revolutionize the sport and enhance its popularity across the Asia-Pacific region. Global Rapid Rugby is the brainchild of the Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, an avid supporter of the Western Force, a franchise based in Perth that, along with two weaker South African teams, was culled from Super Rugby after the 2017 season to streamline and balance the league. Though skeptics say the project is mostly an outgrowth of Forrest’s pique at what happened to the Western Force, he said he views it as an opportunity to advance the game he loves. “Like all sports, rugby needs to evolve,” he said in a video interview when the first plans for Global Rapid Rugby were announced last autumn. “The modern sports public is spoiled for choices and demands easily digestible, fast-paced action.” Plans to put a full, eight-team, home-and-away schedule were derailed by the difficulty of putting everything together in the same year that Japan — one of the countries expected to have a franchise — was hosting the Rugby World Cup. Instead, Global Rapid Rugby has organized a scaled-down Showcase Series of 14 matches featuring the Western Force and teams from five Asia-Pacific countries. The first match will pit the Western Force against a world all-star team under Australia’s former national team coach, Robbie Deans, in Perth on March 22. To fulfill Forrest’s vision, new rules are aimed to speed up the game and make it more entertaining for fans. Matches have been reduced to 70 minutes from the traditional 80. Also, teams will be awarded an automatic nine points for a “power try” scored from a move that starts from deep in its defensive red zone — behind the 22-meter line. Under conventional rules, a try is five points with a chance for a two-point conversion, for a total of seven points. Penalty goals will count for two points instead of three. The changes in rules are expected to de-emphasize kicking as a defensive tactic and provide greater incentive to keep the ball in play and score tries. Based on a few experimental matches under the new format, it’s been estimated that the ball will be in play some 30 percent longer than in a typical match under conventional rugby union rules. “It’s a format that should appeal to people not steeped in rugby tradition,” Robbie McRobbie, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Rugby Union said last week at an event unveiling the South China Tigers, a franchise based in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Rugby Union will manage the new league. McRobbie said that some of the concepts behind the new league were inspired by the success of the shorter, faster sevens format of rugby, though he stressed that rapid rugby is not a hybrid. But it does bring together many of the elements that make sevens rugby an appealing spectacle, especially the emphasis on speed. “We’re big believers in speed,” McRobbie said. “With the success of getting sevens into the Olympics, sevens as a format has exploded in the region,” he said, in part because being made an Olympic sport brings funding to many countries. In addition to the Western Force and the Tigers, teams from Singapore, Malaysia and the rugby-mad island nations of Fiji and Samoa will be involved. When the full league gets underway in 2020, teams from Japan and Hawaii are expected to be added, with even further expansion expected in the future. Organizers also plan to produce tight, 90-minute game telecasts and are negotiating with regional broadcasters. Matches would be streamed live on the Global Rapid Rugby website. Forrest and the head of rugby for Global Rapid Rugby, Matt Hodgson, a former Western Force star player and captain and Australian national team member, have been recruiting top international players to ensure high-quality rugby for the project. The Hong Kong-based franchise unveiled a couple of gems last week, most notably Tom Varndell, a speedy wing from the Leicester Tigers of the top English league, Premiership Rugby. Varndell, 32, is the league’s all-time leading try scorer and a player who is widely considered a world-class finisher. After playing for three months in Hong Kong, he will return to Leicester. “It was an opportunity I couldn’t turn down,” Varndell said last week. “I’m excited about the way the Asian game is going. Sometimes the game in the Premiership can be turgid and quite slow for the fans, and with this new format there should be more focus on the skills and the speed.” Samisoni Viriviri, one of the stars of Fiji’s gold-medal winning team at the inaugural rugby sevens at the 2016 Olympics, said he was looking forward to playing for the Tigers because of his success in the World Rugby Sevens Series. That annual tournament in Hong Kong, played every April, is considered a highlight for players and fans. Viriviri, 30, was the winner of the World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year award in 2014, and like Varndell is a speedy wing in the 15-man game who should thrive in the rapid rugby format. “I always loved playing in Hong Kong,” Viriviri said. “It is like playing at home for Fijian players and it is always a great experience to come here, and I hope that the fans will enjoy what we are doing this season.” Forrest wants to expand opportunities in top-level rugby with a focus on the large populations in China and India and on the island nations of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, where rugby is the most popular sport but where talented young players leave to play the game in places like Australia and New Zealand because of a lack of resources at home. In his video interview, Forrest said he wanted Global Rapid Rugby to have a “strong community benefit,” which helps explain why the Fiji and Samoa franchises were a high priority. “In places where outstanding young people, both boys and girls, men and women, are often forced to move away from their heartland, their homeland, to reach their potential, this competition will help them stay,” Forrest said. He said players from the region “are, in many ways, the game’s future.” The South China Tigers franchise is also seen as a way to help grow top-level rugby in mainland China, where Forrest hopes to eventually base a team. The Tigers have signed two members of China’s national team: Liu Junkul, a wing, and fullback Ma Chong, China’s captain in both the seven- and 15-man formats. Ma and Liu are said to be the first mainland Chinese players to play professionally in an international club-based tournament. An important step for Global Rapid Rugby was securing the approval of World Rugby, the international ruling body for rugby union. Forrest and Hodgson, his director of rugby, stressed that despite the radical rule changes, Global Rapid Rugby is not a rebel league and does have a green light. “World Rugby and its member unions, Global Rapid Rugby and its founder Andrew Forrest all share the same vision, to develop the sport in one of the fastest growing parts of the planet,” Hodgson said in an emailed comment relayed by Mark Doran, the league spokesman. “That said, the World Rugby Council wouldn’t have supported the concept if it didn’t stand up to very close scrutiny.” World Rugby’s chief executive, Brett Gosper, has said that he favors anyone who puts money into developing rugby. “If someone comes along with a checkbook and wants to develop the game in areas, in particular where we need that development,” Gosper told The West Australian newspaper in September, “and I’m thinking across parts of Asia which Mr. Forrest has in mind, then that’s of interest to us.”",The New York Times
2019,A Rural Boxing Gym Puts Up a Fight,"In a rundown school in Nekoosa, Wis. — population 2,500 — an old trainer tries to keep the hopes of small-town boxers alive. NEKOOSA, Wis. — At an abandoned school in a paper mill town in central Wisconsin, a piece of white paper is taped to a side door. Written in black marker it reads: “RAPIDS BOXING.” Climb a stairway to the third floor and there’s another handwritten sign. “Restroom,” it reads. “No resting allowed.” At the end of a dark hallway, you hear the drumming of a speed bag and the squeaking of shuffling sneakers. They are interrupted every three minutes by the buzz of a timer. Before entering, however, there’s one more sign to consider: “First 3 Rules of Boxing.” 1. Hands Up. 2. Hands Up. 3. After punching, bring your hands back fast and high. Then comes the final bit of instruction: “Annual Gym Fee. $20. Pay Ken or Karel.” Ken is Ken Hilgers, 69, a grandfather and retired paper mill powerhouse operator who will teach the art of boxing to any child who walks through the door. In a time when high school boxing teams are unheard-of and university boxing programs have faded, this gym is home to one of the small-town clubs that have kept the sport alive in the Upper Midwest. “They are a dying breed,” Hilgers said of rural gyms like his. “We used to have a boxing club in every town. We used to compete every single weekend.” Dale Horn, a successful boxer trained by Hilgers in the 1970s, had more than 100 amateur bouts and won five state championships. In contrast, Hilgers pointed to Taylor Smith Jr., a burly 10-year-old who was pounding away on a heavy bag as if it had stolen his lunch money. “Taylor here has been looking for a bout for a year,” Hilgers said. “We haven’t found him an opponent of the appropriate age and weight.” Taylor has trained at the club for the past three years, one of 15 children who are here twice a week and form the core of the Wisconsin Rapids Boxing Club. In 1975, when Hilgers started training at a Y.M.C.A. near here, the place had an abundance of boxers, and he had the most successful junior Olympic boxing team in Wisconsin. “They were all stars in their school system, and I’ve never had a run of athletes like that since,” Hilgers said. He estimates that 1,300 boxers have been a part of his club over the years, and 30 of them became state champions. The most famous was Steve Zouski, who went on to post a 31-18 record as a professional. He got in the ring with the former heavyweight champions Mike Tyson and George Foreman. In 1986, Zouski caught Tyson, then 19 and 18-0, on his way up. Zouski was knocked out at 2 minutes 39 seconds of the third round at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. It was the only time he lost by knockout. The next year, he was the first opponent Foreman, then 38, faced after being retired for 10 years. Foreman’s age didn’t matter: The referee stopped the fight in his favor early in the fourth round at Arco Arena in Sacramento. Hilgers still marvels at how Zouski could take a punch. “I knocked him down in practice once by mistake,” he said. “When he got up, his eyes were an entirely different color. He started at the belt and worked his way up. Let me tell you, I never attempted to knock him down again.” Hilgers has taught boxing in odder places than this abandoned school. The club was at a National Guard Armory for a year, and spent time in a senior center that was eventually condemned. “We worked out one winter there without any heat,” Hilgers said of the senior center. “We had to supply our own. What a winter! Everybody smelled like kerosene and diesel fuel.” Now, the old Nekoosa High School is its home. The ring at the center of the room is surrounded by a plywood ledge littered with gloves and tiny dumbbells. Old headgear and boxing gloves are reused as padding, duct-taped to the red, white and blue corner posts. The ropes, frayed and buffered with pipe insulation, are secured by more duct tape. Two heavy bags, three double-end bags and a slip bag hang from an A-frame structure repurposed from the paper mill. The speed bag is mounted on a wood and cast iron structure made by Medart that might be more than 100 years old. “If we didn’t get this site, I was going to quit,” Hilgers confessed. But then two young brothers, Evan and Will Stenerson, walked through his door, and he conjured dreams of more title runs. They were hardworking and eager to absorb Hilgers’s knowledge. Last year, Evan lost a close decision to a reigning state champion. “The kid came up to me and said I deserved the belt, and he handed it to me,” Evan Stenerson, 13, said, referring to his opponent. Now the belt hangs in the gym. Will Stenerson, 14, has a 7-2 record, and the teenagers’ younger brother, John, 9, followed them to the gym and trains here now, too. “Boxing makes you a lot more brave,"" Will said. “It gets your courage up.” On one winter day in the gym, Hilgers nodded at the man in the ring holding punch mitts for Will Stenerson. The man, 24-year-old Nick Maher, may also be the future of the gym — as a successor to Hilgers. Maher was one of the club’s most successful amateurs and, along with his two brothers, formed the backbone for Rapids’s multiple state, regional and national titles. “He’s obviously a really good coach, but there is a lot more to keeping everything in line here,” Hilgers said. Maher is not ready for Hilgers to leave, but he shares his old trainer’s commitment to keeping the gym alive. “This is where I grew up,” Maher said. “If you’re not in Madison or Milwaukee, and you don’t want to go to a fitness gym and get trained like a machine, you have to go to the little towns that have these gyms with three or four guys in it, and those are the clubs that are molding boxers into national champions.”",The New York Times
2019,A Salad for Crouton Lovers,"Don’t let your dinner salad feel sad. Do as Alison Roman does, and pack it with golden chunks of salty, crunchy bread. If you’ve ever eaten a salad for dinner and thought “I am only here for the croutons,” then let me say that you are heard, and you are seen. It may sound dramatic, but a dinner salad without those golden hunks of salty, crunchy bread in the mix can leave me feeling downright deprived. Luckily, I have a salad for you that is extremely crouton-forward. Not just any croutons, but “hand-torn” croutons. It’s an annoyingly pretentious phrase, but for any eye-rollers out there, it’s the haphazard tearing into irregular, craggly-edged chunks, rather than meticulously cubing them with a knife, that makes them spectacular. This inexact technique allows some of the bits of bread to fall away and become crumblike and crunchy, while the rest stay larger, like delicious golden-brown geodes with wild-looking exteriors and tender, chewy insides. How the croutons are cooked is just as important as the way they are torn. To reach their full potential, they must be tossed in enough fat to become crisped, but not so much that they become greasy. Olive oil is great here, but why olive oil when you can use chicken fat? For this salad, since you are also including crispy-skinned chicken that will give you said fat, you can, and you should. After searing your chicken (one of the few times I prefer the leanness of bone-in, skin-on breasts to the fattier thighs) in a skillet until browned, toss your newly hand-torn bread in the rendered fat and juices that have been seasoned with a few anchovy fillets for added funky saltiness. From there, the whole skillet heads to the oven so the chicken can finish cooking through while the pieces of torn bread become golden brown, fulfilling their destiny to become croutons. Of course, there are greens, which, in my opinion, are also pretty special. I like bitter ones like escarole for their punchiness, but any crunchy, sturdy green like romaine or Little Gem would work as well. They’re dressed in an assertively tangy, garlicky mixture, including a bit of soy sauce, enough to mimic the deep savoriness of anchovies without coming across as distinctly “soy sauce-y.” There is also a showering of hard, salty cheese, which almost puts this salad into chicken Caesar territory, which is kind of the idea here. For creaminess, the assembled salad is topped with a few gloriously orange raw egg yolks, to be burst upon eating and mixed in with everything else (yes, this is safe). If you don’t love a raw egg yolk, you can use a soft-boiled jammy egg, crispy fried egg, or leave the egg out altogether, but we’ve come so far on this Caesar-esque journey, it would be a shame to turn back now.

2019,A San Diego Chef Taps the Crosscurrents of the Mexican Border,"Restaurant Review 10 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SAN DIEGO — The cooks at Tacos Fitos, just across the street from the Mercado Hidalgo shopping center in Tijuana, are guardians of a vat of birria. The goat meat shimmers with ancho- and guajillo-stained fat, and the scent of it calls to shoppers, among them Claudette Zepeda-Wilkins. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins is the chef at El Jardín, in San Diego, and often drives an hour south, across the border, to pick up ingredients and eat a few of those tacos de birria doraditos. The version of the dish she makes at El Jardín is a tender, crackling half-moon — a fresh corn tortilla filled with delicate shreds of her own Jalisco-style birria and fried — set over a bowl of broth that is lean and vivid, full of small, creamy beans. The taco is formidable. And like many of Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s dishes, it is neither an unrecognizable aggrandizement nor a straightforward replica of established regional fare. It is a glimpse of the Mexican canon, refracted through the lens of a border-kid-turned-chef coming into her full powers, who understands her cuisine as a jumble of Indigenous, immigrant and colonial influences. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins worried at first that expectations in San Diego, when it came to Mexican food, might be narrow. Diners were used to the industrial tortillas of fast-food tacos. Chips and guac. Fat burritos. What would they make of her red pozole and beef tongue confit? At El Jardín, which opened last June in Liberty Station, a new mixed-use development on a former Navy training base, there is sometimes a sense that she is cooking against all those presumptions — correcting people before they have a chance to misunderstand her or raise an eyebrow at the prices. Oh, you want guacamole? I’ll show you guacamole. And she does. The guacamole is presented as a kind of fairy ring, trimmed with colorful pickled vegetables and ash. It is dramatic, and very pretty, but every garnish is essential. And the guacamole’s most savory notes are only amplified by chunks of queso fresco and the umami-rich, almost cheesy-tasting corn tostadas, imported from Jalisco, with their veneer of fine, Champagne-size bubbles. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s work is both uninhibited and exact. With an annotated menu to indicate regional sources, the restaurant brings together dishes that don’t ordinarily live under the same roof: immense Sonoran hot dogs, Yucatecan-style octopus cooked with sour oranges, the fava-bean-filled tlacoyos of Mexico City. The result, no matter what you order, is a meal that weaves an epic culinary narrative in finely rendered and often delicious details. It makes sense, given Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s more inclusive view of Mexican cuisine, that the broth she uses to season the bright, focused red pozole and mellow black mole, would be an infusion of kombu, or kelp. And that the bar manager, Elizabeth Hoar, would mix makrut lime leaves into her cocktails. Desserts are composed with the same care as the savory dishes, in a way that is increasingly rare in a restaurant without a pastry chef. Servers will suggest the churros, because servers always suggest the churros, but make sure to get a second one. Next to a bar of almost chewy almond cake, made with a respectable amount of brown butter and then covered in a squiggle of dense, torched meringue, there is ice cream infused with the shiny black pit of the mamey sapote fruit. As it melts in your mouth, it unfurls its delicate, floral flavor, something close to sun-warmed apricots and almonds. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins used to be the chef de cuisine at Bracero, and cooked at El Bizcocho, though outside San Diego, she may be best known for her time on Season 15 of “Top Chef.” Competitive cooking shows, like most reality television, tend to flatten people out into easily identifiable characters: the villain, the nerd, the jock. And Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins was cast as the villain. As a result, the YouTube clips that survive have fairly ridiculous titles like “Did Claudette Throw Tanya Under the Bus?” and “Is Claudette Only Out for Herself?” Men receive the most attention for their work in Mexican cuisine, but it is a world of recipes and techniques traditionally maintained at home and passed on by women, to women. So it is reassuring to see Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins working with the kind of financial resources typically reserved for men in the restaurant business. El Jardín’s big, new open kitchen gleams, and has a staff, including cooks and servers, of about 25 people. Quietly, in a way that doesn’t interfere with dinner, Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins uses her position to make a sharp point about how public space can be gendered and politicized. The men’s bathroom hosts a changing table with three sizes of diapers and wet wipes. The women’s room has the same, along with pads and tampons — a low-key effort to normalize the products. In the dining room, lush with plants, there are rainbow-beaded bull skulls affixed to the walls, the work of a Huichol artist from Nayarit, on Mexico’s west coast. The booths along the wall are upholstered with a shining crushed velvet the color of mermaid scales. And just outside, in an expansive garden, the restaurant grows finger limes and nasturtium, beets and radishes, fava beans and English peas. Planes taking off from San Diego International Airport, right next door, often interrupt this serene atmosphere, their engines blaring so loudly, and so close, that servers have to pause midsentence, like comedians for applause. But El Jardín is too determined to let a few planes get in the way. At first sign of a chill in the air, the vertical flames of space heaters flick on outside, and servers offer soft, oversize blankets to guests on the patio, circling several times, with the affectionate insistence of an abuela, coming back, always giving you the chance to change your mind.

2019,A Second Chance at Sisterhood,"Ties I had never been close to my youngest sister. But after our other sister’s death, grief became the bridge we met on. I was 22 years old when my sister Ayan died. She was 19, a freshman in college, and on her way to school when the gold sedan she was in collided with a box truck less than 10 minutes from campus. Heading home early from my practicum at a nearby high school, I was met at the door by two police officers bearing news of her death. I had forgotten my phone at home that day and arrived to a slew of missed calls and text messages from my mother. Hand shaking, I called her back. “Thank God you’re O.K.,” she said, panic making her voice nearly unrecognizable. “I’m on my way home. What’s going on?” I looked at the officers, awkward and out of place in our living room. I ignored her pointed question. “Drive safe,” I said, feigning a strength that would buckle my knees as soon as I hung up. How poetic that I, keeper of my sister’s secrets during her life, had to, for at least a short while, keep the secret of her death. Ayan wasn’t just my sister. She was also my best friend and first teacher. Our relationship taught me some of the most important lessons of my life: How to earn someone’s trust and what happened when you violated it, how to love unconditionally and how to be loved in that same way, how to apologize when you hurt someone and how to forgive someone who had hurt you. Like many sisters, we did hurt each other with brutal regularity. Sisterhood is a terrain shaped by the ennui that characterizes suburban girlhood. Ayan and I often had no one to take our angst out on but each other. After her death, I played the reel of our relationship in my mind on a loop, wrecked by guilt over all my shortcomings as a sister. We were young, and I thought youth made us infallible. I knew we would not live forever, but I thought we would live long enough. I made a list of all the things I would do differently if I had a second chance. Bring her back, I bargained with a God I felt had betrayed me: Bring her back and I promise I will be a better sister. In another reel, one recorded by my father in 1995, the year my sister was born, my mother and I have a conversation. “Do you know there’s a baby in my belly?” she asks me in Somali. I am 4 years old in the video, and playing with a doll at her feet. “What should I name her?” “Name her Ayan,” I say. The camera pans over my face, my hands, my doll’s brown plastic legs. Ayan: a classic Somali name meaning lucky. Stuck in a past I could not forgive myself for and the future I imagined Ayan and I would have together, I neglected my relationship with our younger sister, Idil. As the middle sister, Ayan had been the buffer in the eight years between Idil and me. After her death, grief became the bridge we met on. As the amount of time we spent together increased, so did the frequency of our fighting. Reeling from Ayan’s death, anger was an easier emotion to reckon with than sorrow. Usually our arguments were the ordinary grievances that pepper any relationship, but sometimes we would have huge blowouts. We often compared one another to Ayan who was, as the dead often are, perfect in our memory. Neither one of us measured up. As the years dulled the sharpness of grief, our relationship grew less turbulent. The pain that made it difficult for us to connect became the glue that bound us together. And while our relationship was forged by loss, it has been refined by the mundane moments that make up sisterhood. We binge watch T.V. together and simmer in betrayal when one person watches an episode without the other. We share clothes, and Idil has ruined more than a few of my favorite sweaters. In the car together, we sing loud and off-key, messing up the lyrics to whatever Top 40 song is popular at the moment. Idil is 19 now, her life blossoming at the same age Ayan was when her life ended. Like Ayan, she is also a pre-med student. While the similarities between the two of them are haunting, the greatest gift has been getting to know Idil as a young woman in her own right, outside the shadow of Ayan’s ghost. Recently, while I was on vacation on the East Coast, a phone call jolted me awake at 4 in the morning. It was Idil. It was 1 a.m. in her dorm room at the University of Oregon. Through her sobs, I pieced together that she had failed a chemistry exam and was worried that her dreams of medical school were over. “It’s going to be O.K.,” I assured her. A college freshman, she is sleepless and prone to wild bouts of panic. I try to be the voice of reason in the midst of her imagined catastrophe. Since the start of the school year, these middle-of-the-night phone calls have become a staple in our relationship. It was only when I forgave myself for my past failures as a sister, that I could focus on being a better one in the present. Ayan’s life and unexpected death have taught me so much. Despite the meaning of her name, I am the lucky one. Grief is a profound teacher, but it is anguish long before it is enlightenment. I am better for the things I have learned, and I have my sisters to thank for the most important education of my life: Ayan, my first teacher, and Idil, my second chance.

2019,"A Secretive Dinner Where $25,000 Buys Access to Cuomo (and Filet Mignon)","With state budget season heating up, what better way to make valuable connections than to mingle with the governor, his top aide and his budget director. The rooftop fund-raiser was meant to be a secretive affair, but word spread quickly among those with pending issues before the state. Lobbyists told their clients that the event would be a good thing to go to. After all, the dinner was being held a little more than two weeks before the New York State budget was due, and what better way to make valuable connections than to pay tribute to the guest of honor, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Among those present were the vice president of a school bus company seeking tax breaks for the purchase of buses; a recycling company founder looking for a broadening of the 5-cent deposit law; and an affordable housing developer lobbying for real estate tax credits. The fund-raiser was held on March 14 on the 20th floor of the St. Regis Hotel, just off Fifth Avenue and a block from Trump Tower. The minimum donation per couple was $25,000. The event, which was billed as a spring dinner with the governor, was strictly under the radar: It was not listed on Mr. Cuomo’s calendar, and even the invitation was vaguely worded, with the locale only provided in the R.S.V.P. And although a reporter who showed up at the fund-raiser was barred entry, The New York Times was able to piece together an account of the event through interviews with six attendees and a partial guest list of 35 invitees. The guests included senior Cuomo administration officials, including the state budget director. The fund-raiser provided a vivid example of how things work in Albany’s pay-to-play culture, where political contributions are often viewed by business leaders as a prerequisite for getting their perspective heard in the capital. It also offered a glimpse into the nexus of money and politics that is commonplace across the ideological spectrum and around the United States, and something that Mr. Cuomo has excelled in. The governor is considered one of the Democratic Party’s most prolific fund-raisers, accumulating more than $30 million in his campaign war chest until last year’s costly re-election effort, when he spent dearly to fend off a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon. The high-priced event seemed in stark contrast to Mr. Cuomo’s promise of “real campaign finance reform” made two months earlier, as he announced his support for a public financing system. In January, the governor signed new limitations on corporate donations and, in his State of the State speech, vowed to “combat big money in politics” and empower small donors. But the vast majority of Mr. Cuomo’s political fund-raising has come from big checks, and the event at the St. Regis, held in a room with a trompe l’oeil of the sky on a partly cloudy day, continued that trend. Corey Muirhead is a vice president at Logan Bus Company and interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association. School bus contractors are lobbying the state on several issues of interest to their members, including tax exemptions for the purchase of new school buses. “I coordinate with my lobbyist and I go to events that they feel are important,” said Corey Muirhead of Logan Bus Company, who attended the dinner. “We have stuff that we want to see done up in Albany.” Robert Mujica is the state budget director. He had been working out of Mr. Cuomo’s Manhattan office on the day of the fund-raiser, the governor’s staff said, and received an invitation as a matter of courtesy. About 100 people mingled in a crowd that included the state budget director, Robert Mujica, and the governor’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, before sitting down at more than a dozen tables for two slices of filet mignon, vegetables and what one attendee described as a “little peaked salad.” According to the invitation, a limited number of tickets were available for $5,000; most single tickets were $15,000. The governor delivered a speech that touched on Amazon, the tumult in Washington, and the transition from campaigning to governing that he said some new Albany legislators had to learn. “I thought he gave a great speech. He really knew how to relate to the crowd,” said Conrad Cutler, whose company, Galvanize Group, gathers bottles and cans and returns them to the distributors, collecting the deposit and a 3.5-cent handling fee. “He addressed a lot of pressing issues involving health care and the M.T.A. He underscored his commitment to New Yorkers who have issues.” Conrad Cutler is the chief executive of Galvanize Group, a company that collects cans and bottles to return them to distributors. Galvanize Group wants the state to approve an expansion of the bottle bill, which is backed by Mr. Cuomo and would make more bottles eligible for deposit. Thirteen minutes before the fund-raiser officially began, Mr. Mujica emailed a statement to reporters, lashing out at the Democratic-led State Senate and accusing it of creating “false political expectations” with its budget proposals. Then the dinner started, with attendees sporting badges with two names: theirs and Mr. Cuomo’s, the latter done up in his campaign logo. “As the governor said since Day 1, anyone who can get swayed by a single dollar has no place in government,” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said. He added that people who said their lobbyist told them to attend the fund-raiser should “fire their lobbyist and get their head examined.” Mr. Azzopardi defended the presence of senior aides — including Mr. Mujica, who is in charge of the state budget being negotiated in Albany — at the fund-raiser, saying Mr. Mujica had “worked out of his New York City office that day and this event was after hours.” Staff members are routinely invited to events as guests, he added. Mr. Cuomo, for his part, came from Albany for the event and was in the capital the next day, according to his public schedule. One oddity at the fund-raiser? Neither attendees nor staff members from the Cuomo campaign could describe what office, if any, Mr. Cuomo, who was recently re-elected to a third term, was raising money for. Nor could those contributing to him. “I didn’t ask. It’s obvious what it is. It’s the continual cycle of fund-raising,” said John Samuelsen, the president of the Transport Workers Union International and an ally of the governor. “That’s what he does. That’s what everybody seems to do.” John Samuelsen, whose name is misspelled on his badge, is the president of the Transport Workers Union International. The union, especially its Local 100, represents tens of thousands of public transit workers in the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Samuelsen said he arrived just after the governor had finished his formal address. He said he spoke to the governor for a couple of minutes about the subway. Mr. Samuelsen, who recalled wearing a Woolrich shirt to the event, said he could not recall how much he had donated to attend. “Honestly, I’m not even in the weeds on that level,” he said, adding that his union has happily long spent money to support Mr. Cuomo. “The governor has been the best governor for the trade union movement ever.” The roster of invitees included some well-known figures in New York real estate such as Douglas Durst; prominent political donors like the Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis; and past contributors to Mr. Cuomo like Elliot Gibber, who owns an egg products company and donated $73,000 to the governor’s 2018 re-election campaign. “I walked in and walked out,” Mr. Gibber said. “I have huge facilities in New York State. I believe in the governor. He’s done a lot of work for education and private education.” Mr. Durst gave but did not attend; Mr. Catsimatidis said he did not contribute or go to the event, explaining the governor’s invitation as a matter of their longstanding friendship. “I go back with the governor 20 years,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. “In 50 years in business, I have never gotten anything from the city or the state.” “You know what I’ve gotten? Ungatz,” he said, of a slang term for nada, zip, zero. “That’s Italian, I think.” Charlie Bachtell is the founder and chief executive of Cresco Labs, a cannabis company based in Chicago. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach a deal on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on the idea. Others who bought tickets did so while they had an issue of importance to them being decided in Albany, like Larry Regan, a housing developer seeking real estate tax credits who did not go to the dinner, and Charlie Bachtell, the chief executive of Cresco Labs, a Chicago-based cannabis company. Cresco Labs hired a lobbyist in New York for the first time this year, state records showed. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach an agreement on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on that notion. A spokesman for the company declined to say why Mr. Bachtell had attended the fund-raiser. Larry Regan is the president of Regan Development, which develops market-rate and affordable housing. Mr. Regan has been lobbying the state on real estate tax credits. He paid for a ticket, but did not attend the event, a spokeswoman said. Others with an immediate interest in state matters included Maury Litwack of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas that would like an increase in the reimbursement for science and math education at nonpublic schools. The week before the budget is passed could decide the size of that program. “The governor has been a champion of the STEM program and Jewish causes,” Menashe Shapiro, a spokesman for Mr. Litwack, said. He said that while Mr. Litwack had briefly attended the end of the fund-raiser, “he did not write a check.” Maury Litwack is the executive director of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas. The group wants the state to expand its STEM reimbursement program for nonpublic schools. Mr. Muirhead, the bus company executive, said he attended in his role as interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association, which was lobbying the state government. He said a big issue for the group was a possible tax exemption on the purchase of new buses. Mr. Cutler, the recycling executive, was also clear about his interest in the fund-raiser. “Governor Cuomo proposed to expand the bottle bill to all beverages except wine and liquor,” he said, noting that the bill does not cover a few select categories, like milk. “I agree with that because I make money on every bottle that’s redeemed, and for environmental reasons.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Sexism Storm Over Italy’s Courts, With Female Judges at Its Center","ROME — It was a demoralizing few days for women in Italian courts. A man who stabbed his wife to death was sentenced to a reduced term of 16 years in prison by a judge who cited the killer’s “anger and desperation, profound disappointment and resentment” over the victim’s relationship with another man. The judge’s reasoning was made public on Wednesday. The Friday before that, as Italy’s highest court rejected an appeals court’s decision to clear two men of rape charges, it emerged that the judges in the previous appeal had doubted the accuser’s account in part because they considered her “too masculine” to have made an attractive victim. The men will now face a retrial. Both cases, which involved female judges, provoked angry comments about entrenched gender stereotypes in Italy. According to the National Institute for Statistics, violence against women is slightly going down in Italy, but the number of women seriously wounded by their partners is rising. The number of reported rapes seems to be holding steady. Elena Biaggioni, a lawyer and Italy’s delegate to the advocacy group Women Against Violence Europe, said the recent rulings pointed to an ingrained problem. “We are not discussing the merit of the sentences, but the disruptive stereotypes that weigh like boulders in the words they used,” she said. “Would we ever justify and mitigate a sentence against mafia mobsters because they were raised in a difficult family context?” Ms. Biaggioni asked. “Or robbers because they come from poor backgrounds? Would anyone feel for them?” Ms. Biaggioni was referring to the 16-year sentence handed down for the murder of Jenny Angela Coello Reyes, who was killed last year in the northern city of Genoa by her husband, Napoleon Javier Gamboa Pareja. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year prison term, though the use of a fast-track trial process reduced that to 20. Judge Silvia Carpanini wrote in a document explaining her decision that Mr. Gamboa Pareja had acted “as a reaction to the woman’s behavior, completely incoherent and contradictory, which gave him false hope and disappointed him at the same time.” Mr. Gamboa Pareja had returned to his native Ecuador because Ms. Coello Reyes began a relationship with another man, but in early 2018 she urged him to come back to Italy, promising to break up the affair. Once in Genoa, he realized that the two lovers were still in close contact and that she was ambivalent about her feelings for her husband. Mr. Gamboa Pareja also had “violent and impulsive reactions” toward Ms. Coello Reyes in previous years, the judge noted. But she described the wife’s behavior as the mitigating “context” for the homicide. “The contradictory reasoning resembles the infamous honor killing that was abolished in this country in 1981,” Giuseppe Maria Gallo, a lawyer for the victim’s family, said in a phone interview, referring to a legal provision that specified shorter sentences for men who killed wives, sisters or daughters who had engaged in illicit sex. “Over the years, he had beaten her up, cut her hair, and he was so lucid after the killing that he hid his clothes, and vanished for three days,” Mr. Gallo said. “What else did he need to do to get a full sentence?” Judge Carpanini defended her decision in the national news media on Thursday. Mr. Gamboa Pareja “meandered for a couple of nights, let the police catch him, to some extent he was a sad case,” she said in an interview with the daily newspaper La Stampa. “He didn’t premeditate his attack for days or stab her 30 times as I’ve seen in other much grimmer cases.” Mara Carfagna, a lawmaker from the center-right party Forza Italia who is vice president of the lower house of Parliament and a longtime promoter of women’s rights, expressed concern. “These sentences are worrisome,” Ms. Carfagna told reporters, referring to cases where judges “reduce the sentences because they are understanding toward the reasons for a woman’s killing.” The other case that became a focus of anger centered on two young men accused of raping a 22-year-old woman in 2015 in a park in Ancona, a port city on the eastern coast, where they had been drinking at night after leaving a school party. None of those involved have been publicly identified. The two men were initially convicted, but an appeals court overturned the verdict in 2017. A panel of three female judges found the woman’s account of events insufficiently credible, suggesting that she could have fabricated the story to justify a late night out, and a hemorrhage on her jeans, to her mother. Doctors at the emergency room in Ancona certified a rape had occurred, but could not establish with certainty the cause of her internal wounds, the judges wrote, or that the high level of benzodiazepines found in her blood had been a result of the men spiking her beer, as she believed they had. “We cannot rule out that she might have organized the night out, making up an excuse with her mother, drinking as much as the others and then started provoking,” the judges wrote. One of the men had registered the woman’s number on his mobile phone under the name “Viking,” the judges wrote, adding that this alluded to an “all-but-feminine, rather masculine personality” and that a photograph of her confirmed the conclusion. Luisa Rizzitelli, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Rebel Network, organized a march in Ancona last week to protest the appeals court’s verdict, which she said had evoked “medieval tones.” “Rape is not a matter of desire or physical appearance; it is simply a crime,” she said. “And it’s striking that such stereotypes are spoken in a courtroom by other women.” “However, I am not surprised,” she added. “Italy is permeated with a deeply patriarchal culture, and the influence of the Catholic Church hasn’t helped for centuries. Here, chauvinism comes from women as much as men.” The general prosecutor in Ancona, Sergio Sottani, denounced the ruling and insisted that judges should make sure “that the language used in trials is not a further form of violence against the victims.” A new trial will be held in a different city, Perugia, as per Italian law. About half of magistrates in Italy are women, although the most powerful positions and key representative bodies remain male-dominated. “It is not a matter of accusing a judge or a woman,” said Ms. Biaggioni. “Stereotypes are strong in Europe and in the U.S. alike, but Italy is culturally not very sensitive and still needs much education. Sentences like those in Genoa and Ancona are just the tip of the iceberg.”",The New York Times

2019,"A Shipping Manifest Said the Container Held Dried Fruit. Inside Was 3,200 Pounds of Cocaine.","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The authorities were conducting a routine inspection aboard the M.S.C. Carlotta last month when a worn, teal shipping container caught their eye: The pins that held the containers’ doors in place appeared to have been doctored. The Carlotta, a container ship, had just arrived in Newark from Buenaventura, Colombia, and the teal container was supposed to contain dried fruit. Instead, officers opened the doors to find something that stunned even the most experienced customs agents: 60 tightly wrapped bundles of white powder, each the size of a small trunk. The bundles turned out to be 3,200 pounds of cocaine, the largest drug shipment to be intercepted at Port Newark in a quarter-century, a bounty worth $77 million on the street, the authorities said on Monday. The discovery of the shipment underscored the reality that legal ports of entry remain the main channel through which illicit drugs flow, even though President Trump has contended that drugs are pouring over the unsecured sections of the southern border to justify building a barrier there. The seizure on Feb. 28 also suggested the city’s market for cocaine was resurging, officials said, after several years during which heroin and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, had dominated New York’s illicit drug scene. Ray Donovan, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York City, said dealers have begun combining fentanyl with cocaine, creating a new and deadly product. He said the giant cocaine shipment was a sign that traffickers were pushing “to build an emerging customer base of users mixing cocaine and fentanyl.” “This record-breaking seizure draws attention to this new threat and shows law enforcement’s collaborative efforts in seizing illicit drugs before it gets to the streets and into users’ hands,” he said. Investigators from the Department of Homeland Security were trying to determine where the drugs came from, and how they ended up in Newark. The authorities said on Monday that no arrests had been made. The operation included officers from Customs and Border Protection, the D.E.A. and the New York Police Department. The port in Newark is one of the country’s largest and is a hub for illicit drugs from China and Mexico to enter the United States. Cocaine has taken a back seat in recent years to opioids like heroin and fentanyl, officials said. Heroin is often cut with fentanyl to make it more potent, a trend that has caused an increase in overdose deaths. Recent months, though, have seen the same tactics being used to cut and increase the city’s cocaine supply. It has concerned authorities enough that Mr. Donovan issued a public warning late last year to residents and tourists saying New York’s cocaine supply may be laced with fentanyl.",The New York Times
2019,A Simple Guide to the Aftermath of the Ethiopian Plane Crash,"The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines has led to a virtual worldwide grounding of the plane and raised urgent questions about why a brand-new aircraft would go down minutes after takeoff. President Trump said on Wednesday that the United States, one of the last holdouts in barring flights of the popular jet, would now do so “until further notice.” American and Canadian regulators said new satellite data showed similarities between the Ethiopian crash and another deadly one months earlier by a Max 8 operated by Lion Air in Indonesia, raising further questions about the safety of the aircraft. The investigation into the Ethiopian crash, which killed 157 people from 35 countries, is fast-moving, and far-reaching. There are still more questions than answers, but some possible explanations are emerging. Here’s a guide to our coverage. • The captain of the Ethiopian plane reported “flight control problems” to air traffic controllers minutes before the plane crashed near Addis Ababa, the airline said. • Such problems generally suggest difficulties with the handling of the aircraft or the computerized flight control system, rather than other issues like a fire on board. • After the Lion Air crash, part of the flight control software known as MCAS came under scrutiny. Investigators will try to determine whether the Ethiopian Airlines flight experienced software problems. The Ethiopian airline has a tradition of high-quality training of its pilots. [A reconstruction of the Lion Air crash from the perspective of the pilots.] • The flight data and voice recorders have been recovered and will be sent abroad for study. If they are in good condition, the data could be read quickly. If not, the process could take weeks. • All of the 371 Max 8 planes in service worldwide now appear to be grounded. The United States grounding will affect Southwest and American, heavy users of the planes and the only United States carriers that have them. • Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, called President Trump on Tuesday to express his confidence in the safety of the Max 8, and the Federal Aviation Administration had said until Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday afternoon that the planes could keep flying while it conducted its review. • Norwegian Air, which has one of the largest Max 8 fleets outside the United States, said it would seek compensation from Boeing after European regulators grounded the aircraft. • Boeing shares fell 6 percent on Tuesday, after dropping 5 percent on Monday. They closed up slightly on Wednesday. • If the Ethiopian crash is linked to the MCAS system, the consequences for Boeing could be severe. It has already begun a costly redesign of the flight control software, an effort on which critics say Boeing has dragged its feet.

2019,A Soprano Survived a Vocal Crisis. The Met Found Its Brünnhilde.,"Christine Goerke nearly quit opera before becoming one of the world’s top dramatic voices. Now she faces her biggest test: Wagner’s “Ring” cycle. Christine Goerke at the Metropolitan Opera, where she sings Brünnhilde in Wagner’s “Ring” cycle this spring.CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times Christine Goerke, who is getting ready to join the long, storied line of Brünnhildes who have scaled Wagner’s epic “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera, walked into Valhalla. No, not the majestic castle in the sky where her character, a Valkyrie warrior, brings slain heroes to serve her father, the mighty god Wotan. This Valhalla is a bar in Hell’s Kitchen, a few blocks south of the Met, that bills itself as “craft beer heaven.” “I’m going to be a total jerk and have sparkling water,” Ms. Goerke said at the bar, bowing to the coming marathon she faces in rehearsing and performing one of the toughest assignments in opera: her first complete “Ring” cycle, a sprawling 17-hour, four-opera saga of gods, dwarfs, giants and humans that she will star in between March 25 and May 11. “But on May 12, I’m getting so drunk — having all of the things.” It’s a triumphant return to the opera house where Ms. Goerke trained as an insecure young artist in the 1990s. When she sang the small role of the Third Norn in “Götterdämmerung,” the fourth “Ring” opera, at the Met in 2000, she recalled, she would linger in the wings after her exit, watching the soprano singing Brünnhilde and thinking: “Some day.” Now that day is here. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” Ms. Goerke said over her seltzer, remembering her young fears that she had not trained at the fanciest conservatories. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.” “But then you wander out to get a cup of coffee,” she added, “and you go across the street and there’s a gigantic banner of yourself hanging on the side of the building — which is beyond freaky.” Raised on Long Island, Ms. Goerke overcame her self-doubt to achieve success singing Mozart and Handel. Then catastrophe struck, in the form of a vocal crisis that nearly led her to quit opera. The problem, she found, was that her voice had grown too large for the roles she had been singing. She slowed down, retrained, and re-emerged, against the odds, as one of the leading dramatic sopranos in the world — singing the heavy, nearly impossible-to-cast Wagnerian parts that she sometimes calls “the ‘spear and magic helmet’ ladies,” borrowing a line from the classic Bugs Bunny “Kill the Wabbit” parody. “People can’t get over the sheer power of the voice — and I don’t mean only the volume,” said Alexander Neef, the general director of the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, where she sang her first staged Brünnhildes. “It’s the communicative power. It’s not only that she hits all the notes and she hits them powerfully. It’s that there’s always an element of storytelling that really allows her to connect with the audience.” Great Wagnerian sopranos are few and far between. Only one or two may emerge each generation with the power to be heard over some of the largest orchestras in all of opera without amplification, the precision to hit the high notes, and the artistry to break your heart. Ms. Goerke’s success has been big news in the opera world, which is usually grateful for singers who can merely get through such parts relatively unscathed. And the Met “Ring” will be her biggest test yet. A larger-than-life personality with an irreverent streak — imagine a cross between the great Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson and Tina Fey — she works hard and plays hard. While singing Brünnhilde last fall in Wagner’s “Siegfried” at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, she and her Wotan, the bass-baritone Eric Owens, dressed up for Halloween as the animated superheros of “The Incredibles.” Last month, while starring at the Canadian Opera Company in the title role of Strauss’s “Elektra” — a princess obsessed with avenging the murder of her father — Ms. Goerke gamely joined an online video lip-syncing contest, known as the Dubsmash challenge, between her Toronto colleagues and the cast of another “Elektra” running at the same time in Chicago. Her song? “Daddy’s Girl.” Some find it all a bit much. Others see it as a welcome antidote to opera’s reputation for being elitist or snobby. “I got into it with one of my colleagues a little bit, who was like, ‘I feel like that’s dumbing down things,’” Ms. Goerke recalled. “And I was like, ‘I think it’s fun.’ And you know, it’s not 1945, and things are different. People are always trying to talk about how to make opera more accessible. And I feel like the way to make it more accessible is to let folks know that it is accessible. It’s not the thing that’s stuffy, and for your grandparents.” In person Ms. Goerke comes across as warm, funny and unpretentious — the kind of diva you would like to get a beer, or sparkling water, with. And her unusually frank, often humorous social media accounts offer glimpses into what it’s really like to be a 21st century opera star, which rarely bears much resemblance to popular pearls-and-furs prima donna stereotypes. Sometimes she shares her hacks for life on the road: She travels with her own spices to cut the expense of stocking a kitchen in each new city, and always packs a supply of stick-on hooks that allow her to rig curtains in rental apartments lacking blinds. And she occasionally shares details of her home life in New Jersey, where she lives with her husband, who works in construction, and their daughters, who are 9 and 12. (Her Twitter biography describes her as a “Dramatic Soprano and Soccer Mom...not necessarily in that order.”) In a burst of enthusiasm for her first “Ring,” she recently got vanity license plates for her 2004 Honda Element with 130,000 miles on it: GRANE19, after Brünnhilde’s trusty horse, Grane. Brünnhilde is, in many ways, the hero of the “Ring.” She defies the gods, falls in love with a heroic dragon-slayer and ultimately redeems the world through love before immolating herself. She appears in the final three of the cycle’s four operas — “Die Walküre,” “Siegfried” and “Götterdämmerung” — and although Ms. Goerke has sung them each individually, this will be her first time performing them together in complete cycles, as Wagner intended. “Ring” cycles tend to draw Wagner fans from around the world, who can be as obsessive as Deadheads. This one will likely draw plenty of critics, who will be measuring her performance against the legendary Brünnhildes of the past, as well as some of her old friends from Patchogue-Medford High School on Long Island, where she once played in the band. All will be listening to hear whether Ms. Goerke lives up to her potential. She has surpassed expectations before. Patrick Summers, the artistic and music director of the Houston Grand Opera, conducted some of her earliest successes in Mozart and Handel. He remembered how devastated she was 15 years ago when those of kinds of roles were no longer comfortable for her. Her decision to reinvent herself was initially met with skepticism: When Mr. Summers cast her in Wagner’s “Lohengrin” in Houston in 2009, he recalled, “I had some of my colleagues tell me it was crazy to think such a thing.” But she triumphed, and he invited her back — as Brünnhilde. “She so connects to Brünnhilde, because she’s a warrior herself,” he said. Andris Nelsons, who conducted her in breakout performances of Strauss’s “Elektra” at the Royal Opera House in London and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (including at a searing Carnegie Hall performance in 2015), said he was awed by her ability to sing with power, but also with chamber-music-like intimacy — and by her dramatic intensity. “She lives on the stage, she loves on the stage, she hates on the stage,” he said. “It’s breathtaking.” Mr. Neef said that Ms. Goerke was the only singer he had ever cast based on a video — after watching a recording of an “Elektra” she had sung in Madrid in 2011. “I went into my artistic administrator’s office, and said you have to hire Christine for all three Brünnhildes right away,” he said. “Because if we wait, other people will figure it out, too.” They did. When Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, heard the frenzied ovation after Ms. Goerke sang the Dyer’s Wife in Strauss’s “Die Frau Ohne Schatten” staged there in 2013, he immediately offered her this season’s “Ring.” It is as formidable an assignment as opera offers, yet as she unwound at Valhalla — the bar, that is — she was already thinking about what comes next: She is studying the score of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde,” perhaps the only work that matches the “Ring” in its demands on its lead singers. “That’s my Everest at the moment,” Ms. Goerke said.",The New York Times
2019,"A Southern Town That’s Been Holding On to Its Charm, for More Than a Century","Fairhope, in Alabama, thrives as a place for artists, intellectuals and people of outsize character. A group of populist reformers from up north arrived in Alabama in November 1894 with a radical plan. Their mission: to establish an experimental utopian community inspired by the economist Henry George, whose wildly popular book, “Progress and Poverty,” influenced readers around the world in search of more equitable societies. In this case, their chosen setting was a swath of pine- and pasture-covered land perched high on a bluff overlooking Mobile Bay. There, wrote one of the founders, Ernest B. Gaston, these pioneers would build “a city set upon a hill, shedding its beneficent light to all the world.” Somewhat more modestly, they christened their settlement Fairhope, asserting that their dream community would have “a fair hope” of succeeding. Henry George’s acolytes put their faith in his concept of a “single tax” colony where the community owned the land and homeowners paid an annual tax that funded the creation of parks and public amenities. The founders set aside nearly a mile of beachfront as public parkland, writes a local historian, Cathy Donelson, in her book, “Fairhope.” They quickly drew more settlers — and soon vacationers, too. Early tourists arrived by steamboat, enticed with attractions like the giant water slide that deposited frolickers directly into the bay, while the annual Shakespeare festival offered free outdoor performances that used the scenic natural setting as a stage. Fairhope’s blend of natural beauty and eccentric ambition continued to attract artists, writers and intellectuals. The noted progressive educator, Marietta Johnson, opened her School of Organic Education in town. Clarence Darrow, the original super-lawyer, was a fan of the single-tax philosophy and wintered in Fairhope in the 1920s and ’30s. Upton Sinclair wrote his novel “Love’s Pilgrimage” in a tent on the bluff. A century later, Fairhope is still a draw for writers seeking a peaceful retreat, for art lovers — most notably during the annual Fairhope Arts & Crafts Festival in March — and for many other vacationers, no shortage of whom fall for this unheralded setting and decide to stay. Fairhope TENN. Fairhope Center for the Writing Arts MISS. GA.

Once they see it, there’s a charm about it that they just love.” Ms. Flagg was born in Birmingham and first visited Fairhope as a child. She was lured back years later. “When I started writing, I was living in New York and wanted a place to get away, so I thought, ‘Why don’t I go down to Fairhope?’” She wrote her first book in Fairhope, then returned again to pen the Oscar-nominated screenplay for “Fried Green Tomatoes.” She kept a home in Fairhope for many years, and still returns frequently. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s an amazing amount of artistic talent that is all gathered here in this one place,” said the writer Sonny Brewer, who has lived in Fairhope since 1978. Mr. Brewer, who formerly ran a bookstore in town, founded the Fairhope Center for the Writing Arts, which invites writers-in-residence for monthlong stays in a 1920s cottage tucked behind the city’s public library. Fellow scribes, Mr. Brewer said, have joked about erecting a billboard welcoming visitors to “Fairhope, Alabama, the home of more writers than readers.” Today, Fairhope is still anchored by its public beachfront, with scenic views available from the Municipal Pier that stretches 1,448 feet out over the bucolic bay, and from the tree-lined Henry George Park up on the bluff. A short stroll up the hill, past shady streets where rocking chairs sway on porches, is the very walkable downtown. Sidewalks are filled with more than a dozen different public art pieces and copious flowers in all seasons, from beds of petunias in summer to snapdragons in the dead of winter. New and historic buildings are home to antique stores such as Crown & Colony, indie boutiques, and galleries like Eastern Shore Art Center, which runs a first Friday art walk. Charming cafes and restaurants abound, a mix of longtime local favorites like Julwin’s, a greasy spoon that dates to 1945, and hipper newcomers like Refuge Coffee, where a young woman in a hijab recently sipped espresso next to a couple with copious face piercings, and a retiree from Seattle warned that “they’re a little snobby about their coffee here.” Most Fairhope venues fall somewhere in between, like Locals, a small, no-frills space where grass-fed-lamb burgers and elderberry kombucha are on the menu. From March 15 to 17 this year, a large part of downtown will be taken over by the 67th annual Fairhope Arts and Crafts Festival, which brings in more than 300,000 visitors. Streets are closed to traffic and given over to wares from nearly 200 different artists, along with performances from the likes of jazz bands and dance crews. Later in spring there are sunset concerts near the bay by the Baldwin Pops, while fall brings the Fairhope Film Festival, including outdoor screenings in an amphitheater downtown. The place where Fairhope’s founding spirit is most alive is perhaps Page and Palette, an independent bookstore that has stood near the center of town for over 50 years. The bar and event space hosts eclectic audiences for readings and performances several evenings each week, and regulars fill the on-site coffee shop. On Tuesdays and Thursdays for the past decade, two longtime locals have operated “Sonya and Nancye’s Friendly Advice booth” inside the coffee shop, sitting behind a wooden booth inspired by Lucy from the “Peanuts” comic strip and doling out sage advice for a nickel per customer. “The two of them were just great, loyal customers,” said Page and Palette’s owner, Karin Wilson. “When the bottom fell out in 2008, we really thought we were going to have to close. They were very concerned about our store; they wanted to meet with me and ask how they could help. We were meeting in the coffee shop and someone said something along the lines of, ‘What are ya’ll doing here?’ One of them said, ‘Oh, we’re solving the world’s problems.’ I jokingly said they should do an advice booth, and the idea stuck. They’ve been here every Tuesday and Thursday since,” offering thoughts and comfort to anyone in need of a friendly ear. “They’re two women that everyone feels comfortable talking to. It’s something very special that they created.” Ms. Wilson’s grandmother opened Page and Palette as an art supply and book store in 1968; her father eventually spun off a frame shop and gallery next door. Ms. Wilson bought the bookstore in 1997, adding the coffee shop and bar/event space, while her twin sister, Kelley Lyons, purchased the frame shop, now Lyons Share Custom Framing and Gallery. In a twist, the independent bookseller is now also the city’s mayor — Karin Wilson jumped into politics in 2016 with a successful campaign centered around a platform of smart development. Fairhope is now one of Alabama’s fastest growing cities, with a 27 percent growth in population from 2010 to 2017. “There’s this charm that we don’t want to lose,” Mayor Wilson said. “Owning the store, we meet so many people who say, ‘We’ve always wanted to live in a community like this.’ People choose to be here for a very specific reason and they’re very motivated about keeping it that way.” Certainly, there’s much about modern Fairhope that seems a far cry from its socialist-leaning heyday. The Fairhope Single Tax Corporation maintains a charming old-world office on Fairhope Avenue, but today it owns only about 20 percent of the land in Fairhope. Those who live on that 20 percent technically lease the land and pay a single tax to the FSTC that includes their property taxes and a small fee. The other 80 percent of homeowners own the land beneath their homes. All are free to buy and sell as they please. Historic homes along the waterfront can get multimillion-dollar prices. For visitors, there are a host of rental homes scattered around downtown, plus elegant inns and B&Bs like Emma’s Bay House near the water. Just south of Fairhope is the Grand Hotel, a sweeping 172-year-old property set on a 550-acre expanse that includes two golf courses and a spa. The city’s rapid development means there are now enticing new spots further afield, like the Fairhope Brewing Company, which opened in 2013 in a former tabletop manufacturing facility about a mile from the main stretch of downtown. A huge mural of an oak tree sprouting hops instead of leaves covers the outside of the adjacent bottling building (the artist, Sarah Rutledge Fischer, is the wife of one of the brewers). The brewery also makes a coffee stout with beans sourced down the road at Fairhope Roasting Company, which shares a garage-door-fronted space with Warehouse Bakery & Donuts. The latter serves up old-style chocolate glazed doughnuts, and more new-school breakfast biscuits stuffed with fried eggs, small-batch bacon and spicy mayo. One door down at District Hall, there’s rock ‘n’ roll bingo with whiskey-infused burgers. It’s still the serene pace of life that lures most people to Fairhope. “When I was working on ‘Fried Green Tomatoes’ here,” Fannie Flagg recalled, “writing a screenplay is so very difficult and some days I thought I would just pull my hair out. Every afternoon, I would walk across the street from my house and out onto the pier. I would sit there and watch the sun go down. The church was right behind me. The bells would ring and it would just be so peaceful right there in that spot. It kept me sane.” Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,A Southern Watchdog Under Siege,"Race/Related is a weekly newsletter focused on race and identity, with provocative stories from around The New York Times. Please sign up here to have the Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox. The Southern Poverty Law Center, known as one of the nation’s foremost civil rights watchdogs, fired its co-founder Morris Dees this week after almost half a century on the job. The center, which is based in Montgomery, gave no clear indication as to why it had let Mr. Dees go, but the president of the group, Richard Cohen, said in a statement that “a comprehensive assessment of our internal climate and workplace practices” was imminent, suggesting the dismissal was tied to conflict among the staff. On Thursday, the same day the S.P.L.C. announced that Mr. Dees had been fired, employees sent a letter to the center’s leaders citing claims of mistreatment of staff, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and racism. The letter, cited in the Los Angeles Times, said it was prompted by the departure this month of a respected African-American employee whose “worrisome parting words, hardly belies her frustration and disappointment.” The letter starts with a sober warning: “S.P.L.C.’s integrity is on the line.” It demands that management, “create a work environment untainted by instances, allegations, and fears of sexual harassment, assault, and racial and gender discrimination.” It said that “no one should be made to sit silently with these experiences,” and that “maintaining the status quo threatens the safety and well-being of employees. We deserve transparency from our senior leadership.” More than a dozen staff members are said to have signed the letter. Mr. Dees, a child of the South, founded the center in 1971 with the civil rights leader Julian Bond and another young Montgomery lawyer, Joe Levin. In 1994, The Montgomery Advertiser published an eight-part series on the center that described allegations of the discriminatory treatment of black employees. The center, which releases an annual report on hate groups, has come under fire recently for how it chooses to define the organizations on its lists. Conservatives have accused the S.P.L.C. of unfairly targeting right-leaning groups. It remains to be seen exactly why Mr. Dees was fired after such a long career. One thing is clear: It will be hard for the group to continue carrying out its mission of identifying and rooting out extremists while its own staff is up in arms over allegations of injustice.",The New York Times
2019,A Spinach Soup Fit for a Cleanse,"Eat The only reaction I had ever had to pizza was “I want to eat you right now!” But last November, for the first time in my life, my stomach turned at the thought of eating a slice. The preceding two years of nonstop travel, events, special dinners and meals on the go had taken their toll on my body. The day I had been dreading had arrived: It was time for an elimination diet. Because I’d already planned to take a monthlong solitary sabbatical in the high desert, I figured I’d do a cleanse then to give my digestive system a break. All I really wanted was to get healthy enough to be able to gleefully eat pizza again. Alone in the desert, I wouldn’t have to face the temptations that restaurants and social gatherings might pose. So with signature obsessiveness, I researched cleanses for weeks before settling upon one approved by none other than Our Lady of Wellness herself, Gwyneth Paltrow. And even though the diet seemed to eliminate pretty much everything, I found myself looking uncharacteristically forward to three weeks of monastic dietary rigor. The cleanse prescribed nutritional shakes for breakfast and dinner, but I knew the biggest challenge would be eating only a single solid dairy-, gluten- and sugar-free meal — lunch — each day. Like a chump, I paid an absurd amount of money for 42 packets of shake powder and 63 packets of supplements to last the duration of the diet. And truthfully, I was pretty optimistic about the whole thing — vividly imagining my new future as a vegan with a high-fiber diet and a gut full of good bacteria — until I tasted my first shake. Spiked with Stevia, it was intolerably sweet. I sighed. It was going to be a long three weeks. That evening, as my stomach began to growl, the sunset beckoned me outside. The desert gloaming was a marvel. Every inch of sky glowed in shades of neon pink and orange, interrupted only by the outline of the occasional Joshua tree in the distance. The brilliant light was a stark contrast to the bone-chilling January air. Shivering, I headed inside, looking forward to dinner. Then I remembered the frozen, too-sweet shake on the menu. Each day, I began to dread that sunset spectacle, awesome as it was, because it signaled the arrival of yet another disappointing meal substitute. I suffered through a few nightly shakes before I realized I wasn’t going to survive the cleanse without a hot, savory dinner. I figured I could veer from the tyranny of the shakes as long as I adhered to the constraints dictated by the cleanse. I’d stocked the freezer with pints of homemade chicken stock, so on my first night of mild disobedience I defrosted one, seasoned it with salt and drank it gleefully, feeling it warm me from within. Emboldened, the next night I added a handful of the baby spinach I’d bought to add to my shakes, along with some cilantro and a squeeze of lemon. That’s better, I thought, as I sipped the vivid green soup directly from the bowl, pleased with the brightness of the lemon and the freshness of the herbs. And yet I still wished it were a little creamier. As a professional cook, I’d learned that you should always start a puréed soup with onions cooked in butter or olive oil before adding chopped vegetables to the pot and letting them soften. Then, liquid — sometimes water, sometimes stock, milk or coconut milk — is added, and everything simmers. A little cream, bread or flour or even a potato to lend some body to the soup. Finally, after puréeing, the soup is strained through a fine sieve and the seasonings are adjusted. Ever the obedient student, I’ve made puréed soups like this for nearly 20 years. But the rules of the cleanse turned everything I’d learned about classical cooking upside down. Without potatoes, flour, other starches or dairy to lean on, I had to look elsewhere to thicken and enrich the soup. In the desert I didn’t have access to the perfect produce available in the Bay Area, but I easily found frozen fruits and vegetables, boxed baby spinach and lettuces, fresh herbs and chicken for stock at the local grocery store. Now I let the short list of foods I could eat determine the bounds of my creativity. With each passing evening, I began to look increasingly forward to my soup, trying all sorts of different combinations of vegetables, herbs and stock. But I kept returning to that spinach soup loaded with cilantro and lemon. There was something satisfying about it, even if it was a little thin. One night, looking through the pantry, I spotted some tahini I’d brought from home and wondered what a spoonful or two might do for my spinach soup. I’ve always loved the combination of spinach and sesame — one of my favorite Japanese dishes is blanched spinach dressed with goma-ae, a toasted sesame sauce. And when cooking for vegan friends, I often rely on the creaminess that tahini dressing lends to salads and roasted, caramelized vegetables. Could it do the same for my soup? I stirred some into the pot, and I watched with a smile as the tahini dissolved into the broth, and then, as it always does, began to tighten the liquid. I puréed the soup and tasted a rich, verdurous spoonful, humming with pleasure at the way it coated my tongue. Would a little more tahini, in another form, improve the dish? I made a simple sauce with garlic, cumin and chiles and drizzled it on top. There. I finally found what I was looking for: a soup that tasted vegetal yet rich, tangy yet creamy, spiced to just the right point. It might have been created to adhere to an elimination diet, but abundance was all I tasted. The true test of deliciousness, though, came once the cleanse was over. I still crave this soup once a week — almost as often as pizza. Recipe: Spinach-and-Cilantro Soup With Tahini and Lemon cooking",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A St. Patrick’s Day Miracle: United Ireland,"Brexit could do what centuries of Irish conflict could not. Contributing Opinion Writer For going on three years now, Britain has taken a holiday from sanity. A tiny island kingdom whose people once ruled nearly a fourth of the world’s land area squabbles over the terms of its self-inflicted diminishing and isolation. And really, who cares? Those who believe that history has a wicked sense of humor should care. From the depths of British bungling, hubris and incompetence is emerging a St. Patrick’s Day miracle: the real chance of a united Ireland. After more than 800 years, it’s not just possible but also seems inevitable that London’s ruling reach will no longer extend to part of the island west of the Irish Sea. All of the centuries when borders from India to Africa, from the Middle East to British Columbia, were drawn by besotted and bewigged Englishmen may end with the whimpering last gasps of Brexit. Delay Brexit, redo Brexit, no-deal Brexit. It hardly matters. As with the fall of the Berlin Wall, you can sense the acceleration toward the inevitable. Don’t wait for Her Majesty’s government to resolve the sovereignty issues of Northern Ireland, which are now holding up the divorce between Britain and the European Union. There is no solution. Bear with me while I walk through the Groundhog’s Day of this muddle. When Britain voted narrowly in 2016 to leave the union, it did so in a fit of nationalism and xenophobia, and against the will of majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Voters were promised a migrant-free Britain, unfettered from evil globalists. Instead, they are getting a Balkanized Britain, its stagnant economy at the mercy of forces they will no longer be able to influence in Europe. The vote was a Trump-level temper tantrum that revealed the fraudulence of conservative populism. What has bollixed the formal exit — and is the root cause of all of the rudderless rumblings in Parliament this week — is Northern Ireland. As always, the most vexing of Britain’s old colonial possessions is the one closest to Westminster. The Brexit vote roused the ghosts from bloody eras past, those centuries when it was a crime to be Irish in Ireland. The Troubles, three decades of late-20th-century sectarian terror that took at least 3,500 lives, was the latest iteration of that dead weight of memory. “It almost didn’t matter where you started the story: it was always there,” Patrick Radden Keefe writes in “Say Nothing,” his magnificent new account of the awful years in the north. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 — an instance when “hope and history rhyme” in the words of the poet Seamus Heaney — ended the Troubles. Remarkably, it has held the peace, while essentially erasing the border between the Republic of Ireland and the swath of historic Ulster belonging to Britain. No one wants to put up guard stations and customs checks along the invisible 310-mile line separating prosperous Ireland, a member of the E.U., from the shakily peaceful six counties of the north, which would exit. And only the most hateful elements on both sides want a return of violence that is sure to come with a hard border. The solution? It’s there in the not-so-fine print of the peace agreement. Should a majority of Northern Ireland residents desire to leave Britain, it is required to call for a vote of those people. That majority is fast approaching. What Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain calls “our precious union” is held together by 10 members of Parliament representing the old hatreds of North Ireland — the Democratic Unionist Party. It was founded by Ian Paisley, a bigot with a Bible, who opposed the peace agreement and referred to Catholics as scum who “multiply like vermin.” Keefe quotes an English journalist as saying that the unionists are “more British than the British, about whom the British care not at all.” Paisley is no longer with us. Nor is most of the dark sentiment he stirred up. When the borders came down, so did many of the walls of religion and nationality. Catholics, long a persecuted minority, will soon be a majority in Northern Ireland if demographic trends continue. But the conflict is less about one Christian sect against another. It’s more about how to thrive in an interconnected world. The Republic of Ireland is proudly progressive, led by an openly gay taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who is of Irish and Indian heritage. After a series of scandals, the influence of the Catholic Church has greatly diminished. Last year, Ireland had the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Given a choice, a majority in Northern Ireland could well be persuaded to ditch what is left of feckless and intemperate Britain and form a single Irish nation — if for no other reason than they like the benefits that come with being a small country in the E.U. Of course, many things would still have to fall in place. But the stars are aligning. Remember: This was all Britain’s doing, unintentional though it was. Hope and history don’t usually rhyme. More often, they bump into each other. That happy accident could result a single Irish nation finally free of foreign rule. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).

2019,A Star Princeton Player Has a Sense of Where She’ll Be: The W.N.B.A.,"Bella Alarie has become a must-see player for the Princeton women’s basketball team. It’s something her coach, Courtney Banghart, has known for a while, but the rest of the world is just finding out. Banghart began to sense that more people were becoming aware of her star player during a recent conversation with Chris Young, the former major league pitcher who played basketball and baseball at Princeton. “He goes, ‘I’d pay to watch two players in college basketball: Zion Williamson and Bella Alarie,’ ” Banghart said. Almost every basketball fan knows Williamson, Duke’s top player and probably the N.B.A.’s next top draft pick. But Alarie? She is a 6-foot-4 junior who has developed into a player capable of lifting the Tigers to national prominence. On Saturday, against Cornell in the semifinals of the Ivy League tournament, she grabbed eight rebounds and scored a game-high 21 points, shooting 9 of 10 from the field, in a 68-47 victory to advance to the final. Observers believe she has a chance to do something no Ivy League player has done since Allison Feaster, who graduated from Harvard in 1998: represent the conference in an extended W.N.B.A. career. This development was less a dedicated plan and more a series of serendipitous choices merged with hard work. Alarie, a multitalented two-way player of the kind sought at the professional level, did not tower over her peers when she was growing up. She remembers being only a bit taller than them but says she cannot recall a time when she did not have a basketball in her hands. Her father, Mark, a former Duke and N.B.A. player, set about making sure she could play at any position. “I think a lot of it was really focusing on my guard skills,” Bella Alarie said. “I think my dad knew that from a young age, that developing skills early would really benefit me in the long run. We didn’t really know how tall I would be, so I’m really lucky that I kept growing.” Her slight build meant that during her high school career at National Cathedral School in Washington, she drew interest from Ivy League teams, including Harvard and Penn, but did not get so much as a letter of interest from her father’s alma mater. Anything beyond playing in college was not on her radar when she arrived at Princeton. “In high school, I never really thought of myself as someone who would achieve the things I have so far in college,” Alarie said. “And when I was getting recruited, I did really want to put an emphasis on getting a really well-rounded college experience. The Ivy League I was really drawn to from the beginning. Princeton, Penn and Harvard — those were definitely the schools it came down to.” Things began to change for Alarie after she won Ivy League freshman of the year honors, then was selected to play for U.S.A. Basketball in the under-19 FIBA World Cup. “To make that team, that really proved to me that I could compete with some of the best in the country,” Alarie said. “And against the best in the world at my age. So I think that summer really boosted my confidence in myself as a player and also expanded my game, and I learned how to play in another system.” Her coach took note of it and has turned Alarie into a true hybrid. She has been used more in the post after adding 20 pounds to her frame without forsaking her guard skills. That makes her an intriguing pro prospect for a league dominated by players like Elena Delle Donne and Breanna Stewart, who have size and the ability to play any position. Opposing coaches have noticed, too. “I love her,” Tony Bozzella, the Seton Hall coach, said. Alarie had 22 points and 12 rebounds last year in a Princeton win at Seton Hall. “Reminds me of Delle Donne. Not as good yet, but similar games. Obviously a great scorer in many ways, awesome rebounder and passer, great vision, supersmart. A definite first-round pick.” This season, after missing Princeton’s first nine games with a broken arm, Alarie is putting up numbers seldom seen at the school. She set the Ivy League’s single-game scoring mark last month with a 45-point outing against Columbia, and in the process became the only Princeton player other than Bill Bradley to score at least 45. Entering this weekend’s Ivy League tournament at Yale, Alarie was averaging 23.0 points and 10.7 rebounds a game, and shooting 51 percent from the field, with range extending beyond the arc. On the defensive end, according to Synergy Sports data, she was allowing opponents 0.564 points per possession, which ranked her 36th in the country among 2,231 Division I players with at least 100 defensive possessions. Accordingly, Princeton was 2-7 without her. Entering the weekend, the Tigers were 20-2 with Alarie. Unfortunately for opponents, after she broke her right arm she spent her recovery time working aggressively on going to her left, making her even harder to stop. While W.N.B.A. teams cannot comment on Alarie publicly, scouts and executives are tracking her. As one put it: “She’s on radars.” They have let her coach know it, too. “I talk to W.N.B.A. coaches all the time about her,” Banghart said. “So certainly, she’s no secret to the W.N.B.A.” Princeton’s program has generated other pro talent. Blake Dietrick, the Ivy League player of the year in 2014-15, went on to play for the Atlanta Dream last season. Leslie Robinson, whose father, Craig, was a two-time player of the year at Princeton in the early 1980s, was drafted by the Liberty in the third round of last season’s W.N.B.A. draft. Dietrick credited the success of the program as a whole. “I would not have had nearly as much W.N.B.A. interest were it not for the success of my team and our 30-0 season,” she said, referring to Princeton’s regular-season record in 2014-15. But she also credited her coaches for working to improve the players within the team context and with an eye on long-term success. To Banghart, it was no different from the way she would treat any other high-achieving Princeton student. “If someone’s interested in finance, I connect them to the people they think they can learn from,” Banghart said. “With Bella, it’s the same thing. The more positionless she can be, the better she can be. There’s an eye on helping her at Princeton, and there’s an eye on being the best pro she can be at what she chooses. So I’m thinking big picture with her because she deserves it. She’s earned it.”",The New York Times
2019,A Stark Divide in America’s Retail Industry Is Coming Into Focus,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Macy’s is closing stores. So are J. C. Penney, Family Dollar, Payless ShoeSource, Victoria’s Secret and Gap. On the flip side, Walmart and Target just reported their best sales growth in more than a decade. America’s retail industry is divided. As earnings season continues, it is becoming clear just how divided. On one side are the companies that have worked out online strategies to compete with Amazon, while also finding the right mix of products and services, like selling groceries, to keep shoppers coming into their stores. Amazon is still by far the leader in e-commerce, but Walmart, Target and Best Buy especially are increasingly challenging its dominance in online sales. They are using their physical stores to fulfill online orders — catering to shoppers’ demands for instant gratification — and increasing their digital promotions. Those efforts paid off in 2018, particularly during the holiday season. Walmart and Target just reported their best comparable year-over-year sales growth since before the financial crisis, bolstered in part by the growth of their online operations. Walmart’s digital revenue rose 40 percent last year, and the company is now the third-largest online retailer in the United States, according to data from eMarketer. Target’s e-commerce revenue increased nearly as much, and the company said that about 75 percent of its online sales during the fourth quarter were fulfilled in stores. Best Buy’s turnaround maintained its momentum in 2018. The electronics retailer’s comparable sales growth the past two years is its highest in more than a decade. The three companies also benefited from the struggles and store closings of retailers like Toys “R” Us and Sears. Then there are the laggards. Investors had high hopes for department stores like Macy’s, Kohl’s, J. C. Penney and Nordstrom last year. The economy was strong, consumer confidence was high, and shoppers had extra money to spend as a result of the tax cuts. Shares of the four department store chains rose more than 30 percent in the first half of the year, before they succumbed to a broad market sell-off. But the results they have reported recently show that some of the early hopes reflected in the stock increases were premature. The chains’ performance is tied in part to the struggling malls that their stores often anchor. Many of those shopping centers have been hollowed out in recent years and have failed to keep up with the changing tastes and buying habits of American consumers. J. C. Penney reported declining sales for the holiday season, while Macy’s warned that its sales are unlikely to increase much in the year ahead. Both companies also announced additional store closings. Sales for two mall stalwarts, Gap and L Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, also fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts, and the pair announced more store closings. Nordstrom reported that comparable sales at its full-price stores had declined 1.6 percent. But the company’s results were lifted by another shift among consumers: a growing move toward discount chains. Comparable sales at Nordstrom Rack, the company’s off-price store, rose 4 percent. One department store chain has managed to avoid the gloom. Kohl’s same-store sales and forecast for the year ahead beat Wall Street’s expectations. Why? A partnership with Amazon to sell the Echo and other products from the e-commerce giant while allowing Amazon customers to return purchases to Kohl’s stores.",The New York Times
2019,A Stranger Returned His Lost Lottery Tickets. Then He Won $273 Million.,"An unemployed New Jersey man won a $273 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot last week after a stranger found and returned the winning ticket that he had left behind on a store counter. The man, Michael J. Weirsky, told reporters on Thursday that he lost two tickets immediately after he bought them at a QuickChek in Phillipsburg, N.J., on the day before the lottery drawing. He said it was the result of “the typical cellphone deal.” “I was paying more attention to my cellphone,” he said at a news conference. “I put the tickets down to put my money away, then I did something with my phone and just walked away.” Mr. Weirsky had spent hours searching for the tickets when he got to his home in Alpha, N.J., near the Pennsylvania border. He was convinced they must have gotten lost there, and it was not until the next day that he decided to ask a clerk at the store if anyone had seen them. The clerk said someone had turned them in. Then she quizzed him on what tickets he had bought before handing them over, he said. The lottery drawing was that night. “I was very thankful there was an honest person out there because I thought it was gone,” he said. But Mr. Weirsky, who said he spends $20 a week on quick-pick lottery tickets, said he did not realize he had the winning ticket until two days later, as a snowstorm swirled outside. He said a friend of his mother’s called to say she thought a mutual friend of theirs had hit the jackpot. That man bought his ticket at the same store Mr. Weirsky did, and had been standing right in front of him when he did it. Mr. Weirsky called to ask if he had won. When the man said he had not, Mr. Weirsky decided to check his own tickets using the lottery app on his phone. Then he turned to his mother in shock. “I put the phone down, I put the ticket down, I sat there for a second — I said to my mother, ‘Hey, that just said I was the jackpot winner,’” he said. “And she’s like, ‘What’s that mean?’” “I said, ‘I won $273 million,’” he told her. “And she was like, ‘Get the hell out of here.’” So, for a while, he did. “I just put the ticket back down, watched TV for about another half-hour. And I just got up and ran upstairs, got dressed and I said, ‘I’ve got to go find out if it’s real,’” he said. New Jersey Lottery said in a statement that Mr. Weirsky “ventured out in a snowstorm” to scan the ticket at a nearby store. The scan also said he was the winner. Mr. Weirsky said the lottery win would change everything for him. He had been unemployed for 15 years, he said, living as a stay-at-home husband and moving often for his ex-wife’s job. Their marriage ended in October. He said he now plans to take his time looking for work. He may start a business, he said, or work part time helping a friend who works as a handyman. “I am just going to sit back and enjoy it,” said Mr. Weirsky, who could not be reached on Friday night. He said he planned to take his winnings as a $162.5 million lump sum rather than in installments. His first move will be to buy a new pickup truck, he said, and his next will be to listen to his lawyer. “After that, I am basically locked into what my lawyer and other people that I got working for me tell me I can do,” he said. “But after they tell me I can go crazy, I am going to take a family vacation and take everybody with us.” James Carey, the acting executive director of the New Jersey Lottery, said Mr. Weirsky was lucky that someone had returned the winning lottery ticket to the store. (The store was lucky, too: It got a $30,000 prize from New Jersey Lottery for selling the winning ticket.) When it comes to lottery tickets, possession is nine-tenths of the law, Mr. Carey said. If the person who found Mr. Weirsky’s ticket had claimed ownership, that person would have been declared the winner. “If you have a winning ticket, we always urge our players: Sign that ticket right away,” Mr. Carey said at the news conference. He added, “If you think about it, it is very difficult to say who owns a lottery ticket short of someone coming in here and saying, ‘I purchased this ticket. It’s mine.’” Mr. Weirsky said he was thankful for the unidentified good Samaritan who found his tickets on the store counter and decided to turn them in. He said he hoped to find the person. “I’ve got to find him and thank him,” Mr. Weirsky said, adding, “I am going to give him something, but I am going to keep that private.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Striker Out of Form, and Liverpool Out of First","On Soccer LIVERPOOL, England — Mohamed Salah has been here before. The edge of the opposition box, down Liverpool’s right-hand side, a defender snapping at his heels. A little burst of speed creates a touch, a glimmer of space. The ball is at his left foot. He touches it just a few inches in front of him. Mohamed Salah has scored this goal before. He seemed to score this goal almost continually last season: opening his body out, wrapping his foot round the ball, generating enough whip to carry it high, across the goalkeeper, arcing into the far corner. It is the goal that won him last year’s Puskas Award. It is the goal that at one point seemed to become his signature. The mechanics of it are still there. Now, he sets the ball just the same as he used to. He shapes his body just the same as he used to. He is, it is safe to assume, aiming for the same corner as he used to. This time, though, it is not quite enough. The ball curls, but it fades too soon. It picks up height, but too little. Jordan Pickford, Everton’s goalkeeper, barely moves. The ball drifts, welcome, into his arms. Salah missed more glaring opportunities than that as Liverpool, just as it had last week, visited a team desperate to see it fail and left with a goalless draw. The cost was a little higher this time around: A single point against Manchester United last week took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table. The same result against Everton on a rain-specked Sunday left it a point behind Manchester City. Salah was not the only player who might have diverted the course of the game — Joel Matip and Fabinho, in particular, spurned their chances to become folk heroes — but he did it most often. Twice, once in each half, he raced clear, his feet a blur as he bore down on goal. Twice, his touch was heavy. Twice, his timing was awry. Pickford saved one; the defender Michael Keane stopped the other. But though they were his best chances, it was the first of them, the one that curled straight into Pickford’s hands, that was most symbolic of Salah’s campaign so far. Everything is almost exactly the same as it used to be, as it was in his unstoppable season last year, only it isn’t, not quite. It was, of course, unavoidable that Salah would be accused of suffering from what is popularly known as second-season syndrome. That is the unfortunate thing about setting quite so high a bar last season: even the slightest drop-off, or even the slightest perception of a drop-off, can be interpreted as an anticlimax. Anything other than a repeat of the improbable feats of his first season at Liverpool — 32 goals in 36 Premier League games, 44 in 52 in all competitions — would certainly be enough to invite criticism that his run of form had been an illusion. So it has proved. Salah has scored 17 goals in the Premier League in his 28 games this season. Good, of course; respectable, obviously, more than a goal in every two games; still a smart inclusion in the fantasy team, clearly. Is it a total bettered only by Sergio Agüero, putting Salah ahead of Harry Kane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the rest of the billions of dollars of strikers in the Premier League? O.K. But still, not quite the same. Not really. Salah, indeed, is a strange kind of busted flush. He was, according to his manager, Jürgen Klopp, “unplayable” as recently as four days ago, when he twisted and curdled the blood of Adam Masina, Watford’s left back, during a 5-0 win at Anfield. He has been criticized for disappearing in high-pressure games — not always wrongly — but in the one truly do-or-die game of Liverpool’s season so far, in the Champions League against Napoli, Salah scored the only goal. He is still his club’s leading scorer. Even at Goodison Park, even in the stalemate, it was abundantly clear that he was Liverpool’s greatest threat. That is not to say, though, that the criticism is entirely misplaced. Just as Salah is not a write-off because he has not managed to maintain his furious goal-scoring rate, it is hard to deny that he is not quite the force of nature he was for much of last year. Perhaps, in the early months of the season, there were mitigating circumstances: the lingering effects of that shoulder injury sustained in the Champions League final, the one that threatened his involvement in the World Cup and that hampered his performances in Russia. And perhaps, even as the injury has healed, its effects are still felt. Klopp dismisses any notions that Salah has lost confidence, but the heavy touches when he was once so deft, the slight stumbles when he was once so sure: they are the surefire signs. Salah’s newfound profile means he has to deal with the closer attentions of opposing defenders. He has had to do so, at times, in the absence of much creative assistance from Liverpool’s midfield, and for much of the year in a new position, too. He has not been able to pick up the burden when he is not quite as fluid, not quite as free as he used to be. There is no shame in that, of course. The number of goals he has scored despite all of that warrants respect, rather than scorn. The worry — from Klopp’s perspective, and from Liverpool’s — is that, in a title race that will probably be decided by the very finest of margins, what they need more than ever is the Salah of last year, the one who scored that same goal again and again, the one whose every touch seemed to be golden. If Liverpool is to overhaul Manchester City, if it is to end its 29-year wait for an English championship, it needs the player it had last season, rather than the one who is almost the same, but somehow, infinitesimally, not quite.",The New York Times
2019,"A Supposed Stickler for the Rules, Now at the Center of a U.S.C. Scandal","LOS ANGELES — Ron Allice, the track and field coach at the University of Southern California, assumed bad news was on the way when Donna Heinel summoned him to her office back in 2011. He was right. Heinel, the athletic department administrator who functioned as a gatekeeper over whether recruited athletes could find a spot at the increasingly competitive private university, had found a problem with the track athlete Allice was pushing. He had taken a sign language class to fulfill a foreign language requirement and, though that was the standard in the state university systems, Heinel dug in against him. Now, Allice wonders if there was another reason Heinel was so resolute. And he is not alone. Heinel, 57, who as an unyielding, by-the-book administrator rose to a position of unchecked authority during her 16 years in the U.S.C. athletic department, has emerged as a central figure in the academic admissions scandal that has ensnared members of rich — and in some cases famous — families. They are among 50 people charged with carrying out a series of bribes and rigged admissions qualifications, including making up athletic accomplishments, in order to get affluent children into prestigious universities across the country. Nowhere was the scheme more widespread than at U.S.C., where four others who have coached there — one of them until earlier this month — are under indictment. Heinel stands accused of being at the fulcrum of the scheme, conspiring with Rick Singer, a private admissions consultant, to obtain millions in bribes and then easing more than two dozen students into the school through the so-called side door of athletic admissions, using fraudulent athletic profiles. Through a lawyer, Heinel, who was fired the day she was indicted, declined to comment. Heinel is the only administrator who has been charged, and her university is the only one of eight involved at which more than one coach has been implicated. U.S.C.’s interim president, Wanda Austin, has pledged to revamp its athletic admissions process. According to the indictment, Heinel and Singer, the private counselor who hatched the plan, collaborated with the water polo coach, Jovan Vavic, and the former soccer coach, Ali Khosroshahin, who was fired in 2013, and his former assistant Laura Janke, who created phony athletic profiles. Like Heinel, Vavic was fired by U.S.C. on March 12, the day the indictments were unsealed. It was a stunning revelation. Heinel ran an independent business counseling parents and high school administrators on how to comply with N.C.A.A. regulations. Colleagues described her as a stickler for the rules. Tom Walsh, the former cross country coach who left U.S.C. in 2013 after 19 years, said coaches sweated the days when they had to attest to the worthiness of their recruits to Heinel. “It didn’t matter how good people were,” Walsh recalled in an interview last week. “Coaches in different sports would commiserate: damn, this is tough.” In fact, Walsh said, if you had asked him before the indictment about Heinel’s standards, “I’d have said she was as hard as it gets.” Walsh and his former colleagues are now wondering how far back the alleged scam might have gone. Heinel required coaches who recruited athletes from Europe to have their transcripts translated in the United States to limit the chances of fraud, Walsh said. One runner he recruited was an artist. Heinel demanded to see a portfolio, and copies or photos of the works were not sufficient. The originals had to be shipped. “She was basically the gatekeeper,” said a former U.S.C. coach who requested anonymity because he was concerned that being identified could hurt his career. “If you wanted to get someone in, she was the person that really made that decision. Or not.” Regardless of that power, Heinel largely kept a low profile both on campus and off. She has two children in elementary school and lives with her partner, a school-district special-education administrator, on Naples Island, an exclusive neighborhood in Long Beach, Calif., known for multimillion-dollar homes on winding canals. Neighbors were shocked when F.B.I. agents surrounded Heinel’s house on a narrow, quiet side street just before dawn 10 days ago to arrest her, instructing an inquisitive neighbor to go back in his house. Heinel was described by neighbors as quiet and unassuming, driving a red sedan reminiscent of the official color of U.S.C., walking the dog, jogging or riding a bike frequently, and flying drones or playing sports with her son and daughter. Neighbors said Heinel generally kept to herself, even when they mentioned their children had gone to U.S.C. “It’s usually, ‘Hi, how you doing?’” said Keith Muirhead, a real estate broker who has lived in the house one door down for 36 years. Muirhead described Heinel as friendly, but said that they had “never socialized, never had a glass of wine, which is unusual because in Naples it’s almost a rule.” It’s not clear when exactly Heinel developed a relationship with Singer. But since 2014, Heinel had presented to admissions more than two dozen students with bogus athletic credentials, including a football player whose high school had no football team, as well as a 5-foot-5 men’s basketball player and a high school cheerleader made to look like a lacrosse star. In fact, emails and recorded phone conversations in the indictment paint a portrait of Heinel not merely as a conduit, but also as a fixer who could spot potential brush fires and swept aside skeptical questions. When counselors at two high schools reviewing applications to U.S.C. last April raised questions with parents about the listed athletic qualifications of their children, Heinel called Singer. In a voice mail message captured by investigators, she warned that the indignant parents must be stopped from going to the high school “yelling at counselors.” “That’ll shut everything — that’ll shut everything down,” she said. Around the same time, Heinel wrote a lengthy email to the U.S.C. director of admissions to set aside concerns about the athletic credentials of Matteo Sloane, the son of a drinking and wastewater systems entrepreneur who was admitted as a water polo player despite not playing the sport. Heinel said that because Sloane’s high school did not have a water polo team, he played at L.A. Water Polo Club during the school year and traveled internationally with a youth junior team in the summer, playing in Greece, Serbia and Portugal. None of this was true. “He is small,” Heinel continued in the email. “But he has a long torso but short strong legs, plus he is fast which helps him win the draws to start play after goals are scored. He is an attack perimeter player.” She then thanked the admissions director for raising the discrepancy. Sloane did not play for U.S.C. The admissions director replied to Heinel, thanking her and saying that a paraphrased version of her email would be passed along to assure the high school officials that U.S.C. had looked into the matter. “They seemed unusually skeptical,” the director wrote. There seemed to be no such skepticism of Heinel at U.S.C. Through her 16 years at the school, she grew increasingly powerful, controlling two areas that were crucial to coaches: admissions and budgets. That reputation helped lead to her ascent, colleagues said. Pat Haden, a former U.S.C. football star lured from his post at a private equity firm to become athletic director after the football and basketball programs were penalized in 2010 for improper benefits to players, tripled the department’s compliance staff. He also promoted Heinel to senior woman administrator and the director of admissions and eligibility, jobs that had previously been handled by two associate athletic directors. Haden could not be reached for comment. Heinel managed to cash in on her experience navigating admissions for prospective student athletes. In 2008, she established a side business, Clear the Clearinghouse, which advised high school coaches, counselors and administrators on N.C.A.A. rules for athletes. She offered subscriptions services, for up to $700 annually, and hosted workshops that cost $100, along with offering to do consulting work. Heinel’s business held two-hour workshops at U.S.C.’s Galen Center. The notices advertising the clinics were sent to about 150 high school and private counselors, either from Heinel’s work email account or from that of Katie Fuller, an assistant director of admissions and eligibility at the school. Typically, about 50 people attended the workshops, according to one private counselor who said she attended two of them, several years apart. The workshops were unusual in that most schools, including U.S.C., put them on at no cost or for a nominal fee as a sort of public service for counselors. One of the few documented interviews with Heinel is from a panel discussion for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people she participated in at U.S.C. in 2013, at which she described herself “as a loner for mostly all of my life.” Growing up in Philadelphia, she recalled, she was estranged from her parents for more than two years when she came out to them as gay while she was a student at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where she was a member of the swim team. But she reconciled with them somewhat a couple of years later when a sister became ill with cancer. The experience of coming out to her parents stayed with her. “I’ve just kind of been, ‘Do what I want to do, when I want to do it,” she said. Years later, established in her career as an athletic administrator, Heinel quickly developed a rapport with Haden, who has a gay son. Haden, and his successor, Lynn Swann, instituted few checks on Heinel’s powers. From October until April, Heinel would meet every other Thursday with a subcommittee from the admissions office that included the dean of admissions and two assistants. At each meeting, Heinel would go through a list of recruits, including their test scores, transcripts and athletic profile, and within a few days would get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on whether they would be admitted, according to both colleagues and the indictment. Sprinkled among those hundreds of recruits in 19 sports were the fraudulent athletic résumés that Heinel is accused of shepherding. Often those profiles were created by Janke, who was paid by Singer, but according to the affidavit, on at least one occasion, Heinel created a profile on a U.S.C. letterhead that made it appear as if the U.S.C. lacrosse coach were lavishing praise on a recruit who in reality had never played the sport. Almost always, within days of one of Singer’s clients being conditionally admitted to U.S.C., a check for $50,000 or more made out to “U.S.C. women’s athletics” or “U.S.C. athletics” would arrive in an envelope addressed to Heinel. In all, those checks added up to $1.3 million, which were deposited into accounts that Heinel largely controlled and could distribute to various teams. (Heinel also received $20,000 per month dating to last July from Singer in what court documents referred to as a “sham” consulting agreement.) In explaining to Todd Blake why he had received a solicitation call asking for another donation to women’s basketball when his daughter was admitted fraudulently as a volleyball player, Singer said: “the money went toward her,” referring to Heinel, “and she gets to decide where it goes within the department.” Eight years later, Allice, the retired track and field coach, remains annoyed. Memories of that hurdler were dredged up by the allegations against a woman who now stands accused of fraud. The athlete Heinel said did not measure up to the school’s standards was hardly a borderline athlete, much less one of the fakes she and Singer created. The hurdler, Johnathan Cabral, ended up at U.S.C.’s Pac-12 rival, Oregon, where he would finish second in the N.C.A.A. finals in the 110-meter hurdles as a senior. A year later he finished sixth during the 2016 Olympics while representing Canada. An earlier version of this article misstated one of Donna Heinel’s titles at U.S.C. She was the senior woman administrator, not the senior women’s administrator.",The New York Times
2019,A Surprise Samson: The Week in Classical Music,"that decisive moment [Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Hope you had a bustling week and are looking forward to some adventurous listening this weekend. In memory of Michael Gielen, the searching conductor who died last Friday at 91 — read David Allen’s superb obituary — hear one of the selections David chose: Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis,” rendered with cleareyed power. Listen as you go about chores, or take the subway, or drive to the bank. You’ll be glad you did. On Wednesday, I was at the Metropolitan Opera for the return of “Samson et Dalila” with a fresh cast — notably the galvanizing mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili. It was clear from the start that the Samson, Aleksandrs Antonenko, was struggling; after intermission, the Met announced that he was ill with a cold, and would be replaced by Gregory Kunde. It’s not easy to jump into the middle of a performance, but Mr. Kunde did it with stylish ease. Now 65(!), he’s moved on from specializing in bel canto earlier in his career to the heroic roles of Verdi and Puccini. But he’s hardly ever sung at the Met. Hopefully that changes now. His success brought me back to an already classic recording of Rossini’s “Armida” made from 1993 performances in Italy. Here’s Mr. Kunde combining memorably with Renée Fleming: This week our critics reviewed the return of “Das Rheingold” to the Met; the New York recital debut of the pianist Beatrice Rana; the umpteenth Carnegie concert by the great violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter; and two concerts from Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. In darker news, the musicians of the Chicago Symphony have gone on strike, largely over proposed changes to their pension plan. And Christine Goerke spoke with Michael Cooper about taking on Brünnhilde at the Met, where she was once in the young artists program. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” she said. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.” Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE The night after Beatrice Rana’s New York debut, on the same stage (Zankel Hall), the fun was doubled in a fascinating program of exciting works for two pianos, performed by the formidable Kirill Gerstein, who can play anything, and Thomas Adès, an eminent composer who is also accomplished pianist. Recently they were with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the premiere of Mr. Adès’s Piano Concerto, written for Mr. Gerstein. (They bring that work to Carnegie Hall on Wednesday.) At Zankel, they began with Debussy’s “En Blanc et Noir,” a late work, from 1915, which in this starkly beautiful and steely performance seemed not far removed from the shock-and-awe radicalism of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913). Turning to Stravinsky, they played Shostakovich’s rarely-heard arrangement of the “Symphony of Psalms.” With the chorus part (a setting of psalm texts) divided between the pianos — and without the distraction, so to speak, of the score’s dark, percussive orchestral sonorities — the modernist daring of Stravinsky’s harmonic language came through stunningly. The program also included Mr. Adès’s stream-of-consciousness Concert Paraphrase from his opera “Powder Her Face,” and ended with an account of Ravel’s “La Valse” that had this showpiece sounding dangerous. Don’t believe me? Here they are playing it in Paris in 2016. ANTHONY TOMMASINI",The New York Times
2019,A Swimmer Saved by What She Lost,"Tormented by pain, Morgan Stickney made the agonizing decision to have her lower leg removed. The groundbreaking procedure may change the course of her life, and the future of amputations. CreditCreditRachel Woolf for The New York Times COLORADO SPRINGS — The last thing Morgan Stickney remembers from before her lower leg was amputated is lying on a hospital gurney waiting for the anesthesia to take hold. With a debilitating fear racing through her mind, she asked her surgeon to hold her hand. They talked about swimming until she passed out. “It’s the last moment I had with two legs,” she said. “I was in the pool, the most happy place for me.” Five years earlier, Stickney had dreams of becoming an Olympian. At 15, she ranked in the top 20 nationally in the mile, a freestyle event, and was a rising star out of Bedford, N.H. But by the time she was wheeled into surgery last May, her Olympic dream had long since vanished. A relatively minor foot injury in 2013 had dragged her down a rabbit hole of five surgeries, numerous examinations and untold theories, none of which relieved — or even explained — the constant, excruciating pain that left her unable to walk by day and then, cruelly, stabbed her awake at night. The only solutions offered by too many shrugging doctors were the prescription painkillers that, Stickney and her family knew, were turning a once cheerful teenager into a dreary, opioid-dependent 20-year-old pushing herself around her college campus on a kneeling scooter. The worst moment came during a chemistry exam one day, when the only clear thought Stickney could summon was the note she wrote to her professor on the paper: “I’m too high to take this test right now.” Not long after that, she made the agonizing, irreversible choice to have her lower left leg removed. “Opioid addiction is an epidemic,” she said. “I didn’t want that to become my life. I want to have a family one day. I want to be able to do things with my life. This was the only solution anyone was giving me.” Forced out of the pool by unrelenting pain, Stickney elected to have her leg amputated below the knee in a new medical procedure developed primarily by Matthew Carty, a specialist in limb restoration at Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital in Boston. The amputation procedure that Carty performs is designed to enhance the vitality and the possibilities for the portion of the limb that remains. Those possibilities include the potential of one day connecting the lower leg muscles to a futuristic robotic prosthesis currently in development across the Charles River at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The developers of the prosthetic hope it will operate much like a natural ankle and foot. The operation is not yet perfect — Stickney will require at least one more surgical procedure — but it could forever change how amputations are performed. But in Stickney’s case, it has been transformative: Within weeks of her amputation last spring, Stickney, now 21, was back in the pool, swimming before she could even walk. By December, she had won the 400- and 100-meter freestyle races at the U.S. Paralympics national championships in Arizona. And while her experience has not been seamless, Stickney’s national team dreams, once abandoned, are flickering back into view. Nathan Manley, the coach of the resident program of the U.S. Paralympic team in Colorado Springs, where Stickney trains, said she was a serious contender to make the American team for the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Perhaps most important, she is feeling like herself again — the “nonnarcotic Morgan,” in her words, is having fun again. “Of course, I am,” she said. “When I’m in the pool it’s me, Morgan. It’s not Morgan the amputee.” When Stickney was a healthy 15-year-old in 2013, and suddenly ranked among the best swimmers her age in the country, she saw a different future for herself. But a few months later, while jumping next to the starting blocks before a race, she broke a sesamoid, one of two jellybean-size bones under her left big toe. Ordered to wear a boot, she was told that in eight weeks all would be well. It never was. Four surgeries followed, plus the seemingly endless prescriptions for painkillers and anti-inflammatories: Oxycodone. Tramadol. Meloxicam. Diclofenac. Stickney continued to swim for her club team, and she even earned a scholarship at Biola University, a private Christian college about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles. But within a month of her arrival there in 2016, the pain grew more intense. Another surgery revealed she had shattered the other sesamoid bone in the same foot, and it was removed in a rare — and perhaps ill-conceived, her family now believes — procedure. (The Stickneys lauded the care that Morgan had received from some of her physicians, but also described what they now view as incompetence from others.) After yet another summer spent recuperating from surgery in her room in New Hampshire, Stickney hobbled back to Biola and resumed her studies, powering through her classes in an opioid-induced haze. “I would take about five Oxy at once,” she said. “I went to class high. There were times I took so many pills and I was scared that I had overdosed.” In the fall of 2017, a staph infection related to one of the surgical procedures surfaced in her ailing foot, and her temperature spiked to 104 degrees. Her parents arranged for a flight back to Boston, and Stickney was on an operating table the next day. Around that time, the word “amputation” was first mentioned. She cried through the night. Eventually, though, she secretly began researching prosthetics, and through that process came to learn about Carty and his new procedure. Named the Ewing amputation, after Jim Ewing, the initial patient, the procedure is thought to be the first significant change to amputations in hundreds of years, Carty said. During standard below-the-knee amputations, the muscles in the back and front of the lower leg, which naturally work in tandem, are shorn of their connection. In the new procedure, Carty uses material from the discarded portion of the limb to reconnect those tissues and the nerves that serve them. Doing so preserves the natural connection of the two muscles and the communication with the brain, he said, and, in most cases so far, allows them to work in concert as before. “This is an experimental operation, and I would never represent to anyone that it is signed, sealed and delivered,” Carty said. “But I believe in my soul of souls that we are on to something much better.” Carty said he had been thinking of a better way to do amputations when the Boston Marathon bombings occurred in 2013. He and his colleagues treated dozens of victims after the attack, many of whom required complex reconstruction of their lower limbs. The family of one of the victims that day, Gillian Reny, donated $2 million to establish the Stepping Strong Center for Trauma Innovation, which has helped finance Carty’s research, in collaboration with Hugh Herr, the M.I.T. scientist who is developing the robotic ankle and foot that Stickney and other amputees have tested in his lab. The Department of Defense has since provided an additional $6 million to help develop more sophisticated approaches to amputation. On Wednesday, Jason Souza, a staff surgeon who specializes in amputations at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., performed the first Ewing amputation by someone other than Carty. “The nice thing about this surgery is that it is a relatively straightforward surgery in terms of the technical demands, and it is relatively low risk,” Souza said. Before patients can elect to have the Ewing amputation, Carty mandates second opinions, along with visits to a pain specialist and to psychiatrists. Stickney had her surgery on May 14, a month before her 21st birthday. Tony Stickney, Morgan’s father, initially opposed it, and even tried to dissuade his daughter as late as the day of the operation. But she was resolute. “She wanted to be out of pain, and I didn’t know what else to do as a dad,” he said. “I knew we were losing her to the drugs. Dr. Carty’s surgery provided some hope.” During the operation, Carty discovered that one of Stickney’s metatarsal bones — the five long bones in the foot — had died, probably as a result of the earlier staph infection. What he saw confirmed that any additional procedures to salvage the foot would have failed. Stickney’s decision to amputate only hastened the inevitable. Complications led to a minor corrective procedure soon after. But within weeks, and with her father’s video camera rolling at a pool in Manchester, N.H., Stickney hopped to the edge, dived in and sliced through a lap of the pool before surfacing with her unmistakable smile brightening her face. In that moment — her first venture into a pool in almost two years — a swimming career was reborn. At a para-swimming event in California in September, Morgan so dazzled scouts that she was invited to the U.S. Paralympic training program at Colorado Springs. She moved in last fall. Stickney’s recovery is far from complete. She continues to endure phantom pain — a torment for many amputees — but Carty said that he believed the issue stemmed from a nerve complication, and from the fact that she does more extensive physical activity (training twice a day, six days a week) than any of his previous 12 patients. He has told Stickney that a straightforward procedure should fix the nerve problem, but she said she would not consider it until after the Paralympics. If she makes the United States team, she has already asked Carty to join her in Tokyo. That is the short-term goal. For the long term, Stickney has transferred to the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. She is still on a track toward medical school, and perhaps even a career in limb restoration, just like Carty. Because of everything she has been through, Stickney said, she would like to become a physician or a physician assistant. “I think the world needs better doctors,” she said.

2019,A TV Anchor’s Park Avenue Apartment for Sale,"exclusive The four-bedroom, four-bath co-op was the primary residence for Deborah Norville and her family for the last 17 years. The list price will be $4.5 million. 7 Photos View Slide Show › The television journalist Deborah Norville saw plenty of potential when she first stepped inside her four-bedroom apartment at the massive, Georgian-style co-op at 655 Park Avenue about 17 years ago — even if she called the place “a wreck.” “It had the most unusual design aesthetic I’ve ever seen,” she said, noting, for example, the “bizarre, weird stone path” the previous owner had installed in sections of the unit. The apartment listing conceded: “Needs work but could be spectacular.” “It looked like a mess, but it felt good,” said Ms. Norville, the longtime anchor of the syndicated newsmagazine “Inside Edition” and a former co-host of NBC’s “Today” show. “You had to have a vision.” She and her husband, Karl Wellner, a money manager, transformed the nearly 3,000 square feet of discordant space into a homey, primary residence, raising three children there while improving their work commutes. “A lot of people bailed from New York after 9/11,” said Ms. Norville, who instead relocated to Manhattan with her family from Long Island. “We were determined to stay.” Now, as empty-nesters, they are ready to leave. Their country house just outside the city has become their main home. And so the apartment, No. 4E, which has an entrance on East 67th Street, is back on the market for $4.5 million, according to the listing broker, Meredyth Hull Smith of Sotheby’s International Realty. Monthly maintenance is $7,632. The fully renovated unit was reimagined with the help of the architect James L. Bodnar, incorporating a decidedly Scandinavian décor of muted blues and creams, and rich faux finishes — a nod to the couple’s Swedish heritage. (Mr. Wellner was born and raised in Stockholm, while Ms. Norville has family members from Sweden.) Many of the apartment’s original architectural details also remain: the oak herringbone floors in the entertaining spaces, the high ceilings and oversize, south-facing windows. Along with four bedrooms and four full baths, there’s a spacious library that could be converted into another bedroom. The home is entered through a columned gallery that opens to a large living room anchored by a wood-burning fireplace clad in raw limestone. Flanking the living room are the library and a formal dining room, each separated by French doors. “It is well suited for entertaining because the rooms flow so nicely from one to the other,” Ms. Norville said. The wood-paneled library, where one of Ms. Norville’s two Emmy Awards is displayed, has built-in shelves and a full bath. The formal dining room has a ceiling with a small dome that holds an elaborate candlelit crystal chandelier, matching the candlelit wall sconces, which the couple reserved for holidays and special occasions. Off the dining room is an eat-in, windowed kitchen with granite floors, tiled countertops and a breakfast bar. “I loved to cook,” Ms. Norville said. “Anytime anyone comes home or is about to leave, they ask me to make my chicken curry.” Beyond the kitchen, through a long corridor, is a service/bedroom wing, which includes a washer-dryer, two small bedrooms and a full bath. Two larger bedrooms, each with an en suite bath, are on the other side of the apartment. The master suite has a roomy carpeted seating and dressing area, two large walk-in closets and a bath with tumbled marble tile. Ms. Norville and Mr. Wellner, who is the chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management, especially enjoyed the natural light that streamed through the apartment. “It gets wonderful daytime light,” she said. “It makes me happy to walk in.” She said she would miss her friends in the Upper East Side building, who have included well-known residents like Massimo Ferragamo, the chairman of Ferragamo USA, and his family. (Mr. Ferragamo and his wife, Chiara, put their duplex penthouse on the market last year.) “It will be sad to leave,” Ms. Norville said. The limestone and brick apartment house at 655 Park was designed by James E. R. Carpenter and Mott B. Schmidt in the early 1920s. The building was constructed around a courtyard garden facing the avenue and encompasses a full block between 67th and 68th Streets.",The New York Times
2019,"A Taliban Leader, Eyeing U.S. Peace Deal, Speaks to Afghans’ Fears","DOHA, Qatar — In a sign that the Taliban see a peace deal with the United States as imminent, one of their top leaders released a rare audio message on Thursday seeking to ease the concerns of the insurgency’s own fighters — and those of Afghans who fear that an agreement could let the Taliban return to power and roll back human rights. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a deputy Taliban leader who was recently freed from a Pakistani cell to lead the talks with the Americans in Qatar, said in the message that he was “very hopeful” that the discussions that ended Tuesday could help end a war that has dragged on for 18 years. “We had the kind of talks that have created the opportunity to resolve things and find a solution in the future,” Mullah Baradar said. His message was a window into the internal politics of the Taliban, who are stuck in a deadly stalemate with the Afghan security forces, despite essentially controlling more Afghan territory than at any time since 2001, when the American invasion ousted them from political power. But he provided few details of guarantees on human rights, or whether the Taliban would accept anything less than the return of their oppressive Islamic Emirate that was toppled. His call for his fighters to show humility was also unlikely to quell public concerns considering the Taliban’s history. In their consolidation of power in the 1990s, they resorted to massacres and scorched-earth tactics as they wiped out pockets of resistance. As their talks with the Americans stretched into 16 days behind closed doors, concerns mounted in Afghanistan over what kind of a deal the Trump administration was pushing for. Some Afghans fear that the United States might lose its leverage by accepting a timeline for withdrawing its troops before the Taliban agree to meet with the Afghan government to discuss the country’s political future — which, so far, they have refused to do. Even if the Taliban engage with the government at a later stage, they could be riding the momentum of what they would see as a battlefield victory against the American-led coalition. And the Afghan government would be in a vulnerable position if its international partners had already agreed to leave. Speaking to reporters on Thursday in Washington, Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan president’s national security adviser, sharply criticized American diplomats for leaving the Afghan government in the dark during the peace negotiations. “We don’t have the kind of transparency we should have,” he said, adding that after recent talks the American negotiators delivered only “bits and pieces” of what transpired during the discussions. Washington is “increasing the legitimacy of the Taliban,” Mr. Mohib said. “And decreasing the legitimacy of the Afghan government.” Such concerns were underscored by a recent television interview with the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, who said, with what many considered a triumphalist tone, that the insurgents would see themselves as returning “victorious.” Mullah Baradar tried to ease some of those fears in his message. “Those who come to an understanding with us, and they don’t cheat us or seek enmity, we will treat them like our brothers,” he said. “I am hopeful that all issues will be resolved, the countrymen should not be concerned.” He added: “Nobody has any thoughts of prejudice. It is our Islamic country, and all Afghans should sit together, show respect for each other, and we should have mercy on each other.” Some Taliban fighters and field commanders have a very different concern, fueled by news reports and rumors that their political leaders — many of whom have spent the war away from the battlefield — could compromise on some of their fundamental demands. Many Taliban field commanders, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering their political leaders, said that while they trusted them, they would accept nothing less than a full withdrawal of foreign forces — and soon. Their concerns seem fueled by reports that the United States wants to leave a residual force in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes. “In all these meetings, in all these days, I can’t think of a point or a thought that may have gone against our principles,” Mullah Baradar said, seemingly responding to those fears. As the United States has reduced its troop presence in the past few years, the war’s toll — civilian casualties aside — has fallen on the Afghan forces and the Taliban. That is reflected in the casualty numbers: While a total of more than 100,000 Afghan forces and Taliban are believed to have been killed, the number of coalition deaths stands at a little more than 3,500. “We are making staggering sacrifices in human life to defend not only our country, but also to hold at bay those forces which threaten global security,” Mr. Mohib, the Afghan national security adviser, said. In a sign of the government’s fragility, heavy fighting broke out on Thursday in Mazar-i-Sharif, the largest city in northern Afghanistan, between Afghan special forces sent from Kabul and militiamen and police officers loyal to a former governor, Atta Mohammed Noor. Mr. Noor had threatened violent resistance after President Ashraf Ghani’s government named a new provincial police chief, which Mr. Noor said violated a promise that he would have influence over key appointments. “Afghan security forces are tasked with protecting the Afghan people, not fighting each other over political disputes,” John Bass, a seemingly frustrated U.S. ambassador to Kabul, tweeted in a call for de-esecalation. The possibility that the United States might agree to withdraw troops from Afghanistan just as the war has intensified, and before a comprehensive political settlement is finalized, has raised fears that the war could devolve into revenge-taking and a fight over power once the Americans are gone. Mullah Baradar called on his fighters to show humility, though he also reinforced the idea that the Taliban already see themselves as triumphant. Now that God has “given them victory in political and military fields,” he said, they “shouldn’t resort to ego and pride.” “They should show humility, and show gratefulness to God,” he said. “Instead of a desire for power, they should think about service to Islam and the people.” He added, “My advice to them, my request to them, is that they not be arrogant and grandiose, and they should act in a way with the people as a father would do with their children — with kindness.”",The New York Times
2019,A Taste of Jerusalem in a Chicken Dinner,"Eat One of the great cooking tools is the flattop griddle, a diner standby in shimmering black, best friend to tacos and short-order eggs. You can make a dozen smashed lamb chops on one, huge piles of hash browns, stacks of pancakes, French toast, arepas, buttery trout fillets, mounds of chopped cheese. You can make six burgers at once, and brown the buns for serving them alongside, then scrape the deck and sauté apples for dessert afterward, a topping for ice cream. A long time ago, in a fit of camp ambition, I bought a portable flattop griddle with raised edges on three sides and a grease trap along the other. I put it in a storage chest with a briefcase-size foldable propane two-burner stovetop and a canvas roll of knives and kitchen implements, and slid the thing into the back of my car. The plan was to take this box camping, put it in canoes and boats and travel into the wilderness to cook, or at any rate haul it out of the trunk at tent sites off the Interstate and make my family dinner: sausages and griddled peppers. This didn’t work out as well as I’d imagined. The box weighed a lot. The griddle was hard to clean in the wild. And if the pancakes I made one morning in a tiny boat anchored near the mouth of Long Island Sound were fluffy and delicious, the rain and salt wind that hammered us the rest of the day led to rust on both the cooking surface and the burners of the stovetop, a cycle that repeated itself on shore and in the woods until it ultimately killed the whole apparatus. But not the griddle. I took it inside, scoured it clean, greased it and put it on top of my kitchen range. It has mostly lived there since, a platform for quesadillas and minute steaks, gaining character and nonstick qualities along the way. I’ve found that one of its best uses is for making Jerusalem mixed grill, a dish that is said to have emerged from the Mahane Yehuda Market in that holy city: chicken offal and scraps of meat griddled with baharat, a warm Middle Eastern spice blend that generally includes cinnamon and allspice, coriander, black pepper, cardamom and cloves, and mixed with caramelized onions. It is a rich mixture without being fatty, and is economical to boot, utilizing parts of a chicken that remain cheap no matter how expensive the rest of the bird. Of course you don’t actually need a griddle to cook it. It’s just more fun that way, wielding a big spatula to mimic the market cooks. My recipe is adapted from Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook, the Philadelphia restaurateurs whose 2018 cookbook, “Israeli Soul,” is an invaluable guide to making Israel’s most beloved street foods and restaurant dishes at home. They mix chopped chicken thighs in with the hearts and livers, but as Solomonov said when I called him to talk about the dish, mixed grill doesn’t require the use of offal. “I like a little funk in there,” he said, “but I get it if you don’t like that, if it freaks you out.” So omit the livers if you like. Leave out the hearts. “The dish is as much about the spicing anyway,” Solomonov said. “And chicken thighs take that spice well.” Me, I like a few hearts in the mix, a couple of livers too, some textural contrast to the crunch-luscious quality of the chicken itself. I think that’s worth trying even if you haven’t cooked with livers much, even if you haven’t had any in years, at home or in restaurants. There’s something fantastic about how their creaminess falls in with the sweetness of the onions, how the hearts bring a faint iron tang to the dish. It is genuinely exciting, against the warm heat of the spice. You can serve mixed grill mounded onto a drift of hummus, as you might spoon a thick ragù on top of polenta. I’ve put it on a plate beside a salad. Solomonov likes it as they do at the market in Jerusalem. “Eat mixed grill in a pita,” he told me. “Eat it with some onion and tehina and a pickle, and it’s so satisfying. It’s a taste of Jerusalem at the end of the night.” Recipe: Jerusalem Grill cooking",The New York Times
2019,A Taste of Lebanon via Paris,"City Kitchen This common Middle Eastern flatbread, topped with olive oil and za’atar, can be enjoyed at home, not just at the markets where it’s served. My introduction to Lebanese street food was at an outdoor market in Paris, when I had just moved there in the early days of the 21st century. As I would learn, Lebanese savory treats are common at Parisian markets, a great boon to the hungry shopper. You get to the market by 10 a.m., when everything is fresh, glistening and appealingly displayed. After perusing the offerings and filling your bag with the produce that will be dinner, you may feel a bit peckish. Then you notice the aroma of little flatbreads wafting from a hot griddle, and you head to the Lebanese stand. The typical griddle for baking these flatbreads is a superheated iron dome called a saj. The baker rolls out a thin round of soft dough and quickly slaps it against the hot iron. The flatbread, flipped once, cooks for a few minutes until lightly browned and pliable. Then, still warm, it is brushed generously with the Middle Eastern spice blend called za’atar, which is mixed with olive oil to make a paste. It is a pleasure to eat one of these breads, called ma’noushe, whether at the market, or on the way home. An ancient mixture, za’atar normally contains a few types of wild thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt. The combination is extremely satisfying: The wild thyme is herbal, the sumac sour and the sesame nutty, and there’s just enough salt to make it the perfect seasoning for any number of ingredients and dishes. You can find authentic za’atar at Middle Eastern groceries or online spice merchants. (Or make a version at home, using toasted sesame seeds, dried thyme, marjoram and oregano, adding sumac and salt to taste.) The mixture can vary greatly throughout the Levant. Lebanese, Syrian, Jordanian and Israeli za’atar differ in color and pungency, depending on the balance of wild thyme to sumac, and other spices, like cumin or fennel seed, are sometimes added. A simple way to enjoy za’atar is sprinkled on fresh bread that has been dipped in fruity olive oil, but it’s easy to make za’atar flatbreads. I call for baking them on a sheet pan, but you could use a pizza stone or hot cast-iron skillet, or cook them on a charcoal grill. For a grander version without much more effort, you can make a meaty topping with spiced ground lamb that is briefly cooked with sautéed onions. Baked on a za’atar-dabbed dough with crumbled feta and a few pine nuts, it’s a bit more pizza-like. As your kitchen fills with the scent of savory baking, you can daydream about a trip to Beirut, with a stopover in Paris. Recipe: Lamb Flatbread With Za’atar This savory Middle Eastern dish calls for a juicy red with lively acidity, which will both refresh and cleanse the palate after each sip. Any number of wines match this description, starting with old favorites like Beaujolais or barberas from the Piedmont region of Italy. You could try a younger Rioja, labeled crianza, a less-expensive Ribeira Sacra from northwestern Spain or a Portuguese red from the Bairrada region. You could also try some of the fascinating wines from the Canary Islands. Don’t want a red? Dry rosés will go well with this dish. Try any from the Mediterranean. For a radical departure, why not a good retsina? This traditional Greek wine, flavored with pine resin, exists to go with food like this.
