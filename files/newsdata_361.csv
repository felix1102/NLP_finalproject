2018,One African Nation Put the Brakes on Chinese Debt. But Not for Long.,"DAKAR, Senegal — The new international airport in Sierra Leone was supposed to be a shiny welcome center for travelers — a symbol showing that after a devastating civil war and an Ebola epidemic, the nation was finally open for business. But last month, the government decided that the multimillion-dollar price tag was too high, so it canceled the financing that made construction possible: a more than $300 million loan from China that Sierra Leone might have struggled to repay. President Julius Maada Bio was soon hailed by analysts for putting the brakes on a project that could have deeply indebted his nation, already one of the poorest in the world. It seemed that Sierra Leone was heeding the hard-earned lessons of other developed nations that have found themselves owing enormous amounts to China. Yet only a few days after his announcement about scrapping the deal, Mr. Bio appeared on state-owned Chinese television to make clear that he was not backing away from China after all. In fact, he was seeking its help to build a more than $1 billion bridge, and was also open to renegotiating the airport loan. “We are a developing nation,” Mr. Bio told the interviewer, “and we look forward to nations that want to help us develop.” Across sub-Saharan Africa, governments like Sierra Leone’s are opting to overlook glaring examples of developing countries teetering toward economic distress after borrowing heavily from China. Forty percent of countries in the region are close to falling into debt crisis, the International Monetary Fund has cautioned. And many of those are still seeking loans from Beijing for help to finance airports, highways, railways, dams and power projects. The warning signs of taking on too much debt from China appear across the globe, as in Sri Lanka, where after struggling to make their payments, officials recently turned over to China a port and 15,000 acres of land for 99 years. But Chinese-backed ventures have also hit snags in Africa. Kenya has now borrowed far more from China than from any other country. But it has also come to depend on a flood of Chinese manufacturing imports, a trade imbalance that makes it harder to raise foreign currency to pay off debt. Kenya’s trade with China has grown eightfold in the past decade, according to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who complained at a conference this month in Shanghai that the trade was skewed in favor of China. The monetary fund has flagged Djibouti, site of a large Chinese military base with live-fire exercises in the desert, as having potential problems with mounting debt, most of which is owed to the Chinese government’s Export-Import Bank, according to a report this year from the Center for Global Development. Yet Djibouti shows no signs of limiting new borrowing for projects, and it’s unclear whether these will earn enough revenue to pay off their debts. In Nigeria, Chinese projects have been dogged by accusations of corruption, poor decision-making, and in some cases shoddy construction. Yet the nation is still turning to China to build a coastal railway and myriad other projects. Chinese debt has become “the methamphetamines of infrastructure finance: highly addictive, readily available, and with long-term negative effects that far outweigh any temporary high,” according to a recent article by Grant T. Harris, who was President Barack Obama’s White House director for Africa from 2011 to 2015. The added fact that China has flooded African markets with low-cost manufactured goods means that many African factories have been driven out of business, making it harder for African countries to raise the hard currency — mostly dollars — that they need to repay loans from Beijing. China has extended lines of credit to nations rich in natural resources like oil, bauxite, iron and other metals. So even if a resource-rich developing country has trouble repaying its loans for a while, the thinking goes, it can pay with natural resources sooner or later. China also gains politically by extracting promises of support for the Beijing government over Taiwan as a condition of eligibility for a loan. At the China-Africa Forum for Cooperation summit in Beijing this month, China announced that it had set up a $60 billion fund for African infrastructure projects to strengthen ties with the continent. Numerous analysts and experts, including the former secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the monetary fund, have warned nations to be cautious about taking on too much Chinese debt. Angola, the Republic of Congo and Zambia were some of the nations that Moody’s listed this month among the most indebted to Chinese creditors. A report from the financial research company said interest payments in Ghana, Angola, Zambia and Nigeria already absorbed more than 20 percent of government revenue. This month, while speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of using “debt diplomacy” to expand its global influence. But Chinese officials have repeatedly disputed any notion that its loans are creating so-called debt traps for African nations. “On the contrary, cooperating with China helps these countries raise independent development capabilities and levels, and improves the lives of the local people,” said Hua Chunying, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, in a statement responding to Mr. Pence. China has promised to forgive some of its loans to some of Africa’s poorest nations. But it was unclear which countries would benefit, and the promise applied to only interest-free loans. China is strengthening ties in new areas on the continent, specifically in West Africa where it is adding more African countries to the list of nations in its Belt and Road initiative, which envisions major infrastructure projects backed by the Chinese government around the world. One of the new Belt and Road countries is Senegal, which was part of President Xi Jinping’s four-country visit to the continent this summer. During a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Senegal’s growing capital city, Mr. Xi handed keys to a new wrestling stadium built by the Chinese to President Macky Sall. Across the country, billboards line the roads touting Mr. Sall’s “Emerging Senegal” plan to transform the economy with a new city, a new commuter rail link and other projects. Chinese loans are paying for a highway to the city of Touba and part of an industrial park. The agreements benefit both governments. Mr. Sall is facing re-election next year and eager for his vision to be completed. And Senegal, along Africa’s westernmost coast, is of particular geographical importance to China as a base for manufacturing and exports. The same is true on the opposite side of the continent, in Mozambique, where Chinese loans are paying for bridges and numerous other projects. It’s part of a plan to double down on places that have strategic importance, said Anna Rosenberg, sub-Saharan Africa director at Frontier Strategy Group, an emerging markets advisory firm. “For Africa this is not a bad thing,” she said. “They need the infrastructure. They can’t wait for aid to come from the West. They need it fast, and the Chinese government has realized that.” For nations like Sierra Leone that are eager to put years of political instability behind them, the lure of Chinese deals can be irresistible. With more than half of the population living under the poverty line and an economy struggling to get back to the levels reached before the Ebola outbreak, it has few other options. During his election campaign, Mr. Bio decried the new airport project, calling it a “sham that is clouded with secrecy” and unnecessary for a nation that had no more than 40,000 travelers passing through each year. The monetary fund had also warned against the deal. Canceling the loan was one of the first major moves Mr. Bio made after taking office this year. But on Chinese television, Mr. Bio backpedaled, explaining that he was negative about only the terms of the airport deal, and that the cancellation wasn’t intended as a sweeping indictment of dealing with China. He went on to praise a Chinese health center and other aid the nation has given to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is home to one of the largest iron ore deposits in the world and its economy is dominated by a China-backed mining project that exports ore for use in Chinese steel mills. Government officials declined to comment on plans for more loans from China. Analysts caution that African governments need to get better at negotiating loans with China, taking care to haggle over interest rates and adding clauses requiring full-time employment for local citizens. “The Chinese seem to know what they want from Africans, in particular when it comes to commodities,” said Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, a former member of the Senegalese government who scrutinized deals between China and Senegal. “The question is, is that the same for Africans?”",The New York Times
2018,"One Building, Three Looks","The High End A new condominium in Long Island City has sections that feature distinct architectural styles: industrial metal, old-school brick and curtain wall glass. New York buildings come in a variety of architectural styles, but typically each building has just one. A condominium under construction in Long Island City, though, will bring three styles into a single project. Named Galerie and designed by ODA New York for Adam America, the 11-story complex on Jackson Avenue, directly across from MoMA P. S. 1, will reference building types found throughout the Queens neighborhood. Concrete-framed sections of the facade have factory style windows that hark back to the steel versions on the area’s 19th-century industrial plants. Sections with more traditional punched-out windows are brick, like the older portion of P.S.1. And a curtain-wall component at the top of the complex resembles the glassy structures prevalent across the city today (and provides unfettered views of the Manhattan skyline). The segments fit together like puzzle pieces, giving the large, 182-unit project the feel of a cluster of smaller buildings and thus bringing a more modest scale to an area that has seen its share of looming, straight-up towers. “Long Island City almost has a desperate craving for a sense of community and character,” said Eran Chen, ODA’s founder and executive director. Mr. Chen knew about the site — which borders the Sunnyside rail yard — long before he got the commission. He had already designed a rental building on the same block. Dvir Cohen Hoshen, co-founder of Adam America, admired that building — an 11-story tower with boxy segments that jut out from the facade, creating terraces for the apartments above them — and asked ODA to design a condo version of it that would fill out the block. Instead, Mr. Chen came up with his three-styles-in-one design, which has an H-shaped footprint. The south-facing opening in the H will become a grassy courtyard, with ground-floor amenities, including an indoor pool, looking out onto the green space. Paris Forino, the interior designer for the project, is adding drama to this level with muscular arches in warm white oak. The building’s name and certain features, like a display window for a rotating selection of paintings, prints and sculpture, play off the project’s proximity to P. S. 1 and the many artists’ studios in the area. Long Island City, which offers an easy commute to Midtown Manhattan on public transportation and which will soon become home to an Amazon headquarters, has been evolving as a residential community. Many buildings that went up after a 2001 rezoning were high-rise rentals. Now condominium projects are being added to the residential mix. Galerie’s apartments — two-thirds of them are one- and two-bedrooms — went on sale in February, and over 30 percent are now in contract, according to Halstead Property Development Marketing, which is handling sales. The complex has been attracting renters in the area who are ready to graduate to homeownership, according to Brendan Aguayo, a managing director at Halstead. Galerie is luring out-of-towners, too. Buyers from New Jersey are making “a strong showing,” according to Mr. Aguayo, who had a 3D-printed map of the area made for the sales gallery to help outsiders get to know the neighborhood. Although condos elsewhere in the city have long offered finish options — buyers often get to choose from a “dark” or “light” palette for kitchen cabinetry, for instance — this may be the first time a project offers window options (all with special sound-buffering glazing to address the noise from Jackson Avenue and the rail yards). Modernists may gravitate to units in the section with glass curtain walls, for instance. Or that’s the theory anyway. According to Mr. Aguayo, buyers are focusing less on the window styling and more on apartment size, layout and, of course, price. Apartments range from $550,000 for a studio to $2,550,000 for a three-bedroom penthouse. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,One Conference Is Working the System to Get More Teams in the N.C.A.A. Tournament,"When fans of Conference USA men’s basketball teams look at their schedules for the coming season, they will see a curious twist in February: The dates of the games are set, but not the opponents. It is part of a new, innovative approach designed to finally get the conference an elusive second N.C.A.A. tournament bid. Conference USA, a Division I league made up of 14 teams in the South, has had a pretty remarkable run of success in recent years — in the last four N.C.A.A. tournaments, its teams have knocked off two, three, four and five seeds. But despite that, the league remains stubbornly disrespected by the selection committee. For the last six years it has earned just a single bid annually. It aims to break that cycle this season with the new schedule. Here’s how it works: • Conference USA’s teams will start with a traditional schedule, playing every other team once and a traditional rival twice. But the last four games of the season will be different. • Teams will be broken into three groups after the first 14 conference games. The top group, with the teams in first through fifth place, a middle group of teams 6-10, and a bottom group of teams 11-14. • The teams will then play the others in their group once more each. The result will be a tougher schedule for the top teams, and perhaps a better ranking when the committee meets to pick the N.C.A.A. field. Strength of schedule is always a key factor in the committee’s deliberations. “The knock on our teams has been you don’t have enough top 50 wins, top 100,” said Judy MacLeod, commissioner of Conference USA. “Well, we don’t have an opportunity to play those opponents.” Without those chances, the question becomes, she said, “How can we take our own schedule and make sure our better teams are playing our better teams?” There is a lot of money in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and the more teams a conference gets in, the more money it makes. Conference USA spreads that wealth around, as most other leagues do. So every team would benefit from a second bid if the league were able to get one. Last season, Marshall won the conference’s tournament as the No. 4 seed and earned the N.C.A.A. berth. Middle Tennessee (25-8), Old Dominion (25-7) Western Kentucky (27-11) and three other 20-win teams all had to make do with the N.I.T., or in some cases no tournament at all. The new scheduling may help the teams that do make the N.C.A.A. tournament get better seeding as well. The last four teams to make the tournament from the conference were seeded 12th to 15th. “One of our issues is perception,” MacLeod said. “If our teams had been seeded 7, or 10 even, would they have progressed farther? Maybe the first time, we don’t get another team in, but we get a much better seed. We felt it was worth the chance to try it.” In the end, only four games for each team will be affected by the new schedule, but MacLeod said she believed that might be enough to make a difference. “Just one data point might put one team in over another.” There are pitfalls to leaving holes in the schedule to be filled later, notably travel. Conference USA has teams spread from West Virginia to Texas. Arduous road trips can be eased with careful preseason planning. But no one will know where they will be traveling in mid-February until the last minute. The conference plans to take a one-week break before the bonus games begin to try to find the best sequence of games. While teams in the top division will be the chief beneficiaries of the new scheduling, McLeod feels that every team could profit from it. “Those last weeks everyone will be playing like teams. There will be more fan engagement. Everyone will be having an opportunity to win.” Even the teams in the bottom group, ranked 11 to 14, who might be thought to face some stigma, will have something to play for. Only 12 teams make the conference tournament, and the last four games among that group should be crucial for determining those berths. The conference tournament will be mostly unchanged, but teams in the top group will not fall below a 5 seed, since it would hardly be fair for a top team to lose to several tough teams and fall behind a team with an easier schedule. As for the women, the conference will try a different plan. The full schedule will be set in advance, but each team will play its final games against teams that are expected to have similar records. “We’ll have two different models to evaluate,” MacLeod said. Splitting a league into divisions based on record is mostly unknown in the United States, but is used in some European soccer leagues, Scotland for example. “This is not a cure-all,” MacLeod acknowledged. “We’re not going to magically have four teams in the tournament. We’re looking at innovative ways to enhance our résumés.”",The New York Times
2018,One Constant of the Tennis Season: Mixed Emotions,"On Tennis The official tennis season ended in joy and thinly disguised rage on Sunday in the northern French city of Lille. While Marin Cilic and the Croats celebrated their decisive 3-1 Davis Cup victory, the French player Nicolas Mahut gave David Haggerty, the International Tennis Federation president, an extended piece of his mind as he accepted his second-place prize, still angry at the decision to radically change the format of the men’s team competition next year. Those seriously mixed emotions were an appropriate finish to a season in which tennis had much to celebrate (new stars like Naomi Osaka, enduring stars like Roger Federer and Serena Williams) but also much to lament as its governing bodies failed repeatedly to find common ground. The sports’ leaders need to do better quickly in a brutally competitive global entertainment landscape where only full-strength events seem able to leave much of a trace. Men’s tennis was not quite at full roar in 2018: Andy Murray, who finished No. 1 in 2016, played only a handful of matches as he struggled to recover from hip surgery. The oft-injured Juan Martín del Potro had his most consistently successful season in nine years, only to fracture his right kneecap in Shanghai in October. Rafael Nadal, 32, missed significant chunks of the season with various injuries and had to retire midmatch at the Australian Open and the United States Open. But he still won five of the nine tournaments he did play, including the French Open for the 11th and likely not final time. In the end, the top of the rankings had a throwback look. Novak Djokovic, 31, finished No. 1 after a resurgent in second half of the year in which he won Wimbledon and the United States Open. Nadal finished No. 2, and Federer, 37, finished No. 3 despite again skipping the clay-court season. Those three enduring champions, who again hoarded the Grand Slam loot in 2018, were also the top three men in the rankings as far back as 2007. And they finished in exactly the same ranking order as recently as 2011. “What’s amazing to me is that they have been so successful in such a tough era where the professionalism in tennis had gone way beyond anything we’ve seen before,” said Darren Cahill, a longtime coach and analyst. “A lot of that is because of the money in the sport now and because everybody has the capability of putting a good team around them. Players are taking care of every aspect, ticking every box you can possibly tick, and yet these three guys have been able to dominate.” In a New York Times poll this month of ATP players, coaches and leading analysts, Djokovic, Nadal and Federer dominated the voting on the best shots in the game. Perhaps most remarkable: They finished 1-2-3 in the movement category despite all three being in their 30s. “That’s a tribute to how much emphasis they put on looking after their greatest asset, and that’s their body,” Cahill said. “If you look at all three of them, they haven’t made many changes in their strength and fitness teams throughout the course of their careers. They have had a lot of stability.” Seven of the year-end top 10 are in their 30s, including 32-year-old South African Kevin Anderson and 33-year-old American John Isner, who both joined that elite group for the first time. Kei Nishikori, one of the game’s great ball strikers, also made a remarkable comeback from a major wrist injury to finish the year at No. 9 at age 28. But there were hints of an overdue generational shift. And if you consider the top 20, there are six players 23 or younger: Alexander Zverev, Karen Khachanov, Borna Coric, Kyle Edmund, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev. In all, the number of men in the top 100 age 30 or older dropped to 33 in 2018 from a record 43 last year. Zverev, who now has the redoubtable Ivan Lendl on his coaching team, remains the undisputed leader of the new wave after winning the ATP Finals this month by defeating Federer and Djokovic back to back. But Zverev, ranked No. 4 at age 21, should have plenty of competition from his own generation. Khachanov, Coric and Tsitsipas are players of different styles who share the potential to win the biggest titles. Khachanov, an imposing Russian with one of the heaviest forehands in the game, beat Zverev and Djokovic to win the Paris Masters event this month. Tsitsipas beat Djokovic, Zverev and Anderson on his way to the Toronto final this year. Coric, one of the game’s prime defenders but with an increasingly offensive mind-set, beat Federer twice in 2018 and was a key member of the winning Croatian Davis Cup team. For now, the Grand Slam titles that define careers (and earning power) remain the exclusive domain of the veterans. No active ATP player younger than 30 has won one of the four major singles titles, a first in the 50 years of the Open era. The women’s game is in a far different, much less predictable place. Eight different women have won the last eight major singles titles, and five, including Simona Halep and Caroline Wozniacki in 2018, were first-time Grand Slam singles champions. Naomi Osaka won the United States Open in September at 20, defeating Williams in straight sets in a final where Osaka’s nerveless brilliance was drowned out by Williams’s disputes with the chair umpire Carlos Ramos. For the first time since 2006, Williams, 37, failed to win a tournament, but it was impossible to consider her comeback season from childbirth anything but a success. She also reached the Wimbledon final and won three rounds at the French Open impressively before withdrawing with a pectoral injury. If Williams can stay healthy, she still has a fine chance to win another major and equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. But Williams had best not tarry. Her older sister Venus faltered in 2018 after reaching two Grand Slam finals in 2017, dropping to No. 38 in the rankings at age 38. Osaka and other youngsters like 20-year-old Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka have no shortage of power or ambition. Younger talents like Marta Kostyuk, 16; Amanda Anisimova, 17; and Dayana Yastremska, 18, are on the horizon. And with another season over and another very soon to begin, it would be best if tennis’s leaders did not tarry, either. The sport’s divided governance remains the biggest obstacle to growth and a rational, sustainable schedule. Compromise should not be too much to ask. And if there are any doubts about the beauty of rapprochement, the bureaucrats should consider what happened shortly after the Davis Cup final ended. Despite the disappointment, the French team visited the Croatian locker room and offered congratulations, embraces and eventually toasts.",The New York Times
2018,One Family’s Story of Deportation to Mexico,"LENS After Lourdes Salazar Bautista was deported to Mexico, Rachel Woolf captured a family trying to make sense of a life torn between two countries. The threat of deportation has clouded Lourdes Salazar Bautista’s future for some time. She had left Mexico in 1997 to join her husband, Luis Quintana Chaparro, in Denver, where he had moved a decade earlier. Four years later, the couple bought a house in Ann Arbor, Mich., and raised three children there: Bryan, 14; Lourdes (“Lulys”), 16, and Pamela, 20. Ms. Bautista, 50, and Mr. Chaparro, 52, were undocumented but always managed to find work. She earned a living cleaning houses and churches while he took construction jobs. Life was normal, until it wasn’t. In 2010, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Ms. Bautista. She spent 23 days in custody before her lawyer reached an agreement with ICE: She would be allowed to stay in the United States to care for her children — if her husband was deported instead. That compromise granted her a stay of deportation, which she renewed every year. But when the Denver-based photographer Rachel Woolf met the family last year, their world was crumbling for the second time. In March 2017, Ms. Bautista was told that her application would no longer be renewed. She fought the decision for months. But that August, she was deported with a 10-year re-entry ban. Ms. Woolf, 25, heard about Ms. Bautista through a campaign by the volunteer-lead Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights in Ann Arbor. She connected with the family in July 2017 and caught a glimpse of their lives in Michigan before Ms. Bautista returned to Mexico. “Her children are her life, and that’s where she’s hurting the most,” Ms. Woolf said. Ever since the family’s world was upended on that summer day, Ms. Woolf has been photographing them make sense of a life torn between two countries. After receiving a grant from The GroundTruth Project, a nonprofit journalism organization that counts The New York Times among its media partners, she flew to Mexico last year to photograph Ms. Bautista as she was reunited with her husband and adjusted to life in the city of Toluca. Her younger children, Lulys and Bryan, left Michigan in August 2017 to be by her side. And that transition took a toll on them. Bryan had hopes of joining a soccer team at a high school in Ann Arbor, but he hasn’t been able to find a team at school in Mexico. At school, both he and his sister struggled with the Spanish curriculum. They were born and raised in the United States and suddenly had to adapt to life in their parents’ homeland. “They’re kind of straddling these two places and feeling a lot of the changes that come with that,” Ms. Woolf said. Living in Mexico wasn’t easy on Ms. Bautista either: “I returned 20 years later and the situation is worse,” she told Ms. Woolf. “I realize how hard people work to survive here.” After Ms. Woolf’s first trip to Mexico, she received another grant from the Art Works Projects, a Chicago-based human rights group, that allowed her to visit the family again in May. “They’re hurting a lot but they also are so strong,” Ms. Woolf said. “Their family has been torn apart, and they’re still just as loving and as caring as ever.” Lulys spent a year with her brother and parents before deciding to return to Michigan and finish high school. Now she lives with her aunt and uncle in Ann Arbor, not far from her sister Pamela, who’s studying at Michigan State University. Ms. Bautista was heartbroken when Lulys left, but she supported her decision. She wants her children “to see further than the tiny world that I grew up in, for them to become more than what exists here,” Ms. Woolf said. For her, education has always been a priority. But knowing that her daughters are focusing on their studies is a bittersweet relief. “One of her dreams is to also see her two daughters graduate from college and high school,” Ms. Woolf said, “and she’s recognizing that that may not come true.” Ms. Bautista is not done fighting to return to the United States. She plans to apply for a pardon when Pamela turns 21 in 2019. “She has not given up,” Ms. Woolf said. “All she wants is to be reunited with her kids.”",The New York Times
2018,One Killed and Six Injured as Car Slams Into Pedestrians in Manhattan,"A driver trying to park a minivan in Manhattan’s bustling Chinatown careened over a curb and onto a sidewalk Monday night, killing a 56-year-old man and injuring six others, the authorities said. At least two of the injured victims were in critical condition; two others had injuries that were serious but not life-threatening, the police said. Police and fire officials responded to the corner of Canal and Forsyth Streets about 6:47 p.m., where they said that minutes earlier, a 70-year-old man had tried to park a minivan. But in so doing, they said, the man had hit the gas rather than the brakes, and the minivan mounted a curb, smashing two fruit carts and striking several victims. “Terrible car crash,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter late Monday. “A full NYPD investigation is underway. We cannot accept loss of life on our streets as inevitable.” Officials did not immediately release the names of those who were struck, but they said that the driver, Henry Herman of Monroe, N.Y., stayed at the scene and that the crash appeared to have been accidental. Early on Tuesday morning, the Police Department said that Mr. Herman had been arrested and charged with seven counts of failure to yield to pedestrians as well as one count each of failure to exercise due care, unsafe backing of a vehicle and driving on a sidewalk. Both Mr. Herman and a passenger were among the injured but refused medical attention, the police said. About an hour after the accident, a dark minivan remained at rest, half on the sidewalk and half on the street. Directly behind it, a body was covered by a cloth. Jin Lin, 32, said she was walking in the area when the accident happened about 10 feet from her. Ms. Lin said the vehicle backed up very quickly, which surveillance video broadcast by NY1 appeared to confirm. Ms. Lin said that she called 911 but that the deceased victim had “stopped breathing already.” On Twitter, the Police Department asked people to “avoid the area until further notice and expect heavy delays.”",The New York Times
2018,"One Killed, 6 Injured in Fiery Crash on Brooklyn Bridge","[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The driver of a Ford pickup truck traveling on the Brooklyn Bridge rear-ended a Nissan on Wednesday morning, setting off a six-car crash that ignited a fiery explosion and left a 32-year-old man dead, the police said. Firefighters pulled the man, Kristopher Hambas, of Scarsdale, N.Y., unconscious from his vehicle, a Volkswagen, the police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Six others sustained minor injuries, officials said, including the driver of the pickup truck. The bridge was shut down for more than an hour during the morning commute, officials said. Sixty fire and emergency personnel rushed to the scene, where three vehicles were on fire. According to the police, the pickup truck was traveling on the Brooklyn-bound side of the bridge at about 7:15 a.m. when it slammed into a Nissan, causing the car to strike the median. The truck then hit Mr. Hambas’s vehicle, pushing it into a concrete barrier, where it then burst into flames. Mr. Hambas’s car rear-ended a fourth vehicle, which struck a fifth, which then rear-ended a sixth. Dark plumes of smoke billowed from the thick flames, images of which were captured by television helicopter crews and posted on social media by onlookers. Firefighters extinguished the flames shortly after 8 a.m., a Fire Department spokesman said. All lanes on the bridge were reopened by 1 p.m., the authorities said. Justin Kaplan, 30, grew up down the street from Mr. Hambas in Westchester County and had been his best friend since childhood. The two worked together at a tattoo shop in White Plains before Mr. Hambas left to work in the film industry. “It’s still not real, he was like a brother to me and so many,” Mr. Kaplan said. “He was on his way to a film shoot to pursue his dreams. Nobody ever thought it would come to that tragic of an ending.” There were no arrests in the incident, the police said, and the investigation was continuing.",The New York Times
2018,One Legacy of Merkel? Angry East German Men Fueling the Far Right,"EBERSBACH-NEUGERSDORF, Germany — Frank Dehmel was on the streets of East Germany in 1989. Every Monday, he marched against the Communist regime, demanding freedom and democracy and chanting with the crowds: “We are the people!” Three decades later, Mr. Dehmel is on the streets again, older and angrier, and chanting the same slogan — this time for the far right. He won freedom and democracy when the Berlin Wall came down 29 years ago on Nov. 9. But he lost everything else: His job, his status, his country — and his wife. Like so many eastern women, she went west to look for work and never came back. To understand why the far right is on the march again in Germany, it helps to understand the many grievances of its most loyal supporters: men in the former Communist East. The emergence of Eastern Man as a disruptive political force stands as a prime legacy of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 13 years in power. As she prepared Germans last week for her eventual political exit, some noted that, politically at least, her Germany was more divided between East and West than at any point since reunification. No doubt the far right has made gains across Germany. The Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 13 percent of votes in last year’s elections, enough to make it the leading opposition voice in Parliament. It is now represented in every one of the country’s 16 state legislatures. But support for the AfD in the East is on average more than double that in the West. Among eastern men, the party is the strongest political force, with 28 percent having cast their ballots for the AfD last year. Eastern Man, a figure long patronized, pitied or just ignored in the West, is in the process of again reshaping German politics. No one more embodies the frustrations of eastern men — or has been more the object of their ire — than Ms. Merkel, an eastern woman who rose to the pinnacle of power and provides a daily reminder of their own failure. Yet Ms. Merkel never became the ambassador for the East that people yearned for: Living standards in the region still lag those in the West, even after what is perceived as a traumatic economic takeover. Mr. Dehmel calls her a “traitor” and worse. After reunification, Mr. Dehmel recalled, western men in suits and Mercedes-Benzes arrived in his eastern home state of Saxony, soon running businesses, running universities, running the regional government, “running everything.” And that was before more than a million asylum seekers, many of them young men, came to Germany in 2015. “I didn’t risk my skin back then to become a third-class citizen,” said Mr. Dehmel, now 57, counting off the perceived hierarchy on his fingers: “First there are western Germans, then there are asylum seekers, then it’s us.” One-third of male voters in Saxony, where he lives, cast their ballots for the far right last year — by far more than any other place in the country. “We have a crisis of masculinity in the East and it is feeding the far right,” said Petra Köpping, minister for integration in Saxony. When Ms. Köpping took office in 2014, she thought her job was to integrate immigrants. But as hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers began arriving in Germany a year later, a middle-aged white man heckled her at a town-hall-style meeting. “Why don’t you integrate us first?” the man had shouted. That question, which has since become the title of a book written by Ms. Köpping, prompted her to tour her eastern home state and interview dozens of angry men. The disappointed hopes and humiliations of 1989, she found, still fester. Some three million jobs, most of them in traditionally male industries, were lost over two years. The working-class heroes of Socialism became the working-class losers of capitalism. East German men were abandoned by their newly united country practically overnight, Ms. Köpping said: “They are the original left-behinds.” And they were quite literally left behind — by the women. Long before the #MeToo movement, Communism succeeded in creating a broad class of women who were independent, emancipated, often better educated and working in more adaptable service jobs than eastern men. After the wall came down, the East lost more than 10 percent of its population. Two-thirds of those who left and did not come back were young women. It was the most extreme case of female flight in Europe, said Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development, who has studied the phenomenon. Only the Arctic Circle and a few islands off the coast of Turkey suffer comparable male-female imbalances. In large swaths of rural eastern Germany, men today still outnumber women, and the regions where the women disappeared map almost exactly onto the regions that vote for the Alternative for Germany today. “There is a gender element to the rise of the far right that is not sufficiently acknowledged and studied,” Mr. Klingholz said. Only 16 percent of the Alternative for Germany’s registered members are women. And only 9 percent of female voters cast their ballot for the party last year, compared with 16 percent of male voters. The far right is disproportionally male. And so is eastern Germany. There are on average nine women for every 10 men between the ages of 20 to 40 in the former East, statistics from 2015 show. But that average disguises a surplus of women in big cities — and a much starker shortage in smaller towns and rural areas. Chemnitz, the site of far-right riots in late August, has eight women for every 10 men ages 20 to 40. In Weisskeissel, a village near the Polish border, the ratio is three women to five men. In Glaubitz, it is almost one woman to four men. Mr. Dehmel’s hometown, Ebersbach, once a thriving textile hub on the Czech border, lost seven in 10 of its jobs and almost half its population after 1989. Schools were closed and train services cut. To halt the decline it merged with the neighboring town of Neugersdorf. “We lost a generation,” said Verena Hergenröder, the mayor of Ebersbach-Neugersdorf, an independent. 100 miles Pol. Hamburg Berlin Former east-west border Weisskeissel Glaubitz Chemnitz Cologne Ebersbach-Neugersdorf Czech rep. Germany France Munich Austria By The New York Times Unemployment, once over 25 percent, is now below 3 percent. But the region feels less than thriving. Empty dwellings dot residential neighborhoods. The train station is boarded up. One bit of graffiti proclaims: “There is enough love for everyone.” But people here know that is not true. There were two women for every three men ages 22 to 35 when Mr. Klingholz and his team visited in 2007 to make it a case study. That generation is now 11 years older — the core voting age of the Alternative for Germany. Oliver Graf is one of them. Soft-spoken and polite, Mr. Graf works in construction and volunteers for the local fire brigade. He says he hardly knows anyone “who does not vote for the AfD,” the strongest party in town. At 37, Mr. Graf says he is ready to start a family. He has been restoring his own house. But he is single, like several of his male friends. It’s a topic of conversation, he said. As he put it, “it’s hard to meet someone.” The shortfall of women is not visible in everyday life. “Men don’t know it’s there and if you show them the numbers, they’re often surprised,” Mr. Klingholz said. “All they know is that they have trouble finding a partner.” Bernd Noack, a former mayor of Ebersbach, remembers being surprised, too, when he was first confronted with the issue a decade ago. “I didn’t believe it at first,” he said. At the time, he ran the numbers himself. “Twenty-six percent of the young men couldn’t find a wife,” Mr. Noack recalled. Suddenly some things started making sense, he said: the fights over women in discothèques, the barely disguised hostility toward foreign men in the town. Once, a local company had brought 24 young apprentices over from Spain. They were urged to stay away from the nightclubs, Mr. Noack said, code for “staying away from the local women,” he said. The women who have stayed are prominent in public life. Not just the mayor is a woman. The pastor is a woman. One of the few bars open at night, the Brauerei, is run by a woman, too. Her son helps her out. Her daughter, who graduated from high school in 1989, months before the wall came down, moved away and married a western man. Most marriages between easterners and westerners are between eastern women and western men. “The anger of eastern men also has something to do with the success of eastern women,” said Frank Richter, an eastern theologian and prominent thinker. If eastern men dislike Ms. Merkel so viscerally, it is not just because she let in a million asylum seekers, Mr. Richter said, “but because she is so utterly familiar to eastern men and a daily reminder of their own failure.” Ms. Köpping, another successful eastern woman, worries about the rage. Over the past two years she has toured her home state and held regular citizens’ office hours, trying to understand the anger of the men — and it was, she said, almost always men. One of them, a 69-year-old former factory worker, broke down in tears when he recounted how his factory had been closed down, the brand new machines sold to a western German company. Another told her he stopped going to high school reunions because he was too ashamed that, despite multiple retraining programs, he had not found another stable job. A third, who regularly marches with Pegida, an acronym that stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, raged about young male migrants stabbing and raping “our women.” “Most men I met have suffered so many injustices and setbacks, they have lost all self-confidence,” Ms. Köpping said. As of 2015, she added, they also feel threatened by young male migrants, who do not necessarily live anywhere near them, but whose difficult journey proves they are everything eastern men are not — dynamic, determined and driven — “otherwise they would not have made it here in the first place.” Last year, Ms. Köpping got a postcard from one of the men she had met during a Pegida march. “Dear Ms. Köpping,” it read, “if you get me a wife I will stop marching with Pegida.” Mr. Dehmel said he, too, takes the train from Ebersbach to Dresden most Mondays to join the weekly Pegida march. In September, he traveled all the way to Chemnitz to join far-right protests after the death of a German man, allegedly at the hands of two asylum seekers. On a recent afternoon he was buying ammunition for his rifle at the local gun shop. Gunther Fritz, the gun shop owner, who is also single, said it was no coincidence that the slogans on the streets in 2018 are the same ones as in 1989. “We got a sense of power back then, and we’re not going to let anyone take that away from us,” Mr. Fritz said. “The West was handed democracy after the war, we in the East had to get it for ourselves.” “You watch,” he added, “we brought down one system. We can do it again.”",The New York Times
2018,One Museum’s 19th Century Photo Sale Seems to Be the Met’s Gain,"The images date from the 1880s and include early photographs of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Hotel del Monte in Monterey, Calif., and Yellowstone Park. They were all taken by Carleton Watkins, a pioneering photographer of the American West known for his majestic landscapes. After being held for almost 100 years by the Hispanic Society of America, the photographs were sold through Christie’s in a sale finalized last month and appear to be headed as a gift from an unknown donor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “We’re thrilled that they’re going to the Met,” said Mitchell Codding, the director and president of the Hispanic Society, a Manhattan museum dedicated to art from Spain, Portugal and former Spanish colonies. “They stay in New York but also they go somewhere where they’ll be cared for and appreciated.” A Met curator declined to comment on the reported gift but expressed great enthusiasm at the prospect. “These are absolutely stunning works by one of the most important artists of the 19th century,” Jeff Rosenheim, the curator in charge of the Met’s photography department, said in a statement. “It would be a great privilege to have them in The Met’s collection.” The 130 mammoth-plate photographs by Watkins, 67 of which are believed to be unique, date from a period during which Watkins was trying to rebuild his career after losing his studio and negatives to a creditor during a financial crisis. The Met has a keen interest in Watkins’ work and has staged exhibitions of his photographs in 1999 and 2014. It already owns some 250 of his images. “It’s a very big deal both in terms of the Met’s collection of 19th century American art and the Met’s collection of photography,” said Tyler Green, the author of “Carleton Watkins: Making the West American,” (University of California Press) published this month. “In one fell swoop they would be getting around 10 percent of the guy’s high end oeuvre, which is an extraordinary percentage.” In addition to their notable size, 14.5 x 21 inches, the images are also prime examples of the wet-collodion process of creating photographic negatives, a technique that was used less and less frequently in the late 19th century due to the invention of the gelatin process. The Hispanic Society received the photographs in the 1920s from the museum’s founder, Archer Huntington, whose father, the railroad tycoon Collis Potter Huntington, was a friend of Watkins. The photographs had not been exhibited at the museum and were deaccessioned because they were not part of its core mission. Mr. Codding said the sale garnered more than $1 million for the Hispanic Society, whose doors are now closed because the museum is in the midst of two-year renovation expected to cost about $15 million. The Hispanic Society retained one set of the Watkins photographs that came from Mr. Huntington, an album of images of Spanish missions in California, because it is relevant to the society’s mission.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | One Vote, My Vote","letter A reader rejects the idea of voting for the “less terrible” candidate. To the Editor: Re “Election’s Over, Let’s Have a Rant” (column, Nov. 10): Gail Collins writes in response to Green Party candidates in close races, “Even if both candidates in a major election seem terrible, deep in your heart you know one is more terrible than the other.” Voting for the less terrible to prevent the more terrible when you really wanted to vote for someone else is like taking the slow route on the highway to hell. It will take longer, but you will end up at the same place either way. You’ve let the less terrible candidate know that the less terrible things he or she supports are O.K., and you’ve let the candidate you really like know that the positions he supports don’t matter. The most powerful tool we have for political change is our vote. I vote for Green Party candidates because they support my values. Voting for candidates who don’t is wasting my vote.

2018,"Opinion | One Wave, Two Waves, Red Wave, Blue Wave","The conversation Who ever thought midterm elections could be this exciting? Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Gail Collins: Bret, can you remember any other Election Day that was ever like this? With the whole nation so crazy nervous-excited about congressional races? I do not believe in other years I had intense conversations with neighbors about who was going to win the Indiana Senate race. Bret Stephens: The only thing that’s remotely comparable in my memory, Gail, were the 1994 midterms, when Republicans regained control of the House after 40 years in the minority. One reason that election is worth mentioning is that it probably did more to strengthen Bill Clinton’s presidency, after a chaotic first two years, than it did to weaken it. It gave Clinton a useful political foil in the person of Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, and it forced him to compromise on politically popular legislation, like welfare reform. My point, to those of us who want to ensure that Donald Trump is a one-term president, is to be careful what we wish for. Whatever happens on Tuesday isn’t going to decide what happens in 2020. Or am I missing the forest for the trees here? Gail: Depends which forest you’re meandering in. If, as most people presume, the Democrats take the House but Republicans keep the Senate, we’ll see some interesting investigations into the president. I do sorta dream at night of seeing all those tax returns. But you’re right that Trump will try to turn Nancy Pelosi into the new version of immigrant caravans. The Republicans have made her into their all-purpose target already, even when she hasn’t actually had the power to do anything to thwart them. I don’t think we’ve ever really talked about Pelosi. If you were the Democrats, would you replace her or would any new Democratic speaker become the same kind of whipping person? Bret: Pelosi personifies the Democratic Party a lot of people love to hate: wealthy coastal liberals who have been in office forever and cannot imagine why anyone who voted for Trump did so for reasons other than bigotry or imbecility. If she becomes speaker again, Democrats will be materially damaging their chances of defeating Trump in two years. Please, someone else, like Ohio’s Tim Ryan or Massachusetts’ Seth Moulton: Someone who can help win back the millions of voters who went for Barack Obama in 2008 and Trump eight years later. About those investigations: Yes, they might be very interesting. But I tend to doubt we’ll learn anything from them that we won’t eventually find out from Robert Mueller, and whatever he produces will have greater credibility for not being partisan. Also, investigating the past is probably not what’s going to decide the election. Democrats need to put forward an agenda, work with the Trump administration on things like immigration reform and an infrastructure bill, and appeal to a wider cross-section of Americans. The question of Trump’s tax returns is mostly a distraction from that goal. Gail: Yes, of course, you’re right about the agenda. But the evil side of me really, really wants those tax returns. Bret: My evil side wants to outlaw New England sports franchises and zap people who walk too slowly on Manhattan sidewalks as they stare at their smartphones. Gail: On the Pelosi front, I do think the Democrats need new faces. But she deserves a little bit of a run first — I hate the idea of just caving into the Republicans’ demonization of her. Have we discussed the way all of Trump’s regular Democratic targets — except with the perfunctory nod to Chuck Schumer — are women? Does anybody think his tirades about Maxine Waters aren’t playing to the Republicans’ worst strain of racism and sexism? I just got a generic fund-raising letter from Eric Trump’s wife, Lara. (No idea why I’m on her list, but it’s always interesting to hear what the president’s daughter-in-law has to say … ) The message was to send in one last contribution because “we can’t let Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters run the people’s House.” Maxine Waters is ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, for God’s sake. There are a dozen Democrats way more powerful and influential than she is. Bret: Speaking of singling out minorities, one of Trump’s signature election themes — both in this cycle and the last — is the vilification of Latin American migrants. It’s not enough for him and other Republicans to campaign on historically low unemployment and a big jump in annual wage growth. He needs a bugaboo, and the images of the migrant caravan play into his base’s biggest phobias. Did I mention that last week was the 80th anniversary of Orson Welles’s “The War of the Worlds” radio broadcast, featuring an imaginary Martian invasion? Gail: O.K., I really do like that “War of the Worlds” comparison. They’re coming! They’re coming! Bret: The question is whether it will work. I’m hoping it won’t. But my guess is that elections in the United States have now become base plays where the key is to get your people to the polls rather than win over undecided voters. It also doesn’t help that Democrats have barely made an effort to offer their own ideas about the caravan. Health care isn’t the only issue in the world. Gail: There’s also the importance of stopping the Republican agenda. There are only a few things they’re actually capable of passing legislation on — maybe Kindness to Kittens Week, although I’m not even sure that one would get past our pet-phobic president. But one is taxes. Tax reform is fine but all the Republicans can do is cut, which means slashing revenue, adding to the deficit and increasing pressure on important social programs. I realize we are not entirely in accord on this matter. Bret: Tax cuts, I like. Deficits, I don’t mind (as long as there is robust economic growth). But I like the Republic even more, and I’d hate to see Trump’s first two years in office vindicated with wins in both houses of Congress. So I’m prepared to forgo additional tax cuts in the hope, probably vain, that Democrats will be strategic stewards in the House and not give in to the stupid temptation of seeking Trump’s impeachment or getting lost in endless committee investigations about whether Trump misled the I.R.S. 20 or 30 years ago. I’d also love to see the emergence of Democratic presidential contenders who aren’t the same people now auditioning for the role. Gail: Which includes … pretty much everybody. Are you hoping for a governor who hasn’t raised his or her hand? A former cabinet member who’s been working in the library on a new book for the last two years? Tom Hanks? Everybody likes Tom Hanks. Bret: Well, I can think of one former Hollywood actor who turned out to be a great president, so I’m not ruling it out. And as much as Ronald Reagan was hated by progressives, he did a lot to unite the country, which is what we could use now. The hideous anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh, and the resistance of many Pittsburgh residents to Trump even showing up, is another reminder that Trump can’t fulfill even the most basic presidential duty of consoling a wounded nation. We need a Democrat who can address the fact that the United States is in a moral recession even in the midst of an economic boom. Gail: We may be down to Tom Hanks. Bret: Or Michelle Obama. Gail: But seriously, I keep thinking about how we got to Trump, and how Trump got to Trump. He was a guy with virtually no political principles or governmental ideas when he started out. And early on, when you asked him why he was so obsessed with a wall, or why he had apparently changed his mind on abortion and gun control, the answer would invariably be that the crowd went crazy over that. He’s a total creation of the yelling crowds. Sure, he gets huge audiences, because they know he’s going to tell them exactly what they want to hear. And when they roar their approval, it reinforces his determination to do whatever they scream loudest about. I guess the big question is how much the people who come out to howl at his rallies reflect the people who come out to vote. Bret: There’s a side of me that thinks that Trump is a natural culmination for a country that has spent the past 60 years besotted with television, the past 50 with moral relativism, the past 40 with ostentation, the past 30 with the politics of sex, and the past 20 with the politics of fear. He seems to encapsulate all of it. Gail: Don’t forget the internet. And Fox. Bret: But I also think that it’s a mistake to treat him as pure product of the crowd. For all the Democratic talk that the economy blossomed under Obama, there were pockets of the recession that never went away for the eight years of his presidency. It showed up in the large number of discouraged workers, especially those in late middle age, and probably in the opioid crisis. And Trump found a way to speak to that part of the United States in a way that Hillary Clinton never did. The Democrat who can win will be able to do the same. Gail: I agree, and hoping for a Democrat who can speak to all the parts of the country. Or at least most. Speaking of — um, it was elections, right? Any particular one candidate you’re dying to see win/get creamed? Bret: It probably isn’t going to happen, but I’d love to see the Democratic candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, pull off an upset in his Senate race against Marsha Blackburn. He represents the kind of centrism the party could really use. I also like Rhode Island’s Gina Raimondo, a pragmatic Democratic governor, and I’m happy to see Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, having no trouble with his re-election bid. You can probably see where I am here: I tend to like red state Democrats and blue state Republicans, people who by temperament and necessity have to learn to get along with the other side. I think I know what you’re thinking: The country is in crisis, a G.O.P. victory in the House would consolidate a reign of bigotry and ruin — and this guy wants everyone to have a lollipop and be nicer to their neighbors. But after the last couple of years, I think that would be achievement enough. Gail: Totally in favor of the lollipop. Putting in a Hail Mary that somehow the evil racist Steve King loses his seat in Iowa. And that we have another two years of arguing about tax cuts without the danger there will really be any. Happy voting, Bret. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,Online Cancer Information Is Often Unreliable,"The greater the number of views and “likes” a YouTube video on prostate cancer received, the poorer the quality of the information provided tended to be. Many YouTube videos about prostate cancer are unreliable sources of information. Researchers searched YouTube for “prostate cancer screening” and “prostate cancer treatment.” Then they scored the first 75 hits for each phrase, using validated scales to assess such measures as whether the video favored new technology, recommended unproven treatments, accurately described risks and benefits or showed commercial bias. Outdated, biased or inaccurate videos were viewed more than 6.3 million times. About 77 percent contained misinformation, 19 percent recommended unproven alternative medical treatments, and 27 percent had some commercial bias favoring treatments that were expensive and untested. Three-quarters of the videos described the benefits of various treatments, but almost half failed to mention any risks or side effects. The study, in European Urology, also found that the greater the number of views, “likes” and “thumbs up” ratings a video received, the poorer the quality of the information provided tended to be. The lead author, Dr. Stacy Loeb, an assistant professor of urology at New York University, said that one video, viewed by more than 300,000 people, promoted Chinese herbal injections into the prostate, a treatment with no scientific validity. “Don’t believe everything you see online,” she said. “Just because a lot of people like it or view it, doesn’t mean it’s accurate.”",The New York Times
2018,Online Photo Printing for the Holidays (and Any Time),"Want to share photos this holiday season (and other times)? We have recommendations for cards, photo books, and photo printing services. Smartphones have made it easy to share photos with family and friends, but the images are often ephemeral — soon buried in text strings or inboxes. Digital printing services offer evergreen options, from cards to individual prints to curated albums. The best of those services produce images of truly excellent quality. They use fine papers of your choosing, and offer easy-to-use online interfaces that make it simple for you to upload, edit, annotate, and arrange your pictures. They marry the portable, in-the-moment power of smartphone and digital cameras with the permanence and beauty of print. Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products, has a team of photo experts who have tested multiple printing services and enlisted the help of other experts to judge the results. Here’s what they recommend. Of the photo-card services Wirecutter tested, Simply to Impress came out on top. The company offers a range of tasteful, easy-to-customize designs and high-quality photo reproduction, as well as a quick turnaround time that saw cards delivered to Wirecutter’s New York office within a week — packaged in a gift box with a personalized note. Wirecutter editors especially liked the website’s user interface, which presents clearly defined options and a handful of basic but useful image-editing tools. You can upload images straight from your computer or select from images on your social media accounts or cloud photo services. During checkout, the site gives you an itemized list of all the options you selected and links to each so you can check them and, if necessary, edit them again. Back when people paid for prints of every photo they took, it made sense to put all of them into big binders. Now it makes much more sense to create custom photo books of only your best images. A printing service can make as many photo books as you need, for yourself and for gifts. After testing eight photo book services, Wirecutter found that Shutterfly offered the easiest way to create a cleanly designed book, combined with photo quality that was just as pleasing as what we saw from services costing twice as much. Shutterfly’s app has intuitive keyboard shortcuts, which make it easy to design your book. To judge image quality, we brought the Shutterfly book and the others we ordered to Shamus Clisset, a master printer at Laumont Studio who has made fine-art prints for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMA), and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Although Shutterfly’s printing wasn’t perfect, he said it was the best of the services we tested. Commenting on an image of volcanic smoke, he said, “The whole print is very smooth in color, which is hard to do.” Say your cousin falls in love with a picture you took of Grandma sipping a piña colada at the last family reunion, and wants a nice 8-by-10-inch print — but you don’t have a photo printer. Here’s where online print services come in handy. They let you order individual prints and mail them to anybody who wants one. Nations Photo Lab offered the best combination of print quality, fast turnaround time, reliable delivery, and reasonable price in Wirecutter’s tests. The service got high marks on color accuracy and sharpness, and delivered the prints well-protected from damage, tucked into plastic sleeves that were themselves sandwiched between cardboard panels. Nations also made it easier than other services to deal with images of various aspect ratios. Aspect ratio, or the width-to-height ratio of a picture, differs between smartphones (typically 4:3) and the most common digital-camera format (3:2). Nations let us print 4:3 smartphone images in full, without slicing anything off at the top and bottom. The main downside to Nations is that it doesn’t have an app to let you upload images directly from your phone. If you want that option, consider AdoramaPix instead. One last tip: All of the services mentioned here routinely offer coupons or discounts. If you’re planning to use one of them, and if you’re not on a tight deadline, sign up for the service’s email list and wait for a deal to come along. Usually it won’t take more than a week. And what’s an extra week when you’re making memories that will last (almost) forever? A version of this article appears on Wirecutter.com.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Only One Democrat Deserves to Be Speaker,"Nancy Pelosi’s skills are a perfect match for the job, and there is no better choice in the Democratic caucus — it’s not even close. Ms. Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of a book about presidential primaries. Nancy Pelosi cleared the first hurdle in her quest to become speaker of the House of Representatives when the Democratic Caucus voted overwhelmingly to nominate her for that position. The final vote will not come until Jan. 3, when 218 members of Congress will have to vote for the new speaker. Representative Pelosi will need 218 Democratic votes. Yesterday, 32 Democrats voted no on her nomination. So between now and 2019, Ms. Pelosi has some work to do. But the simple fact is, at the moment, there is no one in the Democratic caucus better for the job. And it’s not even close. The primary role of a legislative leader has rarely been to serve as the “face” of the party. She is not running for president. It is instead the unglamorous and complex job of making some subset of 435 individual political entrepreneurs come together in the name of a political party. Ms. Pelosi has already said that she’d give others the spotlight when it came to the public part of the job. In the past, she has not been a regular on TV news shows, including the prestigious Sunday shows. Since 2007, when she became speaker of the House, she has had a couple of chances to give the response to the president’s State of the Union address, one of the most coveted television spots in politics, but she took neither one. Those spots went to two men: Senator Jim Webb of Virginia in 2007 and, in 2018, Representative Joseph Kennedy III of Massachusetts. Even her detractors say that she’s best at one of the most critical, if not most critical, roles of speaker, which is to court votes and count votes. Counting is a lot more complicated than conducting a survey. It involves understanding the political challenges of each and every member of Congress and then devising a legislative package that can pass. Sometimes this entails compromise; sometimes this entails structuring the vote so that a member can cast a vote against an amendment and sometimes this entails allowing a member to vote against their party — if it already has the votes to prevail. Ms. Pelosi has shown her toughness over and over. For instance, in 2005, she played a central role in the battle against privatizing Social Security. For the Affordable Care Act, she united both the left and right wings of her caucus. Later, as minority leader, she managed to keep the caucus together enough to prevent the Republican Congress from chipping away at Obamacare. Like Lyndon Johnson, a Senate majority leader who eventually rose to the presidency, Ms. Pelosi is a machine politician with a progressive bent. To court votes, an effective legislative leader cannot stick to an overtly ideological line. If she were rigid, she wouldn’t be able to hold together a caucus that consists of conservative “blue dogs” and “democratic socialists.” Finally, a speaker has to be able to win majorities. In the midterms, Ms. Pelosi and her leadership partner Steny Hoyer of Maryland were a very big part of the reason that the party gained at least 39 seats. Mr. Hoyer recruited and campaigned with candidates from the purple or red districts where Ms. Pelosi was viewed as too liberal. She helped raise the millions to make it all happen. They both imposed a stern message of discipline on their candidates, downplaying talk of impeachment and focusing Democrats on pocketbook issues like health care. Ms. Pelosi will need to convince about 17 Democrats to vote with her. In tough districts in the midterms, some Democrats promised to vote against Ms. Pelosi if elected. Having won, they now find themselves between a rock and a hard place; voting against the overwhelming favorite in the caucus (who also happens to be a woman in a year where women gave Democrats the majority) is a surefire way to make yourself unpopular and ineffective internally. But reversing a promise to your voters in your first act in office is a surefire way to make you look like a shady politician if ever there was one. The irony here is that while Democratic candidates were being pressured into the anti-Pelosi faction, Republicans were bemoaning the fact that all the time and money spent on demonizing Ms. Pelosi was a waste that could have been better spent talking about the good economy. Holdouts will be confronted with a lot of pressure to show unity in the opening of the new Democratic Congress. If I had to bet, we’ll be saying “Madam Speaker” for the second time in American history. Elaine C.

2018,"Only Romaine Lettuce From Central and Northern California Is Unsafe, F.D.A. Says","WASHINGTON — It’s O.K. to eat romaine lettuce again, federal health officials said on Monday — as long as you’re sure it wasn’t grown on California’s north and central coast. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said investigators had traced the romaine lettuce associated with an outbreak of E. coli that has sickened 65 people in 12 states and Canada to “end of summer” romaine lettuce harvested from that region. With the growing and harvesting season over there, according to the F.D.A., people may eat romaine lettuce that has been hydroponically or greenhouse grown, or has been harvested from the winter growing desert regions of the United States, and is labeled such. “If it does not have this information,” the agency said in a statement posted on its website, “you should not eat or use it.” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that, to protect consumers, the industry had agreed to label romaine lettuce with the harvest date and region. “The F.D.A. also has commitments from the romaine lettuce industry that such labeling will continue into the future and become standard for their products,” Dr. Gottlieb said. The labels may be extended to other leafy greens, he said. The agency’s announcement follows a stern warning issued two days before Thanksgiving, by the Centers for Disease Control, telling consumers nationwide not only to stop eating romaine lettuce, but also to scrub and sanitize drawers or shelves where it has been stored. Stores were told to pull all romaine from their shelves, and restaurants were ordered to stop serving it. The E. coli outbreak was first identified on Oct. 8, and the onset of the last reported illness was Oct. 31, according to the F.D.A. The agency said that 43 people had become sick in 12 states, and an additional 22 people in Canada also became ill. Federal investigators believe that the E. coli strain, known as O157:H7, causing the outbreak resembles the one that caused an outbreak in the fall of 2017 in the United States and Canada. The C.D.C. has said that these cases are genetically unrelated to another E. coli outbreak earlier this year that killed five people and sickened 200. That bacteria came from a tainted drainage canal near an Arizona lettuce farm, investigators said. The F.D.A. said there was no reason to believe that the romaine lettuce being grown in other large growing regions, including the California desert region of the Imperial Valley; the desert region of Arizona in and around Yuma; and Florida, would be contaminated. Romaine lettuce imported from Mexico should also be safe, the agency said. It suggested that last week’s warning had rid the country of any tainted lettuce. “The F.D.A. believes it was critically important to have a clean break in the romaine supply available to consumers in the U.S. in order to purge the market of potentially contaminated romaine lettuce related to the current outbreak,” Dr. Gottlieb said. “This appears to have been accomplished through the market withdrawal request of Nov. 20.” The F.D.A. has urged growers, processors and sellers to label all individually packaged romaine products to identify the region and harvest date. If heads of romaine are being sold unwrapped, retailers are expected to prominently label the produce display, Dr. Gottlieb said. The commissioner also said that the industry would establish a task force to adopt standards for traceability of its products, as well as to determine how to stop future outbreaks.",The New York Times
2018,"Onscreen, Women Are Giving Patriarchy the Pink Slip","When the #MeToo movement catapulted into the mainstream more than a year ago, survivors around the globe felt more emboldened than ever before to break their silence about sexual abuse at the hands of men. Their stories not only censured the much-deserving perpetrators but also led to a reckoning about gender inequality and misogyny that continues to galvanize society. So much so that we have embraced a new phase of the movement that is redirecting the focus to the women — like Mira Sorvino, Gabrielle Union and Padma Lakshmi — who have stepped out of the shadows of problematic men and reclaimed control of their narratives in fascinating new ways. And now, film and TV have begun to reflect that same shift toward radical female entitlement. Take “House of Cards.” You may recall that the Netflix series’s sixth and final season, now streaming, was at first thrown into turmoil after its male lead, Kevin Spacey, was accused of making an unwanted sexual advance in 1986 toward the actor Anthony Rapp, who was only 14 at the time. As a result, Spacey (who issued an apology to Rapp and said he would be seeking treatment) was fired from the show and his character, the ruthless President Frank Underwood, was killed off. These events took place after Season 5, when Underwood had resigned to take a more behind-the-scenes role (so his many offenses could remain hidden). His wife, Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), cunning and manipulative in her own right yet long suffering under her husband’s oppressive ego, found herself in position to seize the presidency. Even though Claire’s master plan had always been to become president, the fact that she continues on this path in Season 6 — without a man trying to pull the strings — is considered an intolerable act of defiance to Frank’s staff, which remains in place even though Claire is in charge. And like life imitating art, “House of Cards” fans and critics alike voiced concerns about how, quite literally, the show would go on without Spacey — and whether it should. The series’s bold final season has obliterated all those doubts. But first, Claire has to contend with that male-dominated staff, which, from the moment she steps up, makes it clear that it does not trust her authority and does everything possible to get rid of her, even conspiring to have her assassinated. So she devises a plan of her own to remove each one and is equally cutthroat and unapologetic. Although she effectively gives the patriarchy the pink slip by installing an all-female cabinet, she’s still castigated for simply being a woman exerting power — something for which Frank would have been heralded. “Francis was a son of a bitch, but he was a talented son of a bitch,” says the lobbyist Bill Shepherd (Greg Kinnear), one of Claire’s biggest antagonists, implying that her talent remains to be seen and her malice is more self-serving than anything else. Because Claire’s ascension followed Frank’s death, her opponents determine that it is ungrounded, forcing her to work twice as hard just to be taken seriously as a potential threat. But if there is anything this final season has confirmed, it is that “House of Cards” has always been perfectly set up for Claire’s shrewd supremacy. Some people were just too busy watching the other guy to notice. [What to know before watching Season 6 of “House of Cards.”] How women’s competence has been categorically underestimated and undermined by toxic men, including their own spouses, is also a major impetus for the action in “Widows.” The Steve McQueen-directed crime drama follows three women — Veronica, Linda, and Alice (played by Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, and Elizabeth Debicki) — whose lives are upended after their husbands die robbing the nefarious Manning brothers (portrayed by Brian Tyree Henry and Daniel Kaluuya). The Mannings want their money back, and, armed with the knowledge that these widows had nothing to do with their husbands’ blood business, come barreling into their lives, confident that they can threaten them into accommodating their demands. But what the brothers aren’t prepared for is that the women, terrified as they may be at first, are willing to go through with what would have been their husbands’ next heist. These widows aren’t superheroes. They’re not trained vigilantes who carry weapons and run up on people inside their homes. These women are people you know who have lost children and businesses and are consistently reminded of their insignificance by men who claim they love them — to the point that they had been reduced to mere transactions. Veronica is fueled by grief and helplessness after the wrongful death of her son at the hands of the police. Linda is a mother desperate to rewrite her story so she is no longer the wife who watched as her overbearing husband tanked her business and left her with a pile of debt. Alice wants to prove that she is worth more than the cheap sex for which too many men have used her. These are women on the periphery who are fighting the very basic and routine battle for a seat at the table. They refuse to be bullied by men any longer, and now that they’re pushed against the wall, they’re forced to react in ways outside of what is expected of them — incited by their own fury, untapped tenacity and fear of what can happen to them if they don’t fight back. Ultimately, they become fully realized characters who reciprocate the intimidation and menace that have been used against them. But for them, it’s about finally being seen as more than trinkets who can be disregarded in a world that was not built with their value in mind. It’s about being counted — and if that has to be through brute aggression at this point, so be it. [Read an interview with Viola Davis and her “Widows” director, Steve McQueen.] Though Claire Underwood and the women of “Widows” fall into their power and have to fight tooth and nail to hold on to it, they’re not the only women onscreen this year reasserting their value. The eponymous heroines of two other recent movies, “Mary Shelley” and “Colette,” hack through patriarchal society on their own terms — in the 19th and 20th centuries, no less. The two budding literary masters are expected to sit idly by as their husbands appropriate their greatest, most personal works, because that is their place — eclipsed by men even in their own stories. But they soon rebel against this condition. The “Frankenstein” novelist Shelley (Elle Fanning) goes as far to leave her husband, Percy (Douglas Booth), and demand a public retraction after he tries to convince her that his name on a book so dark is more credible than her own. Colette (Keira Knightley) confronts both her philandering husband, Willy (Dominic West), and gender norms by becoming just as popular in ladies’ bedrooms as he is while using her virility to reclaim authorship of her famous Claudine novels. These characters tackle systems of oppression in their own homes, at work and on the streets, and underscore how fundamentally capable and deserving they are without men setting the terms. They’re moving outside the limits put in place by patriarchs, and occupying spaces from which they’ve been dismissed. As a result, they’re taking back what has always been rightfully theirs: the voices that were stripped from them and the power they’ve now clenched. It’s about time.",The New York Times

Scroll down and click to play any episode. Russia’s meddling in the United States’ elections is not a hoax. It’s the culmination of Moscow’s decades-long campaign to tear the West apart. “Operation InfeKtion” reveals the ways in which one of the Soviets’ central tactics — the promulgation of lies about America — continues today, from Pizzagate to George Soros conspiracies. Meet the KGB spies who conceived this virus and the American truth squads who tried — and are still trying — to fight it. Countries from Pakistan to Brazil are now debating reality, and in Vladimir Putin’s greatest triumph, Americans are using Russia’s playbook against one another without the faintest clue. We reveal how one of the biggest fake news stories ever concocted — the 1984 AIDS-is-a-biological-weapon hoax — went viral in the pre-internet era. Meet the KGB operatives who invented it and the “truth squad” that quashed it. For a bit. The Pizzagate playbook: same tactics, new technologies. How the seven rules of Soviet disinformation are being used to create today’s fake news stories. Governments from Pakistan to Mexico to Washington are woefully unequipped to combat disinformation warfare. Eastern European countries living in Russia’s shadow can teach us how to start fighting back, but only if our politicians decide to stop profiting from these tactics and fight them instead.

2018,Orban and His Allies Cement Control of Hungary’s News Media,"BERLIN — Hundreds of private Hungarian news outlets have been simultaneously donated by their owners to a central holding company run by people close to the far-right prime minister Viktor Orban, cementing Mr. Orban’s grip on the Hungarian news media. If approved by the country’s regulatory authorities, which are led by an official appointed by Mr. Orban, the deal will place most leading private Hungarian outlets under the control of a single, state-friendly entity, in a move that is unprecedented within the European Union, according to Freedom House, a global rights watchdog that analyzes press freedom. It is the latest broadside against pluralism under the increasingly autocratic Mr. Orban. Since taking power in 2010, he has steadily chipped away at Hungary’s checks and balances, stacking the Constitutional Court with loyalists, reshaping the electoral system to favor his party and placing dozens of watchdog institutions — including the judiciary and prosecution service — under the leadership of his allies. In coordinated announcements on Wednesday, more than a dozen media owners declared the transfer of — or intention to transfer — over 400 news websites, newspapers, television channels and radio stations to the Central European Press and Media Foundation, a group founded in August that had previously played little role in the Hungarian media. Most of the owners, pro-government business moguls, said they would receive no compensation for the properties. The chairman of the foundation is a former lawmaker from Mr. Orban’s party, court records show. Its two other board members are Mr. Orban’s personal lawyer and the head of a research group that strongly supports Mr. Orban. The deal is largely symbolic, since the transferred outlets are already highly supportive of Mr. Orban. His government has systematically starved independent outlets of state advertising revenues and squeezed their owners’ other business interests — encouraging most private media companies to either censor their coverage or sell to Orban allies. Today, more than 500 Hungarian news outlets take a pro-government stance, compared with just 31 in 2015, according to research by Atlatszo, one of the few Hungarian news websites that remain independently owned. Under Mr. Orban, public broadcasters have been turned into mouthpieces for the Orban government and rarely feature opposition voices. “It’s a massive change, but it’s more about the symbolism,” Zselyke Csaky, the research director for Europe and Eurasia at Freedom House, said of this week’s ownership transfers. The Hungarian media is now “beginning to resemble state media under Communism because of the level of control and consolidation,” Ms. Csaky added. In an email to The New York Times, one of the foundation’s board members, Miklos Szantho, said that while his group had an undeniably right-wing agenda, it is an independent and private entity that will work to sustain a “balanced” media environment in Hungary, combat fake news and tackle political correctness. “The main priority of the foundation itself is to serve, preserve and uphold balanced media in Hungary, in all terms,” wrote Mr. Szantho, who also heads the Center for Fundamental Rights, a conservative Budapest-based legal research group. He said the foundation’s outlets would work to ensure that opposition-minded media outlets do not regain the prominent market position that they held before Mr. Orban’s election. “Since 2010, as the Hungarian political Left lost its ability to invent and communicate strategic visions or ideas about the country but even about themselves, they also lost the capability to ‘nurture’ their ‘intellectual Hinterland,’ while the Right was able to build up a viable counterpart to the ‘progressive’ Hungarian media outlets,” Mr. Szantho wrote. Now, oppositional voices “have to come to terms with the existing, ‘new’ and much more balanced media landscape,” he said. One of the news outlets now controlled by the foundation, Origo, compared its new ownership to that of The Guardian, a major London-based international news organization — but the trust that owns The Guardian does not interfere in its news coverage. Ms. Csaky of Freedom House said that the Hungarian foundation was without precedent in Europe and that its creation highlighted how openly Mr. Orban is prepared to flout European norms. In the past month, his government has come close to forcing one of Hungary’s leading colleges, the Central European University, to move its headquarters to Vienna, and given political asylum to a former prime minister of Macedonia, Nikola Gruevski, helping him escape corruption charges in Skopje. “The boldness of the move shows that Orban seems to have lost some of his pragmatism,” Ms. Csaky said. “With this move, and with the Gruevski move, and C.E.U. leaving, it seems like he trusts his instincts more and more, certain that there will be no pushback from the European Union.” The European Parliament voted in September to begin the process of penalizing Hungary for breaching democratic norms, but it was only a first step, and it remains to be seen what sanctions, if any, the European Union will impose. According to Freedom House’s democracy index, Hungary’s political system, classified as a “consolidated democracy” when Mr. Orban entered office in 2010, is now only a “semi-consolidated democracy.” Its media is only “partly free” and has fallen nearly 50 places on the Freedom House scale since Mr. Orban’s election.",The New York Times
2018,Orchestra That Bridges Mideast Divide Tours a Fractured U.S.,"CHICAGO — The conductor Daniel Barenboim entered the rehearsal room. Musicians of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the improbable ensemble he founded nearly 20 years ago with Edward Said, were tuning their instruments, listening intently to one another. “I’m very, very happy to see you here,” Mr. Barenboim said to the orchestra, whose members include Israelis, Palestinians and musicians from other Arab countries. “I’m very glad that those of you that have strange passports managed to get into the United States.” The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra is dedicated to the idea of breaking down barriers in the Middle East. But new barriers put up by the United States briefly threatened to derail the orchestra’s current tour: Over the summer, it looked as though some musicians might not get visas because they held passports from Syria and Iran, two of the nations named in President Trump’s travel ban. They ended up getting waivers, allowing the tour to go forward. And that is how Mr. Barenboim found himself at Symphony Center here on Friday to rehearse Strauss’s “Don Quixote.” Which led to an inevitable question: As the orchestra nears its 20th anniversary, and even the seemingly modest dream of being able to play in all its members’ home countries appears out of reach, is the whole enterprise quixotic? “When I’m with them, it doesn’t feel quixotic at all,” Mr. Barenboim, 75, said in an interview. “When I talk to you, I know it is quixotic.” Quixotic or not, the project has overcome enormous odds since it grew out of a 1999 workshop in Weimar, Germany, that Mr. Barenboim, an Argentine-Israeli, created with his friend Mr. Said, the Palestinian-American literary scholar, who died in 2003. If the orchestra has not shaped the debate as much as Mr. Barenboim would have liked — a 2005 concert in Ramallah, in the West Bank, has never been repeated, and it has never played in Israel — it has become a regular presence at leading music festivals and concert halls. The five-city American tour that began here on Monday will take it to Carnegie Hall on Thursday, for a concert that is to be broadcast on WQXR and streamed live at medici.tv. The group’s deceptively simple premise — that getting musicians from groups that have been opposed for decades to play together would foster understanding — seems even more ambitious in this polarized age. These musicians from different sides of the Middle East divide are visiting a United States riven by tribalism and racial animosity, and reeling from the anti-Semitic killing of 11 at a Pittsburgh synagogue and the spate of pipe bombs mailed to prominent critics of President Trump. The Divan Orchestra, Mr. Barenboim said, was not created as a political orchestra, or as an orchestra for peace, but simply as a way to promote dialogue — starting with its own members. “I sat them together, so you had a Syrian cellist and an Israeli on the same stand,” Mr. Barenboim said. “What do they do? First of all, they tune to the same A. So they have to listen. Then they try to play the same way, with the same bow strokes. They do that for six hours a day, and then they eat in the same dining room. Their attitude changes.” “I always say to them: ‘I expect all of you to agree on how to play Beethoven,’” he said. “I don’t expect you to agree on the other side’s narrative. But I do expect you to try to understand it and respect it.” Making music is hard work: Mr. Barenboim, who led the rehearsals this week in English — dipping into German, Spanish or French where appropriate — could be a demanding taskmaster. But he was also quick to show warmth and delight, and to offer guidance. “Wonderful. Wonderful!” he said after a run-through, once they had earned it. During rehearsals, the players — the youngest are in their teens, the oldest in their 40s — applauded one another and exchanged sympathetic looks after Mr. Barenboim’s criticisms. But there has been plenty of tension over the years. The project has been disparaged by many Israelis and Arabs alike, with players sometimes feeling displeasure from their families. And the events of the all-too-real world have a way of intruding. When Israel waged war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in 2006, several Arab musicians did not play with the orchestra — some because they could not travel, others because they felt unable to. Nassib Ahmadieh, a cellist who grew up in Lebanon, said he could not bring himself to perform that year. “I didn’t have the psychological state to go on tour with the orchestra while my parents were under bombardment, and the whole country was severely damaged,” said Mr. Ahmadieh, 41, who now lives in Germany. “I couldn’t imagine myself traveling around and playing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. It was too optimistic for me.” Mr. Barenboim’s trip to Chicago was a kind of homecoming: On Thursday he received a huge ovation when he returned to his old podium at Orchestra Hall to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for the first time since he stepped down as its music director in 2006. When he left, there were rumors of bad blood, which his long absence did little to allay. He insisted there was no animosity: He had simply wanted a clean break, he said, and rarely appears as a guest conductor, given his schedule as general music director of the Berlin State Opera and chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Berlin, not to mention his piano concerts. He has also shepherded the creation of the Barenboim-Said Akadamie in Berlin, which offers music degrees and courses in humanities, and concerts in the Frank Gehry-designed Pierre Boulez Saal. Mr. Barenboim has long been outspoken. When Israel passed a new law this year that enshrines the right of self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people,” he wrote that it made him ashamed of being an Israeli. After the United States decided to move its embassy to Jerusalem, he warned that it would make the situation worse and called on the world to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state. In his interview here, he said that the problem that inspired him to create the Divan orchestra remains much as it was then. “These are two peoples who are deeply convinced they have the right to live on the same little piece of land, preferably without the other,” he said. “How can you compromise on this? It definitely cannot be solved militarily, definitely cannot be solved politically — it can only be solved through human understanding of the other.” The concert here on Monday opened with “Don Quixote,” featuring the soloists Kian Soltani, a rising young Austrian-Persian cellist, and Miriam Manasherov, an Israeli violist. And it ended with a rare sight in concert halls: the players hugging one another onstage.",The New York Times
2018,Orson Welles’ Final Movie and More: 7 Things to Know From the Week in Pop Culture,"What would you like to see here? Email us at popculture@nytimes.com. Hello! Welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture. The TV gods have smiled on us, their lowly subjects, and finally “King of the Hill” is available to stream, on Hulu. Thirteen whole seasons of life in Arlen, Tex., and of Bobby Hill (voiced by Pamela Adlon), the sweetest animated 11-year-old you’re likely to find. It took decades to put together “The Other Side of the Wind,” the movie Orson Welles shot, but never completed, before his death in 1985. Manohla Dargis made it a Times Critic’s Pick, writing, “a vision of a film artist worn down by life — or fame or disappointment — emerges, though it would be a mistake to assume that Welles was making a self-portrait.” The stylized movie about a movie is finally on Netflix. There are some great details in this Entertainment Weekly piece on the upcoming final season of “Game of Thrones,” not least of which is the revelation that Kit Harington cried twice during the cast’s table read, having refused to read the script ahead of time. Also, the season will have a battle scene that will make “the Battle of the Bastards look like a theme park.” “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” takes the teenage witch into a darker and spookier realm. In fact, the real-life Satanic Temple is threatening a lawsuit over a statue in the show’s Academy of Unseen Arts that resembles the temple’s copyrighted design for a statue of Baphomet, a horned pagan deity. The Temple claims that the show infringed on its “intellectual property.” “Sometimes, a supporting-actor route presents the easiest path to Oscar,” writes Kyle Buchanan, which can lead to an actor downplaying their role in a movie, a rare moment of Hollywood humility. Buchanan breaks down the scheming happening this year, and it’s a pretty fascinating read. In very wonderful news, Ava DuVernay is working on a multipart Prince documentary for Netflix. It will cover the artist’s entire life, Variety reports, and Prince’s estate is in full support of the project. “Prince was a genius, a joy and a jolt to the senses,” DuVernay wrote on Twitter. “He was like no other. The only way I know how to make this film is with love and great care.” This week Oprah Winfrey joined Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s Democratic candidate for governor, at a campaign event to cheers of “And you get a vote! And you get a vote! And you get a vote!” She is also accompanying Abrams knocking on voters’ doors. (Will Ferrell did the same for Abrams last week.) I’m still thinking about this joyful and deeply surreal video of Tilda Swinton’s dogs frolicing on the beach to a Handel aria. Swinton co-directed this video, and the really good stuff starts around the four-minute mark.",The New York Times
2018,"Oskar Rabin, Defiant Artist During Soviet Era, Dies at 90","Oskar Rabin, a painter who was at the center of a group of dissident artists who defied the Soviet authorities in the 1960s and ’70s, died on Wednesday in Florence, Italy. He was 90. Alexander Smoljanski, a filmmaker who with Evgeny Tsymbal has just completed a documentary about Mr. Rabin, announced the death on Facebook. Mr. Rabin had been in Florence for an exhibition of his work at the Florentine branch of the I. Repin St. Petersburg Art Academy. It opened the day after his death. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said the cause was a heart attack. Mr. Smoljanski’s Facebook post said Mr. Rabin had been under treatment at a Florentine clinic for a hip injury. Mr. Rabin painted still lifes and landscapes, often imbuing them with wry critiques of Soviet life, but his fame rested as much on his defiance as on his artistic ability. In 1974 he was among the organizers of an outdoor exhibition in Moscow by so-called nonconforming artists — those who were denied exhibitions in recognized galleries and museums because they refused to limit themselves to the officially sanctioned style of the day, Socialist realism, which emphasized heroic scenes and sculptures and left no room for impressionism or abstraction or unpleasant subjects. The artists met an unforgiving resistance. “When they gathered in an open lot on September 15,” Hedrick Smith, who was then a reporter in Moscow for The New York Times, wrote in his 1976 book “The Russians,” “they were brutally dispersed by plainclothes police dressed as workers and operating bulldozers and dump trucks.” By some accounts, the police had to pluck Mr. Rabin from the upper reaches of a bulldozer he had clung to as it advanced on him. The aborted art show has ever since been known as the Bulldozer Exhibition. The international reaction was so strong that a few months later the Soviets allowed another show by the nonconforming artists, but the tensions remained. Mr. Rabin continued to incur official wrath and endure the occasional arrest. In 1978 officials encouraged him to make a trip to Paris; while he was there they stripped him of his citizenship. He lived in Paris the rest of his life, even though he became celebrated in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. “The Russia-themed pictures that I sometimes paint even now are not nostalgic,” he wrote in “Three Lives,” a 1986 memoir. “These are pictures-cum-recollections — just a memory about the past. For no matter what sort of past it was, you cannot erase it from your heart.” Oskar Yakovlevich Rabin (whose name is, variously, also given as “Oscar” and “Rabine”) was born on Jan. 2, 1928, in Moscow. His parents were both doctors, and both died of illnesses when he was a boy; an orphan, he spent the years of World War II living in children’s dorms. In 1944 he was sent to live with an aunt in the Latvian city of Riga. He trained at an art academy there, then studied at, but was expelled from, the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow. It was in the mid-1950s that he fell in with a group of artists and intellectuals who were creating artworks and writings that were outside the sanctioned parameters. By 1958 he and his wife, Valentina Kropivnitskaya, also an artist, were living in a camp barracks in the Lianozovo District near Moscow, their home a frequent gathering spot for the renegades, who became known as the Lianozovo Group. “Its participants were united not by some common artistic ideology,” the art collector Alexander Glezer wrote in 1995, “but rather by their uncompromising stand in the fight for freedom of expression and the right to display their works to their compatriots.” Mr. Rabin’s paintings tended toward the expressionistic and were decidedly unheroic, putting him at odds with the official definition of art. “Rabin depicted dreary everyday reality,” Natalia Kolodzei, executive director of the Kolodzei Art Foundation and an expert in the art of Russia and the former Soviet Union, said by email. “Dilapidated hovels, suburban slums, neglected cemeteries, religious symbols, street signs, and newspapers full of personal and narrative significance.” One work from 1968, “Still Life With Fish and Pravda,” featured a glass and a dead fish atop crumpled pages of Pravda, the official Communist Party newspaper, a provocatively ambiguous fragment of a headline showing. In his book, he expressed mock indignation that such a painting was deemed not to fit the sanctioned realism of the time. “I was reproached for my still lifes, for vodka bottles, and for a herring sitting on a newspaper,” he wrote. “But haven’t you ever drunk vodka with a herring? At all the feasts, including the official ones, one drinks vodka.” Such cheeky works, and his outspokenness, made Mr. Rabin a prominent figure among the nonconforming artists. “Middle-aged and essentially hairless, Rabin developed the incongruous status of a bald rock star,” John McPhee wrote in his book “The Ransom of Russian Art” (1994). In 1990, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev restored Mr. Rabin’s citizenship. His works have since been exhibited many times in Russia, as well as in the West. His work is in numerous museums and has been sold at leading auction houses. Mr. Rabin’s wife died in 2008. A son, Alexandre, died in 1994. Ms. Kolodzei said that though Mr. Rabin’s paintings could be grim, many had a subtle ray of hope. “Light, which plays an important spiritual role in much of Rabin’s work, can be seen as symbolizing the warmth of the cultural gatherings in the Rabins’ home,” she said. The light ultimately prevailed. “Artists like Oskar Rabin can be said to have contributed to the ideological erosion and ultimate failure of the Soviet system,” she said. “In a system where everything was defined as political, it was impossible to escape politics even in art; thus some nonconformist art movements became imbued with political meaning from their very inception no matter what the artist(s) may have intended.” Mr. Smoljanski, who worked on his documentary for eight years, said Mr. Rabin led by example. “He showed us all — without any pathos or heroics — how to stay free in a country not designed for freedom,” he said on Facebook. “He never compromised with his persecutors. Never betrayed his ideals.”",The New York Times

When you’re done, use the submission form below to enter the contest by Dec. 10. Our judges will then use this rubric (PDF) to select winners for publishing on The Learning Network. For detailed rules as well as information about a chance to win a scholarship in a related contest, see below. And for step-by-step help in analyzing the elements of a good editorial cartoon and creating your own, use this related lesson plan, “Drawing for Change: Analyzing and Making Political Cartoons.” As Mr. Chappatte says in the video below, the challenge for a cartoonist is in coming up with good ideas; artistic talent is secondary. So find an issue or topic that matters to you, either from current events or historical events covered in The Times, and make your own cartoon. _________ This contest is closed and the submission form has been removed. _________ 1. For this contest, we are accepting drawings or illustrations, or a series of artworks, that offer commentary or criticism about current issues, political topics or historical events covered in The New York Times. Format examples include, but are not limited to, single-panel drawings with captions, sequential comic art, illustrations or digitally created drawings. 2. Don’t be afraid to take a stand or have an opinion. Editorial cartoons illustrate a point, prompt a realization or offer an example. For inspiration, you may want to look over the winners from 2015, 2016 and 2017. 3. Your submission must link to at least one related Times source. Since The Times has been publishing since 1851 and because content from any section or era can be inspiration for your work, that should be easy. If you’re stuck, try searching; you may be surprised at how much you can find in The Times. Be advised that nytimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have access to five free articles each month, but after that you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. The Times also offers K-12 digital subscription plans for schools. But all Learning Network activities for students, including our daily writing prompts, as well as Times articles linked from them, are free, so you can access them without exceeding the five-article limit. 4. Only one submission per student is allowed. If you are submitting a series of illustrations or panels as your cartoon, be sure that your entry is contained in one image file to be uploaded. 5. To include a caption for your cartoon, wait until your image loads. Then you will see a new field appear that says, “Write a caption for this file.” You will also be asked to “Add a credit for this file.” Both of these fields are optional. 6. Be original and use appropriate language. Create your cartoon for a well-informed audience, but include enough background information to give context. Be careful not to plagiarize. 7. Submissions must be from students between 13 and 19 years old, although students can come from anywhere in the world. 8. Create your cartoon by yourself or with a partner. If you are working as a team, just remember to submit both your names when you post your entry. But please submit only one editorial per student. If you’re submitting as part of a team, you should not also submit as an individual. 9. All entries must be submitted by Dec. 10, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern. If you have questions about the contest, please post them in the comments section, and we’ll answer you there, or email us at LNfeedback@nytimes.com. 10. We will use this rubric (PDF) to judge editorial cartoons. The top cartoons, as judged by The Times and professional cartoonists, will be featured on The Learning Network. 11. Follow these instructions if you need proof that you entered this contest. Within an hour of submitting your cartoon, you should receive an email from “The New York Times” with the subject heading “Re: Learning Network Editorial Cartoon Contest.” If you don’t receive the email within an hour, even after checking your spam folder, then you can resubmit your entry. Be sure your settings allow emails from nytimes.com. After two attempts and waiting over one full day, if you still have not received a confirmation email, you can contact us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com with the email address you used in the contest form. Use the subject heading “Please send me an email confirmation for my editorial cartoon contest submission.” Be sure to include your name and cartoon title in your email. You may have to wait up to a week for a reply. 12. The children and stepchildren of New York Times employees are not eligible to enter this contest. Nor are teenagers who live in the same household as a Times employee. 13. Be sure to check your email in January to find out if your cartoon has been selected as a winner. If you are under 18, you’ll need to submit your parent or legal guardian’s written consent in order to have your cartoon published on NYTimes.com. Good luck and have fun. As always, we welcome your questions and comments in case we have somehow omitted details that might be useful. Let us know how we can help. _________ Related Opportunity We also encourage students in grades 7 through 12 to consider entering their cartoons into The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards’ Editorial Cartoon category, sponsored by the Herb Block Foundation. Three $1,000 scholarships will be awarded to students who earn National Medals in Editorial Cartoon in the 2019 Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.

2018,Opinion | Our Mental Health at Risk,"letter A reader says the president’s speech adversely affects the psyche of Americans. To the Editor: Dr. Richard A. Friedman, in “The Neuroscience of Hate Speech” (Op-Ed, Nov. 1), describes the connection between the hateful rhetoric constantly spewing from President Trump’s mouth and the increasingly violent acts we are witnessing in our country. What he does not discuss, but which is no less important, is the corollary to this: the adverse effects of President Trump’s speech on the mental health of many Americans. We are living in an increasingly stressful, divisive time that over the long term cannot but exact a tremendous toll on the psyche of this country. Lisa KaplowitzNew York",The New York Times
2018,Our Networked (Dangerous) World: Do Australia’s Leaders Get It?,"Letter 79 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. Here’s where to find all our Oceania coverage. ______ At one point while I was preparing to interview Rukmini Callimachi about Islamic terrorism at Twitter’s Sydney offices today, I found myself thinking about international threats — and journalism. Not coverage per se, but the way that both are being shaped by two forces: ideological ruptures and digital networks. For both journalism and geopolitics, a breakdown of monoliths and norms has created what sometimes feels like more of everything. Traditional news outlets, especially newspapers, are struggling. In their place are more partisan products and aggregators, more niche publications, greater availability of unfiltered (and often inaccurate) news through social platforms — and more readers and viewers in more places than most of us could have imagined a generation ago. For foreign affairs, the networked world has also meant proliferation. There’s an equalization that’s happened across the nodes and cables, whereby power can be wielded by far more than “superpowers.” Ideologies, motivations and methods of mayhem have multiplied. North Korea can lock up computers in 150 countries, canceling thousands of appointments in Britain’s health care system. The Islamic State can recruit terrorists across borders. Russia can interfere in American elections, smugglers can encrypt communication with the efficiency of a modern military, and WikiLeaks can undermine diplomatic relationships worldwide. Not all of these impacts are bad or the result of bad actors. Technology and trade have helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty since 1990. There are also implications that are harder to categorize: Netflix, for example, can build a huge business in Australia with barely any local employees. Is that a net positive or negative? In many ways, it used to be simpler. During the Cold War, the world was mostly divided into two camps with ideologies and spheres of influence that were well known. Now, it can be hard to know where the biggest threats or opportunities come from or which ones deserve the most attention. For many people, all of this creates a sense of dislocation and anxiety. Even within national borders, it’s hard to know what’s really shaping daily life as the world feels progressively harder to understand. At The New York Times, of course, we believe that part of our job is to help with that — for readers in Australia and everywhere. But we also rely on political leaders to frame goals and strategies for dealing with the forces that affect us all. This week, I got a taste of how Australia’s leaders are managing. Both Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, and Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, gave speeches in Sydney on foreign policy. I attended both. I’d hoped to hear them grapple with some of the new challenges that go beyond nation-states or China vs. America. I’d hoped to hear a sophisticated argument and maybe a vision for what the world could learn from Australia, and what Australia could learn from the world. Instead, I heard status quo thinking and caution. Mr. Shorten’s lecture at the Lowy Institute emphasized that if Labor wins the next election, Australia will not view China solely through the lens of “worst-case scenarios,” seemingly a dig at the Liberals’ focus on foreign interference. He emphasized a need for independence, but did not provide much clarity when I asked about Australia’s areas of concern. Perhaps that was because the Chinese ambassador was in attendance. Mr. Morrison, speaking at an Asia Society gathering hosted by Bloomberg, focused more on the benefits of trade and expanded military spending. He started out trying to emphasize values: “We are more than the sum of our deals,” he said. “We are better than that.” Then he proceeded to talk mostly in transactional terms. The word “technology” did not appear once in his prepared remarks. “Foreign policy speeches tend to be cautious, as they are directed towards multiple audiences,” said Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute. “Australian foreign policy speeches are doubly so, as our external conditions have conditioned our foreign policy in the direction of pragmatism.” Australia’s 2016 defense white paper provides a more nuanced outlook, explaining the tectonic shifts among nations that will affect Australia’s future. There, the word technology appears 56 times. But I still find myself left with a question: Do today’s leaders, in Australia and elsewhere, really understand the effects of a networked world enough to grasp the role it’s playing in both their own democracies and in foreign affairs? Are they doing enough deep thinking about this? This week, I saw no signs that they are. Now for our stories of the week, about this part of the world, about technology, and a few other things to smile and think about. Join our Facebook group for more discussion! ______ O.K., O.K., let’s start with a little fun. • Our 52 Places traveler, Jada Yuan, finally made it to Australia and appears to have had an amazing time both in and around Darwin, and in Tasmania. • I also profiled Liane Moriarty this week. “Big Little Lies” is still defining her public image, but the way she manages her own identity post-Hollywood-stardom strikes me as especially Australian. A few other highlights: • Australian Scientists Warn That World’s Wilderness Areas Are Disappearing “Wild areas provide a lot of life support systems for the planet,” said the author of a study that found 77 percent of earth’s land had been modified by humans. • Chinese Military May Gain From Western University Ties, Report Warns: A new report from Australia says the West is taking risks by collaborating with researchers tied to the Chinese military. • In ‘Shell,’ Kristina Olsson Captures a City That’s Reaching for Greatness: Another great author profile, part of our expanding Australian books coverage. (That’s a good thing, right?) ______ Nellie Bowles, one of our most talented tech reporters (who will be in Australia next month for some reporting and writing), published three stories this week that look at how those who have built our digital world are now eagerly protecting their children from it. They were all among the week’s most read stories among New York Times readers worldwide. You’ll want to digest at least one: • A Dark Consensus About Screens and Kids Begins to Emerge in Silicon Valley: “I am convinced the devil lives in our phones.” • Silicon Valley Nannies Are Phone Police for Kids: Child care contracts now demand that nannies hide phones, tablets, computers and TVs from their charges. • The Digital Gap Between Rich and Poor Kids Is Not What We Expected: America’s public schools are still promoting devices with screens — even offering digital-only preschools. The rich are banning screens from class altogether ______ This week also featured a few stories about animals that will make you smile. Because, why not? There’s the East Asian duck that mysteriously showed up, unannounced, in New York’s Central Park. There’s the wildebeest, which might just have the most efficient muscles in nature (don’t tell The Rock). Even spiders, yes spiders, are worth appreciating. As one of our esteemed science writers explains in this overview of all their gloriousness: “Scary and beautiful are not mutually exclusive.” If only we could say the same for politics. ______ Finally, a bit of commentary for you: → David Brophy: Politicians and activists are shaping nationalist sentiment into pride in artificial and ahistoric notions of civilization. And Australia is just the latest test case. → David Brooks: These mass killings are about many things — guns, demagogy, etc. — but they are also about social isolation and the spreading derangement of the American mind. → Kara Swisher: This is what the internet has come to — thugs like Mohammed bin Salman funding tech companies to host the vitriol of thugs like Cesar Sayoc and Robert Bowers. Rukmini Callimachi deserves more than just my brief mention above. She’s a force when it comes to reporting on global extremism, and The New York Times is partnering with ABC RN to broadcast her podcast Caliphate. RN will provide a unique Australian context for this series with its specialist presenters: “Science Friction” host Natasha Mitchell about the brain science of radicalization, and “Religion & Ethics” host Andrew West on the politics and religion of Islam in Australia, with Samina Yasmin, director of the Centre for Muslim States and Societies. The next episode can be heard on the radio on Saturday at 4 p.m. Here is where to find the series at the ABC, including an interview with the Caliphate producer Andy Mills that aired after the first episode. You can also find transcripts and additional reporting on our site.",The New York Times
2018,Out of the Classroom and Into the World: 70-Plus Places to Publish Teenage Writing and Art,"Contests Updated with new opportunities: July, 2019 When we ask teachers why they bring their classes to our site, we always hear one answer first: Posting in our public forums gives young people an “authentic audience” for their voices and ideas. We’re honored to serve that role, and this week we’ll be talking about it on a panel at the National Council of Teachers of English conference. As a companion to our talk, on the theme of “Why You Should Publish Student Work — and Where and How to Do It,” we’ve compiled this list of opportunities specifically for teenage writers and visual artists. We hope, with your help, to crowdsource even more. The list begins with our own offerings and those of our N.C.T.E. panel partner, the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, and goes on to name dozens more that are open to young people in the United States — though many, including ours, also accept work from students around the world. Please note what we did NOT include: In-person events or competitions; sites that do not seem to be taking submissions now or in 2019; opportunities open only to those from a specific state or region; opportunities open only to members of specific organizations; or competitions that require the use of paid products. But, of course, we know this list is incomplete. What should we add? Let us know in the comments, or by writing to LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and thank you. Note: The descriptions below have been taken directly from the sites themselves. Please check the rules and requirements for each to decide if they are right for your students. _________ ★ The New York Times Learning Network Daily writing prompts: Our Student Opinion question and Picture Prompt offer anyone 13 to 19 years old a place to publicly post writing that is read by our editors and other students around the world.

2018,Over 700 Flights Canceled for Midwest Snowstorm,"The busiest travel weekend of the year got a bit busier in the Midwest. Blizzard-like conditions in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois caused a flurry of cancellations and delays on Sunday and Monday at Kansas City International Airport and O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, creating a Thanksgiving weekend travel nightmare. The storm dumped more than a foot of snow in an area stretching from northern Kansas through Iowa and into Illinois. “As a city, we are used to snow, but it is the first of the season,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said at a Sunday evening news conference. “It is an all-hands-on-deck effort for the city.” Mr. Emanuel said he was rallying resources to streamline Monday morning’s commute for Chicagoans. Gov. Jeff Colyer of Kansas declared a state of disaster emergency, enabling state resources to be used for the response to the snowstorm. Over 600 flights have been canceled at O’Hare, and over 120 flights have been canceled at Midway Airport in Chicago, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com. More than a dozen flights departing from Kansas City were canceled on Monday morning. At O’Hare on Monday, a handful of departure flights were delayed, while many were still scheduled to leave on time. Because of low visibility on Sunday afternoon, no flights were taking off or landing at the Kansas City airport, in Missouri. Several flights were scheduled for late Sunday evening. “The accumulation of the snow and ice coupled with the wind has been a lot for our crews to contend with,” said Joe McBride, a spokesman for the Kansas City airport. “Visibility is improving, but we have too much snow covering the airfield.” [Trapped in an airport? Here are some tips for getting what you want from an airline.] Up to six inches of snow fell on Sunday in parts of the greater Kansas City area, including at the Kansas City airport, according to the National Weather Service. Some other areas in the region received nine inches, as wind gusts as high as 55 miles per hour swept through Kansas and Missouri. But the Weather Service expects the storm to have cleared out of Kansas, Missouri and Illinois by the middle of Monday morning, according to David Roth, a forecaster with the service. The storm is expected to head east-northeast and end up in Maine. “It will be one of the snowier Novembers on record for Maine,” Mr. Roth said. The University of Kansas, in Lawrence, canceled its classes for Monday, and Mr. Colyer asked residents to stay home. The University of Missouri, in the central part of the state, delayed the start of classes on Monday. The National Weather Service also warned people about traveling in the blizzard-like conditions. “If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you,” it said in a statement. “If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.” More than 50 million Americans were expected to travel at least 50 miles for the Thanksgiving holiday, according to AAA, a 4.8 percent increase from last year.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Jackie Mitchell, Who Fanned Two of Baseball’s Greats","Mitchell was a 17-year-old pitcher in 1931 when she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game, but questions about that exploit linger. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Women have cleared many barriers in sports, but few exploits have been as stunning, and steeped in mystery, as the day Jackie Mitchell struck out two of baseball’s giants, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. It was April 2, 1931, and Mitchell, all of 17, was on the roster of the otherwise all-male Tennessee minor league team the Chattanooga Lookouts, which had signed her to a contract just a week before. The Yankees were in town for an exhibition game as they made their way from spring training in Florida back to New York, and 4,000 people had filled the Lookouts’ stands. Mitchell took the mound in the first inning, in relief. “The Babe performed his role very ably,” William E. Brandt, a reporter for The New York Times, wrote. “He swung hard at two pitches then demanded that Umpire Owens inspect the ball, just as batters do when utterly baffled by a pitcher’s delivery.” The third pitch was a strike that left Ruth looking. When the umpire called him out, the Bambino flung his bat away, “registering disgust with his shoulder and chin,” The Times reported. Gehrig took “three hefty swings” and struck out, too. Mitchell received a standing ovation. “That completed the day’s work for Pitcher Mitchell,” Brandt wrote. The rest of the game was of little note. Another pitcher replaced Mitchell, and her team lost 14-4. The next day, The Times article was headlined, “Girl Pitcher Fans Ruth and Gehrig.” Mitchell was pictured standing on the mound, baseball glove in hand, smiling slightly. But what actually happened that day remains in question. Was the strikeout real, or was it orchestrated by Joe Engel, the Lookouts’ owner, as a publicity stunt? “There’s a huge divide in beliefs,” said Leslie Heaphy, an associate professor of sports history at Kent State University and the author of “Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball” (2016). Engel, an inveterate publicity seeker, first noticed Mitchell at an Atlanta baseball training camp in 1931. With Mitchell, the Lookouts would become the only professional baseball team to have a female pitcher at the time. Engel was trying to fill his ballpark during the depths of the Depression, and surely, he may have thought, the novelty of a female pitcher would draw fans as well as some major-league press coverage. Many contended that Engel had orchestrated the strikeouts of the Yankee greats. Strengthening their case was the very presence of Ruth himself, “another man who was known for doing things to elicit a reaction,” Heaphy said. And it just seemed implausible to many that a 17-year-old girl could strike out two of the best hitters in the game. But Mitchell’s defenders argue otherwise. Virne Beatrice Mitchell was born in Chattanooga on Aug. 29, 1913. She learned to play baseball under the tutelage of her father, Joe Mitchell, in a park near their home. The family lived near the future Hall of Famer Dazzy Vance, who was considered the premier strikeout pitcher of the 1920s. Mitchell credits Vance with teaching her how to pitch a “drop ball,” better known today as a sinker. “Think about a pitcher coming in they’ve never seen before,” Heaphy said. “She’s a lefty with a very deceptive pitch from all accounts.” And being a lefty against the two left-handed sluggers gave her an advantage. Another point for the defense: Lou Gehrig was no Babe Ruth. “He was a very serious player who did not take anything lightly,” Heaphy said. Was he in on a hoax? “I personally find that one hard to believe,” she said. The game against the Yankees completed Mitchell’s career with the Lookouts. It is believed that the baseball commissioner voided Mitchell’s contract after the game, perhaps embarrassed by the episode. Mitchell’s story is representative of a chapter of the history of women in baseball. Only one other woman, Lizzie Arlington, had signed a professional contract — in 1898, to play in Pennsylvania for the Reading Coal Heavers, of the independent Atlantic League. Women played baseball on “Bloomer Girls” teams from the 1890s through the 1930s, barnstorming the United States to play men’s teams. The women’s teams — each of which had at least one male player — were thought of more as entertainment than sport. The last of the leagues disbanded in 1934. It would be another nine years before Philip Wrigley started the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (the subject of the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own”), and it was not until the 1990s that the American Women’s Baseball League was formed. Little is known of what Mitchell did after the game against the Yankees. She is said to have continued to play, pitching for another of Engel’s teams, the Chattanooga Junior Lookouts, through the summer of 1931 and criss-crossing the country for the next two years to capitalize on offers to play in exhibition games. In 1933 she signed with another traveling team, the House of David. In 1937, at age 23, Mitchell hung up her glove and went to work at her father’s optometry office in Chattanooga. She died in Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., on Jan. 7, 1987, leaving a nephew and cousins as her only survivors, according to a brief obituary by The Associated Press. She was 74. Ten years after Mitchell’s death, Ila Borders become the first woman to pitch in a regular season professional game, with the minor league St. Paul Saints in Minnesota. And in 2014, Mo’ne Davis became the first girl to throw a shutout in Little League World Series history. Mitchell’s nephew, Spencer Melton, 69, of Miami, said in a telephone interview that he did not know much about his aunt. Nor was he able to demystify the events of that day on the field in 1931. “I heard she liked baseball, but that’s the extent I knew about Jackie,” he said. Elizabeth Maurer, the former director of programs for the National Women’s History Museum, said Mitchell’s story fits a narrative that many people find attractive. “They like to find these women from the past who didn’t just succeed in male-dominated professional fields, but they beat the men,” Maurer said. “But the problem with that is that Jackie Mitchell didn’t actually win,” she added. “She didn’t get to keep that contract.” In an interview shortly before her death, Mitchell stood her ground in defending the legitimacy of her fanning Ruth and Gehrig. “Why, hell, they were trying — damn right,” she said. “Hell, better hitters than them couldn’t hit me. Why should they’ve been any different?” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mitchell's given name. It was Virne, not Verne.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Lilian Rice, Architect Who Lifted a Style in California","In the 1920s, Rice brought her design aesthetic to a small village north of San Diego. Those who live there continue to respect her vision. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. In one of America’s wealthiest enclaves, an area of sprawling mansions near San Diego that sell for upward of $10 million, bragging rights still go to those who live in homes designed nearly a century ago by the architect Lilian J. Rice. Rice was in her early 30s when she planned the civic center of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., 20 miles northeast of the city, and designed many of the homes tucked into the surrounding rolling hills and eucalyptus groves. While Rancho Santa Fe is a small community — its population hovers around 3,000 — Rice’s impact on architecture in California is great. In less than 20 years of professional work, she designed more than 100 homes in San Diego County and planted Spanish Colonial Revival as a state architectural style. She insisted on three things in her designs: restraint in decoration, high-quality craftsmanship and harmony between a home and its site. “She would not grade the land; if there was a boulder, she worked around it,” Diane Y. Welch, author of “The Life and Times of Lilian J. Rice Master Architect” (2015), said in a telephone interview. “Had she lived, she would have been on the forefront of Modernism.” Rice made clear her design philosophy in a 1928 article in an architectural journal. “With the thought early implanted in my mind that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness, I found real joy at Rancho Santa Fe,” she wrote. “Every environment there calls for simplicity and beauty — the gorgeous natural landscapes, the gently broken topography, the nearby mountains. No one with a sense of fitness, it seems to me, could violate these natural factors by creating anything that lacked simplicity in line and form and color.” Eleven of her buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. Lilian Jeannette Rice was born on June 12, 1889, to Julius Augusta Rice and Laura (Steele) Rice in National City, Calif., south of San Diego. Her father was an educator, and her mother was an artist. In 1910, Rice became one of the first women to graduate from the architecture program at the University of California, Berkeley. While there, she encountered the work of Bernard Maybeck, who designed the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, as well as the Hillside Club, which was part of a movement to build homes that respected the existing landscape. Rice was only the 10th woman in the state to receive a license to practice, according to the California State Board of Architectural Examiners. Julia Morgan, who designed Hearst Castle in San Simeon, was the first. In 1922, Rice was working at the firm of the San Diego architects Richard Requa and Herbert Jackson when they were commissioned to create a development plan for more than 8,000 acres that once belonged to the Santa Fe Railway Company. Requa called on Rice to take over the job, and she was given complete freedom to supervise a large team of workers at the site, which became Rancho Santa Fe. “She was superior,” Vonn Marie May, a California-based historian, said in a telephone interview. “Everyone thinks he gave this young girl a chance, when in fact she just blew everyone out of the water.” A Los Angeles Times article said she was “ahead of her time,” adding that “she did a masterful job laying out the village of Rancho Santa Fe.” Even today a homeowners’ association there, when making rulings on home design, considers the question: “What would Lilian do?” But Rice, who by all accounts appeared to be bright, cheerful and easy to work with, was also modest about her achievements, May said. “She was quiet, almost egoless,” she said. “She never married, like Julia Morgan — they had too much to do.” Rice lived and worked in the village she designed from its inception until she died of ovarian cancer on Dec. 22, 1938. She was 49. And while she did branch out — going “full-on English Tudor” in La Jolla, Calif., according to May, and designing an award-winning clubhouse for the women’s rowing club, of which she was a member and onetime president — her legacy is inextricably tied to “the Ranch,” as it is called by its residents. This year, Rice was included in Pioneering Women of American Architecture, a website featuring 50 women, born before 1940, who made important contributions to architecture. While Spanish Colonial Revival was not uncommon at the time, Rice was significant in making it a widespread style in California, said Mary McLeod, a professor of architecture at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture and an editor of the website project. “She was designing and working as an independent architect and was so productive,” McLeod said in an interview. “I have wondered if California offered women more options, if there was more freedom there.” Rice designed at least 60 homes in Rancho Santa Fe, according to Welch. And while many have been greatly remodeled since they were built, Rice’s name still carries weight. “People cherish and value a Lilian Rice home,” she said. “She was a quality nut.” The community has always attracted the rich and the famous. In Rice’s era, Bing Crosby hired her for a variety of projects, including remodeling a stable in his expanding horse-racing venture. Fifty years later, former President Richard M. Nixon could be found strolling the grounds of The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, which, of course, Rice designed.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Noor Inayat Khan, Indian Princess and British Spy","Khan, who was recently suggested as the new face of the £50 note, was an unlikely candidate to engage in espionage in World War II, but she did so with a “steely strength of will.” Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Noor Inayat Khan was not what one would expect of a British spy. She was a princess, having been born into royalty in India; a Muslim, whose father was a Sufi preacher; a writer, mainly of short stories; and a musician, who played the harp and the piano. But she was exactly what Britain’s military intelligence needed in 1943. Khan, whose name was in the news in Britain recently as a proposed new face of the £50 note, was 25 when war was declared in 1939. She and her family went to England to volunteer for the war effort, and in 1940 she joined the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and trained to become a radio operator. Able to speak French, she was quickly chosen to go to Paris to join the Special Operations Executive, a secret British organization set up to support resistance to the Germans from behind enemy lines through espionage and sabotage. Khan was the first female radio operator to be sent by Britain into occupied France, according to her biographer, Shrabani Basu. Khan had worked hard to overcome her fear of weapons during combat training and improved her ability to translate Morse code, but colleagues in her intelligence network still had doubts. Some wondered if she was too young and inexperienced. They pointed out that she had carelessly left codes lying around and that she had unthinkingly revealed her British background by pouring milk into cups before the tea. They also questioned whether she had the right sensibility for the job, having been raised under Sufism, a mystical form of Islam. “Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course,” a superior officer, Col. Frank Spooner, wrote in her personal file. “She has an unstable and temperamental personality and it is very doubtful whether she is really suited to work in the field.” Still, she had excellent radio skills, which the special operations unit desperately needed, so in June 1943 she was sent to France, where she assumed the name Jeanne-Marie Renier, posing as a children’s nurse. Madeleine was her code name. Within 10 days of her arrival, all the other British agents in Khan’s network had been arrested. The S.O.E. wanted her to return to Britain, but she refused, saying she would try to rebuild the network on her own. She ended up doing the work of six radio operators. She moved constantly to evade detection and dyed her hair blonde to avoid being recognized. She knocked on the doors of old friends, asking them if she could use their homes to send messages to London from a wireless set that she carried around in a bulky suitcase. Her work had become crucial to the war effort, helping airmen escape and allowing important deliveries to come in. “Her transmissions became the only link between the agents around the Paris area and London,” Ms. Basu wrote in her biography “Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan.” In recognition of her bravery and service, she was awarded the George Cross by Britain and the Croix de Guerre, with gold star, by France. Noor-un-Nisa Inayat Khan was born on Jan. 1, 1914, in Moscow to Hazrat Inayat Khan and Ora Ray Baker, an American who had changed her name to Amina Sharada Begum after her marriage. Khan’s father, a musician and philosopher who was known as Inayat Khan, was in Moscow at the time on an extended stay with his group, the Royal Musicians of Hindustan, who had been invited to perform in Russia. Her father was also a descendant of an 18th-century ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, in southwest India, making Noor a princess. Inayat Khan was raised in Baroda, in west India, but left the country to introduce Sufism to the west. (He met his future wife while lecturing in San Francisco.) Sufism emphasizes the renunciation of worldly things, purification of the soul and the mystical contemplation of God’s nature. During World War I, the family moved to Paris and then to London, where Noor’s three siblings were born. The family returned to Paris in 1920 and eventually settled in Suresnes, west of the city. Inayat Khan died while on a pilgrimage in India. With her mother overwhelmed by grief, Noor, at just 13, was left to look after the family. Even as she managed the house, Noor wrote short stories, dedicated poems to the family and enrolled at École Normale de Musique de Paris. She also studied child psychology at the Sorbonne. After finishing school, Khan produced an English translation of the Jataka Tales, fables about the previous incarnations of the Buddha, and established herself as a writer. Her book “Twenty Jataka Tales” was published in 1939. Khan never made it home from the war. Just as she was about to leave for England in October 1943, she was captured by the Gestapo. She tried to escape but was caught and sent to a German prison in Pforzheim, on the edge of the Black Forest, where she was chained in solitary confinement, fed the smallest rations and beaten. On Sept. 12, 1944, she was sent to the Dachau concentration camp and tortured there. She and three other S.O.E. women were executed the next day. She was 30. Her cousin Mahmood Khan Youskine remembered her as a refined and dainty young woman who had told him charming stories about rabbits and urged him to play the piano. “The remarkable thing was, within that fineness was also that steely strength of will,” he said in a telephone interview, the “kind of attitude that she displayed in her military career toward the Germans.” He attributed her determination to her upbringing in the Sufi tradition. That sense of duty is also evident in her writing, said her nephew Pir Zia Inayat-Khan, who has helped get her work, including a retelling of Homer, published. “The theme of sacrifice comes up again and again in her writing,” he said by phone. “It’s as if she had already anticipated her own martyrdom.” Khan will not be the next face of the £50 note; the Bank of England has announced that the subject will be a scientist, replacing the likenesses of the steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton. (The selection will be announced in 2020.) But awareness of Khan's wartime efforts, in part because of the £50 note publicity, has grown. English Heritage, a British group that celebrates notable people in history, is planning to create a traditional blue plaque for Khan, adding her to a long roster of figures whose plaques appear on buildings in which they lived or worked. In France, a primary school in Suresnes has been named after her. In 2014, PBS made her the subject of a documentary, “Enemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story.” And the writer Arthur Magida is working on another biography of her. In Gordon Square in London, where Khan once lived, there is a statue of her in a quiet corner. It is engraved with the last word she reportedly said before being executed at Dachau — “Liberté.” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of a writer who is working on a biography of Khan.

Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Pandita Ramabai Saraswati, a scholar, feminist and educator, broke nearly every rule and tradition that confined the life of an upper-caste Hindu woman in 19th-century India. She was the rare woman who had learned Sanskrit, the ancient Hindu liturgical language reserved for Brahmin men; the rare Brahmin to marry out of caste; the rare widow who remained in public view, defying customs; and the rare Indian woman to decide, on her own, to convert to Christianity. At a time when women were expected to be little seen and never heard, Ramabai was an outspoken advocate of women’s education and participation in public affairs. She traveled across India giving lectures on women’s rights. She studied in Britain and the United States, gave lectures in Japan and Australia, and taught Sanskrit as well as her mother tongue, Marathi. Most remarkably for her time, Ramabai charted these paths as a single woman and mother; the few Indian women who were active in social reform then did so only with the encouragement — or, at least, the permission — of their husbands. “Her background, her life choices, her personality and her career catapulted her into the public gaze, making her the most controversial Indian woman of her times,” Prof. Uma Chakravarti wrote in “Rewriting History: The Life and Times of Pandita Ramabai” (1998). She was born Rama Dongre on April 23, 1858, into a Brahmin family. Brahmins, who were generally priests and scholars, were at the top of the caste system that governed Hindu society. Though it was standard for learning to be limited to men and for women to be married off at a young age, Rama’s father, Anant Shastri Dongre, kept her at home and taught her Sanskrit. This “enabled her to escape the rigid gender code,” said Meera Kosambi, an Indian academic who wrote a biography of Ramabai and translated many of her works from Marathi. Ramabai was only 16 when she lost both her parents to famine. Her father’s “last loving command to me,” she wrote in a letter quoted by Kosambi, “was to live an honourable life, if I lived at all, and serve God all my life.” She and her older brother made a livelihood reciting Sanskrit scripture. They moved to Calcutta in 1878, where word spread of Rama’s mastery of the Hindu holy books. Sanskrit scholars at the University of Calcutta gave her the titles Pandita (scholar) and Saraswati (for the goddess of learning), and she became involved in social reform and education circles in Bengal. Bai was added to her first name as a term of respect. After her brother’s death in 1880, she married Bipin Behari Medhavi, a lawyer who was of a lower caste. Rama was only 23 when Medhavi died of an illness, leaving her alone with their 1-year-old daughter, Manorama. She moved to Poona (now Pune), in western India, and formed the Arya Women’s Association to promote education and empowerment. She left for England with her daughter in 1883 to study medicine but was told she could not become a doctor because of her increasing deafness. Instead she enrolled in a teaching program at the Cheltenham Ladies’ College and taught Marathi and Sanskrit. From there she straddled two worlds. She converted to Christianity and took the name Mary, angering her Indian supporters. At the same time, she clashed with church officials, having chafed at their colonial attitudes, and she continued to wear Indian dress and remained a vegetarian. In 1886, she sailed to the United States to attend the graduation of a relative, Anandibai Joshi, the first Indian woman known to have completed medical college. Ramabai was touched deeply by the optimism of American girls, and she viewed the United States as a model for a modern India. Her most important published work, “The High Caste Hindu Woman,” was written in English in the United States in 1887, when she was 29. It focused on the plight of Hindu widows — she called widowhood “the worst and most dreaded period of a high-caste woman’s life.” Brahmin customs prohibited widows from remarrying. Considered cursed, they were required to shave their heads, wear drab, coarse clothes and subsist on meager food. Widows were also subject to physical and sexual abuse. The common practice of child marriage meant that some widows were still girls when they were doomed to a lifetime on the margins. Readers were moved by Ramabai’s account of life in India, and women’s groups formed the American Ramabai Association, with dozens of chapters to support Ramabai financially in her mission. “Here was a woman who circumnavigated the globe in the 19th century, built community in foreign countries and overcame the visceral challenges of diet, dress and language,” said Shefali Chandra, associate professor of history at Washington University in St. Louis. Ramabai wrote wry, thoughtful accounts of her travels that were well received in India. She described how an American host had been horrified to see her barefoot in the house, how Europeans had avoided her small party of Indians on a ship, and how she had stood out when she pulled woolen sweaters over her Indian clothing to stay warm. Using proceeds from her book and lectures, she raised funds to open the Sharada Sadan (Home of Learning) center in 1889 in Bombay, offering widowed girls a refuge where they could study and learn skills like gardening, carpentry and sewing. The shelter grew, at one point serving more than 700 girls and women. Many became teachers and nurses while others stayed, running a dairy farm and their own printing press. The home is still active. “The chief means of happiness is complete independence,” Ramabai urged in her writings, and the means for that is education, which she called “indestructible wealth.” She identified with Native Americans and African Americans. In a letter to her daughter, she described meeting the escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman and urged Manorama to be “as helpful to her own dear countrywomen as Harriet was and is to her own people.” Over time, her shelter, which started as a strictly secular mission, became unabashedly religious. Ramabai built a church and established the Mukti (Salvation) Mission. She made contacts with Christian groups in Australia to help finance its expansion and received dozens of volunteers. Her work drew opposition from conservatives and others in India suspicious of her conversion to Christianity. One newspaper accused her of trying to “set afire the ancient religion of her compatriots with the help of foreigners.” But she found allies in Jyotiba Phule and his wife, Savitri, two anti-caste reformers. “It was not just her feminism that was remarkable but the way that she understood and revealed the Hindu caste system” while also breaching the divisions the system created, Chandra said. Manorama worked as Ramabai’s partner, helping run the schools and mission. But her health was poor, possibly from overwork, and she died at the age of 40. Ramabai died soon after, on April 5, 1922. She was 63. Ramabai’s critique of the Hindu patriarchy and embrace of Christianity extracted a heavy price, according to her biographers: It led to her marginalization in India and her ultimate omission from mainstream history books.",The New York Times
2018,P.S.G. Confirms It Used Racial Profiling in Recruiting Players,"PARIS — The French soccer powerhouse Paris St.-Germain acknowledged Thursday that for the past five years some of its scouts had used racial profiling in the recruitment of young players, hours after a news media report that it was part of an effort to limit the number of black players signed by the club. The charges of discrimination were outlined in a report by Mediapart, which is part of a European investigative journalism collective that has used a trove of hacked documents to produce a series of articles on the internal workings of several top European soccer clubs. On Thursday, Mediapart published scouting reports it said were used by P.S.G. recruiters from 2013 until earlier this year to evaluate young players; along with evaluating a player’s physical and technical skills, scouts were asked to check a box noting each player’s “origin.” The club, which has been transformed into a global force by its Qatari owners in the past decade, claimed senior officials had no knowledge of the racial profiling program. P.S.G. blamed the form, and the system, on an ex-employee responsible for leading a team that recruited players from outside of the Paris region. P.S.G. said it began an internal investigation into the profiling last month — “as soon as it was informed” about the tracking of players’ ethnicities — even as it acknowledged the form had been in use for years. “The Club General Directorate had never been aware of an ethnic registration system within a recruitment department nor had it in its possession,” P.S.G. said in a statement. “In view of the information mentioned therein, these forms betray the spirit and values of Paris Saint-Germain.” P.S.G. already faces questions about its financial affairs after earlier revelations publicized in the so-called Football Leaks scandal. Many of the articles are the result of information obtained in an apparent hack that has exposed internal documents and private emails of top soccer officials. Earlier articles have detailed the extraordinary efforts of Gulf-owned clubs like Manchester City and P.S.G. to evade European soccer’s financial rules; of how several top clubs have plotted to create a breakaway superleague; and how FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, has worked behind the scenes to help powerful stakeholders. The P.S.G. recruiting affair resonated in France because it comes seven years after a similarly ugly episode in which senior officials of France’s soccer federation, including the national team coach at the time, Laurent Blanc, discussed setting up secret quotas limiting the number of players of North African and sub-Saharan origin at its youth training academies. While Blanc was cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry, another official was fired. The revelations quickly became a national scandal, drawing condemnation and reigniting debates about race and integration in France. The current storm at P.S.G. comes only months after a much-celebrated victory at the World Cup last summer by a France team composed of players from a mix of ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds. Only months earlier, though, scouts working for P.S.G. were still being asked to identify young players as French, North African, West Indian, or Black African, according to a copy of a form which was published by Mediapart and whose original version was reviewed by The New York Times. Mediapart reported that Marc Westerloppe, P.S.G.’s former head of player scouting outside of the Paris area, suggested in 2014 that the club needed more of a “balance” because “there are too many West Indian and Africans around Paris.” Jean-Claude Blanc, P.S.G.’s director general, said in a telephone interview with The New York Times on Thursday that the comments had sparked turmoil inside the club at the time. He said he had summoned Westerloppe to a meeting where he was satisfied with the official’s responses and decided against firing him. Neither during that meeting nor one with the club’s 15-member recruitment team did details of the profiling forms ever emerge, Blanc said. Blanc said the forms stopped circulating this spring, shortly after Westerloppe left the club and the unit he used to lead was integrated into a broader scouting team monitoring France. Westerloppe, who is now with French team Rennes, has not commented on the matter.",The New York Times
2018,PETA Asks a Village Named Wool to Change Its Name to Vegan Wool,"When the animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village to take a stand against animal cruelty, residents were surprised, and not amused. LONDON — It began, PETA says, as a playful attempt to draw attention to animal cruelty in the wool industry: The animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village of Wool to change its name to Vegan Wool. But the letter from the British branch of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, received on Wednesday by village officials, attracted scorn and ridicule from residents of Wool after it was posted on Facebook by the local parish council clerk, according to news reports. “With a simple name change, your village can take a stand against this cruelty,” Elisa Allen, director of PETA’s London office, wrote, pointing to evidence of mistreatment of sheep on farms around the world. In exchange for the name change, Ms. Allen said, “we’d be happy to provide every Vegan Wool household that would like one with a cozy, cruelty-free blanket.” PETA recently published graphic videos showing workers on British farms punching animals while they sheared the wool. The group wanted to draw attention to the footage by sending the letter, Ms. Allen said in a phone interview on Friday. “It’s not a benign industry — it’s not a haircut as people often assume it is,” she said. The parish council of Wool, in the county of Dorset, 120 miles southwest of London, said in an email on Friday that PETA’s “request has not been received very well.” Headlines in traditionally conservative tabloids cried foul, saying that PETA believed the name Wool promoted animal cruelty when it was actually linked to water, and quoting residents who ridiculed the suggested name change. “We would be the laughingstock of Dorset if we agreed,” Alan Brown, 81, who hails from a family that has made hurdles to pen sheep for generations, was quoted as saying in The Times of London. For one thing, this ancient village of 5,000 people in the verdant countryside of England was not named after the wool from sheep. True, in the 19th century it was known for sheep of the Dorset Down breed, but most farms have turned to dairy production, the paper said. The name Wool, which is more than 1,000 years old, derives from Wyllon or Well, which means spring, the council said. Ms. Allen said PETA knew that, and wanted only to draw attention to its campaign in a “fun way.” “We’re not afraid to look a little bit silly provided that we can bring these issues into the public domain,” she said. But PETA’s letter touched a nerve with some vegans and animal rights activists. “I know it gets people talking, but for all the wrong reasons,” Sean Ryan Fox, a software designer, said on Twitter. He said such actions “contribute negatively to the reputation of veganism.” An activist for Brooke, a group that campaigns for the protection of working horses, also wrote on Twitter, “I understand why they do it, but by doing absurd campaigns like this, I think PETA are ignoring the damage that they’re doing to the reputation of vegans.” The suggestion that vegan-friendly names can be good publicity is not unfamiliar in Britain, where veganism is increasingly popular. Just this past week, a pub in the city of York changed its name from the Shoulder of Mutton to the Heworth Inn as it began offering a vegan and vegetarian menu. This month, the editor of a food magazine resigned after provoking outrage with his response to a pitch from a vegan writer: “How about a series on killing vegans one by one.” It’s not the first time that PETA has caused a stir by targeting a place’s name. In 1996, the group suggested changing the name of Fishkill, N.Y., to Fishsave. In Britain, Ms. Allen said, the group had unsuccessfully proposed that the English city of Nottingham call itself Not-eating-ham. As for Wool, the parish clerk said in the email that because PETA had made its request in writing, officials would consider the letter at a meeting next month.",The New York Times
2018,"PG-Uh Oh: In Rare Move, M.P.A.A. May Sanction Lars von Trier Film","In a highly unusual move, the Motion Picture Association of America has found a one-night screening of a controversial new Lars von Trier film, “The House That Jack Built,” to be in violation of M.P.A.A. rules, and will hold a hearing within 10 business days to decide whether to impose sanctions on IFC Films, its distributor. The violation was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday. The movie, which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May and tracks a serial killer’s gruesome rampage for more than a decade, was already the subject of denunciations for its depictions of sexual violence. There were walkouts at the Cannes screening. Von Trier, the Danish director with a long history of controversy and provocative work, was banned from Cannes in 2011 for commenting that he was a Nazi while promoting his film “Melancholia.” “The House That Jack Built” was his first time back at the festival since then. An R-rated version of the film, which stars Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman and Bruno Ganz, is slated to open Dec. 14. However, IFC Films and von Trier decided to go an unorthodox route, perhaps in response to the bad press after Cannes: to hold an unrated screening in several cities across the United States on Wednesday night featuring a longer, director’s cut version of the movie. Usually, director’s cuts are released well after the final version of a film has already been in circulation. “The M.P.A.A. has communicated to the distributor, IFC Films, that the screening of an unrated version of the film in such close proximity to the release of the rated version — without obtaining a waiver — is in violation of the rating system’s rules,” the M.P.A.A. said in a statement. “The effectiveness of the M.P.A.A. ratings depends on our ability to maintain the trust and confidence of American parents. That’s why the rules clearly outline the proper use of the ratings. Failure to comply with the rules can create confusion among parents and undermine the rating system — and may result in the imposition of sanctions against the film’s submitter.” On Friday, IFC Films released a statement saying that it had not yet received written notice about sanctions and that “we do not believe that the one-day screening of the director’s cut unrated version has violated the M.P.A.A.’s Classification and Rating Rules.” If the hearings end in sanctions, “The House That Jack Built” could have its R rating revoked, something the M.P.A.A. has done four times before. In addition, sanctions could mean a delay in rating future IFC Films and suspension of IFC’s participation in the ratings system for up to 90 days. In a worst-case scenario, some theaters that planned on running the film could decide to pull it because it is unrated. A representative for the movie referred comment to IFC Films, which did not respond.",The New York Times
2018,PG? NC-17? She Made Such Calls for 30 Years,"SHERMAN OAKS, Calif. — Joan Graves, 77, has seen enough sex on screen for five lifetimes. New and inventive ways to kill people? Don’t get her started. She has spent decades assessing off-color humor, deciding what constitutes glamorized smoking and counting instances of the F-word. Only once, she said, has a horror movie been so violent that one of her employees lost consciousness. Paramedics arrived and hauled the staffer away on a stretcher. Graves is Hollywood’s ratings czarina. For 30 years, she has watched movies — at least 12,500, she figures — and assigned grades of G to NC-17 so parents can make decisions about what is appropriate viewing for children. For 18 of those years Graves has served as the ratings system’s chairwoman, sparring with boundary-pushing filmmakers who call her too prudish, and, at the same time, defending her process to activists and parents who deem her grades too permissive. But her reign is ending. The Motion Picture Association of America said on Nov. 15 that Graves would retire in the coming months, to be succeeded by Kelly McMahon, 45, an M.P.A.A. lawyer with a 7-year-old son. “I decided it was time, if only because it doesn’t look good to have a granny in charge,” Graves said in her no-nonsense way. “I can tell you honestly, though, I still love movies. That has never gone away.” Graves, who studied political science at Stanford University and started out as a stockbroker, was recruited by the Motion Picture Association in 1988, when her youngest daughter was 9. The organization was looking for someone “sensible,” she said. Charles H. Rivkin, the Motion Picture Association’s chairman and chief executive, called her an “institution” whose contributions to film ratings are “immeasurable.” For directors and studios, her decisions have carried enormous business implications: The difference between ratings — PG-13 versus R, or even G versus PG — can mean millions of dollars in ticket sales. But not everyone in Hollywood is a fan, including the Oscar-nominated documentarian Kirby Dick, who made an entire movie in 2006, “This Film Is Not Yet Rated,” about the ratings system. In an email on Thursday, Dick blamed Graves for, among other things, allowing “films with excessive violence to be rated PG-13, resulting in tens of millions of children being exposed to traumatizing violent imagery.” Consider this her exit interview. Over scrambled eggs at a cafe near her office in suburban Los Angeles, Graves spoke of her most challenging moments on the job, the rating she now believes she got wrong, and images she can’t unsee. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You’ve never lost your love of movies? I have a hard time believing that. Not even while sitting through “The Hottie and the Nottie”? During the really horrible movies, I often find myself wondering, “Who gave them money to make this?” There have been times when I have felt worn down — when directors try to outdo each other with sadistic stuff. Did we really need that 15-minute rape scene? But then not long after will come a film that is intriguing and well written and restores your love. At this point, could a filmmaker kill a character in a way that would surprise you? I shouldn’t say no, because then they’d try. Why do ratings seem harder on nudity than on violence? We don’t set standards, we reflect them. What are parents most concerned about? Overall, there is something about graphic nudity in this country. We are all graphically nude a couple times of day, so I don’t quite get it. What has been your most challenging moment as head of the ratings system? Harvey Weinstein was a great frustration. The last run-in I had with him was on a movie about a transgender character. He floated out to the news media that we gave it an R because of the transgender story line. That was not at all the case. It was an R for ubiquitous language — the F-word throughout. Harvey routinely preyed on our policy of treating each film like an attorney would a client: We give the rating and the descriptor and do not publicly discuss our internal deliberations. He would use that to his advantage to create controversy and get attention for his product. As a result of Harvey’s blanketing the airwaves with “the ratings board is totally out of touch,” we did an in-depth survey through Nielsen. Just how do parents feel about foul language? Guess what: They wanted us to be even stricter! (Mr. Weinstein did not respond to a request for comment. The rating for “3 Generations,” the film with the transgender character, was reduced to PG-13 after edits were made.) Have you ever made a mistake? Nielsen recently conducted a survey about your system and 84 percent of parents said they found ratings to be accurate, which is pretty impressive. “Cars 2.” We rated it G and from all the feedback we realized PG would have been more suitable. Speaking of the G rating, it has evaporated. Last year, there were 11 movies with that rating. In 1969, there were 101. Why? Studios want the rating they think will be most commercial. It’s almost as if they throw in a “hell” or a “damn” just to get a PG. What other trends in content have you noticed? One year, not too far back, practically every picture seemed to have someone urinating on the side of the road. Right now, having a conversation while sitting on the toilet is big. One year, everyone was throwing up. I think it’s young filmmakers thinking: “Oh, that’s cool. I’ll do that too.” Is there any movie that you can’t unsee? When I first started, we still had the X rating. There were still a good number of theaters playing double X and triple X films. So we had to watch those — and the rules state that we have to watch the whole movie, so we do. I still have some images in my head from that period that I’d love to get rid of. What has been the best part of your job? Exposure to the creative types. Directors. Some have been bullies and nasty. Most have been extremely articulate, educated and knowledgeable — far more thoughtful about what they want to project on the screen than I would have ever thought. I once described the ratings system as confusing in an article. You were not happy. “Byzantine” was your word. That’s a pet peeve, as long as I’m being candid. Our process is laid out right there on our website. The board is made up of a rotating group of parents and they watch movies and each person assigns a rating immediately after and … then what? A senior rater announces the tally and leads a discussion. Was the vote a slam dunk or was it wishy-washy? They discuss the content and form the ratings descriptor on the spot. Submitters are then informed of the rating. Many times they will say: “We agree with your assessment of the ratings, but we don’t want to market it that way. We want to edit it to get another rating.” At that point, the senior rater can tell them — not as an industry professional, but as a parent — what led to the rating. Was it the shot to the head with the blood on the wall? Then they can edit and submit it again if they want. By my count, you have outlasted at least 27 studio chiefs. When I first became a rater, I thought, “Well, I’ll do this for three months, and then I’ll have to get a real job.” What was the first movie you rated and what was the last? On my first day I rated three, and one starred Ben Kingsley and was set on a Greek island. That’s all I remember. The last one was yesterday, and, to tell you the truth, I can’t remember its name, either. I can wipe my brain clean afterward, which is actually helpful — one analysis doesn’t bleed into another. An earlier version of this article misstated when Joan Graves will retire. She will leave in the coming months, not by the end of the year.",The New York Times
2018,"Pablo Ferro, Who Energized Films’ Opening Credits, Dies at 83","Pablo Ferro, who with quick cuts, hand lettering and a bundle of innovative ideas put a jolt into the often drab world of movies’ opening credits, died on Nov. 16 in Sedona, Ariz. He was 83. The cause was complications of pneumonia, his son, Allen, said. Mr. Ferro burst into the film business in 1964 with his attention-getting title sequence for “Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,” Stanley Kubrick’s nuclear-age black comedy. His hand-lettered titles, full of incongruous sizes (the gigantic “A” in “A STANLEY KUBRICK PRODUCTION” dwarfed the other words), appeared over footage of aircraft refueling in midflight. In a 2009 article about groundbreakers in Mr. Ferro’s profession, The New York Times called it “the title sequence that inspired a thousand hand-drawn title sequences.” Dozens of films followed, many of them Oscar contenders, including “Philadelphia” (1993) and “Good Will Hunting” (1997). In 2009, presenting him its highest award, AIGA, the professional design association, recognized Mr. Ferro for “changing our visual expectations and demonstrating the power of design to enhance storytelling.” Pablo Francisco Ferro was born on Jan. 15, 1935, in Antilla, Cuba. His father, José, was a dentist, and his mother, Isabel (Rivas) Ferro, was a homemaker. “Everywhere I went I drew pictures,” he said of his childhood in “Pablo,” a 2012 documentary about him directed by Richard Goldgewicht. The family moved to New York City when Pablo was 12. His father left two years later, according to the documentary, and Pablo went to work at whatever jobs he could find to help his mother support the family. One job was as an usher at a movie house that showed foreign films, and a love of cinema took hold. He was also teaching himself animation from a book, and after graduating from the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in the early 1950s, he began working alongside Stan Lee drawing science fiction comics. Soon, though, he transitioned to television commercials. “Most of the artists in comics stayed with the comics most of their lives,” Mr. Lee, who died four days before Mr. Ferro did, said in the documentary. “The fact that Pablo was able to go from comic book art to directing commercials — that was a tribute to Pablo’s talent.” Allen Ferro, himself a graphic designer and director, said one of his father’s strengths was becoming adept at all the jobs required for any given project, whether creating graphics, animating or directing, a lesson he passed along. “He was a warrior when it came to being diversified in skill sets,” the son said. “He imbued in most of us the necessity and responsibility of understanding each of the departments that were in your industry.” In 1961 Mr. Ferro, Fred Mogubgub and Lew Schwartz formed a commercial production partnership that within a year was drawing attention with visually jazzy commercials that shook up what had been a bland business. “Among the few hopeful producers working diligently and with signs of success to inject novelty and a species of art into the message from our sponsor are Ferro, Mogubgub and Schwartz,” The New York Times wrote in 1962. Mr. Ferro’s fast-moving commercials, mixing stills, film clips and animation, caught the eye of Kubrick, who was making “Dr. Strangelove.” “He saw my reel, and he wanted me to do his trailer, even though I have never done a trailer before,” Mr. Ferro said in the documentary. The trailer he produced, a blizzard of written words and images, led to the invitation to do the title sequence as well. The film installed Mr. Ferro among a group of artists who had begun to experiment with ways to make title sequences convey more than just who worked on the movie. Saul Bass became a pioneer with his sequence for the 1955 film “The Man With the Golden Arm,” and others, like Stephen Frankfurt (“To Kill a Mockingbird,” 1962), were also using opening credits to set a tone and heighten expectations. Mr. Ferro worked with top directors like Norman Jewison, Jonathan Demme, Barry Sonnenfeld and Hal Ashby, who became a close friend. In 1971 he received another assignment from Mr. Kubrick: to make the trailer for “A Clockwork Orange.” The phrase “quick cut” seems inadequate to describe the result, which remains visually startling almost a half-century later, its words and images coming at the viewer so fast as to be almost unabsorbable. “One time I was accused of subliminal advertising,” Mr. Ferro said of his fondness for that technique. “They would say, ‘Pablo, I’m sure somewhere in there there’s a frame that says ‘Hire Pablo.’ ” Mr. Ferro was not limited to titles and trailers; directors tapped his expertise in other aspects of the filmmaking process. For “The Thomas Crown Affair,” the slick 1968 Steve McQueen thriller, Mr. Jewison, the director, wanted to shorten the movie and sought Mr. Ferro’s editing help. Mr. Ferro used a multiple-screen effect that has since become commonplace but was new at the time. He did not receive an editing credit, but his contribution was later widely cited. “Ferro cut a key scene known as the ‘polo sequence’ into 20 or 30 simultaneous frames, reducing the time from six minutes to around 40 seconds,” Steven Heller, an expert in graphic design, wrote in the magazine Eye in 1999. “But in addition to compression, certain important character traits were brought out by the way in which he designed and paced the multiples. By focusing on clothes, for instance, Ferro underscored the wealth and sophistication of the people in the specific scene.” Mr. Ferro’s marriage to Susan Fridolfs ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Joy Moore; a brother, José; three sisters, Flora, Bertha and Maria; and two grandchildren. He lived in Sedona. In a 2002 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Mr. Ferro explained why he invested so much effort in opening credits. “The title sequence is the story,” he said. “It’s the introduction to the movie. It’s telling you what kind of feeling you’re going to get into. If you fail doing that, the whole movie falls apart.” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled parts of the names of Mr. Ferro’s partners in a commercial production company. They were Fred Mogubgub, not Magubgub, and Lew Schwartz, not Louis.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Packing Tips for an Evacuation,"Benefit from my hard-earned experience. Ms. Markoe is a comedy writer. Three weeks ago, everyone in my house crammed our worldly belongings into a Prius and fled from the billowing black clouds that were racing toward us over the hills and down the canyons from the fast moving Woolsey Fire. Unlike the previous fires I’d lived through, this one gave us no real warning. We woke to a mandatory evacuation notice from the city of Malibu, leaving us no choice but to wedge our car into a line of traffic creeping down the Pacific Coast Highway, the only artery out of the area. On the bright side, I got to see for the first time that when driving 1 mile per hour, the engine of my hybrid car really did rely on its electric part and consumed no gas during the six hours it took us to go less than 25 miles. On Tuesday, I was temporarily allowed back into the neighborhood for the first time in 12 days. It’s hard to describe the gratitude and relief I felt at seeing my house still standing there, relatively unharmed. Even my uncleaned messes were as I remembered them. In fact, everything seemed relatively O.K. until I walked around the block and saw firsthand the once-lovely homes of friends that were now completely destroyed. And even the worst of what happened in my area doesn’t compare with the stories that were coming out of Paradise, Calif., at the same time — a situation so terrifying it’s beyond imagining. I don’t know if the desire to try to take grim data and make it into something useful is built into human DNA or if it’s simply a product of my having consumed too much self-help literature in the 1980s. But as I sit here camped out at a friend’s house, waiting for the all-clear to return home, I find myself overcome with the desire to turn the experience into something useful. I can’t rebuild everyone’s house by myself or do much to help those mourning loved ones lost in the Camp Fire. But I believe I can help you plan for when it’s your turn to flee from the flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, wildfire or nonspecific global warming related catastrophe that may be headed your way. In my experience, whatever your disaster, at some point a uniformed public servant will begin screaming at you through a bullhorn that you must leave now. But packing in preparation for fleeing involves making split second decisions without a clear head. This time as I packed, a voice in my head said, “Quickly, just grab the clothes you like best.” That seemingly sensible idea became the reason that I now wake up every morning to two pairs of pants that do not fit, five shirts that I cannot wear because they require dry cleaning and no shoes. Of course, I did better this time than I did with the last fire, when I wound up sleeping on a friend’s couch for five days wrapped in the leashes of four large dogs. There, I made the unhappy discovery that I’d packed no bras or underwear, yet had somehow brought along the program from my sixth grade dance recital. That is why I recommend that you maintain, year round, a carefully packed box containing important papers, such as your birth certificate, passport, insurance policies, selected sentimental photos that are too glued into bulky photo albums to be digitized. And by the way, why did you glue them down like that? What is wrong with you? But now is not the time for recriminations. While you’re in preparation mode, don’t forget to include a list of all your internet passwords, even though it will turn out to be a futile gesture because every single site you sign onto during your emergency will tell you that your username or password is incorrect. So forget I even mentioned that one. Having accomplished that, breathe a sigh of relief, despite the fact that when you get to your place of safety, you will discover that repeated emergency raids to this prepacked box of important papers over the years have removed all things of importance and left in their place some old mail and a note full of incomprehensible jokes someone passed to you during a history test in the eighth grade. Why you took these things on an emergency evacuation will remain a mystery that will puzzle the ages. Some frequently asked questions about packing for an evacuation: Realize that all the items of clothing you pack will quickly blend together into one big mix-and-match outfit. You’ll discover that the only T-shirt you packed says “I’m FUN!” in 8-inch letters. (It was turned inside out in the drawer when you grabbed what you thought was a plain white shirt.) Just accept the fact that you’ll be seen in public wearing it with a pair of plaid pajama bottoms, a straw hat and a shawl made out of a duvet cover. No. When I packed a lot of makeup this time, I forgot that an older woman dressed in a T-shirt that screams “I’m fun,” only looks weirder if she also has a face full of makeup. You will have two choices: 1) Dorothea Lange’s Dust Bowl studies 2) The entire canon of Diane Arbus. The best you can hope for, if all goes well, is a look that says: “I’m in the middle of doing my laundry. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wondering, I’m fun.” Your clothing choices are now a superpower. Understand that a disaster is sent from a universe that finds amusement in backing you into a corner to see what you will do. Would you like to see more rain? Pack only thin cotton shirts and flip-flops. Would you like the weather to warm up a little? Pack only clothes made of wool. Whatever climate you prepare for, the opposite will materialize — an unexpected consequence of imagining you can properly prepare for anything. Pack only the clothes that are comfortable and utilitarian enough to accommodate spending the night on the floor of a middle school cafeteria, yet are also perfect for cleaning out a refrigerator full of rotting food that has learned to masquerade as an aerial photo of Neptune as it patiently awaits your return. There is something else I’ve learned in my multiple evacuations. If you’re lucky enough to have made it somewhere safely, with Spotify intact, you discover that there’s a Tom Petty song for every moment. Petty is the poet laureate of evacuation. Right now, I’m humming “Free Falling.” Yesterday, I was singing “Don’t have to live like a refugee.” It’s probably not a coincidence that Tom Petty was a resident of Malibu.

2018,Padma Lakshmi: ‘Talent Is Not Somehow a Pass’ for Abusive Men,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Padma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement. But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one’s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn’t be driven by a man’s being good at a certain job. “Their talent is not somehow a pass,” she said at the DealBook conference Playing for the Long Term. “It does not exempt them from really having to be disgraced, because what they did was disgraceful.” (Check out the latest from the DealBook conference.) It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience, which erupted in rare mid-presentation applause after Ms. Lakshmi’s comments. Ms. Borders simply pointed to Ms. Lakshmi and said she agreed “100 percent.” The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders. Ms. Lakshmi, the host and an executive producer of “Top Chef” as well as model, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in September revealing that she was raped at the age of 16 and empathizing with women who waited years to disclose sexual assault. The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn’t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago. Ms. Borders, formerly the president of the W.N.B.A., was named chief executive of Time’s Up, a legal advocacy group for women in the workplace, last month, and her first day on the job was Thursday. The organization aims to tackle workplace discrimination around the world. The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised. “We need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that’s a big part of it,” Ms. Lakshmi said. Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole. “We add value,” Ms. Borders said. Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not “our burden to bear but society’s burden to bear.” “And it lit fire,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Pain and Sense of Betrayal as Canada G.M. Factory Closes After a Century,"OSHAWA, Ontario — General Motors has been making cars in Oshawa, Ontario, for more than a century in factories that once employed upward of 40,000 people, so the company’s announcement on Monday that it would stop production brought recriminations from across the Canadian political spectrum. But for Eva McKeen, an inspector in the paint shop that looms over the north end of the vast manufacturing complex, the pain and the sense of betrayal went far beyond political and economic arguments. “Just as you’re getting older to know that you don’t have a job, it’s really heart-wrenching,” she said. Ms. McKeen was among the hundreds of workers who walked out of the plant in protest just before managers were about to announce its death sentence. Outside, they began waving red flags while blockading the complex’s truck entrances. The ponchos they wore, bearing the logo of their union, Unifor, offered scant protection against the sleet coming down. “The last thing we want to do is walk off the line, we really don’t want to do that,” Ms. McKeen said. “We just want G.M. to work with us.” [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] G.M.’s Oshawa plant is a shadow of its past. The two remaining assembly lines now employ about 2,500 unionized workers and 300 salaried employees. Nevertheless, the closing announcement sent shock waves not just through Oshawa but across Canada. Long the largest car producer in Canada, G.M. lost that title to Toyota last year and will likely end up in the fourth or fifth position after the Oshawa closing. The overwhelming majority of the cars made in Canada are sent to American buyers. The economic importance of the automotive industry to Canada meant that both the Ontario provincial and Canadian federal governments joined with Washington to bail out General Motors during its bankruptcy a decade ago. And preserving access to the United States auto market was one of Canada’s key objectives during the recent renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. On Monday, G.M. workers packed into a local union hall to watch a news conference called by their union leaders, and their anger soon became apparent. As Jerry Dias, the union’s national president, vowed he would hold the company to the current contract that does not allow it to reduce or shut down plants until 2020, the crowd frequently drowned him out with shouts of disapproval for G.M. “We’re sick and tired of General Motors shipping all of our jobs to Mexico,” Mr. Dias said. “We will do whatever it take to get them to reverse their decision.” But several politicians on Monday downplayed any idea that G.M. might have a change of heart about the closure. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said the president of General Motors had told him, “The ship has already left the dock.” Outside the House of Commons in Ottawa, Navdeep Bains, the federal minister responsible for industry, said, “We’re willing to engage and work with them but they’ve been clear about their position.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had expressed his “deep disappointment” about the closing to Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive. He added that the government is looking at measures to help jobless G.M. workers “get back on their feet.” Greig Mordue, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and the former general manager of Toyota’s manufacturing operations in Canada, said that Oshawa’s location ultimately doomed the factory. Most of Canada’s other assembly plants, including a G.M. factory that will remain open, are west or north of the country’s largest city, Toronto, along highways providing direct and easy links to Michigan and Ohio. Oshawa sits on the other side of Toronto, along an infamously congested corridor. “This is like a 100-year-old grandma dying,” Mr. Mordue said. “It’s sad but it is not surprising.” It takes relatively little effort to find G.M. employees in Oshawa who are third- and sometimes even fourth-generation members of their family to work for the company. Even with the closing, the company won’t completely disappear from the city. Its Canadian headquarters will remain on the edge of town, and it also has an engineering center in the city that researches alternative-fuel vehicles. After the company’s troubles in 2008, much of its work force was reduced through early retirements. But there are comparatively few older workers in the Oshawa plant today. Unifor estimates the average age of current workers is between 30 and 40 and that they have just 15 years of service, far too little for anything approaching a full pension. Scott Aquanno, a political scientist at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has studied previous G.M. layoffs, said the local economy’s diversity — many people commute to jobs in and around Toronto — will help buffer the effects of the layoffs. But he said those left jobless will find it difficult, if not impossible, to find work with similar pay and benefits. Timothy Martin, the 33-year-old son of a 32-year veteran of G.M., was only hired full time this year. Sitting in special coveralls with flaps to prevent its zippers from scratching the pickup trucks on which he installs airbags and wiring, Mr. Martin said that he was confident he would find work in the construction trades, but added he was still worried for the city’s future in the wake of the closings. “Oshawa has a dark underbelly,” he said. “I don’t want to see how dark it can get.”",The New York Times
2018,Pakistan Angered by Trump’s Claim That It Does ‘Nothing’ for U.S.,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan reacted angrily on Monday to criticism by President Trump that the country had not done enough in return for years of United States military aid and that the government had harbored Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. In an interview with “Fox News Sunday” this weekend, Mr. Trump defended his decision early this year to withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid to Pakistan. “I ended it because they don’t do anything for us, they don’t do a damn thing for us,” he said. Mr. Trump also alleged that the Pakistani government had known Bin Laden was living in the country before he was killed in an American military raid in 2011. The president doubled down on his criticism on Twitter on Monday, citing Bin Laden and the Taliban resurgence in neighboring Afghanistan as examples of how Pakistan would “take our money and do nothing for us.” Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan responded by saying that Pakistan had suffered enough fighting terrorism on behalf of the United States. “Now we will do what is best for our people & our interests,” he wrote on Twitter. The exchange aggravated an already tense relationship between the two countries. American officials have long complained that Pakistan has failed to act against terrorist networks operating within its borders; Pakistan denies that the networks are even present. The Haqqani network, which is allied with the Afghan Taliban, is a particular source of friction between the two countries. Mr. Khan, a populist politician who was elected in July, is a longtime critic of United States policy toward Pakistan, railing against the American use of drones to target militants in the country’s tribal regions. He has accused the Pakistani military of kowtowing to the United States in the past. Despite his criticism, Mr. Khan says that he is not anti-American and stresses that he wants the relationship between the two countries to be based on mutual respect. The United States and Pakistan enjoyed relatively warmer relations in the years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when Washington considered Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s military ruler until 2008, a close ally. But the relationship turned sour amid mutual mistrust, with officials on both sides accusing each other of not doing enough. The relationship worsened in 2011 with the American raid on Bin Laden’s compound, which was carried out without Pakistan’s knowledge. Bin Laden had been living in the city of Abbottabad, not far from a military training school. Pakistani military officials have denied knowing Bin Laden’s whereabouts, arguing that incompetence rather than complicity kept them from alerting the United States. But that has done little to assuage American skepticism. “Living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there,” Mr. Trump told Fox News. In a series of Twitter posts earlier on Monday, Mr. Khan expressed disapproval of what he called Mr. Trump’s interview “tirade.” Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Khan is fond of using Twitter to make announcements and respond to criticism. Mr. Khan said Pakistan had joined the United States’ “war on terror” in 2001, even though no Pakistanis had been involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. He said Pakistan had “suffered 75,000 casualties” in that effort and experienced more than $123 billion in economic losses, compared with United States aid of $20 billion. Mr. Khan added that his country continued to provide the United States with free lines of ground and air communication. “Can Mr. Trump name another ally that gave such sacrifices?” he asked. Other Pakistani politicians also responded to Mr. Trump’s interview with anger and accusations. Khawaja Muhammad Asif, a former foreign minister, described Pakistan’s relationship with the United States as one of nothing but “betrayal and sanctions.” Shireen Mazari, the Pakistani human rights minister and a critic of American policy, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump had “perpetual historic amnesia.” She said Mr. Trump’s comments should be a lesson for past Pakistani leaders who had acquiesced to United States demands. “Once again, history shows appeasement does not work,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Pakistan Makes Concessions to Protesters in Blasphemy Case,"KARACHI, Pakistan — After protesters blocked highways and forced the closing of schools and businesses, the Pakistani government and Islamist leaders enraged over the acquittal of a Christian woman accused of blasphemy reached an agreement on Friday night that allows further appeals and bars her from leaving the country. The woman, Asia Bibi, was convicted in 2010 on little evidence of violating Pakistan’s law against blasphemy by insulting the Prophet Muhammad. She spent years on death row before she was acquitted on Wednesday by the country’s Supreme Court. Despite her legal victory, which was hailed worldwide by rights groups, Ms. Bibi’s lawyers and her family have expressed fears for her safety because hard-line Islamist parties in Pakistan have called for her execution. Under the accord, which some analysts viewed as a capitulation to extremists, the government agreed not to oppose the filing of an appeal in the Supreme Court of Ms. Bibi’s acquittal. It also agreed to initiate legal proceedings to prevent her from traveling abroad. The government also said it would release all protesters who had been arrested since Wednesday. For their part, the protesting religious leaders offered an apology if their statements had offended anyone, an apparent reference to their criticism of the military leadership. While several Western countries have offered to grant Ms. Bibi asylum, allowing her to leave Pakistan immediately would provoke further turmoil for the new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Mr. Khan is on a visit to China, seeking a financial bailout package for the country’s distressed economy. The protesters, led by a firebrand cleric named Khadim Hussain Rizvi, had been demanding that Ms. Bibi be placed on the so-called exit-control list, a roster of people barred from leaving Pakistan. Ben-Her Gill, a leader of the Christian community in Islamabad, the capital, said Ms. Bibi was still in Pakistan, at a secret location under the protection of the authorities. Protesters took to the streets of several cities on Friday, demanding that the Supreme Court reverse its ruling and that the three justices on the panel that had issued it, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, be dismissed. Mobile networks were suspended in Islamabad and in three other major cities in Pakistan’s largest province, Punjab, as the authorities tried to stop protesters from organizing and expanding the demonstrations. A highway connecting Islamabad to the city of Lahore was blocked, and rail networks across the country were severely slowed by the protests. Schools in Islamabad, Punjab and Kashmir were closed because of the demonstrations. Religious leaders had also demanded the ouster of the head of Pakistan’s military, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, accusing him of acquiescing to Ms. Bibi’s release. Soon after the Supreme Court’s ruling, Pir Muhammad Afzal Qadri, another prominent protest leader, urged army generals to revolt against their top commander. The military said Friday that it had nothing to do with Ms. Bibi’s release. “The armed forces hope that this matter is resolved without disruption of peace,” Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesman, was quoted by state-run media as saying. Ms. Bibi, a mother of five in her early 50s, has been a central figure in the debate over Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws, which critics say are often used to persecute and intimidate members of religious minorities. Blasphemy is a highly combustible subject in Pakistan, with emotions flaring over mere rumors that Islam has been insulted. People accused of it are often killed by mobs even before the police can take action, rights groups say. Ms. Bibi was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad after getting into an argument with Muslim farm workers in June 2009 in her native village in Punjab. She was dragged to a local police station and charged with blasphemy. In 2010 she was convicted and sentenced to death, the first woman ever sent to Pakistan’s death row for blasphemy. In 2011, Salmaan Taseer, an outspoken secular governor of Punjab Province who had campaigned for Ms. Bibi’s release and for changes in the blasphemy laws, was shot and killed by his own police bodyguard outside a cafe in an upscale area of Islamabad. Two months later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister of minorities and the only Christian cabinet minister in the Pakistani government, was shot to death outside his home in Islamabad after he, too, called for changes to the blasphemy law. “The stakes attached to Ms Bibi’s case are extremely high,” said Saroop Ijaz, a lawyer based in Lahore. “These groups have always extracted their pound of flesh,” said Mr. Ijaz, who predicted that the government would be forced to give in to some of the protesters’ demands. “They’ve escalated to a point where it has become difficult for the government to avoid that fate. What that means for Asia Bibi, who has endured close to a decade of incarceration, remains uncertain.” OpinionMohammed Hanif",The New York Times
2018,Pakistani Christian Freed After Being Cleared in Blasphemy Case,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani Christian woman who was cleared last week of blasphemy charges after spending eight years on death row has been released from prison but remains under government protection because of threats to her life, officials said Thursday. The woman, Asia Bibi, was released from a prison in central Pakistan and flown to the capital, Islamabad, late Wednesday night, a senior government official said Thursday on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. One official, however, denied news reports that Ms. Bibi had already flown out of the country. “She is in Pakistan,” said Mohammad Faisal, the spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign office. Ms. Bibi’s family has appealed for asylum, saying she is in grave danger as hard-line Islamists call for her execution. Her lawyer, Saiful Malook, has already left Pakistan, citing threats to his own life. The Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, on Thursday offered Mr. Malook a place in the Netherlands’ Shelter City program, under which human rights advocates facing danger are allowed to stay temporarily in a Dutch city. “The situation of Asia Bibi has our full attention,” Mr. Blok said on Twitter. The Supreme Court acquitted Ms. Bibi on Oct. 31 in an exceptionally rare ruling against a blasphemy verdict. The three-member bench concluded that there was little evidence that Ms. Bibi, a farmworker and mother of three, had spoken against the Prophet Muhammad during a heated argument with Muslim women in 2009. She was convicted and sentenced to death in 2010, a verdict that drew worldwide condemnation and focused attention on Pakistan’s blasphemy law, which critics say has been used to persecute religious minorities. The Supreme Court’s ruling last week clearing Ms. Bibi set off violent protests across the country that were spearheaded by Khadim Hussian Rizvi, a fiery religious cleric. Mr. Rizvi’s supporters paralyzed large parts of the country for two days, blocked highways and damaged several dozen vehicles. Religious leaders called for the three Supreme Court judges on the panel that acquitted Ms. Bibi to be killed, and they urged generals to revolt against the army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, who they accused of acquiescing to Ms. Bibi’s release. The protests were called off only after the government agreed to allow a review of the verdict and initiate legal proceedings to bar Ms. Bibi from leaving the country. The government has been walking a tightrope as it tries to calm religious sentiments while also standing by Ms. Bibi after her acquittal. Officials have warned that Islamist leaders will be put under house arrest if they plan more street protests over Ms. Bibi’s fate. But hard-line religious leaders have traditionally paid little heed to such warnings, and in recent years they have organized large, crippling protests. Blasphemy is an incendiary subject in Pakistan, and the authorities have often been unable to control the violence and riots that have sometimes erupted over mere accusations. In 2011, Salmaan Taseer, an outspoken, secular governor of Punjab Province who had campaigned for Ms. Bibi’s release and for changes in the blasphemy laws, was shot and killed by his own police bodyguard, who was subsequently hailed by many as a hero. Last November, thousands of supporters of Mr. Rizvi’s religious party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, paralyzed Islamabad for days with protests over a proposed new oath for lawmakers, angry because the wording did not mention the Prophet Muhammad. The law minister was forced to resign over the omission, which the protesters considered blasphemy. The Supreme Court is expected to take up the review of Ms. Bibi’s acquittal next week. Mr. Malook, Ms. Bibi’s lawyer, said the military had assured him that his client was safe. “The Pakistani Army assured me that she remains safe, that nobody shall hurt her, and that she should be allowed to leave provided that she is safe,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Pakistani Religious Leader Known as ‘Father of the Taliban’ Is Killed,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani Muslim spiritual leader known as the “father of the Taliban” was killed Friday evening by a knife-wielding attacker who sneaked into his bedroom, officials said, further roiling the country’s combustible religious tensions. The leader, Maulana Sami ul-Haq, 81, exerted an overarching influence over the Taliban movement in neighboring Afghanistan and within Pakistan and led his own faction of a religious party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. “He has been stabbed to death,” said Fawad Chaudhry, the country’s information minister. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and the circumstances of the killing were unusual. Mr. Haq was resting at home in the city of Rawalpindi adjacent to Islamabad when he was stabbed. Police officials said an unidentified assailant entered the house while Mr. Haq’s personal staff members were at a nearby market. They said the attacker went into Mr. Haq’s bedroom, stabbed him in the chest and shoulder multiple times and left. The religious leader was rushed to a hospital when his personal staff returned, but doctors said he died from blood loss. Police detained his driver and personal assistant for questioning. “We don’t blame anyone at this moment, but he was on the hit list of enemies of Islam,” Syed Yousaf Shah, a senior leader and spokesman of Mr. Haq’s party, said by phone. “The motive for killing him and who is behind it is being investigated.” The killing jolted Pakistan just as the government was grappling with protests by religious hard-liners after the country’s Supreme Court acquitted a Pakistani Christian woman on charges of blasphemy, a capital crime here. The government reached a truce Friday night with Islamist leaders enraged over the acquittal of the woman, Asia Bibi, in what appeared to be a victory for the religious right. In a return for the end of the protests, officials agreed not to oppose a further appeal of the acquittal and said it would take steps to prevent Ms. Bibi from leaving the country. Several Western countries have offered her asylum. Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, who has been visiting China seeking financial aid, condemned the killing of Mr. Haq, saying his country was now “bereft of a great religious scholar and renowned political leader.” Mr. Khan ordered an immediate inquiry into the killing, saying Mr. Haq’s religious and political contributions to Pakistan “would be remembered forever.” Mr. Haq ran a seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania, in the town of Akora Khattak in the northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. A large number of Taliban leaders attended the seminary. The students had always hailed Mr. Haq as the “father of the Taliban.” Mr. Haq took pride in the title and was quoted as saying that in local tradition, a teacher is like a father, a spiritual leader. “We strongly condemn the martyrdom of senior Islamic and jihadi leader, Maulana Sami ul-Haq,” Muhammad Khurasani, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said by phone Friday evening. “His death is a great loss for the entire Muslim nation.” Mr. Haq was politically active and served two terms as a senator in his long career. He was known to have good ties with Pakistan’s security establishment. Last month, an Afghan delegation met with Mr. Haq and asked him to play a mediating role in peace talks with the Taliban. Mr. Haq agreed to play a part but accused the United States and other international powers of obstructing peace efforts in Afghanistan. Mr. Haq was a fervent supporter of the Afghan struggle against the Soviets in the 1980s and later supported the Taliban movement. He was vocal about his anti-American beliefs, and said the presence of United States troops inside Afghanistan had only prolonged the turmoil there. Analysts said the killing of Mr. Haq was more likely to affect Pakistan’s internal politics than the effort to revive peace talks in Afghanistan. His seminary, spread over several acres, has received financial support from successive Pakistani governments. Mr. Khan, the prime minister, often praised Mr. Haq for his support in the polio eradication campaign in the northwestern province and in tribal regions. Mr. Haq acted as one of the representatives of the Pakistani Taliban in 2014 when the government held peace talks with the militants. The talks eventually collapsed, and a military operation was undertaken against the militants. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was a graduate of a seminary run by Maulana Sami ul-Haq in northwestern Pakistan. Other senior Taliban figures were among the school’s alumni, but Mullah Omar did not study there. The article also misspelled the name of a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban. He is Muhammad Khurasani, not Khurrasni.",The New York Times
2018,"Palau Bans Many Kinds of Sunscreen, Citing Threat to Coral","SYDNEY, Australia — The Western Pacific nation of Palau has become the first country to ban many kinds of sunscreen, in a move to protect its coral reefs from chemicals that scientists say cause significant damage. Under the ban, which will take effect in 2020, “reef toxic” sunscreen — defined as containing one of 10 prohibited chemicals, a list that could grow later — can be confiscated from tourists when they enter the country, and retailers who sell it can be fined up to $1,000. Damage to coral reefs worldwide from climate change has been widely reported, but scientists say there is growing evidence that chemicals from sunscreen, which washes off swimmers or enters the ocean through sewer systems, also causes grave harm. Palau passed the ban into law last week. President Tommy Remengesau called it “especially timely,” saying that a major impetus was a 2017 report that found sunscreen products to be “widespread” in Jellyfish Lake, one of the country’s Unesco World Heritage sites. It has been estimated that 14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited in the world’s oceans each year, and scientists say a number of studies have shown the product’s adverse effects on coral reefs. Researchers found that even a low concentration of sunscreen in the water can hinder the development of young coral, said Dr. Selina Ward, a lecturer in coral reef ecology and physiology at the University of Queensland in Australia. Studies have also shown that chemicals in sunscreen can cause localized coral bleaching, and can disrupt the reproduction of fish by interfering with their hormonal systems, Dr. Ward said. Chemicals in sunscreen can be “bigger than climate change” in causing damage to reefs, Craig Downs, the executive director of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Virginia, said this year. In 2015, Mr. Downs led a team that found that oxybenzone, which is commonly used in sunscreen, stunts coral growth and is toxic for the algae that live within reefs, providing their color and performing other vital functions. In May, Hawaii became the first state to ban the sale of sunscreen containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, another chemical that scientists say is damaging to coral. The ban is scheduled to go into effect in January 2021. Nonbiodegradable sunscreen is banned in some parts of Mexico. At Xel-Há, a tourist development on the Riviera Maya, visitors can swap banned sunscreen for more coral-friendly varieties and get their own back when they leave. Not all sunscreens are “reef toxic.” But “some of the sunscreens without these chemicals are quite expensive, which is a disincentive,” Dr. Ward said. “I’m sure someone will get it soon, and put out these products at an affordable rate.” The most common commercial sunscreen brands contain oxybenzone, Dr. Ward said. But she also warned against mineral-based sunscreens containing zinc oxide. They were once considered safer for coral, she said, but a recent study found that zinc oxide can cause coral bleaching as well as microbial enrichment, causing more bacteria to form in the water. “I think wearing fabrics on your body is the best alternative to sunscreen,” she said. “We have stinger suits in the summer, when it’s too hot for a wet suit. Cover your whole body in Lycra — an attractive look, if you can imagine.” She noted that reefs are under threat from major, global phenomena, including global warming and pollution of the oceans. By comparison, she said, sunscreen is “the one that we can solve.” Sunscreen manufacturers, not surprisingly, opposed the Hawaii ban. But they aren’t alone in arguing that commercial sunscreens do more good than harm. “At the moment, research on sunscreens’ effects on coral is limited,” said Heather Walker, chairwoman of the Cancer Council Australia’s National Skin Cancer Committee. “By contrast, the evidence that sunscreen prevents skin cancer is conclusive. In this context, a ban is hasty.” Currently, Ms. Walker said, there is no accepted standard for what constitutes “environmentally friendly” sunscreen. “We would be concerned if Australians stopped using sunscreen more generally,” she said. Kim Do, a senior industry analyst at IBIS World, a market research company, said the new bans would cause sunscreen manufacturers to review the ingredients used in their products, though not immediately. She said the industry was “expected to continue undertaking product research and development to meet changing consumer demands.”",The New York Times

None of the old growth remained — only charred stumps poking up from murky, dark pools of water. In places, smoke still curled from land that days ago had been covered with lush jungle. Villagers had burned it all down, clearing the way for a lucrative crop whose cultivation now dominates the entire island: the oil-palm tree. The dirt road was ruler straight, but deep holes and errant boulders tossed our tiny Toyota back and forth. Trucks coughed out black smoke, their beds brimming over with seven-ton loads of palm fruit rocking back and forth on tires as tall as people. Clear-cut expanses soon gave way to a uniform crop of oil-palm groves: orderly trees, a sign that we had crossed into an industrial palm plantation. Oil-palm trees look like the coconut-palm trees you see on postcards from Florida — they grow to more than 60 feet tall and flourish on the peaty wetland soil common in lowland tropics. But they are significantly more valuable. Every two weeks or so, each tree produces a 50-pound bunch of walnut-size fruit, bursting with a red, viscous oil that is more versatile than almost any other plant-based oil of its kind. Indonesia is rich in timber and coal, but palm oil is its biggest export. Around the world, the oil from its meat and seeds has long been an indispensable ingredient in everything from soap to ice cream. But it has now become a key ingredient of something else: biodiesel, fuel for diesel engines that has been wholly or partly made from vegetable oil. Finally we emerged, and as we crested a hill, the plantations fell into an endless repetition of tidy bunches stretching for miles, looking almost like the rag of a Berber carpet. Occasionally, a shard of an old ironwood tree shot into the air, a remnant of the primordial canopy of dense rain forest that dominated the land until very recently. Our driver, a 44-year-old island native and whistle-blower named Gusti Gelambong, had brought us here to show us the incredible destruction wrought by the growing demand for palm oil. The oldest male among nine siblings, he was modestly built but exuded a wiry strength. His father, he told us, was a king of one of Borneo’s dozens of Dayak tribes, the sixth descendant of the sultan of Old Kotawaringin, and his mother came from a line of warriors who served in the Indonesian special forces. In 2001, he said, he took part in a brutal ethnic cleansing of Indonesians who had moved in from the nearby island of Madura. He macheted his way through the nearby town of Pangkalan Bun, slaughtering dozens of people. He felt no remorse about the violence. But the palm-oil companies, Gelambong said, were much stronger than the Madurese. As we approached an intersection, we could see two plantation guards lying back in a shack, rifles propped against their knees. He sped past the guards, averting his eyes. Most of the plantations around us were new, their rise a direct consequence of policy decisions made half a world away. In the mid-2000s, Western nations, led by the United States, began drafting environmental laws that encouraged the use of vegetable oil in fuels — an ambitious move to reduce carbon dioxide and curb global warming. But these laws were drawn up based on an incomplete accounting of the true environmental costs. Despite warnings that the policies could have the opposite of their intended effect, they were implemented anyway, producing what now appears to be a calamity with global consequences. The tropical rain forests of Indonesia, and in particular the peatland regions of Borneo, have large amounts of carbon trapped within their trees and soil. Slashing and burning the existing forests to make way for oil-palm cultivation had a perverse effect: It released more carbon. A lot more carbon. NASA researchers say the accelerated destruction of Borneo’s forests contributed to the largest single-year global increase in carbon emissions in two millenniums, an explosion that transformed Indonesia into the world’s fourth-largest source of such emissions. Instead of creating a clever technocratic fix to reduce American’s carbon footprint, lawmakers had lit the fuse on a powerful carbon bomb that, as the forests were cleared and burned, produced more carbon than the entire continent of Europe. The unprecedented palm-oil boom, meanwhile, has enriched and emboldened many of the region’s largest corporations, which have begun using their newfound power and wealth to suppress critics, abuse workers and acquire more land to produce oil. We arrived at another plantation and stopped near where a stream coursed through the bog. People still lived here: A mother bathed two children beneath a culvert, and a shirtless young boy ran through row after row of identical young palms in the distance, surrounded by dragonflies and sparrows. The uniformity of the world he was growing up in was striking, like the endless plains of drilling rigs in an East Texas oil field. It was, in a way, an astounding achievement, the ruthless culmination of mankind’s long effort to extract every last remaining bit of the earth’s seemingly boundless natural wealth. But it was also frightening. This was what an American effort to save the planet looked like. It was startlingly efficient, extremely profitable and utterly disastrous. The last thing anyone expected from President George W. Bush’s 2007 State of the Union address was a proposal for the largest-ever cut in the nation’s use of gasoline. The president was no climate champion — he had backed out of the Kyoto Protocol shortly after taking office in 2001 — but he did favor what he called “energy independence.” He had declared the United States “addicted” to foreign oil, yet dependence on Middle Eastern fuel continued. Hurricane Katrina, and the lingering damage it did to oil pipelines and refineries, had pushed up gas prices, renewed fears of global warming and kept a firm thumb on the economy. Now, Bush proposed, homegrown energy could be drawn from the rural places most in need of an economic boost. Clean-coal initiatives would generate the electricity of the future, but it was biofuels — in particular ethanol, which is largely distilled from corn, and biodiesel, made with vegetable oil — that would power the vehicles of the future. Within 10 years, the country would replace 35 billion gallons of petroleum, or one-fifth of all the gas and diesel burned, with fuel made from plants. The measure, as he put it, would confront “the serious challenge of global climate change.” Unsaid, but clear to anyone paying attention, was that it would also please America’s agriculture industry, which had been lobbying for ethanol and advanced biofuel research for years. The House chamber erupted in applause. On the night of the president’s address, Timothy Searchinger sat on his couch in Takoma Park, Md., just a few miles from the Capitol, and watched on television, struck by what seemed to him a glaring lapse in logic. “Oh, my God, what the hell is happening here?” he recalls wondering aloud. Searchinger wasn’t a scientist; he was a lawyer, working with the Environmental Defense Fund. But he saw a serious flaw in the claim that the president’s proposal would ameliorate climate change. Searchinger knew that cropland had already consumed virtually every arable acre across the Midwest. Quintupling biofuel production would require a huge amount of additional arable land, far more than existed in the United States. Unless Americans planned to eat less, that meant displacing food production to some other country with unused land — and he knew that when forests are cut, or new land is opened for farming, substantial new amounts of carbon can be released into the atmosphere. Forests hold as much as 45 percent of the planet’s carbon stored on land, and old-growth trees in particular hold a great deal of that carbon, typically far more than any of the crops that replace them. When the trees are cut down, most of that carbon is released. Scientists and lawyers who study environmental impact often deploy “carbon-life-cycle analysis” to determine just how much carbon a given product is removing from, or introducing to, the environment over the course of its production and consumption. When a truck burns biodiesel, the carbon emissions that come from its tailpipe aren’t much different from those of a truck burning petroleum. But a part of the biodiesel emissions aren’t counted, because — in theory — they have been balanced out: Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere when they grow, and fuel experts subtract that sequestered carbon from the tailpipe emission, completing a transaction that they say balances at zero. In ideal circumstances — unvegetated land planted for the first time — this balancing out really happens. When corn grows, it soaks up carbon, and when it is consumed (whether as food or fuel), it releases that carbon back into the air. But the analysis breaks down when faced with the reality of land use. Almost everywhere in the world, planting more corn or soy for biofuel would involve creating more farmland, which in turn would involve cutting down whatever was already growing on that land. And that would mean releasing a huge amount of carbon into the air, with nothing to balance the books. As Searchinger watched Bush’s call for an unprecedented increase in biofuel production, his hunch was that the biofuel balance sheet would turn out to be tragically shortsighted. Representative Henry A. Waxman, at the time a powerful 16-term Democrat from California who had presided over several failed efforts to pass climate legislation, was also skeptical about Bush’s plan. But he knew that one of the most vexing aspects of global emissions reduction was the question of how to replace transportation fuels. It was hard enough to upgrade several thousand electrical power plants to draw on wind or solar or even nuclear power. That would take years. But transforming the more than 100 million cars and trucks on America’s roads would take far longer, decades even, and in the meantime those vehicles were producing 28 percent of carbon emissions in the United States. Waxman thought a biofuel requirement could be a turning point in climate legislation, a moment when Washington stopped pretending. Within months of Bush’s speech, the House and the Senate were reconciling a draft of a sprawling omnibus bill that would eventually be called the Energy Independence and Security Act, or EISA. In addition to requiring carmakers to improve fuel standards, a longtime priority for Democrats, the bill updated and expanded renewable-fuel standards, requiring fuel producers to mix in soy, palm and other kinds of vegetable oil with diesel fuel and to use ethanol from corn and sugar in gasoline. The bill also set tough standards for how much cleaner, in terms of carbon, each of those categories of fuel had to become — 50 percent for diesel, 20 percent for gas — and empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to judge what qualified. The expected gains were enormous. The switch to biofuels, the E.P.A. would later calculate, promised to stop the release of 4.5 billion tons of carbon over three decades, the equivalent of parking every single American automobile for more than seven years. Before the bill passed in December 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “the shot heard round the world for energy independence.” The law had a profound effect. Biodiesel production in the United States would jump from 250 million gallons in 2006 to more than 1.5 billion gallons in 2016. Imports of biodiesel to the United States surged from near zero to more than 100 million gallons a month. As fuel markets snatched up every ounce of domestic soy oil to meet the American fuel mandate, the food industry also replaced the soy it had used with something cheaper and just as good: palm oil, largely from Malaysia and Indonesia, which are the sources of nearly 90 percent of the global supply. Lawmakers never anticipated that their well-intentioned plan — to help the climate by helping American farmers — might instead transform Indonesia and present one of the greatest threats to the planet’s tropical rain forests. But as Indonesian palm oil began to flood Western markets, that is exactly what began to happen. “We saw great promise,” Waxman told me recently, sitting in a glass conference room at Waxman Strategies, the Washington lobbying firm of which he is chairman. But he is no longer so hopeful. He is now also the chairman of the environmental organization Mighty Earth, which lobbies food and agriculture companies to deploy more climate-friendly production methods. In 2007, he and other lawmakers were focused on the benefits of biofuels and the bridge they promised to even greener technologies. Now the soft-spoken Waxman is far more concerned about the other side of the equation. “We didn’t think we were going to pay such a heavy price,” he said. Palm-oil producers had been lobbying American lawmakers to introduce biofuel incentives for years, and they were well prepared for the moment when the incentives became law. Wilmar — the colossal Singaporean conglomerate that controls nearly half of the global palm-oil trade — announced in 2007 that it would quadruple its biodiesel production. In Indonesia, officials directed state-owned and regional banks to make loans on more than $8 billion worth of palm-oil-related development projects and pledged to produce 5.9 billion gallons of biofuel within five years. They also announced that Indonesia would convert more than 13 million acres of additional forest to industrialized palm production. It was as if in response to a law in China, the United States undertook a plan to convert every single acre of New Jersey to soybean crops, and then threw in all of Connecticut and New Hampshire. To make Indonesia’s plan a reality, a complicated question of land ownership had to be addressed. Much of the new development was focused on Borneo, where many villages were settled before there were nations, let alone land deeds. To create a legal basis for development, the Indonesian government established a commercial land-share system in the 1980s. In theory, the system let villages sign over development rights in return for some part of the profit. But in practice, many villagers said, companies often secured the permits they needed through some combination of intense lobbying, bribery and strong-arming, and the result was broken promises and missing payments. Villagers were often simply outmatched by their huge negotiating partners. Wilmar was already a powerhouse in 2007, with operations in 23 countries on four continents, employing more than 60,000 people. When Wilmar said it would buy more than 200,000 acres in the states surrounding Gusti Gelambong’s village, it was a signal for others, too, to rush in. One of Indonesia’s largest conglomerates, the Salim Group — which owns Indofood, the nation’s largest maker of instant noodles — said it would pay $13 million for 200,000 acres in East and Central Kalimantan. Anthoni Salim, the company’s chief executive, was closely tied to Suharto, Indonesia’s longtime dictator who was overthrown in 1998. When the dictatorship fell, an angry mob firebombed Salim’s family mansion in Jakarta, and the new government forced him to abandon dozens of holdings. Within a few years, though, Salim had rebuilt his empire. Even before the boom, Gelambong told me, he saw promise in the new palm industry, and he decided to stake his own welfare to it. When the large companies began to expand their timber and palm-planting to Kalimantan, they brought roads, construction and an influx of goods. They also offered jobs. By the end of 2007, Gelambong was already two years into working with a wildcat palm-oil operation, overseeing the process of putting millions of palm-tree seedlings into the ground. The oligarchs had once brazenly plundered whole states, but Gelambong thought this time would be different. In the post-Suharto era, it was private business capitalizing on free markets, and the companies promised to share profits with the smallholders — the villagers — who gave up their land. To win access to protected ancestral lands, the corporations promised schools for local children and wages that far exceeded those from harvesting jackfruit and jalut timber. Gelambong’s company was owned by a midsize upstart named Bumitama, run not by an oligarch but by the grandson of a Chinese immigrant who moved to remote eastern Borneo and opened a grocery store in 1915. The family built a fortune out of mining and timber, and Bumitama — which sells its palm to mills run by Wilmar and has direct distribution to the American and European markets — was its palm-oil subsidiary. As Bumitama’s plantations grew, so did Gelambong’s responsibility. He became the public liaison for Bumitama’s local operations, a company called B.G.A. — in part, he thought, because officials knew that his family held influence over the people who lived there. The deeper he got, however, the more he began to understand that many landowners weren’t being paid. As he gained access to more company documents, Gelambong said, he found new contracts where village elders had agreed to smaller and smaller shares of profit. He offered a theory: The elders, often rewarded with gifts by the companies, weren’t looking out for the interests of their people, and their people simply had no way of knowing. “No one fights for their rights, because almost no one can write or read,” he said. In his role as liaison, Gelambong was also sometimes responsible for delivering the very gifts that local officials found so persuasive. Indonesia’s new democratic government had reached an uneasy détente with its rural islands by giving them a very long leash to run their own affairs, including the authority to issue permits for developing palm and timber. Acquiring such a permit typically required hefty contributions to one or more local political campaigns. Gelambong said he handled the small stuff; payoffs to the police, military patrols and local chiefs. (Bumitama officials say that Gelambong’s official position was in “documents and licensing,” and that while they cannot “comment on his individual doings,” Bumitama complies with antibribery laws.) As the money flowed, so did the development. From 2007 to 2014, palm concessions in Kalimantan more than tripled. Bumitama alone was planting roughly 37,000 acres of palm each year. Across Indonesia, trees were cut down at a rate of three acres every minute to make room. Soon, palm plantations extended from Kotawaringin in every direction. The palatial remains of Gelambong’s family estate still stand in Kotawaringin, their wood grayed and weathered, ringed by a tall fence capped with elongated spikes that for centuries has turned away tigers and thieves alike. It was there that Gelambong took me to retrieve a box of papers he had acquired. After leaving Bumitama in 2011, he had become the head of his village’s microfinance group, which gave him access to records that helped explain how his former employer had been able to so thoroughly take over the village and its land in the early years of the oil-palm boom. Bumitama, it appeared from the documents, had used the microfinance group as a kind of front to justify putting up land owned by residents as collateral for a $26 million bank loan, effectively mortgaging it to the industry’s financial backers. Sifting through the files, he retrieved copies of three contracts the company presented to its banks. Each contained a list of signatures — purportedly those of hundreds of villagers, consenting to let the microfinance corporation control their land and represent their views to the bank. Gelambong pointed to the long rows of names. Dozens of these people, he said, couldn’t read or write. When he asked some of them about their names in the document, they told him that they had never seen the paper before and that the signature on it wasn’t theirs. At least six of the signatures were from people who had died before the oil-palm companies arrived. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a voluntary global governance organization for the industry, is formally investigating Gelambong’s claims. Bumitama officials said that nothing about their deal in Kotawaringin was improper; the company had the consent of village representatives, and it had undergone due diligence from the banks. A spokesman for Wilmar said that it abides by its sustainability commitments and was watching the Bumitama land inquiry closely but that the company’s internal monitoring program had not yet triggered any alerts about Bumitama’s subsidiary outside Tanjung Puting National Park. Gelambong’s discovery had left him cynical about the industry that had overtaken his home. Promises had given way to despair, and he was humbled by the belief that he and others were suckered into giving up their only true assets. Now they were fighting simply for the right to take back a small sliver of land to farm for themselves. Timothy Searchinger spent a year researching cropland demand, and in February 2008, just two months after Bush signed the biofuels mandate into law, he and eight co-authors published their findings in the journal Science. It was a rare coup for a layman — peer-reviewed scientific journals seldom take an interest in the work of activist lawyers — but Searchinger had done something important. He had tried to quantify how increasing the demand for biofuel would change land use. According to his calculations, the ripple effects from land use would be so great that ethanol wasn’t going to be better for the climate at all; instead, it would create nearly double the greenhouse-gas emissions of conventional fuels. How was this possible? A typical life-cycle analysis adds up just the carbon emissions involved in the chain of fuel production and use: the carbon produced by burning the fuel, the carbon spit out by the tractor in the field, the carbon produced by the fertilizer manufacturer and so on. By this accounting, vegetable-oil-based biofuel fares well against petroleum fuels, reducing CO₂ emissions by as much as 80 percent. What that analysis does not take into account, though, is that there is only so much land. The supposed carbon gains of plant-based fuels have to be offset, Searchinger argued in subsequent papers, by one of three things: reducing food consumption, increasing yields from existing cropland or — most likely — creating entirely new cropland, probably in the countries with the largest “underutilized” forests. And the typical analysis doesn’t count the carbon produced by cutting down these forests or — if that deforestation happens to take place in Indonesia — emissions from disturbing the extremely carbon-rich peatland soils that much of the forest grows upon. Jeremy Martin, a fuel-policy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that before Searchinger’s research was published, the significance of land-use change had been dismissed. “It was really sort of shocking,” Martin said. Climate scientists quickly agreed on the general notion that land use was an important factor to take into account, but there the consensus ended. The numbers varied depending on who did the analysis using what model, and as the research evolved, few could agree on the scale of the problem. Predicting how people will use land can be challenging. Scientists use a suite of complex models to try to capture the nuance of interactions among commodity prices, vegetation coverage, carbon content of that vegetation, fuel use, the weather and the global political situation. Accounting for the “substitution effect,” which describes the way more or less interchangeable commodities like palm and soybean oil tend to be swapped out for one another as buyers seek the lowest price, has proved to be a particularly challenging problem. The American biofuels law, for instance, was designed to support soybean and corn farmers, not palm-oil producers. But the United States began increasing foreign palm-oil imports nonetheless — they more than doubled by 2017 — in large part because so much of the domestic soybean production that once went to food was now being used for fuel. Much of that palm oil went to food production. But the increased use of palm oil in food production was largely a byproduct of the increased fuel-oil production. (In Europe, which also passed a biofuels mandate in 2009 and uses large amounts of palm-based biodiesel directly in its vehicles, the calculation was simpler.) Wrangling precisely how much palm demand resulted from using a gallon of soy for fuel, and how much rain-forest carbon, in Indonesia for example, might be emitted as a result, became a question that was increasingly influenced by political factors. The E.P.A., in 2009, made one of the most significant efforts to model and predict the carbon from biofuels, using three of the most established models and an overlay of satellite imagery of agricultural lands around the world, including those in Indonesia. The agency determined that the carbon footprint of land-use changes overshadowed any other consideration, and not by a small margin. In fact, when land changes were accounted for, the climate benefit of biofuels was entirely wiped away. Because a huge pulse of emissions comes from land change immediately after forests are cut, the E.P.A. concluded that it would take 32 years before biodiesel from soybean oil was truly net-zero for carbon on an annual basis, and a century for it to reach the level of benefit required under the law. But that finding did not last long. The agriculture industry went to war to save the mandate they worked so hard to put in place. They lobbied the E.P.A. to abandon its consideration of indirect land-use change, describing it as a “radical” approach that could hold American farmers responsible for business decisions made by villagers halfway around the world. They supported research suggesting that the E.P.A. had overestimated the expansion of crops into tropical rain forests and said farmers were getting better crop yields off the same land than the models had acknowledged. By the time the E.P.A. released its final rule in early 2010, it had made a complete about-face. Its models now found that the impact from land-use changes were almost negligible. For Indonesia, the E.P.A. estimated that just 110,000 acres of forest would be converted to cropland as a result of the American biofuels law, and almost none of it on sensitive peatland. It also extended the scope of its analysis to 2022, which had the effect of minimizing the short-term emissions. And it worked: Corn ethanol just barely cleared the law’s hurdle, and soybean biodiesel suddenly appeared to be vastly cleaner than regular diesel. It was nearly two years later that the E.P.A. issued its analysis of palm oil; it said in a cursory three-page draft rule that palm oil did in fact fall short of the E.P.A.’s bar, because of its direct impact on Indonesian forests. And that analysis, which remains in draft form today, simply ignores the substitution effect — which, calculated in any form, would suggest an even greater carbon cost. Searchinger, who now is a research scholar at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, argues today that instead of developing evermore complex models, it makes more sense to step back and consider some simple logic: Land has competing uses, and taking more of it for agriculture has to have some consequence for the climate. “We could be off by 100 percent,” he says of his biofuels findings, “and it’s still incredibly bad.” After the palm-oil companies gained control of the land, the clearing began. The fastest method was to rip out the forests with excavators and torch what remained. In 2015, the fires spread out of control. Kalimantan — and most of Indonesia, for that matter — was overwhelmed by billowing clouds of smoke and ash, visible from hundreds of miles away. NASA satellites detected more than 120,000 hot spots. As far away as Singapore and the Thai islands, people covered their faces with masks and prayed that their air-conditioners could filter out the soot. The smoke was so thick that Zenzi Suhadi, a leading activist with the Indonesian environmental group Walhi, was unable to land at Pangkalan Bun airport the day he was supposed to arrive late that September. Nor could he land the next day. But Suhadi needed to get closer — right into the heart of the flames. A biologist who wrote his thesis on Indonesia’s wild orchids, Suhadi switched to environmental work because he thought it could have broader impact. He has taken on the pulp and paper, logging and palm industries with a zeal that seems to grind against his quiet, soft-spoken nature. At 37, he has been riotous and unflagging in the face of powerful government ministers, corporate lawyers and even would-be assassins — all of whom he has faced off with at one time or another. Forest fires are an annual event in Indonesia — sparked in the dry early fall as village farmers clear their fields and then extinguished by the monsoons. But this year was different. NASA officials said they were the worst fires they’d ever observed. Indonesians suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation were streaming into hospitals by the tens of thousands. Researchers at Columbia and Harvard later estimated that the fires led to 100,000 premature deaths. And the fires wouldn’t stop. Suhadi, long a critic of how the palm-oil companies managed their plantations, feared that they had now done something cataclysmic. His team — including an American conservationist from Friends of the Earth and Gusti Gelambong as a guide — had already arrived in Kalimantan. Now he asked them to continue on without him, traveling west toward Kotawaringin and to the jungle of Tanjung Puting National Park. The only way to learn the truth of what was unfolding was to investigate it for themselves. What the Walhi crew found that week in Kalimantan was not just deforestation and misery but a virtual hole ripped into one of the largest banks of concentrated carbon in existence. At every turn — by motorbike and motorboat — shards of burned stumps, a crop of shimmering silvery charcoal, stuck out from the blackened earth like gravestones. This apocalyptic landscape stretched as far as they could see, punctuated by only the rare tuft of scorched but otherwise healthy juvenile palm. They traced what they describe as telltale signs that the fires had been started by the palm companies — which is illegal and which all the palm-oil companies strongly deny doing, but which is also the fastest, cheapest way to raze the land. The process is simple and devastating. First, workers bring in excavators to cut deep trenches across the swampland. These quickly fill with water that drains from the adjacent forest, thereby creating canals that serve as near-instant inroads on which to transport heavy machinery by boat or barge. With the machinery, the forests are cut down, their timber efficiently removed, and the swampy peatland they sit on is left to drain and dry. Once it’s dried, it’s burned. In most of the places the Walhi crew visited, the fires appeared to have been extinguished, but the earth remained hot, smoldering underground. And this — more than the landscape destruction itself — was what concerned the group most. The dried and decaying peatland soil in this part of Borneo would almost certainly continue to burn for many more months, even years, releasing volumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that far exceeded those from the rain-forest deforestation itself. Peatland is boggy, waterlogged ground, loaded with layers of decomposing plants that can’t get enough oxygen to support the microorganisms that would normally break them down. So they accumulate, layer by layer, season by season, compressing into a dense, black carbon-rich mud of partly decayed matter that sinks below the shallow water table and is preserved there in an anaerobic state. Left alone for a couple hundred million more years, the peat would solidify into coal. Exposed peatland can spew carbon into the atmosphere for decades, even centuries, after the land is first disturbed. Indonesia’s peatland destruction — just the amount that has already occurred — is roughly the equivalent of opening 70 new, large coal-fired power plants. And if even a fraction of these emissions are counted as land-change effects in the process of evaluating biofuels, the scales are forcefully tipped. “It’s all a deception,” Suhadi said. “There is no sustainability.” Globally, peatlands from Norway to Brazil hold a volume of carbon equivalent to 21 percent of the entire carbon content in the earth’s soil. Indonesia’s peatlands alone (which are greater in size than others anywhere in the world except for those in Russia and Canada) now emit more than 500 megatons of CO₂ each year, an amount greater than the entire annual emissions of the state of California. Peatland forests hold 12 times as much carbon as other tropical rain forests around the world. This makes destroying them one of the planet’s greatest threats — and protecting them one of the most accessible opportunities to curb rising global emissions. The peatland problem had been known for some time. It’s one reason that six of the world’s leading carbon-modeling schemes, including the E.P.A.’s, have concluded that biodiesel made from Indonesian palm oil makes the global carbon problem worse, not better. The World Agroforestry Center found that peatland-based biodiesel could produce nearly four times the emissions of petroleum diesel. In 2011, the government began a process to survey and designate millions of acres of Indonesia as protected peatland. In 2013, Wilmar signed a pledge to avoid peatland from inside the industry, and other companies eventually followed. American investors and regulators have taken solace in these pledges, assuming that they have lessened the environmental threat. And yet in 2015, as the peat fires raged aboveground and below, Suhadi could see only that none of that mattered. In early July, I traveled to Kalimantan to investigate rumors that large-scale illegal peatland logging operations were still underway. Gelambong met me in a shaded garden behind my hotel. He was deeply uncomfortable and believed he was being followed. We switched tables to move farther into the yard, away from the town officials he suspected were listening. Gelambong’s life hadn’t been the same since he went public with documents accusing Bumitama of seizing his village’s land. The company accused him of embezzlement, and he was arrested in 2016. He spent six months in the Pangkalan Bun jail before a judge determined that there was no evidence to hold him and dismissed the charges. The palm companies keep getting stronger. In 2014, Indonesia’s highest judge and three associates were convicted in a huge bribery scandal that journalists have linked to palm land deals in Borneo. A few years later, a Kalimantan governor was caught granting palm concessions to family members, who flipped them back to the companies that paid for his election. Stories of corruption, and threats to keep it quiet, were legion. I was reminded of the threats that Suhadi had described — a series of anonymous phone calls and an intimidating run-in at a market in Jakarta. Suhadi went dark for several weeks as a result — hiding out in a friend’s house outside the city. His fear was justified. In 2015, one of Suhadi’s colleagues was stabbed to death outside a Jakarta nightclub in a case that news reports speculated was linked to his environmental work, and Global Witness has counted at least eight assassinations of Indonesian environmentalists fighting palm oil. Gelambong drove us out of downtown that afternoon, to the ramshackle waterfront port of Kumai. There, he turned us over to a boat pilot, and we squeezed into a tiny wedge of wood and fiberglass with a large outboard engine. We motored past derelict anchored ocean tankers, toward the entrance to Tanjung Puting National Park. Tanjung Puting is one of Indonesia’s most protected and beloved landscapes, rimmed by mangrove swamps around a core of heath forests that are home to orangutans, proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards and sun bears, as well as some 230 species of birds. Its 1,100 square miles of peatland bogs are one of the last remnants of an ecosystem that used to dominate the southern coast of Borneo; Gelambong said its peatland bogs once stretched most of the way from here to Kotawaringin, two hours by truck. Ecotourists come from around the world to see what remains of them, cruising the Sekonyer River on private klotoks, long wooden ships outfitted with netted open-air bedrooms. The exception to the devastation of South Kalimantan is supposed to be the national parks. But the parks are not safe, either. As our boat cruised out the mouth of the Kumai River, a teacup skipping over the white caps into the open sea, our guide, Fajar Dewanto, warned us that a large part of the park was threatened by palm development. Dewanto works for Orangutan Foundation International, a group that has resettled many of the more than 5,000 orangutans here in the park. But because it’s the widespread conversion of the land to monoculture plantations that threatens the orangutan habitat, Dewanto has also become a de facto park ranger, policing the forest where officials don’t have enough staff, or willingness, to do it themselves. A week before our arrival, Dewanto’s team found the rigid body of an orangutan, half buried under a fallen log next to a scar of freshly cut forest in a peat bog being razed for a new palm plantation. They turned the orangutan over. It was riddled with bullet holes to the chest, arm and thigh. As more than a dozen police officers and wildlife experts established a crime scene, an excavator continued ripping down trees on the peat bog behind them, unwilling to lose even a day of progress. Dewanto couldn’t get the scene out of his head. As our boat rounded a small point of mangroves toward a little-visited swatch of parkland, he wasn’t sure what he would find. Our captain slowed the motor and turned into a small tributary crowded with nipa, a stalky canelike plant that is a food staple for native people here, and from there we navigated into a recently dredged canal no wider than 10 feet. Dewanto had been here one month earlier and seen forest. Now the forest was gone. This level of deforestation on protected peatland supposedly wasn’t happening anymore. In Jakarta, a string of officials — from the government palm-oil agency, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, the palm-industry association, the Peatland Restoration Agency — all denied to me that peat deforestation in Kalimantan still took place. Uniformly, they insisted that Indonesia had learned its lesson and solved its palm-oil problem, that peatland bans were in full force. Restoration was even underway, they claimed, painting a picture of a palm industry on a sustainable path — farming only on dry land and focused on increasing yields, not expanding footprints. But where we stood, a broad expanse had been laid bare, the splinters of wood still so fresh they were pungent, crisscrossed by deep pools of black, boggy water. About a mile back, the tree line marked the new edge of Tanjung Puting National Park, a threshold protecting the largest population of orangutans left in the world. Beside an idle excavator, 24-inch tufts of baby palms had been set in rows, the mound of dirt around their base still fresh from planting. Dewanto wasn’t particularly surprised to find the devastation. “This is every day in Borneo,” he said. In government documents from 2011, this field was mapped not only as protected peatland but also as part of the national park. When the Walhi group visited during the fires of 2015, the forest was still protected. Records show, however, that a nearby village petitioned the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry to carve the plantation out of the park, and this allowed Bumitama, which farms there along with the village, to expand its operation. The government agreed. The park got smaller. A few days later, we drove north, 20 hours on punishing mountain roads, toward the Malaysian border and the West Kalimantan district of Sintang. There, a meeting was planned with the local county governor, or bupati, to discuss a similar situation. North of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors. The permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It’s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. “We call them shadow companies,” said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations. The connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.) At the bupati’s house, an elegant, 19th-century Dutch-built compound bursting with tropical flowers, I pressed him to explain how these peatland forests could be cut down when the government insisted that such land clearing had stopped. The bupati, a doctor named Jarot, had moved to Borneo from Java and had developed a local reputation as a conservationist. He greeted us jovially, barefoot and dressed in bluejeans and a crisp, untucked blue button-down shirt. He said the rural districts must balance economic growth with sustainability, and while he has pledged to control corruption and illegal permits, he also described himself as helpless against the currents of a central government that is close to the big corporations and constantly changes both the rules and the playing field. United Nations forest programs pay communities to leave their trees in the ground. Such funding would help him strike a better balance here, he said, casually shrugging off the plantation case I asked about. “We do what we can do,” Jarot said. “We cannot do it by ourselves. ... We need a fiscal incentive.” An aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases “peatland” and “forest” have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as “forest” under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines — lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies’ land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis? This September, with late-season heat pounding Washington, Zenzi Suhadi cleared security at the Russell Senate Office Building, preparing to brief Senate aides about the impact that palm-oil development was having on Indonesia’s environment. I asked if he was nervous, and he said no. “These are just people. I don’t have to face any tigers.” He didn’t seem to be joking. Suhadi wanted to tell the lawmakers the same thing he told them in two previous visits to Capitol Hill: that the palm trade, driven by American investment, is slowly killing his country. “It’s important for you to understand that all acts of deforestation in Indonesia start with a signature,” he said. “And more than a little of it starts right here.” He was not confident that he would be heard — the last time he visited Washington, lawmakers chewed up their time asking him about water buffalo in his village. But still he felt compelled to speak. From Washington, Suhadi traveled to San Francisco to attend a climate march and address a group of hedge-fund investors. Just down the street, Michael Bloomberg implored strong immediate action on emissions reductions at the Global Climate Action Summit, one of the nation’s largest gatherings on climate goals. But the conference was light on substance when it came to the subject of forests. There was scarcely any mention of peatland at all. When Nancy Pelosi took the stage, she looked back on the 2007 fuel-economy bill and biofuels mandate she shepherded into law. The initiative should be credited, she said, with “charting a new path to clean energy, reducing emissions, increasing the use of renewables.” She made no mention of Indonesia. When I asked her about the deforestation in an earlier email, her office wrote back defending the bill, citing the Union of Concerned Scientists and arguing that even with the Indonesian forest effect accounted for, biodiesels were cleaner than fossil fuels. “Bottom line,” the office responded, “the biofuels in your tank are better for the planet than 100 percent fossil fuels.” Henry Waxman, of course, doesn’t agree. He said Congress was so focused on domestic climate policy that it failed to see the repercussions of those policies around the world — repercussions that now seem obvious. “We’ve created a situation that is so contrary to what we had hoped for,” he said. “We’re doing more harm to the environment. It was a mistake.” The advanced cellulosic-biofuels program that once seemed so promising has been a failure. It never attracted the investment it needed, and the E.P.A. has allowed biodiesel to serve as a substitute in meeting the mandate. President Trump has wandered into the renewable-fuels-standard debate, too, and found himself caught in a thicket, at one moment poised to reform the fuel standard completely and the very next snagged by the interest of a powerful agriculture industry grown accustomed to its enormous benefit. The result is likely to be at least a near-term doubling down on American biofuels use, no matter the cost. It may no longer be possible to slow the momentum behind Indonesia’s palm markets. Sitting in the lavish dining room of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Jakarta in July, over an awkward meal of mushroom consommé and blanched scallops, officials from Indonesia’s Palm Oil Development Fund made a case for their industry. I asked how important the American biofuels mandate has been, given that other countries buy more Indonesian palm oil than Americans do. The answer was unequivocal: It’s what got Indonesian palm off the ground. “The U.S. is not only a market,” said Ruddy Gobel, the chief political adviser to the director. “It also sets the global agenda.” Now, according to the Indonesian development officials, 80 million Indonesians depend economically on palm oil, and nearly half the industry consists of individual landowners like the people in Kotawaringin. “If you pull out biofuel, the whole system will collapse,” said Dono Boestami, the fund’s director. In perhaps the final turn of the life cycle, Indonesia is now working to become its own largest customer. In 2016, it instituted a 20 percent biofuels mandate for its domestic fuels, and this August, it extended that mandate to cover railways and power generation too. Then it upped the pressure further, simply making it compulsory that Indonesians buy and use biodiesel. Officials offer a simple justification for this push: Under the Paris climate accord, they say, converting Indonesia to renewable fuels is the only way the country can meet its own climate goals. The central problem, of course, is that the goals of Paris — slowing planetary warming just enough to allow humans time to adapt to excruciating and inevitable changes, including flooding coastlines, stronger hurricanes and perpetual famine and drought — are unlikely to ever be achieved without stopping deforestation. The planet’s forests have the potential to sequester as much as a third of the carbon in the air. Right now deforestation globally contributes 15 percent of the planet’s total emissions, the same as all the cars and trucks and trains across the globe. On paper, biodiesel is a way to make all those modes of transportation produce less carbon. But in the world as it is, that calculation is far more likely to lead to catastrophe.",The New York Times

2018,Papua New Guinea Is Rich in Resources but Poor in Health,"PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea — Polio was vanquished by the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea 18 years ago. Now, as world leaders gather there for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting this week, polio has returned — on top of raging drug-resistant epidemics of tuberculosis, malaria and H.I.V., and deadly flash points of preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles. All over the country, there are symptoms of a profound public health emergency; young and old are getting sick and dying unnecessarily, while facilities lack basic medicines and equipment. Doctors and experts say the unfolding crisis is the realization of their worst fears after years of deterioration and neglect. “We were expecting something like this,” Dr. Anup Gurung, a public health specialist with the World Health Organization, said of the polio outbreak at a news conference in the capital, Port Moresby, in September. He pointed to the erosion of vaccination rates, which are down to 30 percent in some parts of the country. “It’s like someone lit a paper castle where everything is on fire,” he said. Officials in Papua New Guinea hope that hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, meeting in Port Moresby will elevate the country’s international profile, but the health crisis has become an embarrassment for a nation with an abundance of gold, copper, silver, oil and gas. Public frustration with the summit spending has already led to two national strikes. The collapse of health services has been a focus of the protests. The return of polio is a clear indicator of the failures, with Papua New Guinea accounting for 21 of 109 cases found globally this year. The Papua New Guinea outbreak is vaccine-derived, which means that weakened live virus excreted by vaccinated children has mutated and escaped into the rapidly increasing unprotected population. Dr. Gurung blamed “the steady breakdown of the health system” for the country’s polio emergency. Local and international experts point to three interlinked causes of the country’s health crisis: the collapse of the medical supply chain; changing relations with the country’s biggest aid donor, Australia; and rampant corruption. Getting medicines, equipment and other supplies around Papua New Guinea has always been challenging. The country has few roads, formidable geography and a widely dispersed population, with about 80 percent living in rural and remote locations. That improved with assistance from Australia, but the Australian government withdrew from the arrangement in protest in 2013 after Papua New Guinea awarded the national medicine supply contract to a local company that Julie Bishop, then the Australian foreign minister, said had no accreditation and “a history of supplying substandard drugs.” The company, Borneo Pacific, won the contract — worth 32 million Australian dollars, or $23 million — despite its bid being millions of dollars higher than those of reputable international organizations. At the time, the Medical Society of Papua New Guinea said the deal would “lead to the deaths of many Papua New Guineans.” Reports from health facilities across the country indicate those fears have been borne out. (Borneo Pacific did not respond to requests for comment.) Health workers in aid posts, clinics and even major hospitals regularly report running out of basic medicines like antibiotics, analgesics and antimalarials, said Dr. Sam Yockopua, chief of emergency medicine at the National Department of Health and secretary of the National Doctors Association. Many rural facilities have closed for lack of supplies or workers. [Sign up for the Australia Letter to get news of the region, with perspective, in your inbox each week.] Dr. Yockopua identified “endemic and epidemic” corruption as the root cause of the health care system’s failures, echoing the findings of international investigations. A national audit last year also documented widespread “unavailability of lifesaving and essential drugs” and urged the removal of the entire medicine procurement division. The government did not respond to questions about the report’s recommendations. Signs of crisis are everywhere. About five hours’ drive northwest from Port Moresby, navigating a fractured coastal highway, the Catholic sub-health center in the village of Terapo operates in a condemned building without water or power and with few medicines. It serves more than 500 patients each month, many traveling long distances because government aid posts have closed. At Kerema Hospital, the major facility in Gulf Province, another hour’s drive, Abel Benedict, a pharmacist, said he had not received his monthly order for four months. Dr. Christopher Munguas, a surgeon, said lifesaving catheters and surgical tubes were often unavailable. “Drugs are another headache altogether,” he said. Dr. Peter Sol, an obstetrician, said that before 2014, when the former Australian government agency AusAID was delivering supplies, “you could see all the medicine in remote rural aid posts, health centers. They actually delivered.” Now, Dr. Sol said, “we hardly see those supplies that we used to see before.” Despite its immense resource wealth, Papua New Guinea has the lowest life expectancy in the Pacific at 62.9 years, according to the World Health Organization. And it may be getting worse. The number of people infected with malaria parasites, for example, grew almost ninefold to 432,000 in 2017 from 50,309 in 2014, according to the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research. The survey blames the lack of treatment drugs in many parts of the country, together with a decline in international support. Similarly, a decade ago, Papua New Guinea was being congratulated for its efforts against the spread of H.I.V.; now, infection rates are rising. A survey has also exposed “alarming rates of H.I.V. drug resistance,” said Dr. Angela Kelly-Hanku of the Institute of Medical Research. This is largely because H.I.V. patients are unable to secure reliable supplies of antiretroviral medications, she said. There is also a national shortage of condoms. “The most basic H.I.V. prevention tool, and we don’t have enough,” Dr. Kelly-Hanku said. The country also has some of the most alarming rates of tuberculosis in the world — including drug-resistant strains described as “Ebola with wings” — and the head of the national tuberculosis program recently conceded that the health system was too weak to tackle the problem. Even larger cities have problems. Prof. Glen Mola, one of the nation’s most senior medical specialists, blamed supply chain failures for a resurgence of stillbirths in Port Moresby. Until a decade ago, latent syphilis infection in pregnancy was one of the most common causes of stillbirths in Papua New Guinea. This risk was virtually eradicated through universal screening in pregnancy, but then the supply of the $1 finger-prick blood tests dried up last November. “At Port Moresby General Hospital we didn’t have a case of a death of a baby from syphilis for five or six years, and then we started seeing them again this year,” Professor Mola said. The hospital has also been running out of H.I.V. antiretrovirals and malaria tests. Surgeons are even rationing procedures because of a shortage of sutures. Professor Mola said a colleague with extensive experience in Africa had observed that while corruption was common there, in Africa “they skim off the cream and still leave some milk for the people. In Papua New Guinea, they take the lot.” [Want more in-depth coverage about Australia and the region? Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter.] Corruption has played a big role in the nation’s health crisis but is not the whole story, said Prof. Stephen Howes, an economist at the Australian National University in Canberra who studies Papua New Guinea. The national government slashed its health budget 37 percent from 2014 to 2016 as commodity prices fell. Conditions in Papua New Guinea have also been directly affected by the country’s changing relationship with Australia, its nearest neighbor and former colonizer. Like other international donors, Australia has shifted focus in recent years to infrastructure and capacity building rather than saving individual lives through direct services. “That move out of service delivery was a mistake,” Professor Howes said. Australia also owed Papua New Guinea a political debt after it agreed to process and resettle asylum seekers in detention camps on Manus Island, Professor Howes said, making Australian officials wary of criticizing the country over issues like corruption. Though the Manus Island facility closed last year, there are hundreds of refugees still being held in Papua New Guinea. Australia also fears that pressuring Papua New Guinea too much could push it into the arms of China, which is courting Pacific nations. “We are increasingly looking at P.N.G. through a strategic or in fact through a China lens, and that makes us reluctant to say anything that might annoy them,” Professor Howes said. China and Australia have both invested millions in supporting the APEC meeting, which the Papua New Guinea public has come to view as a drain on government spending. Charles Kerere, a parish priest in the Gulf Province village of Lese, said children in his community were dying from illnesses like diarrhea because the aid post had no medicines. He said he feared an outbreak of polio in the province, which recorded its first case in August. “I’ve been to Port Moresby, I’ve seen lots of money has been pumped into the city,” Father Kerere said. “They are so concerned with trying to please the world leaders that Papua New Guinea is O.K. But under the carpet we have huge problems in our country, and people are suffering. They are crying for services, basic services.”",The New York Times
2018,Parade Watchers Are Thankful for Matt Lauer’s Absence,"For the first time in 20 years, the former anchor did not host NBC’s broadcast of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. For nearly a century, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade has been a turkey-day tradition. For 20 of those years, so was Matt Lauer, as a co-host of NBC’s broadcast of the event. His presence was part of the day whether you liked it or not, like political bickering and your uncle’s weird, gelatinous side dish. But this year, Mr. Lauer is gone. He was ousted from NBC just after Thanksgiving last year, over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. And so for the first time since 1997, Mr. Lauer did not visit the millions of American living rooms tuned in to the parade. Twitter was pretty happy about that. Some people viewed his absence in historical terms. Though other Twitter users were quick to correct the timeline. Some were thankful. Others, however, looked for signs of Mr. Lauer along the parade route — or hoped that he might make a cameo. A few people said they missed seeing the old host, but mostly, Twitter was happy he was gone. Against the best New York Times advice, at least one user used the moment to reflect on the politics of the era.",The New York Times
2018,Paradegoers Brave Coldest Thanksgiving in New York Since 1901,"Heavy winds were expected to threaten the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, but instead parade attendees faced near-record temperatures. Spectators watch balloons float down Central Park West.CreditCreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Under metallic foil blankets, tucked in sleeping bags on the sidewalk or holding quilts over their shoulders and wearing earmuffs over their ears, thousands braved temperatures in the 20s to watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. The National Weather Service on Thursday reported the morning’s lowest temperature at Central Park was 19 degrees, tying it for the second-coldest Thanksgiving Day in New York City’s history, and the coldest since 1901. (Temperatures dipped to 15 degrees in 1871.) Nonetheless, at 72nd Street just before the parade’s 9 a.m. start, a family of turkeys stood on the route braving the cold. “We are icons!” said Jack Brandfield, 20, who along with his father, sister and a friend, was dressed in a full-body turkey suit, complete with yellow feet. “You can find us on Twitter.” The group had shivered in that same spot since 4 a.m. Layers were key, Mr. Brandfield said. “A T-shirt, a henley, a flannel, a jacket,“ said his friend, Jack Hillner, 20. “And a turkey suit!” The parade began with a performance by the Ohio State University marching band, which moved along the route with almost military precision — except for one woman who had stopped playing her French horn because her fingers were too cold. She puffed on her hands until they came back to life. Thor, a palomino police horse standing on Central Park West, seemed to handle it better; all of the police department’s horses wore special jackets emblazoned with “N.Y.P.D.” on their rumps. “He’s warm,” the policewoman riding him said as she passed by. Was she? “Eh!” The officer said with a shrug, and trotted away on her horse. Winds of 15 to 20 miles an hour were expected during the parade, with gusts up to 30 m.p.h. At points, floating balloon creatures, like the Grinch, teetered sideways in the breeze, which induced screams from the crowd. But handlers tugged him and others back into place. If the winds had hit 23 m.p.h. or the gusts reached 34 m.p.h. the police could have grounded the balloons to avoid repeats of past mishaps and accidents that caused serious injuries. But the parade went on uninterrupted, although it appeared the balloons were not flying as high as usual. (Organizers often fly the balloons lower if they think may become dangerous.) At drugstores near the parade route, which runs from the Upper West Side to Herald Square, entire displays of handwarmers had sold out before the parade even began. Claire Churchwell, 27, stood in the aisle of a Duane Reade on Columbus Avenue holding her sneakers in her hand and inspecting her feet for frostbite. Finding none, she put on three newly purchased socks on each foot and headed back into the cold. In a spangly blue dress trimmed with fur, a snowflake in her hair, Jenna Kinder, 15, who had flown from Kentucky to perform with the Spirit of America dancers, had planned ahead. “I’m not cold,” she said. Her secret? “Handwarmers — everywhere.” Some spectators came from even farther afield. “On Monday I was in Cancun!” said Yesenia Romo, 30, a doctor visiting from Aguascalientes, Mexico, a city whose name translates to “hot waters.” Thursday, she said, was the first time in her life she could not feel her toes. “Now I feel like my mind’s freezed.” For the nine extended members of the Diaz family, the cold was too much. They lasted 32 minutes into the parade, before heading home. (To be fair, they had staked out their seats on icy metal bleachers since 7 a.m.) “It’s the tingling in the feet,” said Louis Diaz, 59, a superintendent. “We are going to go home and watch it on TV.”",The New York Times
2018,Paralysis and Anguish: How a Meeting of Bishops Ended With No Action on Sex Abuse,"BALTIMORE — After five relentless months of sexual abuse revelations, America’s Roman Catholic bishops trooped into the final public session of their national meeting this week determined to show outraged parishioners back home that they were taking some action — any action — to respond to the crisis. A bishop from Michigan took to the microphone on Wednesday and proposed a resolution that seemed to reflect a widespread demand for transparency: It said that the bishops should “encourage” the Vatican to release all documentation possible on the alleged misconduct of the former cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, who had been promoted to the church’s highest ranks despite years of warnings that he had coerced young men studying for the priesthood to sleep in his bed. “This is not going to solve everything,” said the bishop, Earl A. Boyea, of Lansing. “It is just one little text that I’ve proposed for all of us.” But even on this “one little text,” the bishops could not find consensus. The vote was almost evenly split over an amendment to add one word — “soon” — to the request to the Vatican to release the documents. The resolution failed, 137 to 83, with five abstentions. [American bishops had a plan to curb sex abuse. Rome ordered them to wait.] The bishops’ paralysis threatened to deepen the damage to a church that has been slowly bleeding members since the last major explosion of the sexual abuse scandal in the United States, in 2002. Some Catholics are renouncing their membership, saying they have had enough. Others are attending Mass dressed in black to show they are in mourning. Parishioners are withholding contributions from their dioceses, or dropping postcards with two pennies taped on into the collection basket — a literal expression of putting in their “two cents.” Bishops who have held public “listening sessions” in parishes have been castigated by furious parents. Though it is too soon for official church statistics to assess the effects, Catholic leaders say the cost to the church is unmistakable. “I’m talking about longtime, cradle Catholics who were very involved in our parish,” said Colleen McCahill, a laywoman who is the pastoral associate at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Baltimore, speaking of the parishioners who have come to her recently to say they are leaving. Bishop Robert E. Barron, an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles, cited statistics showing that in recent years, even before this latest scandal, for every one convert to Catholicism, there are more than six who leave. He said in an interview that he was supposed to give a presentation to the bishops meeting on how the church could attract people who claim no religious identity, but that it was postponed in order to focus on abuse. “This is a credibility issue,” he said. “And without credibility, we can’t possibly evangelize.” The meltdown over the summer came right when many American Catholics thought they had turned the corner on the abuse scandal. When the bishops conference last met, in mid-June in Fort Lauderdale, the crisis on the agenda then was how to help immigrants and families separated at the border. They were also in the process of writing a landmark statement on racism. Five days later, the New York archdiocese announced that Cardinal McCarrick had been removed from ministry after it received credible allegations that he had molested an altar boy 47 years earlier. Two New Jersey dioceses also publicly acknowledged for the first time that their offices had paid out settlements years before to two seminarians who accused the cardinal of sexual misconduct. A subsequent investigation by The New York Times found that a whistle-blower had tried to warn the Vatican about the cardinal’s behavior before he was made archbishop of Washington, a prominent seat. Then in August, a grand jury in Pennsylvania released a report finding 300 priests abused more than 1,000 children over 50 years, and alleging cover-ups by some sitting bishops. Attorneys general in at least a dozen states gradually opened investigations, and the federal government has ordered bishops not to destroy documents related to abusive priests. “The summer of shame has marked a turning point in the way that Catholics, especially American Catholics, are perceiving the church,” Cathleen Kaveny, a Catholic legal and moral scholar at Boston College, said at a symposium in Baltimore on Sunday, a day before the bishops started meeting. “Many people are not seeing the sexual abuse crisis as an aberration within the system, but they’re seeing it as something that really runs throughout the system, that’s enabled by the system.” The bishops came to their meeting in Baltimore aware that they embody the system, and to demonstrate that they hear the cries of the laity for reform. Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, who was assigned to Boston in 2002 to clean up the scandal there and has become Pope Francis’ American point man on the abuse issue, told the bishops he agreed with them about “how important it is that we come out of this meeting with some very concrete action, so that people will not be convinced that the church is incapable of governing ourselves.” But they found themselves wedged between their impatient American parishioners and the Vatican bureaucracy. The bishops were startled to learn on Monday morning, as their meeting opened, that the Vatican had ordered them to delay voting on any of the measures they had proposed to make it easier to report, judge and discipline bishops accused of sexually abusing children or adults. Leading bishops speculated that the Vatican did not want the American bishops to get out ahead of a summit meeting in Rome next February for the presidents of all the national bishops conferences to discuss church polices on sexual abuse. Nevertheless, the American bishops proceeded to discuss the measures, saying they wanted to give their president a clear mandate to take to the Rome meeting. But it soon became clear that they were deeply divided, especially over a proposal to appoint a panel predominantly made up of laypeople to hear accusations of misconduct against bishops. In the end the only resolution related to sexual abuse that the bishops voted on was the ill-fated proposal from the bishop from Michigan to encourage the Vatican to release the McCarrick documents. “We should be grateful that Donald Trump is president because he dominates the news cycle,” Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami said during the bishops’ discussions. “If he didn’t, we would have a lot more bad press.” At that, several bishops seated at the long rows of tables could be seen burying their faces in their palms.",The New York Times
2018,Parishioners Gather to Support Bronx Bishop Accused of Sexual Abuse,"On Friday evening, inside Our Lady of Refuge church in the Bronx, a man tapped on his phone and then raised it high, so each of the approximately 250 people in attendance could see the screen. Rushing toward the man with the phone, the crowd shouted out the name of John Jenik, an auxiliary bishop who was barred from the church on Oct. 29, following a recent allegation that he had an inappropriate relationship with a teenage boy in the 1980s. Bishop Jenik has denied the accusation, but after an investigation by the Archdiocese of New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan called the allegation “credible and substantiated.” An independent commission affiliated with the archdiocese is considering the claim for a cash settlement, and the case has moved to the Vatican for a review process that could take years. Since his banishment, Bishop Jenik, 74, has been living at a rehabilitation center without access to his parish. Many in the church do not believe the allegation, and some gathered on a rainy Friday evening in support. But they were not expecting to see and greet the bishop — even through a FaceTime call. “Muchísimas gracias a todos,” Bishop Jenik said, thanking them for their support. In recent years, as additional allegations of sexual abuse by priests surface — more than a dozen states are investigating abuse claims after a cover-up in Pennsylvania involving at least 300 priests — it is not uncommon to see a parish support the accused. But the size of the crowd on Friday was noteworthy. As the church bells rang at 5 p.m., parishioners gathered in the church hall to wrap handmade signs — written in English, Spanish and Vietnamese — and a framed depiction of Jesus in clear tape before marching into a deluge of rain through the very neighborhood the bishop helped restore. A canopy of umbrellas snaked along the sidewalks. A nun prayed in Spanish through a megaphone. Some supporters carried electric candles, others rainproofed signs. One man, standing across the street with his own sign, yelled, “Support Jenik’s victim.” The marchers remained silent as they passed, continuing onward about a mile. Michael J. Meenan, 52, accused Bishop Jenik in January, and said in an interview last month that he became close to him when he was 13. According to Mr. Meenan, the bishop often invited him to sleep at his home and served alcohol. Once, while sharing a bed, the bishop touched his body through the sheets, Mr. Meenan said. Mr. Meenan’s attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, who has worked on more than 2,000 clerical sexual abuse cases, said on Sunday he is exploring allegations by two other people that question the bishop’s “moral fitness” but do not allege sexual abuse. The archdiocese did not immediately return a request for comment regarding Mr. Meenan’s case. Bishop Jenik is the first seated bishop to be accused of sexual misconduct against a minor since a new wave of allegations flooded the Roman Catholic Church this summer, spurred by the resignation of Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick after allegations of decades of abuse against children and adults. In September the New York State attorney general issued subpoenas to all eight of the state’s dioceses and announced a statewide civil investigation into allegations of sexual abuse and cover-ups. A month later the Department of Justice instructed every Roman Catholic diocese in the country to maintain documentation of their handling of child sex abuse — signaling a deepening investigation into an issue that has largely remained within the Catholic Church’s purview. “The Catholic Church is guilty of criminal acts over the course of decades upon decades, worldwide,” Mr. Garabedian said. “It’s not reasonable to then think that the Catholic Church can self-police in a fair manner. Take away their robes and their religion and they’re just criminals.” Letters of support for the bishop, written in English and Spanish, have expressed discontent with the church-run system and indicated the preference of a court trial. (Mr. Meenan’s allegation does not fall within the state’s statute of limitations.) John Garcia, the executive director of Fordham Bedford Community Services, a nonprofit organization that Bishop Jenik chairs, said the bishop had fought for the community. “He’s been our voice, our fighter. He stood up for us when no one else did,” he said, adding, “There’s nothing short of a smoking gun that will make us believe he could have done this.” On Friday night, Mr. Garcia, one of the few people who has been allowed to visit the bishop, addressed the crowd in Spanish: “I see the bishop almost every day, and he loves you so, so, so much.” Then, on a whim, he dialed the bishop’s number. When Bishop Jenik answered, Mr. Garcia held the phone so parishioners could see him over FaceTime. “Oh my God, he’s there,” shouted Nancy Nguyen, who had traveled from Staten Island to attend. An older woman cried from the corner, and Katty Amato wrapped her arms around her. Ms. Amato, 46, recalled that after she was evicted, Bishop Jenik helped her secure a two-bedroom apartment through the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation, an affordable housing program that he helped start when he joined the parish in 1978. “I keep asking every night, ‘Why is this happening to him?’” Ms. Amato said. “But I think God is testing the community: us, and him too.” She added: “We’re not giving up on him.”",The New York Times
2018,Park Avenue Armory Plans Premieres and Returns,"A new project by the playwright Christopher Shinn, an installation by the artist Hito Steyerl and a residency by the soprano Barbara Hannigan are among the diverse offerings the Park Avenue Armory has in store for its 2019 season, the venue announced on Monday. Programming for the Armory’s vast Wade Thompson Drill Hall — organized by Pierre Audi, the venue’s artistic director — begins on March 22 with the New York premiere of the “The Lehman Trilogy,” as previously announced. The multipart play, about the ill-fated firm that played a large part in the 2008 financial crisis, is written by Stefano Massini and adapted by Ben Power, and will be directed by Sam Mendes. The Drill Hall will also host the premiere of Mr. Shinn’s adaptation of Odon von Horvath’s “Judgment Day,” a project commissioned by the Armory and directed by Richard Jones, which is scheduled to run Dec. 5 through Jan. 11, 2020. (Mr. Jones’s visually audacious production of “The Hairy Ape” drew acclaim at the Armory in 2017.) Ms. Steyerl’s “Drill,” which will spill out of the hall and into the historic rooms of the Armory, will be on view from June 20 through July 21. Other works planned for the space include “Everything That Happened and Would Happen” (June 3-9), a production by Heiner Goebbels — who inventively staged Louis Andriessen’s “De Materie” there in 2016 — that blends live music, performance, sound, movement and moving image. And the Japanese director Satoshi Miyagi’s production of “Antigone,” which adds touches of Noh theater, Indonesian shadow play and Buddhist philosophy to the Greek classic, will run from Sept. 25 through Oct. 6. At the Armory’s smaller rooms, historical spaces used for talks, installations and chamber music concerts, Ms. Hannigan will have a brief residency in October. The daring soprano, who last appeared there in 2017 with two recitals that included rarities by Satie, has organized two programs featuring the New York premiere of John Zorn’s “Jumalatteret,” with the pianist Stephen Gosling, and Schoenberg’s String Quartet No. 2, with the Emerson String Quartet. Among other performers are the violinist Leila Josefowicz, who recently won the $100,000 Avery Fisher Prize, as well as the composer and saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell and the baritone Benjamin Appl, in his North American premiere.

2018,Park Chan-wook Brings His Art-House Eye to ‘The Little Drummer Girl’,"LONDON — A leather suitcase sits in a dark room. A woman hurries over cobblestones in high-heeled boots. A child bounces a ball against a wall. The moments seem unconnected and mundane but the relentlessly ticking clocks and repeated glimpses of the time on various watches and digital displays — 8:19, 8:20, 8:29 — make it clear: Something bad is coming. In these tense opening moments of “The Little Drummer Girl,” a new series on AMC, the South Korean director Park Chan-wook sets a tone of crafted menace and paranoia, pitch-perfect period detail and vivid, visceral sensation that runs through the six parts of John le Carré’s hall-of-mirrors narrative, centered around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the end of the 1970s. [Read our review of “The Little Drummer Girl.”] It’s the second recent foray into world of Le Carré, born David Cornwell, from his sons, Simon and Stephen Cornwell — a follow-up to their successful mini-series, “The Night Manager,” which ran on the BBC and AMC in 2016. That series starred Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston, then about to become a tabloid obsession thanks to his brief relationship with Taylor Swift. The Cornwells’ coup this time was to secure Park, a celebrated art-house director known for films like the violent revenge fantasy “Oldboy” and the erotic thriller “The Handmaiden” who has never previously worked in television. The cast includes Alexander Skarsgard (“Big Little Lies”), Michael Shannon (“The Shape of Water”) and the relatively unknown Florence Pugh (“Lady Macbeth”), in the central role as the young British actress Charmian Ross, known as Charlie. “Little Drummer Girl” is the rare Le Carré work built around a female protagonist: Charlie’s talents (among them bravura lying), courage and idealism lead the Israelis to recruit her to infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist group planning attacks in Europe. The pairing of a provocative Korean auteur and a glossy throwback espionage mini-series might seem an odd one. But Park has been a fan of Le Carré since, as a teenager, he first read “The Spy Who Came in From The Cold.” “My film world is quite dark, and I would say that Le Carré is a big influence on that,” he said, through an interpreter, in an interview at a postproduction facility here. “Little Drummer Girl,” published in 1983, was only translated into Korean around 2005, he said, and although the story is set in 1979, it resonated. “Korea is a country where the Cold War is still very much continuing in terms of what goes on behind the scenes between the north and south.” In the book, he added, there was the similar element of two opposing nations locked in a cycle of violence, which leads to victims on each side. He was also drawn, he said, by the character of the Israeli veteran spymaster, Martin Kurtz (played by Shannon), “more active, dynamic and complex” than Le Carré’s famous puppet-master, George Smiley. “It makes sense that Park would identify with Kurtz, who is a director of sorts,” Shannon said in a telephone interview. “He is always exploring the boundaries between what reality is, and what reality can be created; that’s the overlap between the espionage industry and the entertainment industry.” When Park approached the Cornwells about directing a new film version of “Little Drummer Girl” — made into a little-loved movie starring Diane Keaton in 1984 — they already decided it would be their next television project. (They currently have “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” in their sightlines.) After a meeting, they sent a few scripts to the director but without much hope, as he hadn’t done television before, Stephen Cornwell said in a telephone interview. To their surprise, Park agreed — with the proviso that he wouldn’t change his cinematic eye. He also said there was only one person who could play Charlie. “We nearly burst out laughing when he said Florence, because we were huge fans of ‘Lady Macbeth’ and of her, and she was at the top of our list,” Cornwell said. Pugh was shocked to be approached for the role. “‘The Night Manager’ had boomed, and this was the next one; everyone was talking about it, and I felt it wasn’t really in my reach,” she said in a telephone interview. “But it gave me a lot of confidence,” she said because Park “had faith in the Charlie I was going to bring to the table.” She added that it was “rare to find a character who was just normal. There is something raw and wonderful and believably unlikable about her in the book, and I wanted to show that,” she said. When the series made its debut on the BBC in October, Pugh’s not-always-likable Charlie won raves from British critics. The character, who “feels like a 21st-century woman,” Simon Cornwell said, was one reason the producers didn’t feel the need to update the setting of “Little Drummer Girl” to the present, as they did with “The Night Manager.” The other reason, Stephen Cornwell added, was a difference in context for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “In the ’70s and ’80s, it wasn’t framed in primarily religious terms, and the radical European left had very little interest in religion,” he said. “There are obvious parallels with today, but also great differences.” In the novel, Le Carré scrupulously offers the reader both sides of the story, and Park and the writers, Mike Lesslie and Claire Wilson, were careful to maintain its even-handedness. “I felt the responsibility of understanding the whole context,” said Skarsgard, who plays the Israeli agent Gadi Becker, whose ambiguous relationship with Charlie is at the heart of the series. Gadi is interesting, he said, “because he is so conflicted. It’s not the brave Mossad agent versus the evil Palestinian bomb makers.” Park said that although he didn’t change his directorial approach for television, there was one important difference for him. “The cliffhanger to bring the viewers back the next week is important, something to be enjoyed and very different to making a normal film,” he said. “In terms of following Charlie’s journey, I wanted her to have a powerful encounter at the end of each episode.” More than the sex and violence Park is known for, “Little Drummer Girl” shows the director’s mastery of visual composition and order. From Charlie’s block-color dresses to sweeping views of the Acropolis by night, every detail tells a tale. “I wanted to stay away from the dull, gloomy colors you would conjure up when thinking about the espionage genre,” he said. “This is a story about a civilian woman, an actress, and I wanted that vitality and life in the visual landscape.” The director’s long, thoughtful working process was new for her, Pugh said. “Every scene has been the subject of a long conversation, before, during and after,” she said. “It is a dance with the camera, and you are doing things you don’t understand, but if he is asking you to move in a particular way or put down a cup at a particular angle, there is a reason.” She added: “You are part of a moving painting, and must trust the artist.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the producers of “The Little Drummer Girl.” It is Cornwell, not Cornwall.",The New York Times
2018,Parkland Activists Took On the N.R.A. Here’s How It Turned Out.,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — After the shooting massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., survivors found themselves taking on the National Rifle Association as they crisscrossed the country rallying young adults to register and vote against candidates opposed to gun control. On Tuesday, the Parkland students got a dose of political reality. While their registration drives enrolled thousands of younger votes, the students were unable to turn key races in their home state. Ron DeSantis was elected governor and Rick Scott was leading the vote for United States senator. Both Republicans were endorsed by the National Rifle Association. “Things didn’t necessarily go our way but we know that this is the start, that it’s going to be a long road,” one of the most vocal students, David Hogg, said on Wednesday. “The Florida elections were very close, which is encouraging. For us, the loss in Florida is a call to action.” In midterm elections dominated by health care and immigration, the results on Tuesday also showed that Americans are still wrestling with who should be allowed to purchase guns, how they should be regulated and what defines responsible gun ownership. The outcomes let both sides claim some margin of victory. Two dozen N.R.A.-backed candidates and longtime gun lobby supporters were defeated in House contests, according to Giffords, the gun safety group. And 88 of 129 candidates backed by the group won their races. But groups that oppose gun control also claimed victory. Along with Mr. Scott and Mr. DeSantis, Senate candidates endorsed by the N.R.A., like the Republicans Mike Braun in Indiana and Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, defeated their Democratic opponents. The director of public affairs for the N.R.A., Jennifer Baker, said on Wednesday that “the gun control lobby suffered big losses to pro-Second Amendment candidates in their most high profile races.” A Republican-controlled Senate, Ms. Baker added, would “continue to confirm pro-Second Amendment judges to the lower courts all the way to the Supreme Court.” Voters between the ages of 18 and 29 went to the ballot boxes in greater numbers in House and Senate in races across the country, according to an analysis released on Wednesday by the Institute of Politics at Harvard. Young voters, according to an analysis of exit polls, also helped Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, win the Senate seat in Nevada, and contributed to Beto O’Rouke’s strong showing against Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate race. In Florida, the Harvard research showed, young voters chose the Democratic candidate for governor, Andrew Gillum, over Mr. DeSantis, 62 percent to 36 percent, though Mr. Gillum ultimately lost. John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics, said that politics had become more tangible for younger adults in recent years. The attitudes of youth started to shift after the 2016 election, from fear to hope for the future, he said. Then came Parkland on Feb. 14. A “traumatized generation” became an “energized generation,” which Mr. Volpe expected would help shape a more progressive domestic agenda and demand gun control legislation. “Parkland turbocharged a movement that was going to happen anyway; the tragedy gave them some momentum,” he said. The Parkland students helped the movement, he added, by giving “youth very specific ways to engage: register to vote, sign a petition, call a lawmaker.” At least one person associated with Parkland saw the Florida midterms as a victory. Hunter Pollack, 21, is the brother of Meadow Pollack, 18, who died in the shooting. Mr. Pollack’s father appeared in a political ad for Mr. DeSantis. “The F.B.I. failed my sister. The Broward Sheriff failed my sister. The Broward School Board failed my sister, and Andrew Gillum was a candidate who aligned himself with those failed politicians,” Hunter Pollack said. “If he were elected, I’m positive shootings would continue to happen in schools,” Mr. Pollack said. “He would not take school security seriously. He’s a guy who doesn’t even believe in police officers in schools.” Mr. DeSantis, he said, vowed to get justice for the 17 victims and hold all parties “accountable.” A Parkland shooting survivor, Jaclyn Corin, who is a founder of March for Our Lives, the student-led gun control movement, said she had woken up on Wednesday ready to continue building. “It felt like Feb. 15 in that we know we have to make a change. We have to,” said Ms. Corin, 18, who voted for the first time this election. “We were not successful in this race, but we understand even more work needs to be done.” “Young people are sick and tired of going to funerals of their friends,” she said. “They are sick and tired of seeing kids their age shot at schools, in theaters, at concerts.”",The New York Times
2018,"Part of the Answer to Climate Change May Be America’s Trees and Dirt, Scientists Say","Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — When people think of potential solutions to global warming, they tend to visualize technologies like solar panels or electric cars. A new study published on Wednesday, however, found that better management of forests, grasslands and soils in the United States could offset as much as 21 percent of the country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. At the high end of the projections, that would be roughly equivalent to taking every single car and truck in the country off the road. The paper, published in the journal Science Advances, identified a number of promising strategies, like replanting trees on degraded lands, changing logging practices to better protect existing forests and sequestering more carbon in farmland soils through new agricultural techniques. “We’re not saying these strategies are a substitute for getting to zero-carbon energy; we still need to do that too,” said Joseph E. Fargione, a scientist at the Nature Conservancy and lead author of the study. “But we think that natural climate solutions generally get overlooked. And we found a lot of opportunities here to help mitigate climate change.” Other scientists agreed that storing more carbon in forests and soils could be a potent tool, though some were more cautious about how much was feasible in practice. For instance, the authors of the study used remote-sensing data to identify more than 100 million acres of land in the United States that is not currently being used for crops or pasture but that could be suitable for planting more trees, which absorb carbon from the air. “I’m intrigued and hopeful but also a little skeptical,” said Timothy D. Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University and the World Resources Institute. “They’ve provided a very rough map of these lands, and it would be a good idea to go out and examine this land more closely to see if they’re right and if so, more closely determine what it would take to reforest it.” A growing number of states are now looking at better managing their natural landscapes to store more carbon. California, for example, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in programs to restore degraded wetlands and forests and in efforts to reduce the risk of severe wildfires through improved forest management. (Wildfires release millions of tons of carbon into the air, and it takes many years for the burned trees to fully grow back.) Americans are politically divided over climate change, but there’s broader consensus around some of the solutions. This year, California formed a partnership with 15 other states, including New York and Hawaii, to explore how better land management could help tackle climate change. It’s not an easy task. While many states track the emissions coming out of their power plants and vehicles, they have not traditionally studied how much carbon is released into the atmosphere when, say, grasslands are plowed up and converted into cropland. And it takes detailed modeling to figure out which ecosystems should get priority for restoration. “I’d say we’re still learning,” said Claire Jahns, the assistant secretary for climate issues at the California Natural Resources Agency. “But there’s a growing recognition that we’re not going to hit our state climate targets without paying attention to our lands and the physical environment.” The study looked at nearly two dozen possible approaches. For instance, policymakers could encourage more farmers to plant cover crops between their main harvests rather than leaving their fields bare, which would help pull more carbon from the air into the soil. While cover crops are becoming increasingly common in the United States, the practice often requires extra labor or equipment, so financial incentives may be needed to speed adoption. Other steps could prove more contentious. The study noted that large swaths of forests in the South and Pacific Northwest are being cleared as cities expand. But restricting urban sprawl, as cities in Oregon have tried to do, can be tricky in practice. The researchers contended that many of these actions are relatively affordable. For example, they calculated that reforesting unused land around the United States would cost between $10 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide avoided. That is cheaper than many subsidies to encourage clean energy, and in line with the cost per ton of several recent carbon tax proposals. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Actions to replenish natural landscapes can also have valuable side benefits. Restored wetlands don’t just pull carbon out of the air; they can also improve local water quality and protect cities from flooding. Still, challenges abound. Policymakers have to make sure that efforts to protect forests or convert marginal farmland back into carbon-rich grasslands don’t just spur deforestation or more intensive farming elsewhere. And if we fail to get global warming under control, more of the carbon locked away in forests could be released as more frequent wildfires, droughts and pest infestations kill off trees. Another huge obstacle to conserving more of these ecosystems is the growing global demand for farmland, as the world adds billions more people. Reducing that pressure will most likely require difficult steps like significantly improving crop yields, curtailing food waste and perhaps moderating global meat consumption. “We need to pay attention to everything that’s happening across different landscapes,” said Katharine Mach, a scientist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study. “So much of this is tied to the way we grow food.” For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.",The New York Times
2018,Parting Words,"daily crossword column Erik Agard bids us adieu. TUESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone has their own standards for what makes a good crossword puzzle and, at least in public, mine are very much in alignment with other people’s. There is one standard that I don’t talk about much, primarily because it has nothing to do with the theme or the fill or the cluing, and it would probably seem, well, odd to most of you. But I’m going to reveal it now, just to prove that the enjoyment of crossword puzzles does not have to be an overly intellectual pursuit. O.K., here goes: If a puzzle reminds me of a Monty Python sketch, I automatically like the puzzle. There. I said it. And the world didn’t end. Because we’re talking about a game here — and games are supposed to be fun. Whether the rest of the puzzle is stylistically perfect or not is almost beside the point. If part of the puzzle triggers a smile, I consider myself entertained and having gotten my money’s worth. That’s the case today with Erik Agard’s puzzle. It’s a fine puzzle. Is it one with the kind of cruciverbal derring-do that I expect to see from Mr. Agard? Not really. But it has a theme that reminded me of this classic Monty Python sketch, and that made me smile (the key line is at 2:54): You see? So many people write to tell me how intimidated they are by the starkly black and white, “über-intellectual” New York Times crossword because they look at it as a grim test of knowledge. I’d rather look at it as a fun pursuit that takes you off into all sorts of directions, and down intriguing rabbit holes of research to learn more about that entry you just filled in. So when you find yourself struggling with an entry or a theme and thinking to yourself, “I just don’t think this way, and I’ll never get it,” my best advice is to reframe that thought. Try to find the things you do know, fill them in, learn as much as you can from each puzzle, and then come here to make friends and talk about it. Find the enjoyable parts of the solve, and you’ll be much more likely to come back the next day and try again. 45A: “Pop flies?” is SWAT because “pop” is a synonym for SWAT. 48A: Here’s an example of letting your mind wander and having fun beyond the entry while you’re solving. Obviously, the surface answer to “What icicles do” is DRIP, but don’t let your brain stop there. Answer me this: What movie is the line “I know how to kill a man and leave no trace” from? And what was the method? 3D: Today marks the debut of the term WOMANISM in the New York Times crossword. According to ThoughtCo.com, “The adoption of ‘womanist’ signified an inclusion of race and class issues in feminism.” 46D: I somehow knew that the answer to “Grammy-winning Goldberg” would be WHOOPI, but I confused myself, because I thought of the Grammys as a purely musical award. I had forgotten that comic artists could winning for spoken albums as well, and Ms. Goldberg did have one win and two nominations for her work. 47D: I really like the fact that AUNTIE was clued as “Term of respect for an older woman.” It’s been a long time since the word was clued in the New York Times crossword as anything but part of a proper name for a brand (AUNTIE Anne’s) or a character (AUNTIE Em), but the term has become an endearing way to refer to an older adult woman in African-American and South Indian cultures. At first, it was hard to tell exactly what the four items in Mr. Agard’s theme set had in common. You might not care how “excrementally runny” any of the items in Mr. Agard’s puzzle are — you did watch the sketch above, didn’t you? — but they do, in fact, all RUN. The revealer at 59A (“Parting words from 18-, 23-, 36- and 54-Across?”) is GOTTA RUN, and a FRIED EGG runs, if properly made. A CANDIDATE (23A) runs for office. A COMPUTER PROGRAM runs, and so does an EDITORIAL. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2018,"Past and Present Collide at Wembley, England’s Spiritual, and Spiritless, Home","On Soccer LONDON — The paper airplanes were the nadir, floating down from Wembley’s stands and onto the field, confetti for the loveless union between the English national team and the country it represents. It started during a friendly against Peru in the weeks before the 2014 World Cup. Wanting to give Roy Hodgson’s England team a spectacular send-off on its way to the tournament in Brazil, the Football Association — English soccer’s governing body — had placed pieces of card stock on every seat in the stadium. During the national anthem, the fans were invited to hold them up to form a mosaic of the St. George’s Cross. That part worked fine. When the game — a soporific 3-0 win for England — failed to capture the fans’ imagination, though, a few creative minds started fiddling with the cards. There were a few test launches, and then, before long, there were squadrons of tiny planes in the sky. One, thrown from the top tier, hit Hansell Riojas, the Peru defender. The stadium erupted. A cellphone video of the throw has more than five million views on YouTube. For a while, after that, airplanes became something of a Wembley tradition: not by any means universally popular, but a way to pass time, to alleviate boredom — a silent protest against the tedium of watching England at the professed home of football. As recently as last year, the cheers for a paper airplane gliding from the stadium’s top tier into the back of Joe Hart’s net were as loud as those for the goal that sent Gareth Southgate’s team to the 2018 World Cup. What happened this summer in Russia, of course — those sun-bleached four weeks when it was coming home, everyone was coated in lager, Harry Maguire was a national treasure and waistcoats became de rigueur — has fundamentally altered the dynamic between England’s national team and its public. Thursday’s meeting with the United States might have the air of a tribute to Wayne Rooney, but the paper airplane fad has passed. England is popular again, for now; international breaks are no longer quite such an unwelcome lacuna in the unfolding drama of the Premier League. But if reaching a World Cup semifinal for the first time in almost three decades has absolved the team of its perceived sins, the nation’s relationship with Wembley — the backdrop to so many dreary hours, the scene of so many disappointments — remains much more complex. In April, Shahid Khan, who owns the N.F.L.’s Jacksonville Jaguars and Fulham of the Premier League, made an offer of 800 million pounds (about $1 billion) to buy Wembley from the F.A. His bid had not been solicited; selling the national stadium, rebuilt by the F.A. at a cost of £757 million and only opened in 2007, was not a longstanding plank of policy. The offer was approved by the F.A. board, but it received a much cooler reception from the organization’s council, a sort of parliament for soccer, in which every level of the game is represented. “Only a minority of people speak in meetings like that,” said Malcolm Clarke, a member of the council and the chairman of the Football Supporters’ Federation (F.S.F). “But the tone of those that did was not supportive. If anything, it was against.” The council does not have any legal power — its votes are not binding — but had it voted against the sale, it would have been hard for the board to complete the deal. “They called around the various county associations,” said Barry Taylor, the honorary president of the third-tier club Barnsley and a member of the council. “I think they knew they would not have a majority.” Reading the reception, Khan withdrew his offer in October. Many were relieved. “Certainly, in my neck of the woods, most people don’t think we should sell,” Taylor said. “As someone said to me, ‘Soon we’ll only have Buckingham Palace left.’” In a survey of 2,000 fans by the F.S.F., 58 percent said the F.A. should never sell Wembley. That should not be taken, however, as a sign that the stadium itself is beloved. True, there are many who regard Wembley as the spiritual home of English soccer; there are some who regard it as the spiritual home of all soccer. Gordon Banks, the World Cup-winning goalkeeper, described it as the English game’s “crown jewel” when Khan’s offer was first submitted. But for many, what Clarke called the “mystique” of the stadium has been eroded in recent years. Romance, certainly, was not the dominant force in the discussions held by the council over its sale. “It was more a case of not selling the family silver unless we were absolutely sure it was the right decision, because it was a one-way door,” he said. In part, of course, that is because the current Wembley is not the Wembley that many remember, and cherish. “For me, the historic era of Wembley ended when they knocked down the twin towers of the old ground,” said Mark Perryman, a founder of the LondonEnglandFans supporters group. The new stadium is magnificent, he said, but it is not the same place that hosted “the 1923 F.A. Cup final — the White Horse final — and the 1966 World Cup final, Live Aid and the final of Euro ’96.” It does not possess the emotional resonance that comes with history; nobody ever threw paper airplanes out of boredom at the old Wembley. It is not simply a case of diminishing reverence, however; there are deeper resentments. In its survey, the F.S.F. also asked fans where England’s national team should play its games. Some 71 percent answered that they should be held around the country, rather than exclusively at Wembley. “In the years when they were redeveloping it, the games were held in lots of different places, places that would never have expected to hold an England game,” Perryman said. “It was the biggest experiment in devolution of any national institution this country has seen, and it was a huge success.” There are many, even within the council, who believe England should — like Italy and Spain and the United States, among many others — travel around the nation it represents. One of the strongest arguments in favor of selling Wembley, Clarke said, was that it would eliminate the F.A.’s overpowering financial incentive to play every game there. Sending the team out on the road, some believe, would help the rest of the country feel more of a connection with it. That, to many, is what lies at the root of the discontent with England and with the stadium that had come to be seen as its avatar. Results were, for a long time, poor; major tournaments ended in disappointment. T he sight of so many empty seats, particularly in the corporate sections, went from being a source of embarrassment to a running joke. But more than anything, the problem was that Wembley’s location smacked of centralization, of London’s domination of the rest of the country, of its absorption of investment and resources and opportunity. That imbalance exists in culture and the arts, too, where government spending is heavily skewed toward London and the South East; the fracture between London — as represented by Westminster, England’s political center — and the rest of the country has only deepened in the two years since the Brexit referendum. The decision to rebuild Wembley on its original site — rather than build a new stadium somewhere more central, more accessible — brought the issue into soccer, too. “We are a divided country, and there is a disconnect between London, this global megacity, and the rest of the country, which feels economically deprived,” said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford. “Football, like so many industries, tends toward industrial concentration: the conglomeration of power in the hands of a few. London, and Wembley, is emblematic of that corporatization of football.” For now, wherever England plays, the nation is behind Southgate’s team; success in Russia ensured that. The afterglow will not last forever, though. The F.A. may have recognized that — England played in Leicester and Leeds this year — and Southgate, for one, has voiced his support for taking some home games on the road, strengthening the bond between the players and their people, keeping those paper airplanes at bay.",The New York Times
2018,"Patricia Ione Lloyd, a Playwright With a Taste for Glamour","Socializing With It poured in New York on Election Day, and the “I VOTED” sticker on Patricia Ione Lloyd’s coat that afternoon looked bedraggled. But her glittery eye shadow was perfection, utterly in keeping with the image of a woman whose Instagram posts include a photo of herself (taken just for fun) as a mermaid, in beaded bustier and glistening tail. Ms. Lloyd is a big fan of glamour. She’s also political, and the characters in “Eve’s Song” — her professional playwriting debut, running through Dec. 9 at the Public Theater — are acutely aware of the images they project. She wrote the first draft in 2015 in the Public’s Emerging Writers Group, a program she’d tried for five years to get into, and which she credits with making possible the television writing she has done since. With a black family at its center and the Ellis Wilson painting “Funeral Procession” on their wall, the play — an urgent, darkly comic reminder that black women’s lives matter, too — reads partly as a deconstruction of “The Cosby Show.” It would be reasonable to guess that its author grew up well-off. But the story Ms. Lloyd tells of her Iowa childhood is about living under the poverty line. She goes by Ione now, but she was Patti then — a girl whose mother took her to yard sales to buy loads of books for very little, and whose father made up tales with her about what the birds outside were saying. It was a long road from that life to the one she lives now, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, with her partner, Samantha Ifill, a dentist. “Eve’s Song” came from Ms. Lloyd’s realization that joining a more privileged class didn’t guarantee safety from the dangers of being female, black and queer. Upstairs at the Public, Ms. Lloyd — who is bubbly and funny, with a voice like Mindy Kaling’s — took out her smartphone, opened up Instagram and chatted about her feed. These are edited excerpts. “The first thing I think of is welfare glasses. My family always worked, but like a lot of Americans on welfare just didn’t have enough. I don’t remember what was in style — I think I was about 7 — but I just remember they covered my whole face, and I felt so awkward. Now I love vintage things, or things that look like vintage, like that hat. I have really big hair, and I was like, ‘It just perches there! It’s wonderful.’” “The stories that people tell themselves about black women or black queer women or poor women, those are myths, but people still hold onto them. I’m really trying to tell myself different stories about myself that can help me move through the world in a more powerful way. I will tell you, it’s very hard to find an authentic-looking mermaid tail. But you just have to like fall into the tub — you go, ‘Shoop!’ and hope everything’s O.K.” “Little Miss Flint, Mari Copeny, is a hero of mine. She’s with the ‘Fearless Girl’ in Wall Street. Thinking about language and casting breakdowns, when it’s a girl or a woman it’s usually not meant to be someone of color. I’m trying to find ways through my work to change that assumption. To have a young black girl next to the ‘Fearless Girl’ does that: broadens the idea of girlhood and womanhood. She’s just brave, and I’m really working on being brave.”",The New York Times
2018,"Patricia Quintana, Champion of Mexican Cuisine, Dies at 72","Patricia Quintana, the chef and author whose work exalted the range and sophistication of Mexican cuisine, died on Monday at her home in Mexico City. She was 72. Her son Patricio Pasquel Quintana, who confirmed the death, said Ms. Quintana was given a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma several years ago. Beginning with her first cookbook, “La Cocina Es un Juego” (“The Kitchen Is a Game”), in 1979, Ms. Quintana’s work pushed back against the stereotypes of Mexican cuisine with persistence and finesse, deepening the collective appreciation for regional flavors in her country and abroad. Over several decades she wrote more than 28 books on Mexican food as well as long-running columns for Vogue México and national newspapers. In 1987, JeanMarie Brownson of The Chicago Tribune called “The Taste of Mexico,” Ms. Quintana’s first book published in English, “one of the most exciting cookbooks we have seen in years,” praising its well-rendered recipes, lush photography and attention to regionality. Traveling across Mexico to document, research and adapt recipes, Ms. Quintana often looked to local producers and cooks for practical knowledge, studying the indigenous ingredients she found in home kitchens, whether along stony waterfronts or across agave-speckled flatlands, in adobe pueblos or apartment buildings. In her writing, she drew from this firsthand reporting, but also from the other kinds of knowledge she valued: stories from her grandmothers’ kitchens in Oaxaca and Veracruz, regional Mexican mythology and art, Aztec poetry and song lyrics. Her book “Mexico’s Feasts of Life” (1989) extolled the foods of big family gatherings, like weddings, birthday parties and christenings, gleaning vivid details from both her memories and her fieldwork. “She always kept her mind open to the new,” the Mexican chef Enrique Olvera said in a telephone interview. “She was deeply in love with our cuisine, but also deeply in love with new things.” Ms. Quintana had been a mentor to generations of cooks since the 1980s, when she invited several prominent American chefs — Stephan Pyles, Mark Miller and John Sedlar among them — to her family’s ranch in Veracruz. She greeted her guests with smoked pork tamales and mugs of hot champurrado, made from a base of corn and chocolate. Then Ms. Quintana taught the fathers of the Southwestern movement the fundamentals: How to nixtamalize corn to make fresh masa for tortillas. How to toast the seeds and chiles for mole. How to steam fish inside the fragrant, heart-shaped leaves of the hoja santa plant. “We’d cook, but mostly we’d observe,” said Mr. Pyles, a Texas chef who visited Ms. Quintana several more times and traveled with her across the country. “She wanted us to see what Mexico was like through her eyes. That was her gift to us.” Patricia Quintana Fernandez was born in Mexico City on Oct. 28, 1946, the daughter of cattle ranchers. She grew up in the city, spending summers with her siblings at her family’s ranch in Veracruz. There she followed her curiosity about the laborers who worked the land, tended to animals and cooked the food, joining them to simmer clay pots of beans and heat tortillas. “I wanted to be like them,” she told Food & Wine magazine. It was unusual for a Mexican woman to travel to Europe for culinary school when Ms. Quintana went to L’École Lenôtre in Paris, in the 1970s, taking classes with the pioneers of nouvelle cuisine, including Paul Bocuse, Michel Guérard and the Troisgros brothers. And when she returned, she often wore a white chef’s jacket, custom-embroidered with Mexican flowers, or with the Mexican flag around the collar. The choice was deliberate and defiant. “Women in Mexico didn’t really wear chef coats,” Pati Jinich, a Mexican chef and the host of the PBS series “Pati’s Mexican Table,” said in an interview. “Even though, yes, historically, women owned the kitchen space in Mexico, they were never seen as professionals.” Ms. Quintana wore a chef’s jacket to quietly indicate her own authority. Fluent in four languages, she led locals and visitors on culinary tours of Mexico; established a cooking school in Mexico City, where she taught classes; and started a food business, Gavilla, out of her home kitchen, selling prepared sauces. They are now available in more than 1,000 supermarkets in Mexico. Ms. Quintana’s marriage to Francisco Pasquel in 1970 ended in divorce six years later. In addition to her son Patricio, she is survived by another son, Francisco Pasquel Quintana, and seven grandchildren. Her sons manage her food business. Ms. Quintana rarely spoke about a car accident she was involved in when her children were young; it kept her bedridden for a year and damaged her spine. But once she was back on her feet, she returned to the rhythmic grind of her molcajete, the traditional stone mortar and pestle, as well as the electric blender, which she used when it proved more convenient. She opened a restaurant, Izote, in Mexico City in 2001. She named it after the dramatic clusters of white flowers that bloom on the yucca plant — a thick, slow-growing palm integral to Mayan cuisine. At Izote, Ms. Quintana synthesized the ancient and contemporary influences that had always guided her work as she became a leader in a culinary movement known as alta cocina Mexicana. Her restaurant, in the upscale Polanco neighborhood, was a popular destination until it closed in 2013, after Ms. Quintana learned she had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. By then, her lifelong championing of Mexican cuisine was official: Ms. Quintana joined the Mexican Ministry of Tourism as a culinary ambassador, making a powerful case for her nation’s food culture until, in 2010, it was declared “a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,” a title bestowed by Unesco, the United Nations organization, as an extension of its World Heritage List. “I’ve always wanted to advance and promote Mexican culture,” Ms. Quintana told Food Arts magazine in 2004, “to show that all the ingredients we’ve had since ancient times are still alive.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the surname of one of Ms. Quintana’s sons. He is Patricio Pasquel Quintana, not Fernandez.",The New York Times
2018,Patrik Laine of Jets Has N.H.L.’s First 5-Goal Game Since 2011,"N.H.L. Roundup Patrik Laine scored five goals Saturday in the Winnipeg Jets’ 8-4 victory in St. Louis, two short of the 97-year-old N.H.L. record. It was the 61st five-goal game in league history, and Laine became the third player since the 1997-98 season to score five goals in a game and the first since Johan Franzen did it for the Detroit Red Wings on Feb. 2, 2011. Marian Gaborik did it with the Minnesota Wild in 2007. Joe Malone, who played in the early days of the N.H.L. with the Montreal Canadiens, scored seven goals in a game with the Quebec Bulldogs in January 1920. Darryl Sittler of the Toronto Maple Leafs was the last player to score six goals in a game, on April 22, 1976, against Boston. “If somebody thinks that it’s going to come easily, it doesn’t,” Laine said. “Every goal you’re going to score in this league, it’s hard. It’s the best league in the world. Obviously scoring five, it’s pretty unreal, but for those who think it’s easy, it’s not.” Brandon Tanev, Blake Wheeler, and Jack Roslovic also scored for the Jets, who snapped their first two-game losing streak of the season. Laine’s five goal outburst gives him a league-leading 16 goals in 10 November games. “I felt like every time I touched the puck, it kind of went in somehow,” he said. Chad Johnson allowed six goals on 25 shots and was pulled in favor of Jake Allen after allowing his sixth goal, Laine’s fourth. Allen stopped nine of 11 shots. Laine scored his first goal 16 minutes 26 seconds into the first period when he buried a feed from Bryan Little just 41 seconds after Wheeler tied the game at 1-1 with his fourth goal of the season. Vladimir Tarasenko tied the game 1:24 later when he snapped a 10-game streak without scoring a goal with his seventh of the season. Laine’s second goal came on the power play with Tarasenko serving a two-minute penalty for roughing and put Winnipeg ahead, 3-2. Laine completed his seventh career hat trick and third of November when he beat Johnson 12:53 into the third period. Blues defenseman Joel Edmundson fought Tyler Myers shortly after Laine’s third goal, but that did nothing to change the tide as Laine netted his fourth goal later in the period. Laine netted his fifth of the game when he pushed a feed from Little past Allen, becoming the 45th player in N.H.L. history to record a five-goal game. “We’ve got to play him harder,” Blues left wing David Perron said. “It’s almost like we respected him too much.” CAPITALS 5, RANGERS 3 Brett Connolly scored the tiebreaking goal on a one-timer from the left circle with 6:24 left in the third period, and Washington beat the host Rangers for their season-high fifth straight win. “A little bit of open ice,” Connolly said of his fourth goal of the season. He added, “I got a good piece of it, and it went right where I wanted it.” Alex Ovechkin, Nic Dowd, Jakub Vrana and Tom Wilson also scored for the defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals, and Carlson had three assists. Pheonix Copley, starting in goal in place of Braden Holtby, stopped 27 shots. “Good team win, we’re playing really well as of late,” Connolly said. “We’re starting to get that feeling again through our room, like we had toward the end of last year.” The Capitals, who have rallied after giving up the first goal in four of their wins during their streak, trailed by 1-0 after one period and by two midway through the second before scoring three straight to take the lead heading to the third. “We’re always believing we’re in games,” Connolly said. “We’re finding ways to win.” Ryan Strome tied the score, 3-3, on a wraparound at 5:30 of the final period — his first goal with the Rangers since being acquired from Edmonton on Nov. 16. Connolly, who also had an assist, then gave Washington the lead back, and Wilson added an empty-netter with 1:08 left for his fourth. Wilson has nine points in seven games since returning from a season-opening suspension that sidelined him for 16 games. Jimmy Vesey and Brady Skjei also scored for the Rangers, who lost their second straight and saw their seven-game home winning streak end. Kevin Hayes had two assists, and Alexandar Georgiev finished with 23 saves. Trailing, 1-0, after Vesey scored, the Capitals came out with increased intensity in the second period and scored three goals, outshooting the Rangers by 15-9. “You can’t take a period off against anyone, let alone the defending Stanley Cup champions,” Rangers Coach David Quinn said. “If you’re going to have a chance to beat them, you’re going to have to stay on them for 60 minutes. You can have lapses where you don’t play well, but they can’t be 20-minute lapses.” ISLANDERS 4, HURRICANES 1 Thomas Greiss made 26 saves, and Valtteri Filppula, Anthony Beauvillier, Josh Bailey and Adam Pelech scored, leading the host Islanders past Carolina. Brock Nelson, Anders Lee and Bailey finished with multipoint games. It was the sixth multipoint game of the season for Bailey. Justin Williams scored for the Hurricanes, and Scott Darling made 15 saves. The Islanders limited the Hurricanes to one goal for the third consecutive game. The win was the Islanders’ second in a row against a divisional opponent on back-to-back nights. The Islanders are 9-1-0 against Metropolitan Division opponents. “We know the importance when it comes to playoff seeding, it’s obviously crucial,” Bailey said. “I think going into any game you have to get fired up and have preparation. But like anything there’s probably a little extra going into divisional games.”",The New York Times
2018,Patriots’ Path to Playoffs Includes a Bit More Tinkering This Time,"On Pro Football EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The primary issue confronting the New England Patriots at the moment is not whether they will advance to the postseason, because they have advanced to the postseason every year since the Louisiana Purchase, or close to it. Every season, they get 16 games to resolve, or practice concealing, the inadequacies that might prevent them from winning the Super Bowl, which they usually accomplish well enough to win two playoff games, or even three, earning the perpetual envy of distressed N.F.L. teams everywhere. The next five weeks, then, will shape New England’s candidacy as a contender in an evolving league whose top teams seem to set passing records in every game (as the Patriots do not), seem to score on every possession (as the Patriots do not) and seem to thrash each of their supposedly inferior opponents (as the Patriots have not). As ever, New England (8-3) is stampeding toward another A.F.C. title, expanding its division lead to three games after defeating the Jets, 27-13, before a crowd at MetLife Stadium that was teeming with Patriots fans. The Patriots prevailed after a lethargic first half because they had Tom Brady and Sony Michel, and that potent tandem can counterbalance certain flaws against certain teams — such as the Jets, who appear to be careening toward an ignominious trifecta: a last-place finish, an eighth straight year missing the playoffs and an off-season coaching search. How the Patriots handled the Jets, though, does not matter to New England, since the Jets will not factor among their potential playoff opponents. What is important is whether New England is constructed to score enough points while sufficiently limiting the dynamic offenses dominating the N.F.L. “We want to be physical,” said Michel, who had 133 of the Patriots’ 215 rushing yards, the team’s most in four seasons, and a touchdown. “When you’re physical, you can run the ball, you can throw the ball. It’s almost like you control the line of scrimmage and do what you want to do.” Conversely, opposing teams for years have espoused the importance of running well against New England. The most reliable way to prevent Brady from shredding a defense is to keep him off the field and keep the clock churning. That approach will serve teams well against front-runners like the New Orleans Saints, the Los Angeles Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Patriots entered Sunday averaging 3.9 yards a rush, 27th in the league, and recorded all of 40 rushing yards in their last game, a desultory 34-10 loss at Tennessee. That afternoon, Michel, still slowed by a knee injury, rushed for only 31. He benefited from the Patriots’ bye last week, as did right guard Shaq Mason and tight end Rob Gronkowski, who each had missed the previous two games. “This is kind of the first time we’ve had a lot of guys healthier,” said Brady, who completed 20 of 31 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns. “It just helped everything out.” The Patriots otherwise manhandled the Jets, outgaining them 498 to 338. They inflicted physical discomfort, too, with receiver Cordarrelle Patterson — responding to what he described as Jets defensive end Henry Anderson putting his crotch in his face — grabbing Anderson in a rather sensitive area. An interactive calculator that lets you explore the New England Patriots’ end-of-season scenarios like a champ. “I’m a grown man,” Patterson said, adding, “It’s disrespectful.” Had the Patriots not struggled with coverage; with tackling; and with the concept that presnap penalties are bad and personal fouls are, too, then they would not have been tied with the Jets deep into the third quarter. New England gained 246 yards in the first half and allowed no sacks, but still scored just 10 points. And they were fortunate even to have scored the touchdown, given that it came after Jets Coach Todd Bowles opted to accept a 10-yard pass-interference penalty on third-and-2 at the Jets’ 24 instead of forcing a field-goal attempt. Given another chance, Brady on the next play connected with Gronkowski for a 34-yard touchdown. The Patriots are far more formidable with a healthy Gronkowski, who not only draws coverage away from receivers Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon but also might be the best run-blocking tight end in the N.F.L. New England also expects to soon regain the versatile running back Rex Burkhead, who will complement Michel and James White, who ran for 73 yards on nine carries. White, you may recall, scored the winning touchdown in the Patriots’ last Super Bowl win, two seasons ago against Atlanta. In that postseason, like in all others since 2010, New England rested on the opening weekend, enjoying a first-round bye. The Patriots are seeded second in the A.F.C., behind Kansas City (9-2), which is off this week. New England lags because it has lost to three teams that might not even reach the playoffs: Detroit, Jacksonville and Tennessee. The game that could have the biggest effect on New England’s playoff seeding, as well as the landscape in the A.F.C., will come in Week 15, when the Patriots visit Pittsburgh (7-3-1), which had won six straight before losing at Denver on Sunday. A victory there would give them wins against all three of the other A.F.C. division leaders, including the Chiefs and the Texans. Before the Patriots can envision playoff permutations, though, they must next face Minnesota, which entered its game on Sunday night having allowed the fewest rushing yards per attempt this season. That’s when the Patriots will learn whether they’ve truly resurrected their running game. It’s a new concern for a team accustomed to having one of the most coveted offenses in the league — if not the most — and the most coveted quarterback. That second distinction, at least this season, belongs to Drew Brees, Patrick Mahomes or Jared Goff. The Patriots, though, with a 41-year-old Brady, are recalibrating how to win, with a commitment to balance that they hope will propel them in January, be it at New England, Kansas City or Atlanta, the site of Super Bowl LIII.",The New York Times
2018,"Patti LuPone, From Broadway to the Open Road","Q&A The Tony-winning actress and frequent traveler talks about her favorite vacation spots, where she still wants to go (Bhutan and Tibet are on that list) and why she expects her hotel room to be ready when she arrives at her destination. Patti LuPone entered into the annals of Broadway history when she appeared in the 1979 production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, “Evita,” playing Eva Perón and winning the Tony Award that season for best actress in a musical. (In 2018, she gave a mesmerizing performance of that show’s “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina,” at the Grammy Awards, in tribute to Mr. Lloyd Webber, temporarily patching up a two-decade feud that dated back to when she was replaced by Glenn Close in the composer’s Broadway-bound musical “Sunset Boulevard.”) Over the years, she has returned to Broadway in such roles as Momma Rose in “Gypsy” (her second Tony), Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim’s “Sweeney Todd” and, most recently, Helena Rubinstein in “War Paint.” Currently Ms. LuPone, 69, is starring as Joanne in the gender-switching London production of Sondheim’s “Company” (Bobby is now Bobbie), which has received rave reviews, particularly for Ms. LuPone, and has sparked reports of a Broadway transfer next season. The actress is also the author of “Patti LuPone: A Memoir.” Like all working actors, Ms. LuPone travels a lot, which she greatly enjoys (well, except for the flying bit). “I’m a traveler,” she says. “I’m curious. I want to see as many different cultures, costumes, ceremonies, and landscapes as possible. I want to know why we are different and how we are the same.” In a recent email exchange, she talked about some of her favorite travel spots, how she reduces the stress of life on the road and why she expects her hotel room to be ready for her, no matter what time she arrives. When you travel, are you looking for adventure, relaxation, culture — all three? All three. My first priority is to adjust to any time difference, so I rest. Culture and adventure hold second place equally in my travels. I read a lot and I find that I’m interested in visiting places that are depicted in those books. For instance, after reading George Orwell’s “Burmese Days,” I made a trip to Myanmar when it was still called Burma. I went to Bali, Indonesia, because I grew up listening to the musical “South Pacific” and the song “Bali Hai,” knowing full well Bali had nothing to do with the song. But the word “Bali” was in it. I love green so I always travel outside of cities. I want to see daily life, drink local wine, eat local produce. In the cites I try to find the path less traveled. Once, I took a ferry to get to the Museum of Everything exhibit in Hobart, Tasmania, so I had a peaceful ride on the water and then a wild ride in the artists’ imaginative minds in the museum. Those are the experiences I look for. Do you sleep on the plane? Read? Watch movies? I sleep on planes. I hate to fly. Do you use Wi-Fi on the plane or do you use that time in the air to disconnect? I disconnect on flights. Are there certain things you always take with you? I carry a pillow, a humidi-flyer, Burt’s Bees lip balm, hand and face cream, my computer and my passport. Also, the book I’m reading, sleeping pills, an eye mask and ear plugs, a protein bar if the airline menu looks suspicious. Checked luggage or carry on? If it’s a holiday, and not for work, only carry-on. Rimowa luggage is the only way to go. What have been your favorite trips? Southeast Asia and any place my husband and son are with me. And, of course, LSD in Central Park in the ’70s. How can you beat that? Favorite hotel? The Peninsula in Hong Kong, and the Surf and Sand in Laguna Beach, Calif. But actually any hotel that welcomes one at any time of the day and night and understands stress levels and a desire to be left alone is my favorite. You’re now in London with “Company.” Any particular spot in that city that you try to visit when you have the chance? The Columbia Road flower market, which is about so much more than flowers. And Hampstead Heath. The Heath is a magical 800 acres of land in North London. When I was doing “Les Misérables,” I lived right across the road from the Heath. I wandered into it every day. It just reverberates with history and beauty and my imagination goes slightly haywire in the thicket. Paths that lead somewhere but not always. I would get lost frequently but I always managed to end up at Kenwood House. Where do you want to go that you haven’t gone to yet? My list: 1. Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal and Tibet. 2. Drive the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to Vancouver Island. 3. Spend three months on Capri. 4. Drive the Great Ocean Road in Australia. 5. Drive the Wild Atlantic Way in Ireland.",The New York Times
2018,"Paul Manafort, Immigration, Stephen Hillenburg: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump lobbed familiar accusations about Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation the day after prosecutors asserted that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, had violated his plea agreement by repeatedly lying to them. In a court filing, prosecutors said that Mr. Manafort’s “crimes and lies” had nullified the promises made to him in the deal. Defense lawyers denied that Mr. Manafort had broken the agreement. Mr. Manafort, above, was convicted in August of eight counts of financial fraud stemming from his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. The Times examined his rise and fall. _____ 2. The number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has dropped significantly — even as the national debate around immigration has become much more divisive. A new study, published by the Pew Research Center, put the number of undocumented immigrants at 10.7 million in 2016, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. And it noted a sharp decrease in “recent arrivals.” Above, at the border near Laredo, Tex. Separately, our reporters looked at deaths at the U.S.-Mexico frontier. Here’s the story of a woman who was injured trying to scale a border wall last week, and the tragic history of a boy shot at the border by a Marine two decades ago. _____ 3. China’s richest man and the founder of the country’s biggest e-commerce company, Alibaba, was listed as a member of the Chinese Communist Party in its official newspaper. It might seem paradoxical that an entrepreneur who amassed wealth in the private sector belongs to an organization that propagates the ideals of Karl Marx. But Jack Ma’s membership didn’t surprise many in China — and it “reveals a party that is eager to prove its legitimacy by affiliating itself with capitalist success stories,” our Asia tech columnist writes. Separately, in the second part of our China Rules special series, we look at how the country unleashed upward economic mobility and embraced free enterprise while still maintaining state control. _____ 4. Juul Labs, the leading manufacturer of e-cigarettes in the U.S., is looking to duplicate that success in markets overseas. The company, which has come under scrutiny for producing flavored vaping products popular with children and teenagers, is creating a potent e-cigarette pod that it hopes will appeal to adult smokers and sidestep stricter nicotine regulations in Europe. The new pods contain less nicotine than their U.S. counterparts, but they create an intense vapor, potentially making them even more addictive, experts told us. One researcher said the approach could amount to a workaround, saying, “It’s more like cheating the test.” _____ 5. The final Senate race of the year is over. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Mississippi Republican who had to apologize for a cavalier reference to a public hanging, won a special runoff election on Tuesday, defeating the Democratic nominee, Mike Espy, who was trying become the state’s first black senator since Reconstruction. _____ 6. The creator of SpongeBob SquarePants, Stephen Hillenburg, died Monday at his home in California. He was 57. Inspiration for the cartoon show’s main character grew from Mr. Hillenburg’s background as a marine biology teacher, sort of. At first he drew blob-like sea sponges. “Then I drew a square sponge, and it looked so funny,” he said in a 2001 interview. “He seemed to fit the character type I was looking for — a somewhat nerdy, squeaky-clean oddball.” The television cartoon spawned two movies and a Broadway musical that was nominated for nine Tony Awards (and won one, for scenic design). Mr. Hillenburg announced last year that he had Lou Gehrig’s disease. _____ 7. A fatal tug-of-war. The two pilots on the doomed Lion Air flight that nose-dived into the Java Sea off Indonesia last month struggled with the Boeing 737 almost from takeoff, our reporters learned. The flight data recorder, above, shows the plane plunged dangerously downward more than two dozen times during the 11-minute flight, consistent with investigators’ theory that a new computerized system malfunctioned. The pilots repeatedly pulled the nose back up but finally lost control, investigators said, leaving the plane to crash, killing all 189 people on board. And our journalists, who interviewed dozens of employees, officials and aviation analysts, found that Lion Air was cutting corners long before the crash. _____ 8. Three U.S. soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Witnesses said a roadside bomb detonated as an American convoy passed near Ghazni City, in the southeast. It was the worst loss of life for U.S. troops in the country this year. The Taliban, which now controls more territory than at any time since the start of the war, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group has been pressing the fight for Ghazni City, pictured above, since August. Meanwhile, the military is investigating whether an Afghan soldier who killed a Czech soldier last month in the western province of Herat was beaten or tortured to death while in custody. The U.S. Green Beret unit at the scene has been sent home, officials said. _____ 9. Roz Chast’s jittery cartoons capture the essence of the anxiously obsessive New Yorker. A retrospective of her work, now on display at a Manhattan gallery, includes drawings, childhood sketchbooks, hand-decorated Ukrainian-style eggs and a life-size “M.R.I. of Love,” based on one of her cartoons. She talked with our reporter about getting started as a cartoonist, why she loves crafts and the one thing she hates to draw. (Hint: You won’t find it in the city.) _____ 10. Finally, a reason to celebrate. The N.F.L. last year relaxed its strict rules about on-field jubilation after big plays. Before long, high fives evolved into elaborate routines: drum lines, a phone call, famous moments in other sports, even a pantomime birth with a football baby. Above, Vikings move to a limbo beat. Our sports reporter has assembled a video sampler of this year’s best celebrations, most of which would have once drawn a flag. Have a winning evening.

2018,"Paul Polman, a ‘Crucial Voice’ for Corporate Responsibility, Steps Down as Unilever C.E.O.","When Paul Polman was made chief executive of Unilever in 2009, he was regarded as a safe choice to lead the maker of Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. A veteran executive from Nestlé and Procter & Gamble, he was known for his fiscal discipline and international experience. But Mr. Polman, who on Thursday announced that he would step down at the end of the year, quickly set about making dramatic changes when he took over Unilever. He stopped issuing quarterly guidance, signaling to Wall Street that he was not going to make decisions to improve the short-term stock price. He rolled out a long-term strategy to make Unilever a better steward of the environment and a more socially responsible business, known as the Sustainable Living Plan. In time, Mr. Polman, who is Dutch, began acquiring brands known for their ecological bona fides, like Seventh Generation and Tazo tea. And last year, he fended off a takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz, a deal that would have been a near-term win for investors but would have set up a clash of diametrically opposed corporate cultures. As Unilever’s chief, Mr. Polman emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the corporate world calling for changes to the status quo, encouraging big companies to reduce emissions, embrace renewable energy, improve conditions for workers and produce healthier products. He served on a United Nations panel that created the Sustainable Development Goals. And in 2015, he was among the most prominent business leaders calling for world leaders to commit to the Paris climate accord. “There’s been no one as clear and focused and all-in as Paul Polman in setting goals for his company, his supply chain and taking his words on the road,” said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit group that advocates for sustainable business. “His voice has made a difference. He’s put his money where his mouth is.” Mr. Polman will be succeeded by Alan Jope, who has led Unilever’s beauty and personal care division — its largest business — since 2011. Mr. Jope, a Scotsman, once appeared as a judge on “The Apprentice” with Donald J. Trump. In an interview, Mr. Polman said he believed Mr. Jope would continue his efforts to promote sustainability and social responsibility. “That was one of the main criteria selection of the new C.E.O.,” Mr. Polman said, adding that he believed many of those ideals were now embedded in the company. “A responsible business model makes your brand stronger and improves corporate reputation, and that is reflected in the share price,” he said. “We have a very supportive board who understands that, even when they are tested in cases like Kraft Heinz. And the people and brands who have joined us have come because of the Sustainable Living Plan.” But as Mr. Polman departs, some wonder whether Unilever will continue to promote corporate responsibility, especially as consumer goods makers struggle with lagging sales, rising costs from tariffs and new competition from companies like Amazon. “Paul has been a crucial voice for a more ethical and sustainable form of capitalism,” said Aron Cramer, chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, a trade group. “But consumer products companies are going through choppy waters. It will be essential that the board maintain its commitment to his vision.” When Mr. Polman first took over at Unilever, financial analysts were skeptical of his new direction. During his first few months, which coincided with the financial crisis, Unilever’s stock plummeted more than 27 percent. When he abolished quarterly guidance, shares fell 8 percent. But since then, Unilever’s stock price has shot up, more than doubling during Mr. Polman’s tenure. Mr. Polman managed to deliver strong financial results by acquiring new brands, expanding in emerging markets and enlarging the company’s personal care business. At the same time, he championed the Sustainable Living Plan, which set ambitious goals such as cutting Unilever’s environmental impact in half by 2030, while still improving sales. To accomplish this, Mr. Polman gave managers wide latitude to make changes that could reduce water use and greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and create less waste. The company has been transparent about its progress, issuing annual reports detailing its efforts, including improving working conditions in its supply chain and creating healthier products. For example, Unilever says that carbon dioxide emissions from its factories are down 47 percent from 2008 levels. But success has been uneven. Unilever’s push to use sustainable soy beans in Iowa to create a better mayonnaise has been inordinately complicated. And it notes that it is having a hard time meeting its goal of sourcing all agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020. Last year, that figure was at just 56 percent. And while Mr. Polman has overseen strong, sustained growth at Unilever in recent years, his tenure hasn’t been entirely smooth. The bid from Kraft Heinz, whose board then included Warren E. Buffett, offered Unilever shareholders a roughly 18 percent premium to their stock. But Mr. Polman argued that Unilever would be worth more over the long term, and Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer. In the aftermath, investors looked to Mr. Polman to improve profits and streamline the company, including an effort to reduce bureaucracy by doing away with a dual listing structure that includes two headquarters, in London and Rotterdam. In March, Unilever announced it would make the Netherlands its sole headquarters, dealing a symbolic and economic blow to Britain in the wake of the Brexit vote. But such a move would have forced Unilever to leave the FTSE 100 stock index, in turn forcing several large mutual funds to sell their holdings. In October, Mr. Polman backtracked on the plan. On Thursday, Mr. Polman said his effort to unite the company was among his greatest priorities in his last year on the job, but with the effort having faltered, he believed it was time to retire. “I tried to do the job of unification, but it was a difficult environment,” he said. “But the ship is steadied. We have transformed the company.”",The New York Times
2018,Paul Zimmerman (Dr. Z) Dies at 86; Chronicled Football’s Complexity,"Paul Zimmerman, a pro football writer whose deep understanding of the game informed his work at Sports Illustrated and influenced the way other reporters covered the sport, died on Thursday in Noblesville, Ind. Also known as Dr. Z, he was 86. His wife, Linda Bailey Zimmerman, confirmed the death, at an assisted living facility. Mr. Zimmerman’s tenure at Sports Illustrated ended in 2008, when he had three strokes that left him unable to write and read and almost unable to speak. Over nearly 30 years at the magazine, his sharp writing and sophisticated dissection of the complexities of football gave him a national voice. He could tell the story of a Super Bowl with a mastery of play-calling or write revealing profiles of players and coaches. “He made people understand how difficult the game was to understand and taught us not to try to oversimplify it,” Peter King, a former longtime Sports Illustrated pro football writer, said in a telephone interview. “He never wanted to take the easy way out.” Reconstructing the San Francisco 49ers’ winning drive in the 1981 National Football Conference championship game against the Dallas Cowboys, Mr. Zimmerman wrote about the spectacular touchdown pass from the 49er quarterback, Joe Montana, to Dwight Clark. “It was the play that had given the 49ers their first touchdown, Solomon slotted inside Clark on the right side and breaking to the corner after Clark had cleared out underneath in a semi-pick,” he wrote in Sports Illustrated. But if Solomon was covered, he added, Clark would cut across the end zone, “right to left, doing an about-face and breaking back right.” “Montana, rolling to his right, had to find him.” Montana found a leaping Clark (“who climbed the sky wire”) in the back of the end zone for the game-tying score with 51 seconds left. The 49ers won, 28-27, on an extra point, then defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl. Before there was an internet, before websites detailed the minutiae of each game, Mr. Zimmerman produced his own charts, filled with game specifics, large and small, that helped him tell his stories. In “The Franchise” (1997), a book about the history of Sports Illustrated, Michael MacCambridge wrote that Mr. Zimmerman charted games with “different squiggles denoting pass, run or punt, his tiny script indicating the ball carrier or receiver.” Mr. Zimmerman charted virtually everything else that occurred on a football field as well, including the length of the national anthem. Paul Lionel Zimmerman was born on Oct. 23, 1932, in Philadelphia and soon moved with his parents to Manhattan. His father, Charles, was a garment industry union leader and co-chairman of the Socialist Party-Democratic Socialist Federation. His mother, Rose (Prepstein) Zimmerman, was a dressmaker. Paul played football at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx and then at Stanford and Columbia. As an offensive lineman, he understood the importance of the trench battles between offensive and defensive players, a view later reflected in his writings. He earned a master’s degree in journalism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism before starting a newspaper career with The Sacramento Bee, and later worked for The New York Journal-American, The New York World-Telegram and Sun and The New York Post. At The Post, he covered the New York Jets and chronicled their rise to the Super Bowl championship in 1969, led by Joe Namath. Gerald Eskenazi, the Jets beat reporter for The New York Times in those days, recalled Mr. Zimmerman in an email as “the rival reporter I feared the most.” “On Mondays after a Jets game,” he wrote, “I would reluctantly pick up The New York Post to see what angle I missed in the game, what quote he got.” Mr. Zimmerman burnished his football-expert credentials with the publication of “A Thinking Man’s Guide to Pro Football” (1970), which he revised in 1984. In his review of the original version, the Times sports columnist Robert Lipsyte praised Mr. Zimmerman for having a “clear and skeptical eye and the rare gift of being interesting and technical at the same time.” At Sports Illustrated, Mr. Zimmerman became known for his mock N.F.L. drafts, for answering letters about football and various other subjects, including wine (about which he had a column in The Post) and for picking winners each week. Leading off his bettor’s guide to Week 12 of the 2008 football season — one of the last things he wrote before his first stroke — he advised readers: “You’re going to see a parade of underdogs that will blow your head off. So wear a hat.” Before his illness, he had completed an autobiography, “Dr. Z: The Lost Memoirs of an Irreverent Football Writer.” But it took until last year for it to be published, with help from Mr. King, who now works for NBC Sports. In addition to his wife, Linda, Mr. Zimmerman is survived by his daughter, Sarah Zimmerman; his son, Michael; a stepson, Nathan Bailey; a stepdaughter, Heather Snopek; and a granddaughter. In 2014, six years into his stroke-imposed silence, Mr. Zimmerman starred in a nine-minute video, “Yours Truly, Dr. Z,” produced by NFL Films. In the video, the actor Tom Wopat narrates a script by Ken Rodgers based largely on what Mr. Zimmerman had written in the past. The collaboration earned Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Zimmerman a Sports Emmy for outstanding writing. “Ken did his homework,” Ms. Bailey Zimmerman said in a telephone interview, “and could do the dialogue as if Paul was talking.”",The New York Times
2018,"Paula Jones, Reconsidered","Critic’s Notebook “The Clinton Affair,” A&E’s six-part mini-series on the scandals of Bill Clinton’s presidency, lacks a point of view. It is straightforward in style and evenhanded in tone. Strangely, this recommends it. The events it covers have been so sensationalized and so politicized for so long that seeing them presented neutrally and in roughly chronological order is revelatory, particularly regarding the stories of three women: Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick. These are the women who, in the 1990s, publicly accused the president of the United States of sexual harassment and assault. It’s been a year for reconsidering Bill Clinton’s presidency and its players; December is the 20th anniversary of his impeachment. Ken Starr returned to defend his investigation in a memoir, “Contempt.” Linda Tripp reappeared on Capitol Hill, where she styled herself as a brave truth teller who faced a “high-tech lynching” for blowing the whistle. And Bill and Hillary are setting off on an arena tour billed as “An Evening With the Clintons.” Much of the buzz around the A&E series has focused on the participation of Monica Lewinsky. Though the filmmakers — the director Blair Foster and the producer Alex Gibney — interviewed more than 50 subjects, including James Carville and David Brock, the one boldfaced name in the network’s news release is hers. This prime-time appearance caps her comeback. After spending a decade and a half out of the public eye, she has returned with a perch at Vanity Fair, a TED Talk and an anti-bullying cause. She has called herself “patient zero” of online shaming. She has emerged from years of media torture as an unexpected darling of the press. The same cannot be said for Jones, Willey and Broaddrick. In the ’90s, they were dismissed as “bimbos” deployed in service of what Hillary Clinton called the “vast right-wing conspiracy,” and with few exceptions, their stories have remained relegated to the margins of respectable conversation. They have been featured not in glossy fashion magazines but in self-published memoirs and political smear campaigns. They have been used as right-wing pawns and left-wing punching bags. In 2016, when they sat together in an on-camera interview during Hillary Clinton’s run for president, it was for the nationalist outlet Breitbart. And when they convened in public to tell their stories, it was in service of a Donald J. Trump campaign stunt at the second presidential debate; Steve Bannon could be spied stalking the perimeter. Their stories have been twisted in so many ways for so many years that it seems unworkable to unravel them now. “The Clinton Affair” does the work. It quite literally shows these women in a new light. They are filmed in places that look like well-appointed hotel rooms. The lighting is soft and generous. The filmmakers place their stories on the same level as those of Lewinsky and Carville, of career F.B.I. agents and prestigious lawyers. As a result, a space opens there for them to speak about Bill Clinton but also about themselves. The series lifts their accusations from the tabloid gutter and repositions them in the context of their lives as women. Paula Jones, in particular, rises. In 1994, she said that Bill Clinton had summoned her to a hotel room and exposed himself when he was the governor of Arkansas and she was a state employee. (Clinton has always denied the charges from Jones, Willey and Broaddrick). Later she filed suit against him for sexual harassment. Her story was politicized from the start: It was seized by a Republican operative, who urged her to go public at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the right’s annual activist spectacle. In turn, Clinton’s advisers trashed her on television. Carville said this: “If you drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.” George Stephanopoulos compared Jones to Tonya Harding: just another woman seeking cash for telling a tabloid tale. (Even Harding — not the victim in that story — has since had her legacy revised.) The assessment lingered: In 2016, Vox published an “explainer” dismissing her charges as “probably bunk,” relaying, in part, that her description of Bill Clinton’s penis did not align with those of some anonymous sources. “The Clinton Affair” gifts her a blank slate. The aspersions cast against her can be resolved here. Yes, she was poor: She sought out an Arkansas state government job in an attempt to transcend her only other options, “the Walmart and the Pizza Hut.” And yes, she leaned on conservatives; in a contemporaneous interview with Sam Donaldson, she explained, “Those are the only people that are coming to my defense.” In her new interview, she retells her story of harassment while fighting back tears. She appears guileless and helpful. In a word: credible. Jones’s account is further clarified by Slate’s eight-part investigative history podcast “Slow Burn,” in which the journalist Leon Neyfakh pursues the uncovered stories of Clinton’s impeachment. If “The Clinton Affair” seeks an even retelling, “Slow Burn” snakes in and out of the narrative, teasing out themes and sorting out confusions. One of its achievements is in its meticulous documentation of how the harassment and assault claims against Clinton came to be politicized. Jones’s representatives made efforts to place her story in mainstream newspapers, only to be frustrated by foot-dragging journalists. As Michael Isikoff, a Washington Post reporter at the time, puts it in an interview with Neyfakh, his editors “viewed it as tawdry.” (Isikoff was later ready to report the Lewinsky story for Newsweek, but higher-ups held it, according to “Slow Burn” and “The Clinton Affair”; Matt Drudge broke the news instead.) Later, NBC sat on the tape of an emotional interview with Broaddrick in which she accused Bill Clinton of raping her, finally airing the segment only after Clinton had weathered his impeachment and trial. “Slow Burn” concludes with an episode about that NBC appearance. Through new interviews with Broaddrick and Lisa Myers, the NBC reporter who championed her story, it paints a convincing picture of a network news division that seemed incapable of handling assault claims against powerful men, no matter how credible or well-sourced. In the ’90s, these women’s stories cut directly to the biases of the mainstream media: that sexual harassment and assault were tabloid tales and that publishing anything that seemed to sway a political process was ill advised. For the past several years, we have been recalibrating Clinton’s legacy through micro historical trends. When Lewinsky re-emerged in 2014, she aligned herself in the causes of the moment, speaking out against bullying and shaming. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, the accusers’ stories were again co-opted for political attack, by both the Trump campaign and Clinton supporters. An Emily’s List rep told BuzzFeed of Broaddrick: “Women know that this is an unfair attack on Hillary, and that’s why it continues to exist in this small corner of the right-wing media world.” Today these stories are being re-evaluated in the context of the #MeToo movement. In an essay for Vanity Fair earlier this year, Lewinsky wrote that #MeToo had given her a “new lens” for seeing her own story: “Now, at 44, I’m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern.” Lewinsky has always been cast as the central female character of Bill Clinton’s scandals, and while that has been hell for her, it has been rather convenient for him. Over two decades, it was easy to forget that the reporting on Clinton’s consensual affair with an intern arose out of an even more damning context: Jones’s harassment suit. (It was Lewinsky and Clinton denying their affair under oath in the Jones case that gave Starr the material to pounce.) Paula Jones spoke out against the most powerful man in the world, and when his lawyers argued that a sitting president couldn’t be subject to a civil suit, she took them all the way to the Supreme Court and won. In another world, she would be hailed as a feminist icon. But not in this world — not yet. OpinionMichelle Goldberg",The New York Times
2018,Peeling Back the Paint to Discover Bruegel’s Secrets,"New technology allows researchers to look beneath the layers of the Dutch master’s works, revealing some macabre details. AMSTERDAM — What would happen if you peeled back the layers of a masterpiece by one of art history’s greatest painters? Dead bodies might suddenly appear. Take, for example, Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s large-scale festival scene, “The Battle Between Carnival and Lent,” which he painted in 1559. If we look at his first drafts of the painting, using X-ray photography, we can see a corpse inside a cart that an old woman is dragging behind her. Then we see another dead body on the ground, its face turned to the viewer; he is lying ominously close to a sick child. But when we look at the final version of the painting — the one we see with our own eyes — these macabre elements aren’t there anymore. The corpse in the cart has been blotted out with brown paint; the body on the ground is shrouded in a white cloth. When and how did these dead people disappear? New imaging technology, created by a project known as “Inside Bruegel” offers some insight into these questions, by allowing us to pull the painting’s layers apart. The project was developed along with the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, for “Bruegel” a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition, featuring 87 of the painter’s works, and which runs through Jan. 13, 2019. “It’s a huge advancement if you want to look at Bruegel,” said Ron Spronk, a professor of art history at Queen’s University in Canada, and one of four curators of the exhibition. “You can actually see the creative process. You can follow the artist in how he makes decisions.” A leading painter of the Northern Renaissance, known for works like “The Tower of Babel,” “The Peasant Wedding,” and “The Triumph of Death,” Bruegel created meticulously detailed, chaotic worlds. They parodied religious themes, mocked piousness, presented death and destruction in surprisingly realistic detail and elevated peasants to central roles. He showed us a comic, violent, and sometimes ugly universe of common folk at a time that the Spanish Inquisition was sweeping Europe in the 16th century. On his death bed, Bruegel advised his wife to burn his drawings, for fear “that they were too caustic or derisory, either because he was sorry” or because she might get in trouble with the authorities, according to a 1604 biography by Karel van Mander. Was he afraid of retribution because his drawings were too subversive? “One of the things that art historians debate quite seriously is to what level Bruegel was criticizing the government of that day,” Mr. Spronk said. “Those kinds of questions are still debated today.” Bruegel himself made changes to his own compositions that might give us clues about his perspective. Like other 16th-century masters, he constructed his paintings painstakingly on wood panels, layer by layer. He started with a light-colored foundational surface, known as the ground, made of chalk and animal glue, on which he would sketch out his composition. Later, he would paint using oils. In the center foreground of the painting, “The Battle Between Carnival and Lent” we see festivalgoers celebrating on one side and pious observers of lent on the other. They are engaged in a kind of jousting match. A rotund man holding a pig on a stick faces off with an austere penitent, holding a baker’s peel on which there are two fish. If we look at an image of this painting made with infrared rays, though, we see that instead of the two fish, Bruegel painted a cross — a symbol of the church. He later removed the cross and added the fish, a traditional food served during the festival of Lent. But fish are also symbols of Christ, so it could just be a more subtle reference to the church. “We don’t know,” which he meant, Mr. Spronk said. “This could be interpreted in many different ways.” As to the painting’s corpses, Sabine Pénot, a curator of Netherlandish and Dutch paintings at the Kunsthistorisches Museum and another of the exhibition’s curators, said that Bruegel didn’t make these changes himself; someone else blotted out the dead body in the cart, and covered up the corpse on the ground, although nobody knows who did it or when, precisely. Ms. Pénot said it may have been in the 17th or 18th centuries. Using the “Inside Bruegel” tools, we can see what he intended, and how others reacted, Ms. Pénot said. “You see Bruegel’s creative forces and in some cases you see what happened after him. You see the paint layer where you find these dead or ill bodies and then you encounter the intervention of someone later on to reduce these dark or shocking images.” Ms. Pénot compares these changes to those that have been previously noted in Bruegel’s “Massacre of the Innocents,” which is currently in the British royal collection. (A copy, but not the original is included in the Vienna show, because it was too fragile to travel.) “Massacre of the Innocents,” originally depicting the slaughter of children, is thought of today by some critics as one of Bruegel’s most strident criticisms of the atrocities of the Spanish Inquisition in the Netherlands. But some viewers must have felt that the violence he depicted was just too much to handle. At some point in history, either in the 17th or 18th century, Ms. Pénot said, someone replaced all the images of dead children with images of farm animals — and that’s how the painting stands today. Using the web tool InsideBruegel.net, anyone can access 12 paintings from the Vienna museum and spend hours zooming in on these details. Initially funded by the Getty Foundation’s Panel Paintings Initiative, a decade-long effort to train panel paintings restorers, this technology has also been used to study the paintings of Bruegel’s fellow Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, as well as the works of van Eyck, a 15th-century Flemish painter best known for the Ghent Altarpiece, “The Adoration of the Lamb.” “You can access the website really as a novice and as a specialist,” Ms. Pénot said. “It’s a very important tool for conservation, but you can also make your own discoveries.” Ms. Pénot said that researchers have discovered that, “Most of these paintings have gone through a modification. Either the panels were cut down, or they have been partly overpainted or details have been changed, either in Bruegel’s time or in later periods.” Mr. Spronk said: “There still is a lot of debate as to what the meaning is, or what the layers of meaning are, in the paintings. The question of what Bruegel is trying to convey is not resolved.” He added that it was unclear if the painter was an anthropologist ahead of his time, “who wanted to show us images of peasants in their daily life, falling into the water, having a bowel movement in the grass,” or whether he was “pretty much just trying to make us laugh.” “We don’t know the answer,” Mr. Spronk said. “We provide theses images so that people can make up their own minds.”",The New York Times
2018,"Peer Review: The Worst Way to Judge Research, Except for All the Others","The New Health Care A look at the system’s weaknesses, and possible ways to combat them. Even before the recent news that a group of researchers managed to get several ridiculous fake studies published in reputable academic journals, people have been aware of problems with peer review. Throwing out the system — which deems whether research is robust and worth being published — would do more harm than good. But it makes sense to be aware of peer review’s potential weaknesses. Reviewers may be overworked and underprepared. Although they’re experts in the subject they are reading about, they get no specific training to do peer review, and are rarely paid for it. With 2.5 million peer-reviewed papers published annually worldwide — and more that are reviewed but never published — it can be hard to find enough people to review all the work. There is evidence that reviewers are not always consistent. A 1982 paper describes a study in which two researchers selected 12 articles already accepted by highly regarded journals, swapped the real names and academic affiliations for false ones, and resubmitted the identical material to the same journals that had already accepted them in the previous 18 to 32 months. Only 8 percent of editors or reviewers noticed the duplication, and three papers were detected and pulled. Of the nine papers that continued through the review process, eight were turned down, with 89 percent of reviewers recommending rejection. Peer review may be inhibiting innovation. It takes significant reviewer agreement to have a paper accepted. One potential downside is that important research bucking a trend or overturning accepted wisdom may face challenges surviving peer review. In 2015, a study published in P.N.A.S. tracked more than 1,000 manuscripts submitted to three prestigious medical journals. Of the 808 that were published at some point, the 2 percent that were most frequently cited had been rejected by the journals. An even bigger issue is that peer review may be biased. Reviewers can usually see the names of the authors and their institutions, and multiple studies have shown that reviews preferentially accept or reject articles based on a number of demographic factors. In a study published in eLife last year, researchers created a database consisting of more than 9,000 editors, 43,000 reviewers and 126,000 authors whose work led to about 41,000 articles in 142 journals in a number of domains. They found that women made up only 26 percent of editors, 28 percent of reviewers and 37 percent of authors. Analyses showed that this was not because fewer women were available for each role. A similar study focusing on earth and space science journals found that women made up only about a quarter of first authors and about 20 percent of reviewers. They had higher acceptance rates than men, though. In 2012, the journal Nature undertook an internal review of its peer review process, finding balance in its editors and reporters but disparities elsewhere. In 2011, women made up only 14 percent of the more than 5,500 peer reviewers for papers. Only 18 percent of the 34 researchers profiled in 2011-12 were women, and only 19 percent of the articles written for the “Comment and World View” section were by women. It’s possible women declined opportunities to review, but studies have documented that male editors tend to favor male reviewers. This year, Nature reported that it had increased participation of women in the “Comment and World View” section to 34 percent, while the percent of reviewers had climbed only to 16 percent. Unesco estimates that women make up 29 percent of the worldwide science work force. But there are also data to support the value of peer review. A 1994 study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, reviewed the quality of papers submitted to the journal before and after the peer review and editorial system. Researchers used a tool that assessed the manuscript’s quality on 34 items, and their work showed that all but one got better. The biggest improvements were in the discussion of a study’s limitations, its generalizations, its use of confidence intervals and the tone of the conclusions. Probably none of these would have occurred without the nudge of peer review. How then to improve the existing system? For starters, more formal training might improve quality and speed. Given how hard it is to recruit good reviewers, journal editors could consider better incentives, such as paying reviewers for their time. The unpaid costs of peer review were estimated at 1.9 billion pounds (almost $3.5 billion) in 2008. Or journals could offer, without promise of acceptance, quicker turnaround for a reviewer’s future papers. Academia might offer more formal recognition for review work as well. A number of journals have moved toward fully blinded reviews, in which reviewers don’t know the authors or institutions of papers they’re judging. This could eliminate some biases. It’s hard to do this, though, because papers often refer to prior work or to where the research occurred. It also doesn’t solve the relative lack of women in the editorial and review process in general. One way to detect problems with research earlier would be to let researchers post manuscripts online before submission, for public judgment before formal peer review. This is already common in some sciences, such as physics. Medical journals would probably resist this, however, because it could reduce their ability to get press and attention once the research was fully published. A significant improvement would require a change in attitude. Too often, we think that once a paper gets through peer review, it’s “truth.” We’d do better to accept that everything, even published research, needs to be reconsidered as new evidence comes to light, and subjected to more thorough post-publication review. As an author of papers, and as a writer who comments on papers in the news media, I’ve seen how the peer review process can fail. But I’m also an editor at the journal JAMA Pediatrics. There, as at many journals, a paper’s first gatekeeper is an editor. Those getting past that hurdle are sent out to a few experts in the field who are asked to read and offer their views to the editor. This informs what might happen next: acceptance, rejection or a chance to respond to reviewer comments before a decision is made. Each week we meet by teleconference to discuss papers we are considering for publication. We talk about the reviews, and ultimately decide what few studies make the cut. I’m always impressed by the quality of the discussion and the seriousness with which people take their charge. We also follow papers we turn down to see if we made mistakes in deciding to reject. We use that data to review and improve our process. I’m sure other journals do the same. And I’m sure we make our share of bad calls, as other journals do. Peer review is still better than the alternatives. It might make more sense, though, to see it (and publication) as steps on the road to assurance, not a final stamp of approval. An earlier version of this article misstated the publication date for a study that tested the peer-review process by resubmitting papers to the same scientific journals that had already accepted them, but using different names and credentials. It was published in 1982, not 2010.",The New York Times
2018,Pelosi Tells Democratic Allies Party Will Make Big Gains in Midterms,"[See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis.] House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi predicted sweeping Democratic gains in the midterm elections at a private meeting with political allies in Washington on Tuesday, but warned that President Trump might attempt to brand the election as “rigged” if the ultimate result was close, according to three people present for her remarks. A California Democrat who is seeking to reclaim the House speakership, Ms. Pelosi briefed a luncheon of several dozen Democratic donors and political strategists, delivering a detailed forecast for the election that conveyed confidence Democrats would soon take the House majority. She was joined by a collection of senior Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor, and Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Going state by state over the political map, Ms. Pelosi said she expected Democrats to capture three or four Republican-held seats in Pennsylvania, between two and four in New Jersey and up to three in Illinois, people who attended the event said, speaking anonymously to discuss a private conversation. In several smaller states, Ms. Pelosi predicted a Democratic sweep of the most competitive congressional races, including gains of two seats each in Iowa and Kansas, and one seat in New Mexico. That supremely optimistic outlook on the night reflects just how high Democratic hopes have risen for a takeover in the House, and one person who attended the event expressed surprise at just how far Ms. Pelosi went in the direction of predicting a robust victory. Most leaders in both parties now expect Democrats to take the majority, but even confident Democratic officials have been largely restrained in forecasting the scale of gains they anticipate. [Read more about Nancy Pelosi on the campaign trail] Still, Ms. Pelosi urged Democrats not to take victory for granted even over the final hours of the campaign, and cautioned that they should not be surprised if Mr. Trump attempts to question the legitimacy of the election. She noted that Democrats have deployed hundreds of lawyers around the country to address any issues of election integrity. Mr. Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims of voter fraud in the past, including in the aftermath of his own 2016 victory. Looking past an anticipated victory, Ms. Pelosi said a Democratic majority in the House would swiftly tackle issues of government ethics, infrastructure spending and health care. Impeachment, she said, was not on the agenda. Ms. Pelosi was not alone in her buoyant mood. Mr. McAuliffe, who with Ms. Pelosi has been raising millions of dollars to attack Republican-drawn congressional maps in state elections, said he expected the party to gain 40 seats in the House, including at least three in his home state. And Representative Henry Cuellar, who briefed the crowd on his native Texas, offered a prediction that thrilled the room: Representative Beto O’Rourke would defeat Senator Ted Cruz. Recalling a campaign swing he made with Mr. O’Rourke, Mr. Cuellar said he had never seen anything quite like the crowd that gathered for the insurgent Senate candidate.",The New York Times
2018,Pelosi Turns to Arm Twisting After Resounding Vote Leaves Her Just Short of Speakership,"WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi overwhelmingly won the Democratic nomination on Wednesday to be speaker when the new Congress convenes in January, but the defection of 32 Democrats signaled that she could still face a divisive fight to lead the House just as the party assumes control. The result kept alive the threat of a messy intraparty feud and touched off what promises to be an intense period of internal arm-twisting and cajoling by a leader renowned for both. At the same time, it confirmed that despite a drumbeat of calls within her caucus for new leadership, most Democrats support returning the 78-year-old Californian, the first woman to be speaker, to the post. In a secret-ballot vote that dramatized rifts among Democrats only weeks after midterm election victories handed them the majority, Ms. Pelosi, running unopposed, won support from 203 Democrats. Beyond the 32 no votes, three ballots were left blank. [Here are the Democrats who voted against Nancy Pelosi.] “It’s a big victory,” she exulted as she made her way to the Capitol after the results were announced, brushing aside questions about her detractors and saying she felt “great.” To become speaker, Ms. Pelosi must win 218 votes in a House floor vote on Jan. 3. That gives opponents time to recruit a serious challenger, something they have said could occur only once they showed that she lacked the votes to be elected. But the tally also demonstrated the limits of a group of dissidents who want fresh faces at the top of the party. They include newcomers who campaigned promising to change Congress, some of whom made explicit pledges not to vote for Ms. Pelosi, who has led House Democrats for more than 15 years. Speaking with reporters as the votes were tallied, Ms. Pelosi hinted that she expected her opposition to erode. “I think we’re in pretty good shape,” she said. “I don’t want to make other people’s announcements for them, but we go forward with confidence and humility.” But some of those who voted against her on Wednesday said they were repelled by the politicking that has defined the speakership fight so far, and were determined to maintain their opposition in part because of it. “I made a promise to the voters of my district that I would be a no — no under any circumstances,” said Representative-elect Max Rose of New York, adding that he was mystified that journalists continued to ask him whether he would change his position. “What it speaks to, though, is a culture of politics in this town where people change their opinions,” Mr. Rose said. “So I’m not swaying with the wind, and I believe that many of us members came here to D.C. not for just one fight, but to change politics in this country.” The congressional freshman class of 2019 includes the most racially diverse and most female group of representatives ever elected to the House. Just before the balloting began, Ms. Pelosi dispensed with one major obstacle that had threatened to strengthen her foes, securing the support of a small but critical bloc of Democrats after she agreed to change House rules to give rank-and-file members more influence in Congress. After painstaking negotiations that stretched into the wee hours of Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi struck a deal with the Problem Solvers Caucus, which had withheld its support until it secured changes that its members said would break partisan gridlock by empowering lawmakers to forge bipartisan compromises. The deal, the latest example of Ms. Pelosi’s quiet campaign to wear down opponents, came minutes before Democrats began formally nominating her for the post, and not long before the start of the vote testing the strength of her support. “We have reached such an agreement with Leader Pelosi to help break the gridlock for the American people and will support her,” the Problem Solvers said in a statement. The deal won her the backing of eight members. But Ms. Pelosi still faces determined opposition from others, including members of a group of 16 Democrats who signed a letter last week calling for new leadership. Their three leaders met with the minority leader before the vote on Wednesday and emerged declaring themselves unmoved. [As Nancy Pelosi prepares to lead the House again, she will have to navigate between a rampaging president and her colleagues’ plans for fighting back.] Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, an organizer of the group, said their request of Ms. Pelosi had always been: “Produce a meaningful plan for a leadership transition, as you promised in the summer, to allow a new generation of leadership to step forward.” He said he was “disappointed to report that no agreement was reached in this initial meeting,” but “hopeful” of continuing talks with Ms. Pelosi. With Democrats so far in control of 234 seats for the next Congress, Ms. Pelosi can afford to lose no more than 16 Democrats in the Jan. 3 roll call vote if all lawmakers are present and voting. That margin may change as additional races are called. “None of us wants to have a floor fight, but voters have to be heard — we need to protect new members,” said Representative Kathleen Rice of New York, who attended the meeting along with Mr. Moulton and Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. Several of the newly elected members won in competitive districts after promising not to support Ms. Pelosi for speaker, and they risk losing their seats if they go back on their word. “We just elected the most diverse group of members that has ever been elected to the House in our history,” Ms. Rice added, “and they deserve to know when the leadership is going to change.” Along with Ms. Pelosi, Democrats moved unanimously to return their other two top leaders, forgoing a vote and electing Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, 79, as the majority leader and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, 78, as the whip. The results amounted to a resounding endorsement of a leadership team that has remained unchanged for more than a decade, a remarkable reality for a party whose new face is one of generational, racial and cultural transformation. Still, the election did yield the promise of a new generation of leaders. Democrats chose Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the 46-year-old chief of the party’s House campaign committee, for the fourth-ranking position of assistant majority leader. And Representative Hakeem Jeffries, 48, of New York, who has been a leading voice in favor of generational change within the party, was elected chairman of the caucus, the No. 5 post. Taken together, their elevation reflected a new sense of urgency among House Democrats after midterm election victories ushered in a disproportionately young class of freshmen eager to shake up the stilted ways of Washington and infuse a different set of voices into their party leadership. Mr. Jeffries beat out an icon of the left, Representative Barbara Lee of California, who would have been the first black woman to be elected to that post. Ms. Lee, at 72, would also have been the fourth septuagenarian in the House Democratic leadership. The contest between two members of the Congressional Black Caucus split Democrats, with 123 supporting Mr. Jeffries, who represents Brooklyn and Queens, and 113 siding with Ms. Lee. Ms. Lee said after the vote that she “absolutely” thought that sexism and ageism had been at work in the contest. “That’s something women, especially women of color and African-American women, have to fight constantly, each and every day,” she said, adding, “We still have many glass ceilings to break.” In impassioned speeches to an ornate hearing room full of Democrats on Wednesday afternoon before the vote, Ms. Pelosi’s allies argued that she was the best person to take on President Trump and outmaneuver Republican congressional leaders at a critical time for the country. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who is in line to become chairman of the Intelligence Committee, became emotional as he made the case for Ms. Pelosi. “Everything we care about is now at risk,” Mr. Schiff said, according to people in the room, mentioning families who lack health insurance, children separated from their parents and autoworkers who have lost their jobs. “Press characterized as the enemy of the people, the independence of our justice system being undermined. We have the most immoral, unprincipled and dangerous president in our history.” Although she easily won the nomination, Ms. Pelosi’s victory carried notes of caution for a leader who has proclaimed unequivocally that she had the votes to become speaker. Those who have pressed for a new leader have long believed that after they showed she did not have such support, they could force a debate over an alternative candidate for speaker, a clear time limit on her tenure or a compromise in other leadership posts that would ensure a generational change at the top — all options Ms. Pelosi has refused to consider. But Ms. Pelosi, who excels at legislative haggling and the corralling of a sometimes fractious group of Democrats, has demonstrated in the past that she has the capacity to win over dissenters with a mix of sweeteners and unspoken threats. The last time she faced opposition, when Mr. Ryan challenged her for minority leader in 2016, she lost 63 Democrats, almost twice the number that voted against her on Wednesday. Her deal with the Problem Solvers Caucus appeared to ease her path considerably. Among the changes she agreed to were one that would make it easier for “consensus” bills — those that gain at least 290 co-sponsors — to get a vote on the House floor, and for bipartisan amendments, with at least 20 members of each party supporting them, to be considered in committees. Another notable change would eliminate the ability of one member to essentially force a vote of no confidence in the speaker, a threat that has allowed the House Freedom Caucus, a group of ultraconservative Republicans, to handcuff the speaker, and ultimately led to the resignation of Speaker John A. Boehner in 2015. Instead, the move would have to be initiated by a party caucus or conference. An earlier version of this article misstated the leadership rank Representative Hakeem Jeffries was elected to. He is the fifth-ranking leader, not the fourth.",The New York Times
2018,Pelosi and Trump Agree on Something: She Should Be Speaker,"WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the highest-ranking House Democrat, declared on Wednesday that she was confident that her newly ascendant colleagues would elect her speaker, as she moved aggressively to hold off a challenge to her leadership that could fracture the party. The day after midterm elections that handed her party control of the House, Ms. Pelosi curtly brushed aside questions about whether she was convinced she would continue to lead her caucus — “Yes, I am,” she said — even as other Democrats jockeyed for position. Republicans, after stinging losses, braced for a leadership battle of their own. The maneuverings were the first signs of potentially bruising battles over the direction of both parties in a new era of divided government, in which Democrats and Republicans will both face internal struggles to define their messages and their tactics. Democrats faced immediate decisions on how aggressively, and where, to use their oversight powers to investigate President Trump and his administration, and how far to go in seeking compromise or confrontation with a commander in chief who has labeled them sworn enemies. Mr. Trump began the day offering Ms. Pelosi an early, if unusual, endorsement on Twitter. In a backhanded compliment to an adversary he relishes attacking, he later said during a formal postelection news conference that he would even supply her with Republican votes to win the speakership if there was not sufficient support among Democrats to elect her. “I think she deserves it,” Mr. Trump said. “She’s fought long and hard, she’s a very capable person, and you know, you have other people shooting at her trying to take over the speakership.” Ms. Pelosi, fresh off midterm election wins that her allies believe have cemented her hold on the top position, said the president was right about her fitness for the job, but for the wrong reasons. “I don’t think anybody deserves anything — it’s not about what you have done, it’s what you can do,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference at the Capitol. “And I think I’m the best person to go forward, to unify, to negotiate.” Still, Democrats do face consequential choices about their leadership as a new, more diverse and younger majority prepares to take over. Ms. Pelosi, 78, has exuded confidence that her colleagues would choose her to resume her tenure as the first female speaker of the House, and whispers that she would face a serious challenge appear to have dissipated. Behind the scenes on Wednesday, she began the process of gathering the votes she needs to hold off any rebellion, making telephone calls to Democratic lawmakers to secure their support, according to a senior Democratic aide. She spent Wednesday night in her Capitol office handwriting personalized messages on letters that went to each Democratic lawmaker and newly elected member, in which she solicited their support “with confidence and humility.” “We must show on the first day of the 116th Congress that we are prepared to get the job done for the American people,” she wrote. Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, who is supporting Ms. Pelosi for speaker, said that “with victory on your side, it always helps a lot.” But he and other more centrist members of the party in the House will insist on changes to ensure they have a voice in legislating and policymaking. Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday that she would put forward new rules that would ensure “openness and transparency” in the way the House runs. “Our newcomers will be part of putting together how our agenda goes forward,” she said. Some of the Democratic candidates most outspoken about opposing her speakership lost on Tuesday, such as Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and Dan McCready in North Carolina. But others won, including Abigail Spanberger in Virginia — who a spokesman said on Wednesday had not changed her position that Ms. Pelosi should not be speaker — and Joe Cunningham in South Carolina. “There is no chance he will vote for Pelosi,” Tyler Jones, Mr. Cunningham’s spokesman, said on Wednesday. “He will keep his promise.” Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday night that he planned to run for majority leader, the No. 2 position in the House, while Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina plans to run for whip, the No. 3 post. That lineup would keep the top three positions of the current septuagenarian triumvirate — with none of the youthful sheen of the incoming class. “It’s a pretty static situation right now,” said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, who leads the moderate New Democrats Coalition. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have said they want one of their own to be considered for any vacancy in the top two positions. But no one has come forward to challenge Ms. Pelosi or Mr. Hoyer. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who is viewed as a rising star, has told lawmakers he is likely to run for Democratic caucus chairman against Representatives Linda T. Sánchez and Barbara Lee, both of California, a contest that could pit two of Democrats’ geographic strongholds against each other. “We have won the majority, and now we must keep the majority,” Mr. Jeffries, 48, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, he added, the Democrats must “avoid an unnecessary family feud about leadership aspirations.” Mr. Clyburn, who is black, said on Tuesday night that he believed Ms. Pelosi would stay in the top position, with Mr. Hoyer second in line, and “hopefully” himself third. He said he expected to see more African-Americans in other leadership positions, arguing that the newer members would accept such a result. “I’ve been campaigning for all of these people — I talk to them all the time,” Mr. Clyburn said. “I don’t have any problem with them.” Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado said on Wednesday that she would challenge Mr. Clyburn, but she is not expected to topple him, particularly given his base of support in the Black Caucus. Ms. DeGette, who has been the chief deputy whip for more than a decade, said in an interview that she did not “intend to have a messy leadership race.” Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the triumphant chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, announced on Wednesday that he would seek the post of assistant majority leader, the No. 4 job, which is already being pursued by David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Cheri Bustos of Illinois. Republicans were also grappling for power. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the founder of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, announced that he would seek the post of minority leader, pitting him against Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the current No. 2 Republican. In an interview with The Hill on Wednesday, Mr. Jordan placed the blame for Republican losses in the House at the feet of the leaders, suggesting they had not been conservative enough or sufficiently willing to bulldoze Democratic opposition to muscle through Mr. Trump’s top priorities such as repealing the Affordable Care Act, building a huge border wall or cutting welfare. He spent Wednesday dialing fellow Republicans to make his case. Mr. McCarthy defended his tenure, telling House Republicans in a letter that the party had enjoyed “great gains,” including tax cuts and a reduction in federal regulations. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana said he would run for whip, the No. 2 spot, ending speculation that he might challenge Mr. McCarthy. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming announced she would seek the job of Republican conference chairwoman, setting up a likely showdown with the current chairwoman, Representative Cathy McMorris-Rodgers of Washington. The maneuvering among top Democrats was quieter. Mr. Hoyer has begun collecting signatures from allies for a letter highlighting his experience, his ability to take on Mr. Trump, and the steps he has taken to advance younger members on his whip team, according to two Democrats familiar with the effort. As of Wednesday, several lawmakers said they did not expect a serious head-to-head challenge against Ms. Pelosi to emerge, but it was still far from certain whether she would have the 218 votes needed to win the speakership. A shrewd vote-counter, Ms. Pelosi would be unlikely to let such a fight play out in the House chamber without being certain that she would win; if she determined that she could not, several lawmakers said they expected a scramble to replace her. Still, allies and adversaries alike noted that a newly empowered Ms. Pelosi had a formidable arsenal of potential sweeteners to offer rank-and-file members who might not be inclined to support her, including prime office space, positions on plum committees and money for staff members — all valuable currency on Capitol Hill.",The New York Times
2018,"Pelosi, Yemen, Les Moonves: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. House Democrats began to choose their leaders and rules for the next Congress, which begins in January. Representative Nancy Pelosi, above, easily won the Democratic nomination to be speaker of the House — but 32 Democrats voted no. She will need to win over some of those defectors for the final floor vote on Jan. 3, and that could be enough time for a serious challenger to emerge. Ms. Pelosi, 78, who has led House Democrats for more than 15 years, was optimistic. “We go forward with confidence and humility,” she said after the vote. And in a sign of the strength of a new generation of members, Hakeem Jeffries, 48, of New York was chosen to lead the Democratic caucus. _____ 2. “We are seldom free to work with unblemished partners.” That’s Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in a statement released just before a classified briefing he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave to senators. They defended the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia — and urged the senators not to withdraw support from the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate is expected to vote soon on a measure to force the withdrawal of U.S. military efforts in Yemen, except those directly targeting Al Qaeda. Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis have called for a cease-fire. Peace talks between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels are scheduled for early December in Sweden, but the two sides remain far apart. _____ 3. Les Moonves was pushed out as the head of CBS after 12 women accused him of sexual harassment or assault. But those accusations didn’t directly cause Mr. Moonves’s fall, our reporters have learned. He feared that only one woman could bring him down. “If Bobbie talks, I’m finished,” a friend recalled him saying. Our reporters examine how he tried to silence her, why that ultimately led to his downfall — and how those efforts could cost him $120 million in severance. _____ 4. How did a push to legalize pot become a debate about race? New Jersey legislators have linked a proposal to clear hundreds of thousands of past criminal convictions to an effort to legalize recreational marijuana. Defendants would be eligible to have their records cleared if they have had no convictions in 10 years. Supporters say strict drug laws have long unfairly targeted minorities: A black New Jersey resident is three times more likely to be arrested on marijuana-related offenses than a white resident, a recent study found. Above, in Trenton. “There would be no way that I would support legalization of marijuana without expungement,” said the head of the Legislative Black Caucus Foundation. _____ 5. President Trump campaigned on a promise of an industrial comeback. After his election, he told workers in Ohio that the jobs were “all coming back.” So when General Motors announced this week that it was idling five North American plants, it felt to some workers like a betrayal. But at a Chevrolet factory in Lordstown, Ohio, above, that will soon be shuttered, our reporter found a number of workers who blamed G.M. for that unfulfilled promise, not Mr. Trump or his administration’s trade policies. “I believe that no matter tariff or not, G.M. will continue to take our cars out of this country because it’s cheaper to do it and ship it back,” said a Trump supporter. _____ 6. Want to spend your vacation sleeping in a bunker, listening to gunfire and explosions? The War Hostel Sarajevo in the Bosnian capital offers just that experience. The manager, above, a former tour guide, said he realized that many tourists were there to engage with the glorious city’s agonies during Bosnia’s 1992 to 1995 war. “I decided to give people what they wanted,” he said. The hospitality industry calls this “dark tourism” — a niche but growing global market focused on places where terrible things happened. _____ 7. Mystery surrounds the birth of two babies in China. A Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, above, claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. He defended his work at a conference in Hong Kong, saying it was both safe and ethical. But his claims have raised thorny questions. Dr. He revealed his research only after the babies were born this month. And it appears he didn’t seek approval from Chinese regulators. A moderator at the conference asked him, “Why so much secrecy around this?” As genetic technology advances, critics are warning of a slippery slope. The birth of gene-edited children is alarming for practical, ethical and theoretical reasons. First and foremost are safety concerns. Then there is the ethical quandary that editing could be used to create babies with desired skills or physical features — with potentially frightening consequences. _____ 8. Adopt late. Slow down. Our personal tech columnist is moving to the Opinion section at the beginning of the year. In a farewell column, he reflects on changes in the industry and offers tips for navigating the future of technology. The tech industry in 2018 is bigger, more pervasive and far more dangerous than it was when he started in the job only a few years ago, he writes. And our private tech choices matter, because they can alter economies and societies. _____ 9. Do the Oscars still matter? The Academy Awards can frustrate fans and often miss the mark, but that’s why they’re relevant, argues our new Carpetbagger columnist, who will be covering the awards season. Oscar nominations provide a freeze-frame of a year in Hollywood, he writes, telling us about our cultural blind spots and revealing our biases, like a tendency to take male-led stories more seriously. Also important: The attention around them has helped movements like #OscarsSoWhite, TimesUp and #MeToo gain notice. _____ 10. Finally, what should a monument look like? The national debate over removing Confederate statues inspired a New York City nonprofit to ask artists to imagine new monuments. One submission: a poster with the phrase “We are all people” in many languages. Another artist designed a manhole cover, above, shaped like a man’s head and torso — a tribute to Christopher Columbus, not on a pedestal but at a viewer’s feet. The designs will be displayed in five cities in the U.S. and Canada next year, ending on the High Line in Manhattan in October. Have a memorable evening.

2018,Pelosi’s One Potential Rival Cuts Deal and Drops Speaker Challenge,"WASHINGTON — And then there were none. A Democratic insurgency seeking to force Representative Nancy Pelosi to abandon her bid for speaker and install a fresh crop of leaders at the helm of their new majority suffered a setback on Tuesday, when Representative Marcia L. Fudge, the sole lawmaker to flirt openly with a challenge, dropped the idea and endorsed her. Ms. Fudge’s sudden reversal was the result of a swift and relentless bit of deal-cutting by Ms. Pelosi, a legendary negotiator and vote-counter who has insisted that she will have the support to claim the speaker’s gavel despite a rebellion in Democratic ranks. It sent a group of dissidents who released a letter on Monday calling for new leadership back to the drawing board to find a Democrat willing to directly challenge Ms. Pelosi, 78, who has led her party for 15 years, handily dispatching would-be challengers along the way. Ms. Fudge, who is African-American, said she had changed her mind after Ms. Pelosi gave her the opportunity to play a key role in safeguarding voting rights and assured her that black women would “have a seat at the decision-making table” in the new Congress. “My consideration was due in large part to the lack of sustained efforts that ensure diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the House,” Ms. Fudge said in a statement circulated by Ms. Pelosi’s aides. “I am now confident that we will move forward together and that the 117th Congress will be a Congress of which we can all be proud.” Two minutes earlier, Ms. Pelosi released a statement of her own, announcing that she intended to reinstate an elections subcommittee that Republicans eliminated in 2013 and name Ms. Fudge as its chairwoman, handing her “a critical role in our Democratic majority’s efforts to ensure access to the ballot box for all Americans.” Ms. Fudge said that this month’s elections clearly demonstrated the need to strengthen election protections, and the new post would allow her to work to reinstate voting protections struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. “The erosion of voting rights and civil rights was on full display in Georgia, Florida, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas,” said Ms. Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus who previously served as mayor of Warrensville Heights, a predominantly African-American suburb of Cleveland. “Our party should reflect the diversity of our changing nation and guarantee all our citizens the unfettered right to vote and to have every vote count.” Her turnabout came after several days of quiet conversation with Ms. Pelosi, who hosted her for a 45-minute meeting on Friday in her Capitol office suite. Ms. Fudge emerged saying she would decide over the Thanksgiving holiday whether to pursue the speakership, but on Monday, her name was conspicuously absent from the letter calling for new leaders, which she had originally signed. On Tuesday, Ms. Fudge’s prospects appeared to dim when it was revealed that she wrote a letter in 2015 pleading for leniency for Lance Mason, a former state lawmaker and judge in Ohio, after he was convicted of brutally beating his wife in front of their two daughters, and who is now the prime suspect in her killing. But in the end, the issue was moot; Ms. Pelosi had already struck a bargain with Ms. Fudge that removed her from the running for speaker.",The New York Times
2018,Pelosi’s Strategy in Secret Ballot: Allow Her Critics to Let Off Steam,"Going into a closed-door election among Democrats this week, Nancy Pelosi knew she had locked up support from the vast majority of her colleagues to become her party’s nominee for speaker of the House. She was unopposed, after all; the vote was a mere formality. But Ms. Pelosi, a shrewd strategist who is always looking toward her next move (or several), offered Democrats a choice anyway. Her team designed an awkward-looking paper ballot, printed in giant type, that gave Democrats a chance to register their opposition to her by checking a box that said “no.” The unorthodox ballot was a small but illustrative piece of Ms. Pelosi’s strategy for avoiding a divisive floor fight over the speakership that could tarnish Democrats just as they begin their new House majority. It was part of a bid to let some steam out of the pressure cooker of her opposition — a small but vocal group that has insisted she must step aside to usher in an era of change — and continue her laborious push to win over critics before a far more consequential vote to formally elect a speaker when the new Congress convenes in January. The effort plays to the strengths of Ms. Pelosi, a veteran legislator and negotiator who does not shrink from a challenge, and few expect her to fail. But it is not her style to take the result for granted. “Seriously, and very purposely, and doggedly,” were the words Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado used to describe Ms. Pelosi’s approach to winning over her opponents. A day after he ticked the “no” box on his secret ballot, Mr. Perlmutter said on Thursday that he was in active conversations with Ms. Pelosi and was open to supporting her for speaker in January if they were able to reach an agreement. The paper ballot was meant to give lawmakers who opposed Ms. Pelosi, particularly newly elected members who had promised during their campaigns not to back her, a chance to cast a protest vote, and potentially room to change course before the January vote. It was the latest iteration of Ms. Pelosi’s campaign-trail exhortation to Democratic candidates to “just win, baby” — her swaggering way of saying they should do whatever they had to to protect the party’s chances of winning the majority, even if that meant breaking with her personally. The yes-or-no choice also gave Ms. Pelosi, who is renowned for her vote-counting talents, a clear sense of how much work she had ahead to secure the support necessary to regain the speakership. Thirty-two Democrats checked the “no” box in Wednesday’s balloting, while 203 voted for her, a result that was simultaneously a resounding endorsement of Ms. Pelosi’s nomination as speaker and an indication that she would indeed have to change more minds to win. To be elected, her name must be uttered by a majority of representatives present and voting on the House floor on Jan. 3 — as many as 218. That would mean she could afford no more than 16 defections. “The members that voted no, or the three that voted by not voting, expressed themselves in caucus, and now they have a choice between Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, and I think for anybody, no matter what sort of Democrat they are, that’s a pretty easy choice,” said Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, an ally of Ms. Pelosi. He was referring to the fact that Republicans are expected to name the incoming minority leader when the roll call for speaker unfolds, as is traditional for the party in the minority. Ms. Pelosi’s opponents, though, have said they do not intend to vote for Mr. McCarthy or any Republican. Ms. Pelosi has spent much of her time since Election Day systematically chipping away at her opposition, and that is how she spent the hours immediately before and after Wednesday’s vote. She cut deals with a group of centrist lawmakers on changing House rules to allow more consideration for bipartisan bills, and met with critics who had said they would vote against her. Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts — one of 16 signers, along with Mr. Perlmutter, of a letter calling for new leadership — attended two such sessions with Ms. Pelosi on Wednesday, and on Thursday evening said he had secured unspecified “concessions” that made him comfortable supporting her for speaker. “I’m not going to say what we actually agreed upon, but we agreed on a set of values that were in harmony with the things that we care about,” said Mr. Lynch, who mentioned an infrastructure package and pension changes as common priorities. “I’ll leave it at that, because I know she’s still got to sit down and talk to 13, 14 more members to get to 218.” With the caucus vote behind them, Mr. Lynch said, those who oppose Ms. Pelosi have a steeper task to persuade colleagues that blocking her ascent would be worthwhile. “In a way, we’re pushing against human nature, because now that we have the majority, members are energized and hopeful, and they have something to lose here,” Mr. Lynch said. “Many members, including myself, don’t want to mess this up.” After a tense and unproductive meeting on Wednesday with Ms. Pelosi, the three lawmakers who put together the letter opposing her did not appear to have a plan to ensure that they would have the votes to stop her in a floor fight, and were still searching for a candidate willing to directly challenge her. “We’re not meeting with anybody,” said Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Ms. Pelosi in 2016 for the minority leader post and garnered 63 votes, almost twice the number who opposed her on Wednesday. “All we’re saying now is everybody needs to vote their district, vote their conscience, and let the chips fall where they may.” That will not be the approach of Ms. Pelosi, who has been working quietly behind the scenes to court skeptics and opponents by wielding a considerable arsenal of sweeteners, including her ability to dole out committee assignments, to set the legislative agenda to ensure certain policy issues are made priorities, and to select point people for high-profile efforts. She is cognizant of the fact that many newly elected lawmakers feel that they must oppose her as a matter of political survival, given her demonization by critics as a symbol of runaway liberalism. But she has focused intently on cutting deals with incumbents to bring them over to her side. Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, an ally of Ms. Pelosi, said Democrats had been toiling to figure out a way to allow those who felt they must oppose Ms. Pelosi for speaker to satisfy that need without leading to a damaging spectacle at the very moment that Democrats assume control of the House for the first time in eight years. He even floated the idea of scrapping the secret ballot, a tradition in which party caucuses meet behind closed doors to elect their leaders, so that Democrats who had promised to vote against Ms. Pelosi could fulfill their pledge by doing so out loud in front of their colleagues — and then rally to her side during the official vote of the House in January. But Democrats balked at the change. “We’re all trying to avoid a bloody fight on the floor,” Mr. Connolly said. But he added that Ms. Pelosi’s yes-or-no ballot yielded the same general result, allowing Democrats to cast a protest vote, and even take a picture of it to show constituents. “That lets some of the steam out and allows people to feel better about the process,” he said. It was not enough for many critics of Ms. Pelosi who said there was little she could do to win them over. “We’ve still got a month to go, and I think she has a math problem getting to 218,” said Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin, who voted against her on Wednesday and said he would again in January. “I’m not in the game of trade-offs or I need this or that. I don’t play that game at all.” If Ms. Pelosi is interested in “peeling off” the votes she needs, Mr. Kind added, “she’s probably better off burning up the phone lines with other members.” As of Thursday evening, that was just what she was doing.",The New York Times
2018,"Pence Goes to Georgia; Warning Signs for G.O.P., Including Steve King: 5 Days to Go","Welcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters. MARIETTA, Ga. — The chant began well before Oprah Winfrey arrived on Thursday: “And you get a vote! And you get a vote! And you get a vote!” Ms. Winfrey eventually joined in the cheer, with its origins in her days as a talk-show host — but only after she delivered a pointed rebuke to people who might willfully forego the franchise and a stirring evocation of her native South’s racist past. “I’m here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed, who were repressed and who were oppressed for the right of equality at the polls,” Ms. Winfrey said as she visited Georgia on behalf of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor. “Their blood has seeped into my DNA, and I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain.” [Read what happened when Ms. Winfrey dropped by a voter’s home to campaign for Ms. Abrams.] Not to be outdone, Ms. Abrams’s Republican rival, Brian Kemp, barnstormed the state on Thursday with Vice President Mike Pence. “I heard Oprah’s in town today,” Mr. Pence said at one of his three Thursday rallies for Mr. Kemp. “And I heard Will Ferrell was going door-to-door the other day. Well, I’d like to remind Stacey and Oprah and Will Ferrell, I’m kind of a big deal, too.” Mr. Pence, returning to an argument that Republicans have deployed throughout the campaign against Ms. Abrams, added, “I’ve got a message for all of Stacey Abrams’s liberal Hollywood friends: This ain’t Hollywood. This is Georgia.” Although Ms. Winfrey emerged Thursday as a vocal champion for Ms. Abrams and her policies, she focused her most impassioned remarks on voting rights — a message that could reverberate among her still-devoted fans across the country. “For anybody here who has an ancestor who didn’t have the right to vote, and you are choosing not to vote — wherever you are in this state, in this country, you are dishonoring your family,” said Ms. Winfrey, who, like Ms. Abrams, is a black woman who grew up in Mississippi. “You are disrespecting and disregarding their legacy, their suffering and their dreams when you don’t vote.” Indeed, Ms. Winfrey’s two appearances in the Atlanta area were designed to help Ms. Abrams galvanize support — and enthusiasm — among voters she must turn out if she is to win on Tuesday: white women from the suburbs, as well as black women. Together, Ms. Winfrey and Ms. Abrams drew hundreds of them on Thursday. Both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Kemp are hoping to avoid a runoff, but polls show the two effectively tied. A Libertarian candidate is also in the race. Two presidents are still scheduled to campaign in the state: former President Barack Obama is due in Atlanta on Friday, and President Trump will campaign in Macon on Sunday. We’re entering the homestretch, and our just-completed poll in the New Jersey district of Representative Leonard Lance carries ominous news for him — and for other Republicans in high-income districts. Mr. Lance, who is in his fifth term, is winning only 39 percent of the vote against Tom Malinowski, the Democratic challenger. That’s a remarkably low number for an incumbent this late in the campaign. And it’s not difficult to see why Mr. Lance is struggling: A majority of the district disapproves of President Trump and a majority also prefers Democrats to take control of Congress. That’s a familiar, if discomforting, tune for suburban Republicans across the country. • There were other red flags for House Republicans from lesser-known races. The party has poured millions of dollars over a period of months into some of the hardest-fought races in the most competitive districts. But what worries G.O.P. strategists, and delights Democrats, are the races that have not gotten so much money and attention. And a pair of polls, one public and one private, came out this week in two such districts. A Republican group received a survey from Illinois showing that Representative Randy Hultgren, the incumbent, was tied with his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, in an exurban Chicago district that Mr. Trump carried by 4 points in 2016. Even more alarming for Republicans, a survey commissioned by a Pennsylvania ABC affiliate found that Representative Mike Kelly narrowly trailed his Democratic opponent, Ron DiNicola, in an Erie-area seat that is heavily pro-Trump. Both incumbents may survive, but these sorts of numbers this late in the campaign are the political equivalent of flashing red warning lights for the G.O.P. • At the outset of this election, few in either party thought Representative Steve King of Iowa was in any political peril. But as Mr. King continues to echo themes of white nationalism and offer support for extremist figures abroad, he is drawing the sort of unwanted attention that may create difficulties in his re-election. The New York Times, which is polling dozens of House and Senate districts in partnership with Siena College, is going to survey his heavily conservative western Iowa district to see if his provocations, which have drawn rebukes from national Republican leaders, are catching up with him at home. Stay tuned. The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. President Trump is getting ahead of a possible midterm loss with an unsubtle message to fellow Republicans: It wasn’t me. A day after Paul Ryan, the lame-duck House Speaker, gently questioned the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s proposed executive order banning birthright citizenship, the president did what he often does when he feels challenged. He escalated hostilities. By a lot. “Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!” Mr. Trump tweeted. He suggested that a “new” Republican majority — after Mr. Ryan is gone — would solve immigration issues. Mr. Trump enjoys little more than brushing back establishment figures in both parties. But the primary intent of Mr. Trump’s tweet was not complicated: He is already pointing fingers at fellow Republicans for potential losses in the House next week. Similar flare-ups were common in 2016, when the presidential election looked lost, betraying perhaps Mr. Trump’s foremost political creed: The buck stops … somewhere over there, far away. When last we checked in with Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, he had thrown his support behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the political upstart who dethroned him in the Democratic primary in June. He pledged to do what he could to flip the House. But Mr. Crowley remains on the ballot on two third-party lines, including the Working Families Party, and could still affect Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s race on Election Day. There is a new flier circulating online that urges voters to support Mr. Crowley, calling him the “best qualified candidate” and explaining that, because of low turnout in the primary, he “came up a little short.” The source of the flier is not known, but Mr. Crowley’s office has disavowed any connection. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign also says it does not suspect his hand in it. There have been similar entreaties: In July, the former Senator Joe Lieberman wrote an Op-Ed in The Wall Street Journal that urged voters to support Mr. Crowley in the general election; Ruben Diaz Sr., a New York City councilman who represents the South Bronx, did the same in The Bronx Chronicle in September. On Wednesday, Mr. Crowley responded to the mysterious flier. “Not running. Not campaigning,” he posted on Twitter. “Shut down campaign operations months ago. Not circulating fliers.” He added: “To whoever is: knock it off. Focus should be on electing Democrats to Republican seats. I’ve moved on, so should everyone else.” For all the dismissals about a shadow campaign for his House seat, Mr. Crowley has evidently not forsaken a future in politics. “Joe for NY” is the name of his new state campaign committee, which hosted a fund-raiser on Monday in Manhattan. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has won two Senate elections without clearing 50 percent of the vote. One big reason: A Libertarian on the ballot has presumably hurt the Republican more than Mr. Tester, a Democrat. In both of his runs, Mr. Tester’s margin of victory has been smaller than the vote total for the third-party candidate. But on Wednesday, Mr. Tester faced a complication: The Libertarian candidate this year, Rick Breckenridge, endorsed Matt Rosendale, the Republican nominee and state auditor. The effects of this aren’t entirely clear — early voting is well underway, and Mr. Breckenridge remains on the ballot. But make no mistake: It’s good news for Mr. Rosendale, whose campaign — once considered a serious long shot — has piqued top-level Republican interest in recent weeks in a state Mr. Trump carried by 20 points.

2018,Pennsylvania Democrats Pick Up Victories 2 Years After Trump Wins State,"DOYLESTOWN, Pa. — Pennsylvania voters, who went for President Trump two years ago, swerved in the other direction Tuesday, handing Democrats key victories and swelling the party’s share of the state’s House delegation. Democratic women crashed the all-male congressional delegation, winning four House seats in the Philadelphia suburbs, according to The Associated Press. Three of the Democratic candidates — Mary Gay Scanlon, a lawyer; Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran; and Susan Wild, a former solicitor in Allentown, Pa. — flipped seats previously held by Republicans, an achievement aided by a new map of House districts drawn this year to eliminate a Republican gerrymander. Additionally, Madeleine Dean, a state representative, won a seat vacated by a Democratic man. In western Pennsylvania, a fifth Democrat, Representative Conor Lamb, who faced an incumbent Republican representative in a new district, also won his race. Democrats netted three flipped seats, because Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican running in Mr. Lamb’s vacated district, also won his race. [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis.] Democrats were all but preordained to net the two suburban Republican seats won by Ms. Scanlon and Ms. Houlahan because of the redistricting. Ms. Wild’s victory in the Seventh District, which includes the Lehigh Valley, was a bit of icing on the cake, as the state contributed to Democrats’ new House majority. Still, the party went into Election Day hoping for an even broader advance, a gain of up to six seats, riding the wave of anger at Mr. Trump among the diverse, college-educated voters of the Philadelphia suburbs — especially women. Republican incumbents held off strong challenges in three close races from Erie County in the northwest to Bucks County in the southeast. Representatives Mike Kelly, Scott Perry and Brian Fitzpatrick were all returned to the House. Mr. Fitzpatrick won a second term in his Bucks County-centered seat, the lone Republican win in the Philadelphia region. “I lost some really good friends tonight,” Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of a vanishing breed of Republican moderates, told supporters, referring to the party’s loss of the House. “We had a rough night tonight nationally.” As widely expected, Democrats’ top two elected officials in the state, Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey Jr., cruised to re-election. Republican strategists had openly worried that their statewide candidates’ failure to appeal to moderates — Representative Lou Barletta, running for Senate, and Scott Wagner, the nominee for governor — would be a hurdle for many Republican voters and hurt the party’s down-ballot candidates. Mr. Wagner, a wealthy businessman and state senator from York County, was a divisive figure who modeled himself after Mr. Trump. At one point he posted a Facebook video threatening to stomp into Mr. Wolf’s face with golf spikes. Mr. Wolf, a liberal, has raised state spending on education and expanded Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act, though he lost a battle with Republican majorities in the General Assembly to impose a severance tax on natural gas. Mr. Casey’s opponent, Mr. Barletta, built his career on opposition to illegal immigration. But throughout his campaign he struggled to benefit from the issue in a state Mr. Trump won in 2016, even as the president’s final election message focused on an “invasion” by a migrant caravan, rhetoric designed to turn out the Republican base. In purple Pennsylvania, those voters are more or less balanced out by suburban Republicans, who find the president’s harsh nativism repugnant. Here as elsewhere, Republican suburban women were more inclined to vote their values than their stock portfolios. Mr. Trump, who spent the final weeks campaigning nonstop in red states where Democratic senators were vulnerable, including multiple visits to Florida, Indiana and Missouri, last came to Pennsylvania on Oct. 10 to stump for Mr. Barletta in Erie. West of Pittsburgh, Mr. Lamb, who became one of the Democrats’ national darlings after winning a heavily pro-Trump district in a special election in March, defeated Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican. The House race considered the closest in the state was Mr. Fitpatrick’s, as he fought to portray himself as independent of the national party. He won endorsements from organized labor and gun control groups and was the beneficiary of around $7 million in outside spending by national Republican committees. His Democratic opponent, Scott Wallace, a liberal philanthropist, told supporters the midterms were about “that crazy guy down there” in the White House. At a high school in Warrington in Bucks County, it was clear that the backing of the liberal groups had boosted Mr. Fitzpatrick. Lindsay Edling, a 22-year-old waitress voting for the first time, said she generally prefers Democrats, but voted for Mr. Fitzpatrick because he had the support of two gun control groups. “Just all the shootings going on, it’s really been concerning,” she said. And Susan Novick, 52, a special-education teacher, said she had voted for Mr. Fitzpatrick because his name was on the list given by the Pennsylvania State Education Association. But it was also clear that Mr. Trump’s aggressively divisive campaign motivated some Republican and independent voters to cast a ballot for Mr. Wallace to send a message. “Don’t even ask me about Trump,” sneered Dorothy Brodsky, 73, a Republican who voted for Mr. Wallace. “I have 18 grandchildren. I’m very concerned about their future.” Barbara Krumins, who runs a construction business with her husband and is registered as an independent, said the congressional race was “100 percent” a referendum on the president. “Just everything about him has been total anxiety and anguish,” she said. “Everything that comes out of his mouth is just crap. It’s just insane. It’s not the views I was bought up on.” She voted for Mr. Wallace. The biggest factor in congressional elections in the state, unquestionably, was redistricting. In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the map of Republican-drawn districts used in the previous three House elections. The court, with a majority of Democratic justices, ruled the map had “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s Constitution. The new court-approved map was more faithful to the nearly equal balance of voters between the parties. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans five to four in Pennsylvania, but in the last three congressional elections under the old maps, Republicans won 13 of 18 House districts. After Tuesday, the delegation is split 9 to 9, reflective of Pennsylvania’s continuing role as a battleground state going into the 2020 presidential election.",The New York Times
2018,Pennsylvania Flipped to Trump in 2016. Will It Flip Back in the Midterms?,"MIDDLETOWN, Pa. — Sandy Sinkovich, a retired X-ray technician, was a registered Republican until she switched parties during the Obama years. She plans to vote a straight Democratic ticket in the midterms. President Trump, she said, has “done nothing but destroy our country.” Dave Sweeney, who services juice machines, registered as a Republican in 2016 after years of being a Democrat so he could vote for Mr. Trump in the primary. He is concerned about the migrant caravan and plans to vote party-line Republican. “No, I’m not racist if I think you should work for welfare, you should work for food stamps,” Mr. Sweeney said. Few states have reflected the changing political allegiances of the Trump era more than Pennsylvania, which was the most populous of the trifecta of Rust Belt states that Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Along the way, Republicans claimed 13 of Pennsylvania’s 18 House seats. Now, two years later, the wheel is turning again. Because of weak Republican candidates at the top of the state ticket and redrawn congressional districts, Democrats are positioned for gains — maybe big ones — in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, including three or more women who could crash the state’s all-male House delegation. The shooting of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday divided Pennsylvanians, as it did Americans, on whether President Trump’s fiery anti-immigration rhetoric may have fed into the violence. But in an election season when partisan attitudes were already well set, it is unclear whether the shooting would affect many votes. Congressional races around Pittsburgh are more settled than tossup districts elsewhere. “I think this is not primarily a political issue, and I don’t think voters are thinking about it as a political issue,” said Mark Harris a Republican strategist based in Pittsburgh. “I know everyone is as outraged about what’s happened; it doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat.” Looming just over the horizon: Democratic hopes that this year provides a reset, and Pennsylvania returns in 2020 to its alignment as a dependable blue state in presidential politics. That prize is still a ways off, and by no means assured. Of more immediate concern is an array of highly competitive House districts that, on Election Day, could serve as a harbinger on the battle for control of the House nationally. Democrats are expected to pick up at least two Pennsylvania House seats — and, in a blowout, as many as six — which would advance the party toward the 23 pickups it needs for a congressional majority. Republican troubles begin with a failure to nominate candidates for governor and Senate with broad appeal to moderate voters. The incumbent Democrats, Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey Jr., have led in polls by double digits since the spring. Their opponents — Lou Barletta, a conservative congressman challenging Mr. Casey, and Scott Wagner, a state senator running against Mr. Wolf — are divisive figures. Mr. Wagner, who once said if the state laid off 10 percent of its teachers they would not be missed, recorded a video boasting he would grind his golf spikes into Mr. Wolf’s face. Both challengers have failed to raise much money or become competitive enough to attract outside spending. Republican Party leaders in Pennsylvania openly worry that their lackluster statewide candidates will depress turnout, with significant fallout for congressional races, and perhaps the size of Republican majorities in the General Assembly in Harrisburg. “There’s a lot of collateral damage that could come out of having a very weak top of the ticket,” Mr. Harris, the Republican strategist said. The biggest blow, however, came when the Democratic-majority State Supreme Court threw out a Republican-gerrymandered map of congressional districts early this year. The new map drawn by the court more closely reflects the state’s partisan equilibrium. Democrats are widely expected to flip two seats previously held by Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Both candidates are women: Mary Gay Scanlon, a lawyer, running in the Fifth District, and Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, competing in the Sixth District. In addition, Madeleine Dean, a state representative, is the Democratic nominee in the newly drawn Fourth District, also suburban and an open seat. Much of it was previously represented by a Democrat. “The Fourth, Fifth and Sixth are going Democratic, end of quote,” said G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist who conducts the Franklin & Marshall Poll of Pennsylvania. Another potential Democratic pickup, — and a possible fourth woman the state could send to Congress — is the Seventh District, in the Lehigh Valley. There, Susan Wild, a former Allentown city official, is doing well in polls against Marty Nothstein, a former Olympic cyclist. Republicans are not without prospects of their own. Another race in the Philadelphia suburbs matches the freshman Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican and former F.B.I. agent, against Scott Wallace, a wealthy philanthropist. The district is centered on Bucks County, a swing region that both Hillary Clinton and Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, carried in 2016. Mr. Fitzpatrick has won the backing of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and gun-control groups. His campaign signs boast he is “Ranked #1 Most Independent Freshman Congressman.” But the congressional race stirring the most interest in the last days is in the 10th Congressional District in south-central Pennsylvania, where Representative Scott Perry, a conservative Republican, has suddenly found himself in choppy waters. Mr. Perry is a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House. He was redrawn from a district Mr. Trump won by 21 points into one the president carried by nine, and has done little to appeal to independent voters. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll showed him with a two-point edge over his challenger, George Scott, a Lutheran minister. “It’s much closer than anyone thought it would be and much closer than it should be,” said Charlie Gerow, a Republican strategist who lives in the district. Here, as elsewhere, many voters see the ballot as a referendum on Mr. Trump. Jessica Kolaric, 46, who works with dementia patients, said that she did not know much about either congressional candidate but that she planned to vote for Mr. Scott, the Democrat. “Someone needs to hold Trump accountable and put him in check,” she said. Mr. Trump’s 44,000-vote victory in Pennsylvania, like elsewhere in the Rust Belt, was the result of an unforeseen surge of blue-collar voters, who swamped the votes of college-educated voters in suburbia. In March, the upset victory by a centrist Democrat, Conor Lamb, in a special election in a House district Mr. Trump had carried by 19 points set off a wave of punditry that “Trump Democrats” were returning to their ancestral party. The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. On closer analysis, Mr. Lamb’s win was largely because he galvanized suburban voters outside Pittsburgh. Mr. Lamb has been redistricted into a seat where he now faces a Republican incumbent, Keith Rothfus. In September, the National Republican Congressional Committee canceled its advertising in support of Mr. Rothfus, a sign the national party believes his chances are slim. But it is too early to write the obituary of the Trump Democrats of western Pennsylvania, particularly in terms of 2020. An important bellwether is Erie County in northwest Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump won in 2016 after decades of Democratic dominance. Ryan A. Bizzarro, a Democratic state representative from Erie County, was shocked two years ago by how many of the Democratic households whose doors he knocked on favored Mr. Trump. Mr. Bizzarro revisited many of the same houses this year. “I’m seeing many of the same Democratic voters who I spoke to in 2016, and who voted for President Trump, come back into the fold,” he said. If a Democratic wave turns into more of a tsunami, the incumbent Republican congressman who represents Erie, Mike Kelly, could also be in trouble. Still, even that scenario would not spell doom for Mr. Trump’s prospects in Pennsylvania in 2020. Mr. Madonna, the pollster, has a factoid he likes to drop into talks he gives around the state. “There are three recent presidents who had a horrible first midterm,” Mr. Madonna tells audiences. “Reagan, Clinton and Obama. All three of them won re-election handily.”",The New York Times
2018,"People, Places and Things to Know: A Quintana Roo Hotel, the New Bucket Bag and More","People, Places and Things T’s cultural compendium of what’s new. Quintana Roo, the Mexican state on the Caribbean side of the Yucatán Peninsula, has been a major destination since the 1970s, when the first resorts started appearing along its sandy coastline. Since then, travelers in search of a pristine, not-too-developed piece of it have moved from Cancún to Playa del Carmen to Tulum, which, with its winter yoga retreats and beachside bars, remains the bohemian favorite. It also has some much-lauded restaurants and small hotels, including two new and noteworthy properties: Habitas Tulum has a glass-walled Moorish restaurant and 32 canvas structures outfitted with kilim rugs, midcentury-style furnishings and decorative macramé. A ways inland, in the heart of town, lies the 16-room Casa Pueblo Tulum, set in a Modernist concrete building whose décor — unpolished wooden doors, handcrafted ceramics — nods to the Japanese art of wabi-sabi. The region’s latest exciting spot, though, isn’t in Tulum at all but some 50 miles north — past the Mayan ruins of Xel-Há and Playa del Carmen, in the area known as Punta Maroma. Here, on an especially lush stretch of jungle that juts out into the sea, you’ll find Chablé Maroma, which promises to draw the next wave of pioneers looking to escape the scene. It’s the second location for the Chablé brand, whose first resort opened just outside Mérida in 2016. Like that property, this one prioritizes privacy — each of the 70 palapa-roofed casitas has its own pool and terrace — and the beauty of the natural surroundings. The architect Javier Fernandez placed the casitas throughout the 11-acre site around the existing mangroves. The floors are made of parota wood, and local Yucatán limestone was used for the facades, while artisans in the Yucatán city of Valladolid embroidered the silk and linen pillows inside. The rooms also come with outdoor showers, from which you can watch spider monkeys swinging through the canopy overhead. The sense that one is entirely surrounded by nature carries over to the white sand beach. Because there are no neighboring resorts competing for access, guests can take nearly private swims and snorkel runs through the clear water of the cenotes (underwater caves). Then there’s the main restaurant, Bu’ul, which will entice the same sort of crowd who last year flocked to Tulum’s pop-up of Noma, René Redzepi’s food mecca in Copenhagen. Helmed by Jorge Vallejo, who trained at Noma and runs the esteemed Mexico City restaurant Quintonil, it serves a menu of contemporary Mexican cuisine built around fresh seafood and local produce (avocados, chiles, guava): Diners might choose between grilled octopus with sweet potato purée or boquinete roasted tikin-xic style, for which the fish is marinated with achiote sauce and sour oranges and then wrapped in banana leaves, before finishing the evening with a pot of baked Oaxacan chocolate. — JOHN WOGAN Riccardo Tisci, the newly appointed chief creative officer of Burberry, was just 2 years old and living in the south of Italy when the Sex Pistols signed to A&M Records outside Buckingham Palace in 1977. Yet he’d come to identify with the punk movement all the same: As a student at London’s Central Saint Martins, Tisci studied the groundbreaking designs of Vivienne Westwood, who, along with her former partner Malcolm McLaren, the Sex Pistols’ manager, helped birth the punk aesthetic in the early ’70s. At Givenchy, Tisci occasionally channeled Westwood’s spirit by offsetting the romantic mood of his work with chains and studs, and he even helped the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Andrew Bolton research Westwood’s archive for the Costume Institute’s 2013 “Punk” exhibition. Now, he’s honoring the British designer — and his adopted city — with a soon-to-be-released 16-piece collaborative collection. It consists of iconic Westwood shapes, from her towering lace-up heeled brogues to a cinched-waist wool blazer with Teddy Boy lapels, all remade in Burberry’s signature check, which, in this context, morphs into an instantly edgier plaid. “It was like working with family,” Tisci says of conferring with Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler, her husband and creative partner, on the looks, proceeds from which will benefit the environmental nonprofit Cool Earth. “Clashing the two houses — it feels so natural and sort of new-punk.” — ALICE NEWELL-HANSON Once reserved for the road, pearlescent hues brighten up the home.

The first such timepiece was designed by Ferdinand Alexander Porsche of the German car family, who, after creating the legendary model 911, began making consumer goods, including the ebony-cased 1972 Chronograph 1, an immediate sensation. Now, Louis Vuitton has harnessed that same debonair spirit but has added a 21st-century twist: Its new 46-millimeter Tambour All Black and Gold Chronograph is a marvel of embellished minimalism, with a steel case coated in an ultradurable high-tech PVD that makes the timepiece virtually scratch-proof. Heightened by touches of 18-karat pink gold and an obsidian alligator strap, the chronograph’s stopwatch capability may be the least of its attributes: With one flash of this on your wrist, traffic itself may well come to a standstill. $12,295, louisvuitton.com. — NANCY HASS Abstract forms with a highly practical purpose — and almost too good to cover with a pot.

2018,"People, Places and Things to Know: Japanese Glass Artists, a Food-Focused Hotel and More","People, Places and Things T’s cultural compendium of what’s new. Glass melts above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point it resembles sun-bright lava with a taffylike pull — and often necessitates that its handlers work with a partner, lest one of them get scorched. Fourteen years ago, at Tama Art University in Tokyo, Baku Takahashi and Tomoko Wada paired up in an introductory glass blowing class; they’re still working together today, driven by a shared belief, as Wada wrote in an email, “that glass itself, with its transparency and color, is alluring, so we treat it with importance.” Now 32 and married, they’re considered two of the most exciting glass artists in Japan. After graduating and assisting artisans for a few years, Takahashi and Wada rejected Tokyo’s thriving maker scene for Takahashi’s hometown in Fukuoka Prefecture on the country’s southernmost main island, which is home to rocky beaches and citrus-fruit forests whose mandarin-orange hues are reflected in his work. Here, out of a 1,100-square-foot studio, the duo makes sculptures, wall hangings, pendants and small objects that are distinct to each artist but alike in their focus on what Wada calls “spatiality.” For more than a decade, she’s been iterating upon her “Apartment” series, for which she fills and stacks glass boxes of various sizes with glinting balls of rainbow-hued glass, dried flowers or lengths of organdy, as if rearranging the rooms of an abstract dollhouse. But the specific contents are not really the point: Within these realms, it’s “the empty space that is most distinctive,” she says. It’s fitting, then, that her partner aims to fill the void: Takahashi often produces the fragile flotsam that Wada places inside the cubes. In his own practice, he’s similarly focused on claiming space, sculpting forms he hopes the world hasn’t seen before, even if they are loosely born of a childhood spent reading anime and playing video games. Takahashi melts, cools, fuses and polishes glass shapes in cartoonish shades (royal purple, aquamarine) to create crayon-box-size statues that resemble, say, an Olympic torch from the year 2080 or a religious totem from a dreamed-up pacifist cult. As obsessed as Wada and Takahashi are with space, though, their artistic motivation ultimately lies with their chosen material. In Japan, artisans have blown glass for centuries, though many modern techniques were introduced by the Portuguese and the Dutch starting in the 16th century. In the last century, glass blowing has often been seen more as craft than art, perhaps because the process of shaping the material was historically “used for the manufacturing of products,” Takahashi says. “We look to fuse old-fashioned values with new ideas.” Which is not to say that the duo is interested in crafting rarefied works; instead — as with the democratization of crafts such as indigo dying and paper making throughout Japan — they’re trying to convince a new generation that glass blowing, too, merits innovation. Takahashi’s figurines were first shown a couple years ago at Playmountain, a design boutique in Harajuku; last spring, he exhibited works at a gallery inside Beams, a men’s wear store, just before Wada took her turn showing at Playmountain. In 2016, the artists launched a collaborative project called Toumei (“transparency” in English) that comprises vases, light fixtures, earrings and drinking glasses in bulbous shapes and muted tones. Sold online, these objects speak to her love of emptiness, his love of form — and their experience living together amid all their glassware. “We felt the need to create pieces that could be used,” Wada says. “It’s necessary for all creations — including artwork — to be considered from various viewpoints.” — KURT SOLLER From left: Paul Morelli necklace, $25,000, paulmorelli.com.

Jin Kay, Dylan Cao and Huy Luong all have distinct childhood memories of their mothers on their way to work. Kay, who grew up in 1990s South Korea, can still see the silk blouses and pencil skirts his mother, a doctor, would wear under her lab coat. Cao and Luong, meanwhile, spent their early years in Vietnam, where it was common to see women’s skirts hiked up during their daily commute on motorbike. Over a decade later, these images inspired the trio to launch Commission, their own line of women’s wear, out of a small Manhattan studio. “It’s a tongue-in-cheek reinvention of our parents’ clothes, which were themselves interpretations of Western style codes, so it’s all full circle,” says Cao, who designs along with Kay, while Luong focuses on branding. Between them, the men have done stints at Gucci, Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim and Michael Kors, but they were eager to build something that felt personal. And though the clothes are indeed a shout-out to cool Asian girls, the founders made a conscious decision to eschew aesthetic stereotypes: Instead, the line consists of ’80s-leaning tailored separates set apart by subtle detailing — a gauzy floral dress with a center slit (pictured above right), a pale blue button-up with a cinched waist meant to create a tucked-in look. Some pieces riff on the idea of a busy woman balancing work and home, as with a two-button suit jacket with a strap sewn onto the shoulder, from which hangs not a purse but a punkish chain, making the piece just as suitable for the office as for a motorcycle-powered escape. — AHNNA LEE England has long had an abundance of five-star, shades-of-stone country hotels, but apart from a few notable exceptions — Angela Hartnett’s Lime Wood, Raymond Blanc’s Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons — food has rarely been the main draw. “You’d go for the scenic walks or the spa,” says the award-winning chef Skye Gyngell, who’s hoping to make another exception of Heckfield Place, a new 45-bedroom hotel in a Georgian estate in Hampshire, a one-hour drive southwest from London. Most of the produce used at the property’s two restaurants — the lively Marle and the more intimate Hearth, which is reserved for hotel guests — is grown on its own 438-acre grounds, which include a farm (set to be biodynamic-certified by 2021), walled gardens and an orchard of pear, apple, quince and plum trees. Gyngell, best known as the executive chef of the lauded London restaurant Spring, takes a minimalist approach to cooking: “I always ask myself, ‘What can I leave out of this? What doesn’t it need?’” she says. A recent meal at Marle included a rainbow of raw radishes, beets and carrots served with celery yogurt; beef fillet with golden girolles and a sweet-marjoram-accented sauce; and — the chef’s favorite — a bright mulberry, honey and custard tart. Hearth, meanwhile, named for its limestone fireplace, serves a prix fixe menu that changes daily. Both restaurants, along with the rest of the hotel interiors, were designed by the Ilse Crawford alum Ben Thompson, who opted for green-veined marble tables, midcentury oak chairs and, instead of table vases, decorative gourds. heckfieldplace.com — KATE MAXWELL Postmodernism, the cheeky 1980s design and architecture movement that arose as a reaction to minimalism, may now be reviled in certain quarters, but it left behind some fine ideas. Here, the floridly decorative neo-Classical Tinkertoy aesthetic of Robert Venturi and the Memphis Group gives way to a more elemental and elegant form, as reimagined by Syrette Lew of the Brooklyn-based studio Moving Mountains. This low table, assembled from kindergarten-basic shapes in cornflower blue and pale carrot-colored concrete and joined with pinkish bronze, may seem at first glance precarious — why does the cylinder not just roll away and the whole thing collapse? — but it is a meticulous feat of engineering and restraint in a vivid yet understated palette: an eloquent symbol of how the past can gracefully morph into the future. Price on request, mvngmtns.com. — NANCY HASS Coco Chanel was 18 when she first saw a Coromandel screen in an antiques shop. Such inlaid ebony-lacquer folding panels — made during China’s Kangxi period at the end of the 17th century and later named for the trading ports along the Indian coast from which they were often sent to Europe — became a lifelong obsession. By the time she died, she’d come to own more than 30 pieces (they still line the walls of her preserved Paris apartment at 31 rue Cambon), which were fashioned by incising scenes of the royal court and the natural world into the hand-rubbed finish with a technique called kuan cai; artisans then added bits of gold, jade and mother-of-pearl. This brooch, with birds and leaves crafted from garnets, diamonds, coral and red-orange spinels, evokes these screens, with an additional twinkling tribute to the iconic 20th-century designer: Tucked into the tableau is Chanel’s signature flower, the camellia.

2018,Peter Thiel Is a Man on an Island,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ How often does a tweet, a policy action or a statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel, a vocal supporter, in disbelief? “It doesn’t happen very often,” he said. By many classic measures, Mr. Thiel has impeccable Silicon Valley credentials: a co-founder of PayPal, a Facebook board member since 2005, a partner at the venture capital firm Founders Fund, a sponsor of an ocean cleanup project and a Bitcoin investor. But in many ways, he is a man on an island — and not just because he has New Zealand citizenship. His frequent defense of Mr. Trump — a stance that Reed Hastings of Netflix referred to as “catastrophically bad judgment” — has set him apart from much of the tech industry. At the DealBook conference on Thursday, he acknowledged that the current political environment was “not healthy” but said that the country had been “polarized since the late ’60s” and that Mr. Trump was “not the main cause.” Mr. Thiel did allow that the conspiracy theories, misinformation and hateful language that have proved difficult to tamp out at Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, were “certainly worrisome.” “It’s a complicated thing to get right,” he said. And the president’s many unsupported, exaggerated or misleading comments about trade, immigration and even his own popularity? “I tend to think that the inaccuracies President Trump tells are basically exaggerations of the truth,” Mr. Thiel said. He also addressed his move to Los Angeles this year, saying Silicon Valley now “feels like a one-party state” marked by “the madness of crowds.”",The New York Times
2018,"Peugeot Returns to U.S. to Help People Get Around, but Not With Its Cars","PARIS — Nearly three decades ago, Peugeot abandoned the United States market, stung by years of dwindling sales that were punctuated by a dispiriting 4,291 cars sold in 1990. Two years ago, Peugeot’s parent, the big European carmaker PSA Group, announced its return to the cutthroat North American market. The move stunned some industry observers and amused several others with long memories. Last month in Washington, the company finally unfurled its opening gambit, and it’s not a car, exactly. PSA is thinking smaller, rolling out an app, but also bigger: This is about the future of the car market as well as the company. PSA’s North American plan starts with the new app, Free2Move, which offers users in Washington, D.C., the ability to book any kind of ride. The app includes services to rent cars, electric scooters and bicycles, as well as ride-sharing services — with no separate charges for parking, gas or insurance. Other United States markets are expected to follow. The move is at once unconventional and yet fundamentally cautious for PSA, Europe’s longtime No. 2 carmaker after Volkswagen and the owner of the Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands. The company is aiming to become a total mobility provider, its chief executive of four years, Carlos Tavares, said in an interview last month at the Paris Auto Show. “We believe that human beings are eager to protect their spontaneous freedom of movement,” Mr. Tavares said. “You need to have an available mobility tool that is going to fulfill this need for freedom to move anywhere, anytime, when you decide to do so.” Signing up for Free2Move costs $10, and it can be used to book with scooter and bike services like Bird, Capital Bikeshare, Jump, Lime, Skip and Spin; the car-sharing service Car2Go as well as Free2Move’s own branded option; and Uber, the ride-hailing service. All billing is centralized via the Free2Move account. The app, Mr. Tavares said, which got its start in Europe early last year, is a central element of PSA’s international business. PSA, once widely believed to be deeply troubled, has bounced back to profitability and growth under Mr. Tavares. One year ago, PSA acquired General Motors’ Opel (Germany) and Vauxhall (Britain) divisions, which are already making a profit that eluded G.M. for decades. With Free2Move, the company is placing a bet on deep changes to the car business in the decades ahead, as electrification, autonomy and car-sharing remake a capital-intensive industry known for being set in its ways. Significantly, none of the 600 cars that Free2Move will maintain in the Washington test are PSA models. For now, app users choose between Cruze subcompacts and Equinox crossovers, both Chevrolets, while the Car2Go service found via the app offers Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars. According to Mr. Tavares, at later stages in the company’s 10-year plan, Free2Move will include PSA’s own cars. Eventually, PSA will sell its cars in North America, under a brand that is expected to be announced this year. North American assembly is not out of the question, he said. For now, said Mark Rechtin, editor of Motor Trend, using “other manufacturers’ cars is a low-cost market research tool to buy time and determine what vehicles and features will work best here.” He added that this could be a way for PSA to sell off-the-rack “vehicles as a fleet to a company like Waymo or Uber — and not have to worry about selling to picky car shoppers and having a retail and service network.” Any return to the North American market is noteworthy because it remains a diverse and expansive place, with great distances, unique sets of regulation and a hugely competitive environment. A combination of incentive spending and advertising costs has kept fledgling brands out of the market, while several established brands have fallen away of late. Meanwhile, the stock market has shown mounting disdain for the major players’ prospects and shares, even in recent years of great sales and profit, as shareholders bridle at the thought of legacy costs, inefficient dealer networks and an uncertain regulatory future. Added to the list of worries lately are risks from a trade war and tariffs. More significant still from a carmaker’s perspective may be the unknown chaos that car-sharing, autonomous driving and the switch to electric cars are likely to inject into the market and their own futures. From its current position of relative good health, PSA is better placed than it had been to consider these pressures, and take its shot on the future. Yet, to the greatest extent possible, a company entering a major market would like to control its own narrative for as long as possible. With its new strategy, PSA aims to stake itself not just weeks or months to fail or succeed, but years. “Because we don’t want to rush,” Mr. Tavares explained. “We want to start by making sure that our teams understand the U.S. consumer. I worked a few years in the U.S. in my former life.” (He was No. 2 at Nissan under the chief executive Carlos Ghosn, with whom he had a spectacular falling-out after admitting in an interview with Bloomberg that he wouldn’t mind taking on the challenge of reviving G.M., which was soon to be leaderless.) Mr. Tavares continued: “I know that the customer expectations are very specific and the way you handle those expectations is very specific. So we decided that we would start by understanding the U.S. consumer through the mobility services activities that we are now implementing. It is a good way to understand the market.” Larry Dominique, head of PSA’s start-up operation for North America, based in Atlanta, is charged with helping to develop and enact the strategy. He said he was certain that baby steps were the right way to go. “The biggest mistake most companies make is overinvestment, and then the moment there’s an initial downturn, their fixed costs are way beyond their revenue and they’re in deep, deep trouble,” Mr. Dominique said. “We want to avoid that. And how do you avoid that? By planning well and making sure you understand very, very well the trends, the consumers, the behaviors, their wants and desires.” He continued: “How is mobility as a service saving car-ownership patterns? What are we seeing geographically? How are alternative powertrains manifesting themselves in North America versus other parts of the world?” Like a growing number of carmakers, PSA — with the founding Peugeot family, the Chinese carmaker Dongfeng and the French government each holding 14 percent of its shares — is proactively responding to the new markets. A PSA news release announcing the Washington test program said: “In the U.S. alone there are almost 260 million vehicles, 320 million people and over 17 million new cars sold each year. Car manufacturing is not going away. However, just as Amazon and Uber have changed behavior, we believe PSA must also learn and participate in this emerging business.” Rebecca Lindland, an industry marketing analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said the desire to read the market closely and forestall investment was understandable. “The market is contracting, and the industry is changing so much,” she said. “I wouldn’t invest in a new dealership network and add rooftops at this time, especially since the euro is uncertain and Brexit hasn’t kicked in yet.” Fortunately for PSA, the Peugeot, Citroen and Opel brands are long since clear from any obligation they had to any American dealers. “Just to be very clear,” Mr. Dominique emphasized, “we have no legacy in North America. I have no dealer networks, I have no dealer contracts, I have no service contracts, I have no I.T. contracts. I literally have a green-field opportunity in North America.” He added: “Trust me, I’ve had lots of calls from my friends and other O.E.M.s saying, ‘Larry, you have an opportunity that we can only dream of.’ They can’t tear down what they’ve already got.”",The New York Times
2018,Phil Mickelson Wins Duel With Tiger Woods as Pay-Per-View Coverage Sputters,"It took 22 holes for Phil Mickelson to defeat Tiger Woods in their $9 million, winner-take-all golf duel on Friday in North Las Vegas, Nev. The four extra holes forced the pair to finish after nightfall and under the lights at Shadow Creek Golf Course, but the most dramatic development of this exhibition match might have been the faltering of its pay-per-view coverage. The match, believed to be golf’s first pay-per-view venture, was supposed to cost $19.99 to watch, but a lot of people got to see it free because of a glitch at one of the outlets. (The gallery at Shadow Creek was limited to invited guests.) B/R Live — the sports streaming platform for Turner Sports, which produced the duel between Woods and Mickelson — had technical difficulties at the point of purchase, a Turner spokesman said. There were numerous online complaints from customers who had paid to see the match but could not gain access to the stream, and so B/R Live removed the payment requirement and provided the match on an open platform, at no charge. “We experienced some technical issues on B/R Live that temporarily impacted user access to The Match,” Nate Smeltz, the Turner spokesman, said in a statement. “We’ve taken a number of steps to resolve the matter with our main priority being the delivery of content to those that have purchased the pay-per-view event.” Turner, he said, did not know how many people the technical issues had affected. The match was also available for a fee through cable operators and DirecTV, but only people who purchased through B/R Live were affected by the glitch, according to the statement. Those other providers, however, may have lost potential customers when the match was available free on B/R Live. Many pay-per-view events, like the Conor McGregor-Floyd Mayweather fight last year, have been plagued by problems, because most customers delay their purchase until shortly before the event, overwhelming systems. And while cable and satellite operators have had decades to figure out how to handle the demand, new online streaming platforms have not. For the win, Mickelson made a four-foot birdie putt on a specially set up 93-yard, par 3. Mickelson was 1-up after 16 holes, but Woods tied it with a birdie from the fringe of the green on the par-3 17th hole. Both birdied the par-5 18th and then parred the first playoff hole before it went to the par-3 extra hole that they kept playing until there was a winner.",The New York Times
2018,Philippine Lawyer Who Resisted Duterte’s Drug War Is Gunned Down,"MANILA — One of the founding members of a Philippine lawyers’ group at the forefront of opposing President Rodrigo Duterte’s lethal war on drugs was gunned down on Tuesday, killed by three bullets as he was leaving his office for the night. The attorney, Benjamin Ramos, 56, was the 34th lawyer killed since Mr. Duterte became president two years ago. His group, the National Union of People’s Lawyers, specialized in doing no-cost work for poor clients whose families have been targeted by the police, soldiers and death squads associated with the president’s drug war. “We are shocked, devastated and enraged at the premeditated, coldblooded murder of our colleague and fellow people’s lawyer,” said Edre Olalia, a leader of the group. “We are disturbed and unbowed. These are dangerous times.” Initial police reports said that Mr. Ramos had just finished work when he was shot by motorcycle-riding men near the central town of Kabankalan on Tuesday night. He was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Colleagues described Mr. Ramos as passionately dedicated to pro-bono work for the poor, environmentalists, activists and political prisoners. The National Union of People’s Lawyers said his work had angered local policemen and the military. His picture was recently included by the local police in a list of people accused of having ties to the underground communist movement, a claim that the group has denied. Jose Manuel Diokno, a human rights lawyer for another organization, the Free Legal Assistance Group, said he was outraged by the killing. “I join the calls for the police to conduct an impartial and thorough investigation, to find the motive, the gunmen and the mastermind,” Mr. Diokno said in an interview, urging the Justice Department to take the lead in the inquiry. “I ask my fellow lawyers who fight for what is right and just to continue and not be cowed,” he said. In a speech in August 2017, Mr. Duterte told the national police not to be daunted by rights lawyers investigating the thousands of deaths of what he called drug addicts and dealers. “If they are obstructing justice, you shoot them,” Mr. Duterte instructed the police, referring to lawyers. (The president is himself a lawyer and began his political career as a prosecutor.) He often carries a list of the names of dozens of judges, members of the armed and police forces as well as of local politicians he claims are protecting drug suspects. He has never publicly divulged how he came up with the list, although at least three mayors whose names appeared on it have been killed. Eight other mayors were also gunned down in suspicious circumstances. One of them was killed last year in a raid that left his wife and 10 other people dead. A mayor was also fatally shot during a flag-raising ceremony in July. Mr. Olalia said that some of the National Union of People’s Lawyers members had received threats, and had been labeled by the police and the military as sympathetic to the political left, in “open contempt of basic principles of the role of lawyers in democracy.” He said a colleague investigating abuses against women and children, Katherine Panguban, had recently been criticized by the police for leading a fact-finding mission into the killings of nine farmers in the central city of Sagay. The military has said the farmers were recruited by a front organization for communist rebels, and attributed their deaths to infighting among the cadres. Mr. Olalia said Mr. Ramos’s death would not stop the group’s work. “We will be there in the trenches in defense of the defenseless,” he said. “There is no other choice.” The group Human Rights Watch said Mr. Ramos’s killing was proof that impunity existed under Mr. Duterte’s drug war. “It is a blow to the human rights movement in the Philippines,” the group said in a statement. “We demand an impartial investigation into Ramos’s murder and the many other attacks against lawyers in the Philippines and that the authorities bring the perpetrators to justice.”",The New York Times
2018,Philippines Says It Will Charge Veteran Journalist Critical of Duterte,"SHANGHAI — The Philippine government said on Friday that it would charge a veteran journalist and her online news start-up with tax evasion, a move the publication described as an attack against media in the country by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. The country’s Department of Justice said it had grounds to indict the start-up, Rappler, and its founder, Maria Ressa, for tax evasion and failure to file tax returns. Rappler denied the charges, calling the case a “clear form of continuing intimidation and harassment,” and accused the government of trying to silence critical coverage. The penalties for tax evasion include a fine as well as up to 10 years of imprisonment. Speaking from Washington, D.C., where she received an award from the International Center for Journalists on Thursday evening, Ms. Ressa said an indictment — which the government has said could come as soon as next week — would have a chilling effect on reporters in some of the most dangerous places around the world. “This is really transforming our democracy and yet another blow,” Ms. Ressa said on Friday. “It is meant for maximum impact of intimidation.” Since taking office in 2016, Mr. Duterte has threatened to block the renewal of a license for the country’s largest broadcast network, called reporters who ask him tough questions “spies” and warned that “just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.” [Read more about Rappler’s efforts to combat fake news in the Philippines.] Mr. Duterte is one of a handful of populist and increasingly authoritarian leaders around the world who have turned on the media and accused reporters of deceit and “fake news,” echoing a phrase used by President Trump. In the Philippines, some of those attacks have been more literal than rhetorical as Mr. Duterte used government institutions and the law to pressure journalists. The tax evasion case centers on a 2015 investment in Rappler by the Omidyar Network, an American organization owned by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay. The financial transaction at the heart of that case is also the subject of a Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission effort this year to revoke Rappler’s license to operate. Mr. Duterte’s hostility toward the publication has been apparent since soon after he took office. A former mayor from the southern city of Davao, Mr. Duterte ran for president as a blunt antidrug populist. He executed a brutal campaign against drug dealers and users, leading to the deaths of thousands and prompting outcry overseas. Rappler became one of the administration’s biggest critics, writing stories that raised questions about the violence. Mr. Duterte used his first state-of-the-union address in 2017 to single out Rappler, accusing it of being foreign-owned without giving any evidence. Not long after, the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into the ownership structure. In January, the government revoked Rappler’s license, prompting accusations by rights groups and activists that the speed of the decision showed it was politically motivated. Rappler appealed and continued to operate from overseas. “It’s virtual assassination,” Ms. Ressa said in an interview this year. “It’s a smear campaign. ‘You’re biased, you’re corrupt, you’re owned by Americans,’” she said, quoting Mr. Duterte. Rappler has also had to battle an onslaught of misinformation on Facebook — some of it published by officials close to Mr. Duterte. The daily grind has weighed on Rappler’s young reporters, many of whom have received death and rape threats. A veteran reporter and former CNN bureau chief, Ms. Ressa has covered wars and talked to terrorists, but she described the past two years as the most challenging in her multidecade career. She has since traveled the world, attending journalism industry events to bring awareness to the battle in the Philippines between the media and the government. Ms. Ressa created Rappler in 2012 after persuading three friends to leave their high-powered jobs at other news organizations. The women shared an optimism that the internet would create a more level playing field and give a platform to those without a voice. They also had years of experience tackling thorny issues. Ms. Ressa, who had negotiated the release of three staff members kidnapped by a Qaeda group in 2008 when she was head of ABS-CBN, the national broadcaster, has written two books on terrorism. Chay F. Hofileña, who is head of investigations at Rappler, has written about media corruption, and Glenda Gloria, managing editor, about military corruption. They built their careers in the wake of the “people power” revolt that brought down the regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and ushered in Corazon Aquino, the first woman to become president of the Philippines. They have been arrested and threatened with death. A black funeral wreath was once delivered to Ms. Gloria’s family door. Lilibeth Frondoso, Rappler’s head of multimedia, was once thrown in prison with her newborn child. Now the future of Rappler and journalism in the Philippines is less certain than ever. “Next,” Ms. Ressa said, “will be an arrest warrant.”",The New York Times
2018,"Phoebe Robinson’s Work Diary: ‘The Sausage Is Getting Made Very Publicly, but It Makes You Fearless’","like a boss She’s a comedian, podcaster (2 Dope Queens), best-selling author and — no surprise here — a confessed workaholic. CreditCreditTawni Bannister for The New York Times Four years ago, Phoebe Robinson was just another standup comedian. She had regular shows in New York and Los Angeles, but hadn’t broken through. Then she met Jessica Williams, a cast member on “The Daily Show,” and taped an episode of her podcast in a moldy Brooklyn apartment. Since that moment of instant chemistry, Ms. Robinson, an Ohio native, has seemed to be everywhere. In 2015, she and Ms. Williams created a hit podcast, 2 Dope Queens, that spawned a series of HBO specials; the next year, her first book, “You Can’t Touch My Hair: And Other Things I Still Have to Explain,” became a best seller. Ms. Robinson began racking up onscreen credits and accolades (the 2018 movie “Ibiza”; Jill Soloway’s Amazon show “I Love Dick”), started another podcast and wrote a second book, “Everything’s Trash, but It’s Okay.” Published Oct. 16, “Everything’s Trash” addresses Ms. Robinson’s workaholism, among other topics. It’s an irresistible mash-up of stream-of-consciousness venting and measured appraisals of everything from white feminism to Bono. Reading it made me gasp, reread the joke, and then maniacally giggle on the subway. Toward the end, Ms. Robinson, 34, promises that she’s addressing her addiction to work: “I daydream about taking it easier every single day of my life.” We checked in on how that’s going. 10 a.m. Make 2 Dope Queens announcements on social media, then tape a short video for TheSkimm. I live by and die by Google Cal and Wunderlist. Your girl loves a to-do list and sometimes the first thing I’ll write down on a to-do list is “Start a to-do list.” LOL. It is full trash, but a good way to pretend like I’m getting something started and then cross it off. 10:30 a.m. Hang wall art for an Apartment Therapy photo shoot at home. The artistic mood in my apartment is like “Solange on a budget.” Just hella chill — like there is a giant framed photo of Sade that hangs above the dining room table and reminds bae and me to relax and be chill. But then we have this big plaque of his that we hung that is a work achievement, so it’s nice to remember when something really dope happened. 11:30 a.m. Write standup. I do most of my writing sitting on a couch at home. Writing in a coffee shop feels very cool, but some guy will be like, “Can you watch my stuff while I go do xyz” and now I’m on mall-cop duty, which can distract my flow. Plus I listen to a lot of ignorant music or dad rock, so sometimes I’ll be paranoid that people can hear me having Phil Collins on repeat for an hour. 1 p.m. Workout. Ninety-five percent of my work is creative somehow, but I try to make sure to remember that all of it is connected to make my career sing. It’s like going to the gym. You may go to the gym five times a week, but you’re not doing the exact same thing every time. That’s what it’s like with all these different appointments and creative gigs. They each work a different muscle, which is nice. Hopefully, I’m getting better, faster, stronger. Is that a Daft Punk song? 9 p.m. Do standup. Two comedy shows, back to back. The sets aren’t that long — 15 minutes and 10 minutes. So it’s kind of nice to go out and try some new material and then travel to the next show, make adjustments in my head with jokes, and try them again. 10 a.m. Conference call for potential movie role. This was a FaceTime call with a female director — just getting a feel for each other and our personalities and our working styles. These sorts of calls are cool because there’s no pressure. You either get along with someone or you don’t, so it’s nice to truly just be yourself, talk about Oprah and if the other person isn’t into it, then ya know, that’s O.K. 1 p.m. Workout. There’s a small gym in my building. It makes it so easy. 3 p.m. Launch sweepstakes announcements for “Everything’s Trash” book launch. I’m feeling good about the book. I think it’s better than the first one and I hope that people like it. At this point, you just sort of have to accept that you won’t have any control over how people receive it. Just hope for the best, promote it like crazy and then move on. It’s easy to get caught up in trying to make the best-seller list, but it’s like ... writing a book is the achievement. It’s super hard to do and the fact that in the span of three years, I’ve written two books, I’m like, “Yaaaaas Gaga.” The book tour will be exhausting, but I could be a doctor having to deliver bad news, but I’m not. So I try to have perspective and take vitamins like biotin so my Afro will be poppin’. 8 p.m. Comedy set. I’ve been doing comedy for 10 years. I think any time you go on stage, you’re going to have a small part of you that is dreading sucking, but it’s work. That’s all it is. It’s a job and you have to show and do the damn thing. No one in the audience cares about whatever is going on in my head because they paid to be entertained. And ultimately, I’m going to do thousands and thousands of shows in my life. The preciousness of it has to go away. I don’t run my stuff in a mirror. I just have an idea, a few lines I’ve written down and sort of talk myself through it on stage and then keep refining it and figuring it out. The sausage is getting made very publicly, but it makes you fearless in a way. 7 a.m. Hair and makeup before photo shoots for T: The New York Times Style Magazine and Apartment Therapy. Over all, these shoots are chill. I’m friends with my hair and makeup people (Delina Medhin and Sabrina Rowe), so they make it a lot more enjoyable. 9 a.m. I think I want all shoots to happen at my home now. It’s nice to roll out of bed, walk around barefoot and drink a LaCroix and then shoot and then be like, “O.K., everyone leave.” 2 p.m. Post updates on socials about Black Girls Code. I got involved with this organization after I literally just Googled “black owned charities.” 3:30 p.m. Papermag.com interview. I don’t really have to prep for these interviews. Unless you’re talking about something weighted like politics or health-related stuff. You want to know your ish. But when I’m just being interviewed about myself? I’ve lived it. I’ve done the work, whether it’s writing the book or producing “2 Dope Queens” for HBO. Also, my brand is just being myself. So if I’m true to who I am, there’s nothing to prepare. 4 p.m. Seattle Times interview. I think the more you do interviews, the better you get. I know how to answer the question I want to answer. I also have worked on trying to fit in charity organizations that I work with, without feeling forced. That’s a hard thing to do, but padding stuff with jokes makes it easier. Sneak the medicine in with the dessert. 7:30 p.m. Dinner with manager. These dinners are a mix of relaxing and professional. You want to chill with them and hang and catch up. But you also want to get down to work and make sure you’re getting all your bases covered. I like to get work stuff out the way so then you fully enjoy your meal. Who wants to talk deal points re: a contract over a plate of scallops? 10 a.m. Work on speech for Girls Write Now. The organization reached out to me and I was thrilled. Female writers tend to not be supported the way male ones are, so I’m happy to be a part of it and hopefully, put some more eyeballs on what they do. 1 p.m. Workout. I have to go on my book tour next month and I can’t be sick and I have to be alert and in shape enough to be doing 45 minutes of stand-up a night and then signing books after that. Regiment comes with age in my case. It’s just like, “C’mon, dawg. Step it up if you really want it. If not, don’t waste your time.” So I’m just being honest with myself and not worrying about the number on the scale or having a six pack. I just want to be healthy for my bae and my family. Everyone is getting older. We gotta enjoy these years, ya know? Interviews are conducted by email, text and phone, then condensed and edited.",The New York Times
2018,Photo of More Than 60 Students Giving Apparent Nazi Salute Is Being Investigated,"Police and school officials in a small town in Wisconsin are investigating a photograph taken last spring of about 60 male high school students, many of them making what appears to be a Nazi salute. The photograph, taken on the steps of a local courthouse before the Baraboo High School junior prom, was available for purchase on the photographer Peter Gust’s website, Wheel Memories, until Monday morning, when it apparently was deleted. The image went viral after it was posted on Twitter Sunday night. In a letter sent to parents on Monday, the school district superintendent, Lori Mueller, said that administrators were “extremely troubled by the image.” “Clearly, we have a lot of work to do to ensure that our schools remain positive and safe environments for all students, staff and community,” Ms. Mueller wrote. “If the gesture is what it appears to be, the district will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address the issue.” Not all the students in the photograph participated in making the salute. One student, wearing a red bow tie, stands stoically in the far upper right corner with his hands at his sides. Another student in the front row is making the O.K. sign with his right forefinger and thumb, a hand gesture that has been adopted by white nationalists. There is one black student in the group, who is partly obscured. When an anonymous Twitter account, which is believed to be run by two members of the school’s senior class, shared the photo on Armistice Day, the message said, “We even got the black kid to throw it up.” Baraboo is a town of 12,000 people 40 miles northwest of Madison, and the seat of Sauk County. The population is 94 percent white, according to the 2010 census. Each year, members of the junior class at Baraboo High School pose on the courthouse steps for parents and other residents. More than one professional photographer usually attends the event, according to Alisyn Amant, 19, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who graduated from Baraboo High last year. The junior prom is held each year in the school gymnasium; there is no senior prom. [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] Some of the students in the picture have since graduated, Ms. Amant said, but most are now seniors at the school. Ms. Amant said she knows several of the students in the photograph but would not give their names. She said that there was a clique of boys at the school who often made offensive remarks. “I’m not surprised by them doing this,” she said, “but I’m surprised that there’s so many of them doing this. Photographers were there; the parents were there; community members were there.” She added that she was disappointed that the photograph had been taken months ago and that no one seemed to mind until now, or seek punishment for those involved. She said that many of her high school classmates and current students she had spoken to had told her they thought some disciplinary action should still be taken. Ms. Amant’s mother is a reading specialist with an office on the high school campus. “A lot of teachers in the school have been role models and instilled the values that I have,” Ms. Amant added. “I know that my mother is outraged about this, too.” The student in the red bow tie has been identified as Jordan Blue. In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr. Blue wrote that the salute was the photographer’s idea, and that he was unable to get away from the shot before the picture was taken. “I knew what my morals were, and it was not to salute something I firmly didn’t believe in,” Mr. Blue wrote. On Twitter, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland responded to the controversy by directing the school district’s attention to its online lesson plans, which include resources on the consequences of normalizing symbols of hate. “We need to explain what is the danger of hateful ideology rising,” the museum’s post said. “Auschwitz with its gas chambers was at the very end of the long process of normalizing and accommodating hatred.” Another small-town school was rocked recently when teachers and staff members at an elementary school in Idaho wore Halloween costumes depicting Mexican stereotypes and a border wall adorned with President Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.” The teachers and staff members were suspended.",The New York Times
2018,Picks of the Litter: Dog Picture Books for Every Child — and Grown-Up,"Children’s Books Romantic love, platonic love, parental love — I’d hate to live without any of them. But dog love took me by surprise a year ago, when it arrived relatively late in life with Marco, my first dog. So, like many before me, I became a seeker-outer of dog books. Dog picture books, especially, which are easy to enjoy with or without a child. (If you doubt that, please watch the YouTube video of Betty White reading “Harry the Dirty Dog,” which has over five million views.) All animals have lessons for us, but none have as much to show fledgling humans — and some of us older ones — about finding and losing, playing and working, caring and staying true. And the creators of dog picture books deliver those while blatantly dialing up the emotions — who can forget the scene in “Madeline’s Rescue” where Genevieve gives birth to 11 puppies? In that grand tradition, these five new books are the pick of the litter. Cori Doerrfeld’s wonderful “The Rabbit Listened” used a stuffed bunny to offer a gentle tutorial in the magic of staying quiet and letting children express what’s bothering them, and now in GOOD DOG (HarperCollins, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 3 to 6) she tells a more playful but equally satisfying tale of a stray dog who finds his person in the form of a little girl who has lost her stuffed bear. Each page has just two words, one of them “dog” — “hungry dog,” “hopeful dog,” “brave dog” — while Doerrfeld’s soft, pleasingly round illustrations make clear what’s happening. Non-dog owners, beware the page where she turns to her parents and says, “My dog?” Another kind of who-rescued-whom story is FOUND. (Simon & Schuster, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 3 to 8), by Jeff Newman and Larry Day, a sweet narrative that unfolds through pictures alone, with words appearing only in signs and objects in the background. We see a sad girl looking out the window, and a brown dog wandering in the rain. She takes him up the stairs of her rowhouse. He settles in, and she feeds him from a dog bowl labeled “Prudence”; she’s less sure about letting him play with Prudence’s ball. On a jaunt to the pet store to buy a new ball, she spots a poster: Someone’s looking for the dog she found. She gathers herself and returns him to his rightful owners. On the walk home, a sad bulldog peers out a shelter window, and on the last page we glimpse that dog scampering out of view in her house. The story is so tightly constructed there’s almost no room for interpretation, and I like that. The vigorous pen-and-ink art leaves a lot of white space on the page, with just occasional washes of color, adding to a sense that the book is a straightforward puzzle you’re solving with visual clues, like the colors of the balls that belong to each dog. Of course, there’s an overarching fantasy element — the girl appears to live with no parents and no adult figures intrude on her decision-making. But isn’t that one of the best things dogs can give kids, a sense of their own power? The delightful comics-style GOOD ROSIE! (Candlewick, 40 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8), written by Kate DiCamillo and illustrated by Harry Bliss, stars a little white and brown terrier named Rosie. She has a pleasant daily routine with her owner, George, but she doesn’t have any dog friends, so she’s lonely. (You suspect George, a fussily dressed older gentleman with a balding dome of a head, may be lonely too.) One day, George takes Rosie to the dog park, where a St. Bernard named Maurice tries to befriend her. Rosie feels he’s too big and loud. Then an irritatingly “small, yippy” dog named Fifi arrives. Again, no. Rosie is lonely even at the dog park. But a mishap occurs: Maurice almost swallows tiny Fifi. After Rosie delivers a strategic bite on the leg, Maurice coughs Fifi back up. She is fine, though her collar now says “Fif.” Is friendship possible after all that? You bet! The newly renamed Fif leads the way, asking Rosie directly, “Do you want to be friends with a dog named Fif?” The final page shows a grinning George looking on as the dog friends play — and he’s flanked by two ladies who must be the owners of Fif and Maurice. DiCamillo, whose many books include the Newbery Medal-winning “The Tale of Despereaux,” packs an emotional punch in picture books, chapter books or novels, and Bliss is a wry New Yorker cartoonist and the author-illustrator of the sophisticated picture books “Grace for Gus” and “Luke on the Loose.” Together they’ve created a remarkable guide to making friends: Be honest and direct about what you want, and don’t bite. “Good Rosie!” is divided into eight sections, like mini-chapters, slowing down the pace and making it not just a good read-aloud but a fantastic choice for newly independent readers. Marla Frazee’s LITTLE BROWN (Beach Lane, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), a parable about a dog with no friends who hoards all the toys at the dog park, is an unusual dog book in that it’s frankly dark, beginning with the muddy colors and foreboding look of its tall pages. Frazee, the creator of “Boss Baby” and many other brilliantly funny and pointed picture books, is not so much offering a lesson as challenging her audience to do better, be more just and kind, figure out how everyone can get a fair share. The dog named Little Brown begins the book “cranky” and alienated, and at the end he’s still cranky and alienated, only he’s sitting atop a pile of treasure. Two questions linger: Is he lonely because he’s greedy, or is he greedy because he’s lonely? And how can we fix a situation like this, where a tyrant calls the shots? “Maybe tomorrow they would know what to do,” the book ends. In 2018 America it’s hard to take that as hopeful, but I’m trying. If the state of the world or anything else is putting you in need of a good cry, I recommend Laura Vaccaro Seeger’s BLUE (Neal Porter/Roaring Brook, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 3 to 8). It’s another book that uses only two words on each page. This time the phrases all include the word blue — “chilly blue,” “true blue” — the better to show off Seeger’s thick, brushy art and die-cut holes, which are reminiscent of her Caldecott Honor-winning “Green.” Seeger walks you through the life span of a good dog belonging to a little boy who grows to be a man just as the dog passes into the great beyond. (It’s a tip of the hat, perhaps, to the folk song “Old Blue.”) The ending made both me and my husband cry. Our 8-year-old son seemed unmoved, but that may be because his first dog is still young. Still, his reaction tugged at my heart, making me realize that some day, he’ll come back to the book with sadder, wiser eyes. Tempus fugit, but especially, it seems, when you love a dog.",The New York Times
2018,Picture Book Biographies to Dazzle a Fact-Loving Child,"Children’s Books At a literacy center in Brooklyn where I volunteered a couple of years ago, I was often surprised by which books would catch a child’s eye. It was not always the ones with bold jackets or zany titles, as I somehow expected. Often it would be a quiet story — a bit old-fashioned, even. One favorite was Barbara Cooney’s 1982 “Miss Rumphius,” about a girl who grows up wanting to fulfill her grandfather’s request that she do something “to make the world more beautiful.” After many travels she finally returns home and plants a lot of blue and purple lupines in the fields around her house. The end. I loved to watch how intently a young reader would turn the pages and puzzle out this modest and satisfying conclusion. I enjoyed the story, too — and while it was partly inspired by a real-life figure, I wanted it to be all true. Publishers of today’s picture books must be on my wavelength. Perhaps nudged by the Common Core crusade, which called in part for high-quality nonfiction for children, they are producing a bonanza of beautifully illustrated and closely researched nonfiction books about unsung heroes as well as heroes we can’t read enough about. Best of all, if you like true stories, they include superbly detailed endnotes and suggestions for further reading. It’s anyone’s guess which of these new books a child might reach for — but it might surprise you. Children who love words should warm to Alexandria Giardino’s ODE TO AN ONION: Pablo Neruda and His Muse (Cameron Kids, 32 pp., $17.95; ages 4 to 8), which imagines a small episode in the life of a great poet. The spare prose echoes Neruda’s own celebrations in verse of simple things, like the onion: “luminous vessel … bright as a planet,” vanquishing “the hunger / of the laborer along the hard road.” We first see Pablo at his desk, “writing a long, sad poem,” until he realizes he’s about to be late for lunch with his friend Mathilde. In Felicita Sala’s vivacious and beautifully detailed drawings, done in colored pencil, Mathilde’s smile and Pablo’s glum expression give a tender humor to this real-life relationship, as they gather vegetables from her garden to cook. The full text of his poem “Ode to the Onion” appears in the original Spanish at the end, and in an excellent translation by Giardino. SO TALL WITHIN: Sojourner Truth’s Long Walk Toward Freedom (Roaring Brook, 32 pp., $18.99; ages 5 to 9), written by Gary D. Schmidt and illustrated by Daniel Minter, is a stirring introduction to an extraordinary life. Born into slavery on a Dutch farm in New York State, Sojourner Truth chose her own name after she won her freedom and began a walk that, over her long life, extended to thousands of miles as she journeyed from camp meetings to abolition halls “to tell the truth about Slavery.” She never learned to read or write, yet successfully sued a white slaveholder in court for the return of her son (who had been illegally sold), addressed the first Women’s Rights Conventions, and insisted on riding in whites-only streetcars in Washington, D.C., after the Civil War. “I felt so tall within — I felt as if the power of a nation was with me!” The plain-spoken and eloquent quotations in this book come directly from her 1878 memoir, “Narrative of Sojourner Truth.” Daniel Minter’s paintings, in saturated tones of midnight blues and leaf browns and golds, bring it powerfully to life. Did you know that Japan bombed Oregon during World War II? I didn’t either. Sometimes the most inconsequential episodes in larger stories can turn out to be the most moving, and so it is with THIRTY MINUTES OVER OREGON: A Japanese Pilot’s World War II Story (Clarion, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 6 to 9), by Marc Tyler Nobleman, illustrated by Melissa Iwai. After Pearl Harbor, apparently, the Japanese military believed a successful attack on the United States mainland would be effective propaganda, so in 1942 a bombing raid was planned to start a fire in the Oregon woods that would “rage into nearby towns and cities.” Iwai’s fine renderings of the unsuspecting townspeople of Brookings, Ore., are matched by her depictions of the bomber, which was launched from a Japanese submarine deck by slingshot. Fortunately, the plan failed, but the story goes someplace completely unexpected when, years later, the boosterish citizens of Brookings track down the pilot, Nobuo Fujita, to invite him to a Memorial Day ceremony. He is welcomed warmly — and even teased about his poor fire-setting skills — and friendships made that day continue to grow for another generation and beyond, until his story becomes a thought-provoking meditation on the power of forgiveness, of others and oneself. The “girls who code” movement should probably get some extra credit for the trend in fine books about women who made history in science and math. NOTHING STOPPED SOPHIE: The Story of Unshakable Mathematician Sophie Germain (Little, Brown, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), written by Cheryl Bardoe and illustrated by Barbara McClintock, tells the story of a young woman who made her mark in the lofty academies of Paris after the French Revolution. With trouble in the streets, Sophie was often forced to stay inside for her safety, and she fell in love with the study of mathematics. She would even sneak out of bed to work on problems while everyone was asleep. Her parents’ response? To take away her candles! Yet she didn’t give up, and in 1816, after years of work, she won a grand prize from the Royal Academy of Sciences for solving an “impossible” problem: how to predict patterns of vibration, a real-life challenge to designers of buildings and bridges. Barbara McClintock’s illustrations in markers, gouache and collage show Sophie moving through life in a bright swirl of numbers, floating like thought balloons all around her. Refreshingly, Sophie Germain’s story not only reminds us of the importance of perseverance, it recalls a time when discoveries were often made by hard-working amateurs — for the fun of it.",The New York Times
2018,"Picture Books About Cars, Trucks and Other Things That Clank, Roar and Move Fast","Children’s Books They HUFF, they ROAR, they CLANK, they MOVE! Size, strength and speed, embodied! No wonder we are most fascinated by vehicles when we ourselves are at our youngest, smallest and least independent. No wonder, too, that there have been picture books about moving machines for about as long as either has been around. (See “Cousin Chatterbox’s Railway Alphabet” from the 1840s for an early example: “U is the urchin, so simple and small, / who cannot make out how the train goes at all.”) New arrivals in this long tradition drive, float and fly onto shelves each publishing season. A kicking of tires follows for some of the latest. As always, your mileage may vary. Kate Prendergast sets DOG ON A DIGGER (Candlewick, 32 pp. $16.99; ages 3 to 6) on an industrial lot, drawn without sentimentality; the eye wanders over pavement, warehouses, a concrete canal and a parked excavator with a clamshell bucket — a digger. Nestled within is a small trailer camper, the cozy home of both a dog and that digger’s operator. We follow them in this wordless, paneled story as they begin their day’s work. Young readers won’t fail to notice a small eye on the excavator’s jaw-like bucket, which gives it an apatosaurian air. If the digger doesn’t quite have a will of its own, it does still seem to enjoy its work. Prendergast works in pencil, in soft shades of gray, and then adds two colors: yellow, for the digger itself and for the safety gear worn by both man and dog, and blue, for the dress worn by a young woman who runs a snack stand on this lot. She has a small dog of her own. There’s something more than hamburgers and hot dogs between the two humans, to judge by how they look into each other’s eyes — but then the woman’s dog goes missing. It’s our title dog who spots the pup clinging to a branch over the canal, and who thinks of using the excavator’s long boom to reach the pup, all communicated through the time-honored techniques of judicious pointing, barking and pawing. The book ends with something like a family portrait in yellow and blue: man, woman, excavator and two dogs, rescuer and rescued. Well, it’s a curious mix: a gloomy setting, an almost-dinosaur digger, a dash of romance, a touch of peril and a quick-thinking dog. Prendergast’s figures can be a bit wonky, too; at times they squish and stretch to fit their frames. Still, there’s a tenderness to the drawings, and one picks up Prendergast’s affection for her characters and even for that setting, which in its grimness lends an unexpected sort of credibility to the story. Add Prendergast’s convincing sense of how to keep the action moving from one panel to the next, and the young friends with whom I shared this book didn’t stop to wonder if the elements added up; they wanted to know what would happen next, and they turned the pages to find out. SMALL WALT AND MO THE TOW (Paula Wiseman/Simon & Schuster, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), from Elizabeth Verdick and Marc Rosenthal, is the follow-up to (yes) “Small Walt,” in which snowplow Walt, with driver Gus, earns a spot alongside the big plows, despite doubts about Walt’s size. In this outing, Walt and Gus, making their rounds, see a car skid into a snow-filled ditch. Can they help? Despite his can-do spirit, Walt must now learn to deal with his limitations: “My plow is tough, / but it’s not enough.” The, from over the horizon, appears Mo the Tow, driven by “the lady in blue — Sue.” (Are women in blue a trend?) Mo and Sue are the pair with the hardware and skills to perform this rescue — except it turns out they can’t quite reach the stranded car; first they’ll need some snow cleared. Are Walt and Gus up to it? No spoliers. Suffice to say all these characters have something useful they like to do and that they do well, and each has limits, too, making this a story about teamwork as well as pluck. Verdick and Rosenthal may not be clearing new ground with these lessons, but what they plow, they plow well. The characters are appealing, and the language is active and satisfying, with plenty of onomatopoeia. Good luck saying RUGGAROOOM BRUMMAHUM 10 times fast, but your audience will enjoy hearing you try. The flap copy tells us that “Small Walt” has been called “reminiscent of Virginia Burton’s classics,” and this book will be, too; the cover design practically dares you not to think of “Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.” Rosenthal’s drawings feel like a contemporary take on Burton’s spirit, though, rather than something derivative: Burton, after an espresso. The lines and colors are direct, cheerful and effective. They look like the work of someone in a good mood, and it put me in a good mood to look at them. J. M. Brum and Jan Bajtlik’s OUR CAR (Neal Porter/Roaring Brook, 32 pp., $16.99; ages 2 to 6) introduces a father, a son and the little red car they love. The drawings are digital, done in bold colors and simple shapes. (I might have guessed pastel, had one image not been recolored and reused multiple times on the title page and opening spread.) Father, the driver, and son, the passenger, are presences more than characters, just enough there to help us project ourselves into the book. “Our Car” has little interest in the actual mechanics of automobiles, yet it cuts, joyfully, straight to the things that thrill about cars; the book is a distilled dose of speed and color. The troubles that come with cars are here, too. When its engine needs work, this car “screeches like a wild animal,” and teeth, eyes and even plodding feet appear, mysterious and terrific. While their car is in the shop, father and son must resort to the bus. No apologies for public transportation are made! Straphangers scowl, armpits loom too close to heads, and what is that fellow in the back doing with his finger so close to his nose? Why are things we hope to avoid on a bus such fun to see in drawings of one? When the car is home again, father and son wash it with the affection you elsewhere see lavished on golden retrievers. Then the book takes a leap: “Today I get to drive.” Dad is no longer at the wheel — the boy is! And off he zooms! Alas, on the next page we see he was not really driving, but only on the living room furniture, pretending. Mom (heretofore unmentioned, and still unseen) is given the thankless role of asking him not to park on the rug. I’ve yet to be made happy by reaching the end of a story and finding one of these “it was all a dream” endings waiting. We decide to enter a sort of dream already when we enter the world of a book; it is not necessary to wake up twice at the end. Buy this book, and paste down that last page.

2018,Picture Books to Make Your Kid — and You — Giggle and Guffaw,"Children’s Books Friends, I bring you delights! Glittery, silly, rambunctious delights. Five new humorous children’s books offer young readers a plethora of pleasure, plus pants for potatoes. Though very different from one another, four of the five feature classic children’s book imagery in one form or another. The fifth features, as I said, potato pants. In KING ALICE (Feiwel and Friends, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), Matthew Cordell, who won the 2017 Caldecott Medal for “Wolf in the Snow,” captures the joy (for kids) and frequent exasperation (for parents) of the dreary, slushy indoor snow day. On a blustery day off from school, young Alice is determined to fill her hours with adventure, enlisting her willing, but bedraggled, dad into the fun. After declaring herself king (“You mean queen,” suggests her father. “No! King!” says Alice), Her Highness sets out to cram every ounce of fun from their indoor family time, capturing all of it in a book-within-a-book recounting her adventures. Not even a timeout for the crime of accidental unicorn bopping deters from the fun with Dad. Cordell’s art is lively and especially funny when presented from the king’s crayons. Children may enjoy the fact that even a Caldecott Medal winner is not above a little gastrointestinal humor (this child certainly did). Alice’s mother and baby brother are also along for the ride. Parents will laugh in recognition at the household chaos busy young minds can create during stretches of unexpected indoor time. David Ezra Stein’s INTERRUPTING CHICKEN AND THE ELEPHANT OF SURPRISE (Candlewick, 48 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8) reunites readers with their inquisitive feathered friend from the Caldecott Honor book “Interrupting Chicken.” This time, Chicken returns from school excited to read with her father. Why? Because her teacher, Mrs. Gizzard, has told her that every good story has an “elephant of surprise.” Her father thinks that perhaps Chicken means something else, but, as we learned in “King Alice,” fathers are easily confused. (It wasn’t “Queen” Alice, nor is it the “element of surprise.”) Chicken knows precisely what she’s looking for — she’s on an elephant hunt, and she finds one in every story she reads. Did you know, for example, that Rapunzel features a bubbly blue elephant with exquisite blond braids? Now you do. Stein’s art is rich, textured and varied. Like “King Alice,” this book features stories within stories. All with elephants. Lots and lots of elephants, each of them, as advertised, surprising. Those who love their artwork textured will adore JUST ADD GLITTER (Beach Lane, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), a collaboration between the author Angela DiTerlizzi and the illustrator Samantha Cotterill. On a rainy day, the mail carrier leaves a box on a little girl’s stoop. And just in time. She and her cat are feeling “bored and ignored.” What better way to “put some shine upon your crown” than an unexpected package of glitter? Within moments, the girl is spreading sparkles everywhere: on her paper crown, paper dinosaurs and stars, and all over the bedroom rug. If your walls are “looking for glitz,” or just a few more “flashy bits,” glitter is just the thing for you. The cat, though, seems hip to a problem with which parents are all too familiar: Glitter gets everywhere. Pretty soon they’re chin deep in the stuff. After some judicious (and from experience I would say overly optimistic) sweeping, the glitter is gone, with the little girl and cat discovering that you don’t need a special delivery to find a little sparkle. With its fun rhymes and blinged-out pages, “Just Add Glitter” will appeal to those young crafts enthusiasts who have never met a surface that couldn’t use a little extra razzle-dazzle. A young knight guards against frightful creatures in Jon Agee’s THE WALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK (Dial, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), which uses the clever conceit of the book’s “gutter” — that space between each set of two pages — as a boundary between all that is safe on one side, and all that is scary on the other. Our knight explains to his readers that the brick wall we see there keeps him safe from a scary menagerie of animals. Tigers and rhinos and gorillas — oh my! Yet, the true menace on the other side of the book is a bearded ogre who would undoubtedly “eat me up” if he ever caught our young hero. Thank goodness for the high wall protecting him. But something seems to be happening on his “safe” side … something that may require the knight to rethink everything he thought he knew about barriers and who resides on the other side. Agee is the creator of many acclaimed books including “Milo’s Hat Trick” and “It’s Only Stanley,” and this deceptively simple story offers a genuine lesson in the value of all creatures, great and small. Whatever they may look like, oftentimes our biggest fears come from the uncertainty of not being able to see across a boundary. And sometimes, the greatest dangers are right in front of our own two eyes. Finally, I promised potato pants, and that is exactly what you’re going to get. Laurie Keller’s whimsical POTATO PANTS! (Holt/Christy Ottaviano, 32 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8) tells the tale of the one day — the only day — in which Lance Vance’s Fancy Pants Store is selling potato pants. A horde of naked potatoes rushes to the store by “spud bus” and “tuber Uber” to grab those tuber trousers because “once they’re gone, they’re gone!” Unfortunately for our hero, a big, purple eggplant has trespassed into the store, the same eggplant who rudely shoved our hero out of the way the previous day. Now, potato is worried that the eggplant will see him again and he will once again suffer at the hands of that bullying aubergine. Meanwhile, all the good potato pants are flying off the racks. How will our potato pal get his pants? As in “The Wall in the Middle of the Book,” Keller presents a worst-case scenario and gradually dispels the fear. Might he have mistaken the eggplant’s intentions? There’s plenty of silly illustrations and attractive potato pants to keep chuckling readers turning pages to the end.",The New York Times
2018,Pilot Pleads Guilty to Being Drunk at Heathrow Minutes Before Flight,"LONDON — The crew of a Japan Airlines flight was traveling by bus to Heathrow Airport here when the bus driver had a suspicion that there was something wrong with the co-pilot. He could smell it on his breath. After the bus driver alerted the authorities, the co-pilot, Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, was arrested at Heathrow — 50 minutes before his flight to Tokyo. A breath test showed that he was almost 10 times over Britain’s legal alcohol limit for pilots. Mr. Jitsukawa admitted that he had consumed two bottles of wine and five cans of beer hours before he was to help pilot Flight JL044 last Wednesday, the authorities said. At the Uxbridge Magistrates Court on Thursday, the co-pilot pleaded guilty to exceeding the legal alcohol limit, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said. He was detained until his sentencing on Nov. 29. Japan Airlines apologized for the pilot’s actions and said it would take the violations seriously. “Safety remains our utmost priority,” the airline said in a statement. “We will implement immediate actions to prevent any future occurrence and to regain our customer’s trust.” According to the Kyodo News agency, before the bus driver alerted the authorities at Heathrow, the pilot had passed the airline’s own breath test. Because of the pilot’s drunkenness, the flight was delayed for more than an hour, but eventually took off with two pilots instead of the usual three. Japan’s transport minister has said he will tighten rules about alcohol consumption by flight crews after a series of incidents in the industry. “We will use all possible means to ensure flight safety,” the minister, Keiichi Ishii, told reporters on Friday. In May, a Japan Airlines flight attendant was caught drinking a beer in a bathroom during a flight, Kyodo reported. Other incidents of drunkenness among crew members have drawn scrutiny to the industry. In June, a British Airways pilot was jailed for eight months after a breath test found that he was more than three times over the alcohol limit before he was to fly a long-haul flight. The pilot, Julian Monaghan, had consumed three double vodkas and a Diet Pepsi in his hotel room on an empty stomach before his flight, the BBC reported. Passengers had already started to board the plane before he was escorted from the cockpit in handcuffs.",The New York Times
2018,Pip and Me: A Journey Into the World of ‘Great Expectations’,"Footsteps Dickens began his novel in the marshes of the Hoo Peninsula, about 25 miles from London. More than 150 years later, a traveler retraces the path of that book’s indelible characters. It’s a warm morning, the sky is cloudless and the marshes of the Hoo Peninsula, 25 miles downriver from London, are thick with daises and red clover. In the churchyard of St Mary’s in the village of Lower Higham there is a scent of cut grass. The whole scene, in other words, is distinctly un-Dickensian. But it is here, near the Thames estuary, that Charles Dickens’s 1861 novel “Great Expectations” opens: “Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea.” There’s no novel I love more, and I’ve come to know this peninsula well during the 15 years I’ve lived in London. There was a time, seven or eight years ago, when I would escape to this quiet landscape, weekend after weekend, as if looking for something I’d mislaid. On this visit, having taken an early morning train to Lower Higham, a journey of no more than 80 minutes, my plan is to spend the day walking from St Mary’s, across the marshes to an isolated inlet named Egypt Bay, before returning via a second church, St James’s, in the village of Cooling. Both churches have been proposed as the setting for the opening scene of “Great Expectations,” when the young boy Pip, visiting the graves of his parents and his brothers — “five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long” — encounters the convict Magwitch, who has escaped from a nearby prison ship. (“‘Hold your noise!’ cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. ‘Keep still, you little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!’”) I’m carrying my favorite gazetteer, discovered in a book store in nearby Rochester on a previous foray: Colonel W. Laurence Gadd’s “The Great Expectations Country,” published in 1929 and long out of print. Colonel Gadd is forever “striking out,” in his rather upright way, but there’s a likable modesty to his guidance (“I make no claim to infallibility”) as we follow him from the Hoo Peninsula, via Rochester, to London, where the adult Pip is sent when he receives a fortune from an anonymous benefactor. But the colonel’s starting point, like the novel’s, is the marshes. The Hoo Peninsula divides the estuary of the Thames from that of the smaller Medway 10 miles to the east. To get a sense of its shape, take a seat on the churchyard bench and rest your right foot on your left knee: the Thames follows the curve of your heel and sole; the Medway the bony top of your foot. Both rivers open to the North Sea beyond your toes. The marshes occupy most of the northwest of the peninsula, which is to say your heel. A foot is apt for a place that offers such stimulating walking, but the terrain is not without its challenges. If you look at a UK Ordnance Survey map, you can see how wet it is: not only bounded by the two rivers and their mud flats, it’s veined by hundreds of ditches, streams, dikes, fleets and runnels, most of which can only be crossed using infrequent footbridges. If it is a formative realm for Pip, the peninsula can also be seen as central to Dickens’s own world — a rural counterpoint to London: at once his sanctuary and his inspiration. As a child, Dickens lived in the naval port of Chatham, on the Medway four miles to the southeast, and in later life, as a world-famous author, bought a home near Lower Higham, Gads Hill Place, where “Great Expectations” was written and from where he would take regular walks on the marshes. (Today the building forms part of a private school, though there are plans to open it to the public.) St Mary’s, two miles north, was his local church, where his daughter Katey was married in 1860. In “The Great Expectations Country,” Colonel Gadd maintains that the church in the novel must be this one, since its architecture matches that described by Pip. “All the other churches in the peninsula,” he writes, “have square stone towers, but [St Mary’s] has a quaint timber steeple, shingled with tiles. Pip saw this steeple under his feet when the convict tilted him backwards on the gravestone.” For Pip, the church is where life gives way to death, but also where the peopled world cedes to the marshes — “a dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it.” “The Great Expectations Country"" in hand, I strike out. Marshland is born of rivers: as silt is sluiced down from the land to the sea, the tides in turn lift it back onto the land. First there are the mud flats, covered daily by the tides. As silt accumulates on them, the mud flats rise until they stand clear of the sea for long enough to become colonized by salt-loving plants. Then they become salt marsh, the Thames estuary’s richest habitat. When the salt marsh is drained and walled off from the tide it becomes grassland. In a field half a mile north of St Mary’s, I wait at a railway spur for a freight train to shunt slowly by. It’s bound for London, the driver yells from his window, carrying estuary sand from the Cliffe aggregate works. Once the train has passed, I follow the footpath over the railway and through the works with its churning conveyor belts and towering sand dunes. In “Great Expectations,” the adult Pip remembers fondly the summer afternoons he spent with his beloved Uncle Joe, the blacksmith who is the closest thing he has to a father, lounging beside the Thames at “that old battery over yonder.” It is there, too, that Magwitch bids the boy to meet him, with a file and “wittles” (food), the day after their first encounter. Close to the former site of the battery, fenced off, flooded, and ringed by brambles, you can see the monolithic, derelict Cliffe Fort, sitting on the peninsula’s heel like a wart. Built in 1870, less than 10 years after the publication of “Great Expectations,” to counter the threat of French invasion, it is one of the Thames’s oldest remaining defensive fortifications. River Thames Egypt Bay Cliffe Fort Northward Hill Cliffe Hoo Peninsula St. James’s Church Cooling St. Mary’s Church England Lower Higham Gads Hill Place River Medway A2 Rochester England Chatham London M2 Area of detail 2 miles 50 miles By The New York Times A narrow footpath path runs along an embankment between it and the river’s exposed mud flats, which are littered with detritus washed down from the city — plastic bottles, wooden pallets, plastic ship’s fenders, deflated soccer-balls, shoes. The black hull-ribs of ships scuttled long ago reach out of the mud. Gulls squabble noisily. It’s not a pretty place, or a friendly one, so it’s a relief when the footpath opens out onto the marshes. As the grinding and banging of the aggregate works are left behind, a cooling wind rises from the sea. Even in the sunshine, with the giant container ships plying the Thames, this is recognizably Pip’s marsh country: flat, treeless, glinting with ribbons of water — a halfway place that is marine as much as terrestrial. The embankment follows the Thames’s high-water line and will take me all the way to Egypt Bay, with the river on my left and the marshes on my right. “If you like solitude, and fresh air, and open spaces,” writes Colonel Gadd, “the trip is worthwhile.” The embankment was built in the 1880s to prevent the Thames from flooding the marshes during storms and high tides. It transformed life on the peninsula. As late as 1874, Her Majesty’s Inspector for Schools described the area as “low-lying, aguish, and unhealthy, where no one would live if they could help it.” The “ague"" — malaria — had been one of the chief perils of living here; the marshes, Pip tells Magwitch, are “dreadful aguish.” When the embankment was built, standing floodwater where malaria-carrying mosquitoes bred was prevented and the disease largely eradicated. As the Thames widens toward the sea, the towering robotic cranes of the London Gateway container terminal dominate the river’s far bank a mile north, but to the south the marshes are at their most exposed and expansive. Looking across them toward Northward Hill, two miles away, I feel my city eyes widening, adjusting to the open space. The environmentalist Wallace Stegner wrote in 1960 that we need “wild country available to us, even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in.” It may be hard to think of this landscape so heavily shaped by humankind as wild, but to know that it is here, just an hour or two from London, still intractable and sparsely populated 180 years after Dickens — it’s a source of comfort. “The distance from Cliffe Creek to Egypt Bay is about three miles,” Colonel Gadd announces. It takes him an hour, “as the way is for the most part on slippery mud.” The embankment path avoids the mud, but is more like six miles, and it’s past 4 p.m. by the time I reach Egypt Bay. I arrive sunburned and windblown, my lips taut and salty. The provenance of the bay’s name is unclear, though it has been suggested it’s because a Phoenician coin was unearthed nearby. What is known is that this sandy inlet was an ancient landing place, and favored by smugglers in the 19th century. Beyond the mudflats, says Colonel Gadd, is where the prison hulk was from which Magwitch escaped before apprehending Pip — “in the topographic sense,” at least, for the vessel once anchored here was not a prison hulk, the colonel concedes, but a Coast Guard lookout. I rest on the sea wall and when I stand, a group of swans rises from a nearby dyke, five of them, passing over the marshes until they are no more than gleaming dashes against the dark woods of Northward Hill. Turning away from the river, I follow them south across the marsh, locating the wooden footbridges that cross the drainage ditches, and finally heading west, until the square stone steeple of St James’s Church comes into view. According to the historian Edward Hasted, writing in the 1770s, Cooling was “an unfrequented place, the roads of which are deep and miry, and it is as unhealthy as it is unpleasant.” On this late summer’s afternoon the village has an air of tranquil prosperity, and is so still and unpeopled as to feel like a film set. I don’t see a soul. “Close by the south porch,"" Gadd writes of the church, ‘are the gravestones of Pip’s little brothers.’ A meter in length and torpedo-shaped, the real gravestones — thirteen in total — belong to two branches of the Comport family, victims of malaria in the late 18th century. In Dickens’s novel there are just five, but as his friend and biographer John Forster put it: “with the reserves always necessary in copying nature not to overstep her modesty by copying too closely, he makes the number that appalled little Pip not more than half the reality.” No reader would believe thirteen. Colonel Gadd insists that the stones were imaginatively “imported"" by Dickens to St Luke’s at Lower Higham, where my walk began. But for me it is St James’s, because of their presence, that will always be where Pip met Magwitch on that “memorable raw afternoon towards evening.” Even today, in the warm raking light, I suppress a small shudder. A place might inspire fiction, but fiction in turn can shade your experience of that place. I remember my first reading of the novel, long before I set foot here. It was Pip who knew these “death-cold flats,"" but that terrifying stranger who would transform his life — part magus, part witch — seemed to be the very marshes incarnate, a shackled golem formed of salt-mud and fog. (“Keep still, you little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”) Once I’ve written my name in the church’s visitor book, I return “The Great Expectations Country” to my backpack, and start the four-mile walk back to Lower Higham and my train to London.

2018,Pittsburgh Shooting Suspect Pleads Not Guilty in Synagogue Rampage,"PITTSBURGH — Robert Bowers, the man accused of murdering 11 people in a hate-fueled massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue, entered a plea of not guilty in a federal courtroom on Thursday. Mr. Bowers, 46, walked into the courtroom on foot, showing little sign of the injuries he sustained from the shootout that ended the attack on Saturday, besides a heavily bandaged left elbow. He wore red, short-sleeved jailhouse scrubs and his handcuffs were unlocked at the defense table. He sat down with little effort. The arraignment, which took less than 15 minutes, began with prosecutors reading him a summary of the 44 counts in his indictment, which was handed down Wednesday. The counts include hate crimes and using a firearm to commit murder in a crime of violence. After describing each category of the crimes from the murders, the prosecutor, Soo C. Song, added, “Those victims are listed by their initials.” Mr. Bowers leaned forward in his seat, firmly nodding his close-shaved head and answering “Yes,” loudly and without hesitation, to every question he was asked. Those questions included whether he was informed of and understood the charges and penalties. [Back-to-back funerals. Mourners 50 deep. Read more about how Pittsburgh is grieving, 11 times over.] “The possible penalties,” he was informed by Troy Rivetti, one of the prosecutors, “are first a sentence of death.” Mr. Bowers did not appear to flinch. Beyond death were a variety of prison sentences from 10 years to life, connected to the 44 counts. At the end of the short hearing, Mr. Bowers was asked how he pleaded. “As is typical at this stage of the proceedings,” said his lawyer, Michael Novara, a federal public defender, “I ask the court to enter a plea of not guilty.” He also requested a jury trial, which prosecutors estimated could take three to four weeks, or longer if Attorney General Jeff Sessions certified it to be a capital case.",The New York Times
2018,Places for Matches,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN Will Nediger’s Saturday puzzle: It’s a feeling. SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’ve got to admit, my inner teenager’s first glance at today’s Will Nediger grid landed on 1A and she then self-consciously cringed. (“Oh no,” she thought, “not that.” Very prickly and prudish, this teenager, sometimes.) But aside from a couple of other nose wrinkles I thought this puzzle was a good mix of high and low, let’s say; there weren’t torrents of weird debuts, and there also weren’t many common filler words, so it made for a challenge. I muffed 4D and killed a lot of time sticking with “I made it” instead of IM ALIVE. I also had “pit” for PIP for a while, and I didn’t know the show WWE RAW, which made the southeast a little slow too, although I eventually sussed it out on crosses and vague recollection. I learned something new about the NENE (although they’re probably not walking on really hot lava), and certainly something new about Harry REID, the former Democratic majority leader of the Senate, although this might have been common knowledge to some (he was even elected to the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame). 1A: In more innocent puzzles past, “Pole star?” referred to Santa Claus, and “pole star” was an entry for clues like “Guiding principle” and “Lech Walesa, for one?”. Yet, somehow, STRIPPERS here was unsurprising. Other clues for this entry, by the way, have been along the lines of “Ones whose business is taking off?” (2007) or “Worker(s) on tobacco” (1960). I must say, I did love the intersection with 7D, “Woman’s name meaning ‘pleasure’,” since that name was EDNA. I also wager that if you look you’ll find a pole (or even pole yoga) studio near you where people of all stripes take classes, even in YOGA PANTS, although they make it harder to get traction. 61A: One of several good puns today, I had OFFAL on my mind here, or some poor type of chum, but the “sharks” in question were the sort you swim toward in desperation, the ones that practice USURY. 62A: Emiliano Zapata led workers against sugar cane magnates and a dictator in the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910. I know the ZAPATISTAS only from about 1994 on, when Nafta was signed and the group was in the news for a similar mobilization attempt; I’m not sure how far back the term goes. This group still exists: The Times wrote in 2017 about its renunciation of military guerrilla tactics and foray into political activism, a reaction to how violent Mexico has become. 24D: Both long down entries today were cultural, but this was a debut and a bit more obscure than your usual bookish Saturday clue, perhaps. We see misty, evocative, soft paintings in museums, but that particular ethereal quality where earth, sea and sky sort of melt into one another is TURNERESQUE. J.M.W. Turner is probably one of England’s most famous painters, who I had been taught to look at as a chronicler of the industrial age, but could also be considered a forefather of modern art. 41D: Another debut from the high culture Pantheron, er, Pantheon — the hint about “rhyming” helped me figure out SIR PURR on the crosses. The inclusion of a low-slung terrier, a big cat and a TOQUE in this puzzle made me think of the movie “Ratatouille,” if you ever saw it. This puzzle is a rare case where the seed entry didn't end up making it into the final grid. Especially ironic since the seed entry was SEED ENTRY at 1-Across! But Andrew Ries suggested I replace the top-left corner entirely, and he was right, since it was actually the weakest part of the grid. I'm much happier with how the new version turned out.

2018,"Players in Any ‘Breakaway’ League Would Be Barred From World Cup, FIFA Says","LONDON — Imagine a World Cup without Neymar, Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. In other words, soccer’s premier tournament shorn of its biggest stars. Such an unthinkable idea is being openly discussed among the sport’s highest authorities, according to leaks of behind-the-scenes discussions involving some of soccer’s leading clubs. The discussions have included the possibility of a breakaway league. Such a competition, seemingly the brainchild of the Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, would render the teams and players in it as pariahs to the rest of the soccer world, Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said. “You are either in or you are out,” Infantino said on Wednesday at a round-table discussion with a small group of international news media organizations, including The New York Times, after yet another tumultuous week for global soccer. The planned breakaway, essentially a cash grab by soccer’s richest, most popular teams, is one of a number of revelations to have been made public in what seems to be a coordinated attempt to obtain confidential data from within the soccer industry. The disclosures come at a sensitive time for the sport. FIFA is in a major dispute with UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, after Infantino unveiled plans in March for a new tournament for clubs backed by billions of dollars from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. A club breakaway — something that top clubs have threatened to do in the past before backing down — would be far more damaging. Without the support of soccer authorities, any such league would effectively be considered a rogue competition. “If there are players who don’t play in organized football, they don’t play organized football, and that encompasses everything: national leagues, confederation competitions, the Euros and the World Cup,” Infantino said. Under one version of the so-called superleague plan, more than a dozen of Europe’s biggest teams would consider leaving their domestic competitions to play one another beginning in 2021. Real would be joined in the league by other superclubs, with the likes of Juventus, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool seen as key partners in the plan, drawn up by Key Capital Partners, the Madrid-based advisers to Real Madrid and Pérez’s construction company, A.C.S. “It sounds like an idea cooked up at 5 a.m. in the pub,” said Javier Tebas, the president of Spain’s professional league, La Liga. Real Madrid has not commented. Infantino said some of the information published in recent days was misleading, though he did not provide details of what was inaccurate and said FIFA under his leadership was a far better organization than the one he inherited in 2016 after the fall of the longtime president Sepp Blatter and a major corruption scandal. Not everyone is impressed by his efforts. “He’s had sufficient time in order for something to happen and he hasn’t done it,” Tebas added. Tebas’s opposition to Infantino’s leadership might also be linked to the FIFA president’s recent comments that he would oppose the Spanish league’s plans to play an official game in the United States early next year. Infantino is using the controversial talk of a breakaway to push his plans for an expanded FIFA-operated tournament for clubs, suggesting that without it, the likelihood for teams walking out would be higher. “If the price to pay is to give proper values to clubs participating in a Club World Cup, and this allows us to put 25 percent into solidarity and give one million to Haiti, who has nothing, or Mongolia, then we should be doing that.” The crisis appears to have led to a thaw in the troubled relationship between Infantino and Aleksander Ceferin, the leader of European soccer’s governing body. They have not held face-to-face bilateral talks since Infantino announced his Club World Cup plan. The two spoke by phone on Wednesday and could meet soon, Infantino said. The talks included discussions of the expanded 2022 World Cup in Qatar to include 48 teams, a move that will almost inevitably require the Gulf state to share games with regional neighbors, potentially involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the two powers behind a punishing economic blockade against Qatar. “In light of the current circumstances in the region we all know about, I would be even happier if this could happen and football can build bridges,” Infantino said. FIFA is sending specialists to Doha this week to study the feasibility of changing the dimensions of the tournament, which must be played within 28 days, in order not to further affect European league seasons. The tournament is being shifted from its June-July timetable to November and December to mitigate the affects of high temperatures in the Middle East. “We may have to play matches simultaneously, this kind of thing, and compare the value of that with the positive impact,” Infantino said.",The New York Times
2018,Poem: A Man’s World,"Poem The power of insinuation: Although the title tells us straight, the nod to James Brown —followed by that suggestive first line — plunges us into a squeamish, all-too-familiar outrage. Is no quarter safe from despair? Surely our current national poet laureate doesn’t mean to take us there? For Tracy K. Smith, a consummate weaver of words, meaning is a many-layered continuum. She shows us the world as we have fashioned it — a reminder that even sweeping global ills like environmental abuse, sexual hierarchy and territorial ambition are fueled at the hearth by the everlasting deadly sins of lust and greed.

2018,Poem: Only as the Day Is Long,"Poem The title poem of Dorianne Laux’s forthcoming collection is a searing eulogy, a heart-rending kaddish whose compassion is tendered with an unblinking eye. It also happens to be a sonnet, albeit unrhymed — still singing although turned on its head, with the six-line stanza followed by the octave. It’s a fitting vessel for this litany of conflicted sorrow as Laux takes us from the cellular level to the vastness of the universe, all the while gathering the devastating minutiae of a not-quite-vanished life.

2018,Poem: Parents,"Poem The deceased parents in Ted Kooser’s poem are nothing like the cantankerous apparition of folklore, nor is their son “spooked” by their lingering presence. This was once their home, too, and their persistent housecleaning is one aspect of what they’ve always done — namely, look after their child. Aided by Kooser’s artful lineation, we are whisked from room to room, the quick in pursuit of the dead. A benign haunting, if you will: Perhaps the best way to keep the spirits of loved ones alive is to allow them to continue living within us. Selected by Rita Dove",The New York Times

Whether looking for an affirmation that’s constantly shifting or holing up in furious retreat behind the glass, no one emerges victorious from the combat between the observer and the observed: Reflection becomes its own condemnation.

2018,Poems to Uplift and Inspire Young Adults,"Match Book Dear Match Book, I am a librarian, looking for poetry recommendations for my stepdaughter, a senior in high school. Her English teacher, who’s also been helping her with college essays, introduced her to the poems of Mary Oliver, and I’d like to find her even more “happy poetry.” She is a hard-working young woman and a loving and loyal sister to my son, who has Down syndrome. She is currently thinking about studying neuroscience and becoming a doctor. She also recently registered to vote, and I know that she will use the power of her voice and her vocation to change the world. She has always loved fanciful stories, and as a child her favorites were tales about mermaids. Although her academic workload and her job don’t leave much time these days for recreational reading, her yearning for literature persists. I’ve recommended Naomi Shihab Nye, and my niece, another English teacher, recommended Andrea Gibson (my stepdaughter does not prefer classic poets to modern). Can you help us discover poems for her to inspire herself and to share with her teacher? JESSICA APPELCOLUMBUS, OHIO Dear Jessica, Emails to Match Book from readers seeking poetry are rare, but welcome. When the requests do come, however, the poets readers cite most remain constant: Let’s just say that your stepdaughter isn’t the only fan of Mary Oliver’s outdoorsy interiority. Most verse lovers I hear from also mention the buoyant, contemplative lines of the former poet laureate Billy Collins. Your stepdaughter’s request for happy poems made me think of Collins’s dynamic poem “Today,” from his collection “Aimless Love.” The poem’s single long, trailing sentence begins, “If ever there were a spring day so perfect, / so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze / that it made you want to throw / open all the windows in the house”: rousing lines in any season. More spring joys proliferate in two of the most reliable sources for mood elevation: Shakespeare’s sonnets and Emily Dickinson’s nature poetry. The structure of the sonnets offers comforting conventions — 14 lines in iambic pentameter — which you can count on even during adolescence’s tumultuous times. And the couplets’ thrilling turns never fail to provide a jolt of epiphanic joy. Then there is Dickinson’s exuberance for the outdoors (“The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms — / Sweep vale — and hill — and tree!”), which courses through much of the work of the 19th-century poet, who was also an amateur botanist. Prescriptive Measures Your stepdaughter’s medical aspirations suggest that she might enjoy the work of two doctors who are also poets. Though Rafael Campo’s poems are by no means sunny, his uncommonly compassionate views of patients gripped by illness — try his collection “Comfort Measures Only” — will likely offer inspiration to your stepdaughter. The 20th-century physician and modernist William Carlos Williams might suit her tastes too. In his poem “January Morning,” from the collection “Al Que Quiere!,” Williams embraces nature, touches on medicine and writes throughout with bracing vivacity. Funny Pages Thinking about Williams and his very short apology, “This Is Just to Say” (the lines that launched a thousand memes), led me to Kenneth Koch’s affectionate parody “Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams” for when your stepdaughter needs a bit of delicious levity. And then there’s Koch’s friend and fellow New York School poet Frank O’Hara, whose “Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!]” and “Having a Coke With You” are blithe, short and therefore perfectly suited for memorizing. Creature Comforts Even if she’s outgrown her affection for mermaids (I thought of suggesting Adrienne Rich’s “Diving Into the Wreck” even before I remembered that it features a half-woman, half-fish), maybe your stepdaughter can hold onto her love of myths a little longer. In a short stack of collections, poets mine traditional folklore and fairy tales for modern wisdom. In “Bestiary,” Donika Kelly’s sharp, moving debut that is full of wordplay, the search for self takes many forms, real and mythical, including that of your stepdaughter’s favorite fabulist sea dweller in “Love Poem: Mermaid.” Then there are the 17 Grimm fairy tales that Anne Sexton updates in “Transformations” — which, despite having been published in 1971, still feels current. One of the most startling poems in the collection, “The Maiden Without Hands,” led me to GennaRose Nethercott’s narrative poem “The Lumberjack’s Dove,” a darkly absurd story told from three points of view: those of the woodsman, the bird and an ax. It’s a feat of storytelling and transformation that seems uniquely suited for adolescence. Yours truly, Match Book Do you need book recommendations? Write to matchbook@nytimes.com.

2018,Poet and Punk: Patti Smith’s New Audiobook,"Audiobooks PATTI SMITH AT THE MINETTA LANE Words and Music By Patti Smith Read by the author 1 hour, 22 minutes. Audible Studios. There was a nice symmetry to “Patti Smith: Words and Music” opening a three-night run this past September at the tiny Minetta Lane Theater in the Village, while an old comrade had passed his 200th performance of the like-minded “Springsteen on Broadway” up at the much larger Walter Kerr. Both artists are South Jersey rock ’n’ roll refugees who earned New York citizenship, though Bruce Springsteen’s is more honorary; he became a global ambassador of empathic workingman’s Americana, while Patti Smith became an icon of urban punk bohemianism, a sensibility she helped invent. Unlike Springsteen, Smith has long held dual passports in the music and literary worlds. She came to performance as a poet, declaiming verse from the St. Mark’s Church Poetry Project altar in 1971, and early books like “Witt” were more than mere lyric sheets, even if the words were generally more powerful off the page. Her best recordings, especially her debut single, “Piss Factory,” and the opening of her debut album, “Horses,” were often poems declaimed over and around music. They could even be unaccompanied incantation, like the breathtaking flow of her spoken-word B-side “Babelfield,” which still feels as riveting as it did when I played it as a late-night college radio D.J. in the ’80s. And her stage patter has always been its own entertainment, part stand-up comedy, part populist sermonizing. All of which is to say that whatever “Patti Smith at the Minetta Lane: Words and Music” exactly is — audiobook, live concert recording, podcast, radio theater or combination thereof — the hybrid form feels completely natural to her talents. The recording, which has a bootleg quality to it, assembles pieces from the three-night run into a single seamless show, though showing seams is a big part of her approach. She begins as if she’s hosting a salon, promising a night of “hyper-living theater,” with no nudity but for “the naked mind — and even more dangerous, the collective naked mind.” She reverently reads a Rilke poem, “Autumn Day,” taking minor musical liberties, her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, accompanying her on piano in a style evoking Erik Satie. That’s followed by an offhand reflection on making a leaf-shaped ashtray in grade school that becomes a well-turned shaggy dog tale, complete with punch line. Smith has spoken about studying the work of “my two Johnnys” — Coltrane and Carson — in honing her improvisatory way with words. She sure has great timing. As “Springsteen on Broadway” draws on a memoir, “Born to Run,” the through-line here draws on “Just Kids,” Smith’s book about coming of age in New York with her soul mate Robert Mapplethorpe, and the more fanciful, impressionistic follow-up, “M Train,” which focuses on her later life. From the former volume she recites a passage about wandering the city in 1967 looking for a job, and stumbling on a memorial service for Coltrane, who’d died only days earlier, where she observed mourners “sobbing as the love cry” of the saxophonist Albert Ayler “spirited the atmosphere.” From “M Train” she describes a dream sequence in which she sees her late husband, Fred (Sonic) Smith: “I awoke and it was still dark. I lay there for a time reliving the dream, feeling other dreams stacked behind it. I slowly began to recall the entire body, telescoping backwards, letting my mind stitch the fleeting pieces together.” Her readings breathe. At one point Smith mispronounces “Second Avenue,” interrupting to correct herself and note the difference between Second and Seventh Avenues in 1967. And naturally, the spoken-word sections function as bridges to the songs. Another “Just Kids” passage recounts walking around town with Mapplethorpe and hearing her lone hit single, “Because the Night,” playing out of storefronts. Her gifted friend “was unabashedly proud of my success. What he wanted for himself, he wanted for us both,” and it’s deeply touching to hear her mimic his voice, speaking to her “in a tone he only used with me — a bemused scolding — admiration without envy, our brother-sister language. ‘Patti,’ he drawled, ‘you got famous before me.’” This segues into a spirited reading of the song — written, in fact, with Springsteen — with a more chamber-music feel than usual, arranged for piano, bass and guitar with Smith’s daughter, son Jackson and longtime collaborator Tony Shanahan. The seesaw between recitation and song continues, at times wisely dispensing with Brechtian asides. The aforementioned dream sequence with Smith’s husband segues into “Love Is All We Have Left,” a fragile cover of the recent U2 ballad. Another segment from “M Train” soars on heightened language, only to drop to earth with a complaint about Smith’s aged joints, and a funny reverie about wrangling Virginia Woolf’s walking stick from the New York Public Library’s literary miscellany collection. A magnificently Rimbaudian “Pissing in a River,” from her 1976 “Radio Ethiopia” album, shows her singing voice potent, feral and fierce as ever. Versions of “Frederick” and “The Jackson Song,” written for her husband and son, are equally compelling, the latter following a heartbreaking account of a combination photo and recording session with Mapplethorpe that seems to choke Smith up onstage. The finale is “People Have the Power,” a song whose earnest wishfulness can feel awkward in concert settings, where it’s a pro forma set-ender. In context here, it’s genuinely heartening; credit intimacy of scale, the validation of time, an impassioned delivery and a moment in history that makes one root hard for its truth. For some time now — certainly since “Just Kids” won the National Book Award in 2010 — Smith’s writing identity has come to rival her music-making one. But the takeaway from “Patti Smith at the Minetta Lane: Words and Music” is how the two are ultimately inseparable.",The New York Times
2018,Poisoned Wildlife and Tainted Meat: Why Hunters Are Moving Away From Lead Bullets,"Many hunters are ditching traditional ammunition amid mounting evidence that it harms scavengers and pollutes the food people eat. Chelsea Cassens during an elk hunt at The Nature Conservancy’s Zumwalt Prairie Preserve in Oregon.CreditCredit ZUMWALT PRAIRIE, Ore. — Aiming a rifle loaded with a copper bullet rather than the standard type made of lead, Chelsea Cassens fired at an elk from 70 yards away, hitting it squarely behind its shoulder. To avoid spooking the animal if it was only injured, Ms. Cassens waited several minutes before approaching as her father needled her skeptically, suggesting her newfangled ammunition might not have immediately killed it. Moments later, Ms. Cassens, her father, Ed Hughes, and the three others in their hunting party descended on the fallen 450-pound beast, carved it open, inspected the internal damage, and found the spent bullet. “Will you look at that!” Mr. Hughes said, pleasantly surprised. The copper bullet had expanded on impact, as it was designed to do, opening a gaping hole in the elk’s lungs and killing it almost instantly. “Her bullet did the trick just fine,” Mr. Hughes, 63, conceded, adding later that he also planned to switch from lead to copper bullets, a transition more and more hunters are making amid mounting evidence that lead bullets are poisoning the wildlife that feed on carcasses and polluting the game meat that many people eat. At least 30 states regulate the use of lead ammunition, including Oregon, where Ms. Cassens and her father met for a weeklong elk hunt this fall. In Oregon, hunters are not allowed to fire lead bullets in a number of state wildlife areas. Neighboring California, which already enforces some of the nation’s most restrictive gun laws and was the first state to prohibit lead ammunition in specific regions, recently imposed a statewide ban on that type of bullet that will go into effect next July. [California Tries New Tack on Gun Control: Ammunition Control] Across the country, state wildlife agencies have tried a range of tactics to encourage hunters to switch from lead ammunition. In Arizona, non-lead ammunition is free in some areas, and is delivered in bulk to a Native American tribe that lives near habitats with the most vulnerable scavenger species. In Minnesota, game wardens host shooting clinics for hunters to compare copper and lead bullets, hoping to show that lead bullets break apart in ways that make them more prone to contaminate the animals they kill. According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, lead exposure is the leading cause of death in California condors, the largest land birds in North America, which three decades ago were on the brink of extinction. And between 10 million and 20 million animals, including eagles, hawks, bears, vultures, ravens and coyotes, die each year not from being hunted, but from lead poisoning, according to the Humane Society. Yet many hunters are reluctant to stop using lead bullets. They cite a range of reasons, from being unaware of the potential health threat or harm to scavenger animals, to having a stockpile of traditional ammunition they do not want to waste. Some also see the push away from lead bullets as a ruse for limiting gun rights or banning hunting more broadly. And many hunters question the availability, accuracy, price and lethality of non-lead ammunition. Indeed, regulating lead ammunition has long been a hot-button point of contention among both conservationists and hunters. The topic was so charged, in fact, that President Barack Obama’s administration waited until its last day in office to impose a ban on lead ammunition on federal land. Just hours after taking office as the Trump administration’s new secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke overturned that prohibition in his first action. And in California, the organization representing the state’s game wardens has pushed back against the impending statewide ban, breaking ranks with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and writing in a letter to the governor that there is “insufficient data to justify such a drastic action.” About 95 percent of the 10 billion to 13 billion rounds of ammunition purchased every year in the United States contain lead, which primarily comes from recycled car batteries, according to industry estimates. These bullets are often jacketed by a harder metal like copper or steel. [Read: Millions of weapons aficionados reload their own bullets and cast their own ammunition.] Before starting the elk hunt, Ms. Cassens, 33, who has been hunting since she was 10 years old and had always used lead bullets, was joined by Leland Brown, an avid hunter and the non-lead hunting education coordinator for the Oregon Zoo. She fired both lead and copper ammunition into water jugs to compare the amount of metal fragments that splinter off during penetration. A lead bullet fired from Ms. Cassens’ Remington .30-06 rifle, Mr. Brown explained, often sheds nearly a third of its original weight — more than enough to kill a bird if it consumed the particles. Still, despite the growing evidence and legislative regulations, a nonprofit created by the firearms industry has challenged much of the scientific research into the risks of lead ammunition. The group’s website, Hunt for Truth Association, claimed that lead used in bullets is not sufficiently soluble to dissolve in most animals’ digestive tracts. If poisoning occurs in the wild, it is more likely from other soluble sources like leaded gasoline, paint, pesticides, landfills, mining tailings, or illegally dumped lead acid batteries, said the website, which was recently taken down. Lynn Tompkins, who runs a bird rehabilitation center called Blue Mountain Wildlife in Pendleton, Ore., rejected those ideas. She held up photographs of X-rays of birds with lead bullet fragments in their stomachs, and said that roughly half of those she treats have lead poisoning. Often they are partly paralyzed and emaciated, she said, because the lead disorients the birds, making them incapable of hunting. On a recent day, Ms. Tompkins fed a bald eagle with an eight-foot wingspan that had been rescued. It had a blood lead level of 813 micrograms per deciliter. Anything above 10 micrograms per deciliter is considered especially dangerous, and even 3 micrograms per deciliter can increase an animal’s mortality rate. “I’m not opposed to hunting,” she said, “but we moved away from lead in gasoline, paint and plumbing and now we need to do the same with ammunition.” Wildlife authorities have at times also been reluctant to embrace bans on lead ammunition for fear that forcing non-lead ammunition on hunters may cause them to stop hunting altogether. Revenue from hunting is vital to conservation programs, enforcement and research. Many wildlife officials are themselves proud hunters and do not want to contribute to the decline of this pastime, not to mention the practical role that hunting plays in conservation efforts like the one at the 33,000-acre Zumwalt Prairie Preserve, run by The Nature Conservancy in Wallowa County, Ore. Working with state wildlife authorities, the conservancy grants access to roughly 250 hunters each year as part of an effort to control the number of elk, who overgraze the land, destroying much of the aspen and woody shrubs that birds, insects, and small animals need to survive. When hunters arrive, they are required to check in with the conservancy’s staff and if they show they are using non-lead ammunition, they are entered into a drawing for cash-card prizes. Slightly more than half of the hunters have switched to lead-free ammunition. Similar incentives are offered in Utah, where prizes in a raffle conducted by state wildlife authorities include new rifles and all-terrain vehicles for hunters who participate by either using non-lead ammunition or removing gut piles, the remains left behind after a hunter strips the animal’s carcass of its meat, which are often laden with lead bullet fragments. Court battles over the regulation of lead ammunition have raged for years. In 2012, a coalition of environmental groups sued the federal government in a bid to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate lead bullets under the Toxic Substances Control Act. An appellate court ruled two years later that the agency lacked the authority to regulate bullets under that law. That same year, Mr. Obama signed a defense budget bill that included language prohibiting the E.P.A. from banning lead ammunition under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The use of lead ammunition has been equally controversial abroad. About a decade ago, 15 countries in the European Union had partial or complete bans on lead bullets. By 2017, that number had grown to 24, according to the European Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation. And last year, the chemical agency for the European Union proposed phasing out the use of lead ammunition across all wetland areas. [How a vegetarian reporter spent a week with hunters.] For Ms. Cassens, the turning point came when she met Mr. Brown at the Zumwalt Prairie Reserve. He had a binder that she flipped through, a collection of X-rays that showed lead flecks in game meat that had been randomly selected and was donated to food pantries. She said she feeds her two children and husband game meat most nights of the week, estimating that she saves at least $1,500 a year by not buying meat from grocery stores. But the possibility of threatening her family’s health was too much. “As a nurse and a mother,” she said, “I know that no amount of lead is safe to consume.” Susan C.

2018,Poland Elections Reveal a Deeply Divided Nation,"WARSAW — Despite making major gains in provincial assemblies, Poland’s populist ruling party suffered a sweeping defeat in municipal voting in a set of elections that concluded on Sunday, confirming that Poland is a nation ever more deeply divided between its liberal cities and its conservative countryside. In elections for local and regional offices around the country, the governing Law and Justice won just four of 107 mayoral races, down from the 11 it won four years ago. Yet the party secured the most seats in nine out of 16 provincial assemblies and won outright majorities in six of them — a significant gain from the one provincial government it controlled after the elections in 2014. The recent elections, which were the first nationwide vote since Law and Justice swept to power in a parliamentary vote in 2015, had the highest turnout in local contests since the fall of communism in 1989. The turnout in the first round of balloting was 17 to 20 percentage points higher than that four years ago, and the turnout in the runoff round, which is usually lower, was in many places almost identical to that from the first round, said Lukasz Pawlowski, the head of the Institute of Local Government Studies. “This never happens,” he said. “The emotions from the three years of Law and Justice in power are running incredibly high.” The ruling party appears to have gained strength in poor and rural communities where its generous social policies, anti-immigrant sentiment, skepticism of the European Union, and message of national pride steeped in conservative values resonate most. But it lost ground among the more liberal, pro-European electorate in urban areas, failing to capture mayoralties in any of the major cities like Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, Gdansk and Lodz. That schism seems likely to continue into parliamentary elections next year. Law and Justice led the balloting for provincial assemblies four years ago, but in several states it remained out of power, as opposition parties were able to piece together governing majorities. Its improved showing this year will give it outright control of several regions, though it remains to be seen whether it can form coalitions in others. The first round of local voting was held on Oct. 21, though many of the results were not clear for days. In races for provincial assemblies, the leading candidates won even if they attracted less than 50 percent of the vote; in a mayoral election, if no one won a majority in the first round, a runoff was held on Sunday between the top two finishers. In many cities, notably Warsaw, opposition candidates for mayor unexpectedly won in the first round, without runoffs. In the big cities, thousands of demonstrators have regularly filled the streets to protest government changes to the judicial system, including the forced retirement of more than two dozen Supreme Court judges. Critics say the changes undermine the independence of Polish courts. The government’s attempts to reshape the judiciary have been deemed by the European Commission a severe threat to the rule of law. Poland became the first member of the bloc to trigger a process that could lead to it being stripped of its voting rights. Two weeks ago, the European Union’s top court ordered Poland to suspend the law that purged the Supreme Court. It is not yet clear how the government will respond. By Monday afternoon, most senior officials from the ruling party had yet to comment on the final election results. Jaroslaw Sellin, a Law and Justice lawmaker and deputy minister of culture, said on Monday that his party “has a problem in big cities” that are “the base of the left-wing and centrist electorate.” Mr. Sellin said that ahead of elections next year for the European Parliament and the national Parliament, the party will have to “analyze the problem thoroughly.” “We’ll try to show these Poles that all the good policies of the current government are dedicated also to them,” he said in an interview with a private news channel, TVN24. Grzegorz Schetyna, leader of the biggest opposition party, Civic Platform, said on Sunday that “Poles have demonstrated through great mobilization and high turnout that they want to defend the independence of institutions, the independence of local governments.” “I’m convinced that next year, in the European election, Poles will also defend Poland’s place in Europe, and then, in the national election, they will defend our democracy,” he told his supporters.",The New York Times
2018,Poland’s Leaders March With Far-Right Groups on Independence Day,"WARSAW — It was meant to foster unity and celebrate the sacrifices of past generations in the creation of the modern Polish nation. But after days of wrangling and controversy, the country’s Independence Day celebration on Sunday ended up highlighting Poland’s deep divisions. President Andrzej Duda and senior members of the government walked at the front of a state-sponsored procession through the streets of Warsaw behind a huge red-and-white Polish flag with an inscription “For you, Poland.” And Mr. Duda told the crowd that “this march should unite all Poles,” adding, “Let this march be for everyone.” But hundreds of yards behind the officials from the governing Law and Justice Party were far-right activists known for promoting racist, homophobic and supremacist slogans. Wreathed in an eerie red mist from burning flares, thousands of nationalists chanted: “Use a sickle, use a hammer, smash the Red rabble.” Some shouted: “White Poland.” They marched holding a banner with the slogan “God, Honor, Fatherland” and thousands of Polish flags. But some wore balaclavas and waved the green flags of the ultranationalist group National Revival of Poland. Also visible were the flags of Forza Nuova, an Italian neofascist group. No members of the opposition or leading public figures who are not close to the government attended the event, which the police said attracted 250,000 people, and which critics said was a surrendering of Independence Day to radical groups. The procession — one of scores of events across Europe to mark the 100 years since the end of World War I — followed days of legal turmoil after the mayor of Warsaw banned the Independence March organized every year by far-right groups. Among them are the National Radical Camp, which human rights activists have for years said should be made illegal. The march, which in previous years involved violent clashes with the police, made international headlines last year when demonstrators chanted, “Pure Poland, white Poland,” and “Refugees, get out!” and a small group of hard-liners carried banners with the slogan “White Europe of brotherly nations.” The organizers challenged the mayor’s ban, and a Warsaw court eventually sided with them, calling the decision “preventive censorship.” Before that ruling was handed down, however, officials decided to hold a state procession in place of the Independence March, prompting more anger from nationalists. The far-right groups and government eventually agreed to walk together in one procession divided into two parts — one for the officials, and one for the nationalists. Despite earlier concerns, Sunday’s march was a peaceful affair. But Andrzej Rychard, a sociologist at the Polish Academy of Science, called it a “bad sign.” The nationalist government, he said, now finds itself trapped by the radical groups after years of “flirting with them.” “As a citizen, I’m indignant that the authorities were incapable of forcing the nationalists to give up their own banners and stick to Polish flags only,” Mr. Rychard said. “I also don’t understand how it happened that the nationalists, who are politically irrelevant, have become an equal partner for the government.” The increasingly euroskeptic governing party, which has fallen out with the European Union over the party’s attempts to take control of Poland’s independent judiciary, became the first member of the bloc to set off a process that could see the country lose its voting rights. Political divisions also marred the official ceremony earlier on Sunday at Warsaw’s Pilsudski Square, named after Gen. Jozef Pilsudski, one of the fathers of Poland’s independence. The top delegation at the event was led by President Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the head of Law and Justice, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. But Donald Tusk — the president of the European Council, a former prime minister and a fierce opponent of the government — stood at the back, barely visible, seemingly distancing himself from the politicians from the conservative governing party. “I know that we often argue about the shape of our country. I know that sometimes we do it too intensely,” Mr. Tusk said as he addressed the crowd. “Forgive us, Poland.” Krystyna Skarzynska, a professor of psychology at Warsaw University, said the dynamic of the ceremony reflected “pettiness and hypocrisy” in the leading politicians’ remarks. “They’ve been talking us to death about this need for unity, but they didn’t even welcome Donald Tusk during the ceremony,” she said in an interview. “They didn’t mention Lech Walesa, who had played a great role in Poland’s independence, either.” Mr. Walesa, a former president and the iconic leader of the Solidarity social movement, has for years been a fervent critic of the Law and Justice Party and refused to celebrate the anniversary with the government.",The New York Times
2018,Police Chief Who Led Weinstein Investigation Ousted in Shake-Up,"The police commander who led the effort to arrest Harvey Weinstein has been ousted from his longtime position as the head of the Police Department’s special victims division in a major shake-up that comes as the department’s handling of sex crimes is facing increased scrutiny and criticism. The chief of detectives announced the change in leadership on Friday afternoon. The division’s reputation was tarnished when it came to light in court that one of its detectives made serious errors that compromised the sexual-assault investigation of Mr. Weinstein, the movie producer. In addition, a city watchdog agency found in March that the unit had far too few detectives to handle the city’s sexual assault cases. The decision to transfer the division’s commander, Deputy Chief Michael Osgood, to a new post as head of patrol operations in Staten Island was months in the making. The police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, promised a “top-to-bottom scrub” of the unit back in April after a report by the city’s Department of Investigation found the special victims division was severely understaffed. Chief Osgood, a highly respected manager within the department, had won praise from advocates in his eight years at the helm of the division. But he had also pushed his superiors hard for more resources, and his warnings over the last four years about the state of the city’s sex crimes unit were made public in the investigation department’s report. The report included memos from Chief Osgood pleading with senior police officials for more detectives and pointing out there was a large backlog of 1,400 unsolved crimes for which there is genetic evidence. “They are sitting dormant,” he wrote. “The backlog continues to increase.” According to the report, the division had so few staff by 2011 that the senior police officials instructed the unit to “simply not investigate all misdemeanor sexual assaults.” From 2009 to 2017, detectives investigating adult sex crimes saw their caseloads rise by 65 percent, but staffing levels remained unchanged, at about 74. Since the report was issued, the Police Department has steadily added detectives to the division. The number of investigators handling adult reports of sexual assault is up to 118, though it is still 30 short of what the report recommended. At a news conference, the chief of detectives, Dermot F. Shea, denied the transfer of Chief Osgood had something to do with his requests for additional manpower. “Mike Osgood should be commended — he raised the bar significantly,” Chief Shea said. “This is not a punishment.” Chief Shea said he was appointing Deputy Chief Judith Harrison to take over the division. She will be the first woman and the first black person to hold that position. “We have a new set of eyes and a fresh perspective,” Chief Shea said. Chief Shea also said the division will be split into two commands, one dealing with adult sexual abuse and a second investigating child abuse. He said he was removing hate crimes from the division’s portfolio, moving the Hate Crimes Task Force, which has been in the spotlight in recent weeks following a surge in anti-Semitic incidents, under the Special Investigations Division, which also houses the cybercrime and major crime units, he said. Chief Harrison said, “In every assignment I’ve had, I’ve tried to make sure to place the victim first.” She said she had yet to speak to Chief Osgood, who has run the division since 2010. Councilmember Donovan Richards, the chair of the public safety committee, said he had “mixed feelings” about the shake-up. He called Chief Osgood’s removal “bittersweet” and commended him for bringing greater attention to sexual assault victims years before the rise of the #MeToo movement. Still, he said, Chief Harrison “is a stellar public servant, and is someone that is largely admired in the N.Y.P.D.” Other city lawmakers said it appeared Chief Osgood had been ousted in retaliation for his role in the investigation department’s report. “I think it was incredibly courageous of Chief Osgood to speak up about the lack of resources at the Special Victims Division and what impact that was having on victims of sexual violence, and he paid the price,” said Councilmember Helen Rosenthal, who chairs the committee on women. Mary Haviland, the executive director of the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault, said she was “deeply disturbed” at the news of the reorganization. She said Chief Osgood had built a good relationship with advocates for sex-crime victims and had overhauled training for investigators to improve their interview techniques. “I feel that they’re transferring out an enormous amount of experience that’s been gathered the last eight years, and I think it’s very unfortunate,” Ms. Haviland said. “It’s hard for me to understand why you would want to transfer out someone like that who’s performed that way in that job.”",The New York Times
2018,"Police Find 50 Guns, Nazi Propaganda and 200 Doves at Man’s Home","At weddings and funerals out in the world, he released doves, a universal symbol of peace and love. At home, the police say, he kept something quite different under lock and key: an arsenal of guns and Nazi propaganda. The police in Laguna Beach, Calif., say they made the discovery at the home of Mitchell Todd, 51, who was arrested on suspicion of making a criminal threat after officers received a complaint that he had threatened a man who hired him to release doves at the funeral for the man’s son. When the police arrived at Mr. Todd’s home in Huntington Beach, they discovered a cache of more than 50 firearms as well as Nazi propaganda and several pounds of ammunition, according to the authorities. It was not clear whether Mr. Todd had been formally charged. The police did not return calls seeking comment. Fox 11 reported that he was to be taken to the Santa Ana Jail on Wednesday. “This is definitely an amount of weaponry that is not for personal use,” Sgt. Jim Cota, a spokesman for the Laguna Beach Police Department, told Fox 11. “We’re trying to figure out why one person would have in excess of 50 guns.” Sergeant Cota said that the suspect had threatened the man whose son had died over a payment dispute, using “words to the effect of, ‘Maybe you need to go be with your son.’” The sergeant added, “You could tell the voice mail messages and text messages became more and more threatening.” Mr. Todd also left a voice mail message in which investigators could hear the releasing of a handgun slide, according to Sergeant Cota. “At that point we knew we were dealing with somebody who’s got the potential of extreme violence,” he said. The discovery of the Nazi propaganda has prompted the authorities to look into whether Mr. Todd had any involvement with hate groups, Sergeant Cota said. The police also found 200 white doves in cages on Mr. Todd’s property. The birds looked calm and some fluttered around in a three-second video clip that the authorities posted on Twitter. The police said that the birds appeared to be well-cared-for and that a family member of Mr. Todd’s would take care of them. On OCDoves.com, a website for a dove business that appears to be Mr. Todd’s, a six-paragraph payment policy stipulates: “The retainer is to be paid in full before event. We do not hold the day or time unless service is paid” in full. The website promotes its doves as truly all white and superior to those provided by other dove services. “If your looking for a cheap homeless looking bum that smells and dresses poorly, missing teeth & shows up late,” the website says, “other white dove services might be a fit for you.”",The New York Times
2018,Police Report in Killing of Black Security Guard Is Criticized as Rushed,"The Illinois State Police took steps on Tuesday to defend the actions of a suburban Chicago police officer who killed an armed security guard on Sunday, claiming that the guard was not wearing a uniform and ignored verbal commands to drop his weapon. But witnesses have contradicted that account, and it was not clear how the State Police reached its conclusions. The findings by the state’s Public Integrity Task Force, the lead agency in the case, were based on a preliminary investigation into the killing of the guard, Jemel Roberson, 26, who was responding to a shooting at a bar. But a lawyer for his family disputed the state’s account and criticized the agency for rushing to judgment just days after the deadly encounter. “We are three days into this and they are saying preliminarily that it was a good shoot?” the lawyer, Greg Kulis, said in an interview on Wednesday. “They traditionally take nine months or longer.” The killing of Mr. Roberson has ignited protests and demands for justice, just a month after a Chicago police officer was found guilty of second-degree murder in the high-profile killing of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager who was shot 16 times by an officer in 2014. Protesters have pointed out that Mr. Roberson, who was black, was killed even though he was a “good guy with a gun,” the type of person put forth by the National Rifle Association and President Trump as a solution to mass shootings. The shooting on Sunday morning occurred while Mr. Roberson was chasing after a gunman who had opened fire inside the bar, Manny’s Luxury Lounge in Robbins, Ill. The man had struck four people inside, and Mr. Roberson was trying to detain him when the police arrived. A white officer with the Midlothian Police Department encountered Mr. Roberson in a parking lot outside the bar, and according to the State Police, gave “multiple verbal commands” for Mr. Roberson to drop his weapon. The officer then opened fire on Mr. Roberson, the State Police said. On Tuesday, Chief Daniel Delaney of the Midlothian Police Department said he was “completely saddened by this tragic incident.” “What we have learned is Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation,” Chief Delaney wrote on Facebook. “There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.” The man suspected of opening fire inside the bar was being treated on Wednesday in a hospital, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said. He has not yet been charged. Mr. Roberson, who lived in Chicago, had hoped to become a police officer, Mr. Kulis said. Other security guards at the bar encouraged him to stay home on Saturday night because he had an early engagement the next morning, playing the organ at his church. But Mr. Roberson kept his promise and showed up at work. His mother, Beatrice Roberson, has declined all news media requests for interviews, Mr. Kulis said. In the days after the shooting, Mr. Kulis filed a federal lawsuit against the Midlothian officer, whose name has not been made public, on Ms. Roberson’s behalf. He also filed a request in court for the Midlothian Police Department, along with the other agencies that responded to the scene, to preserve all evidence in the case. And on Wednesday, Mr. Kulis said he planned to subpoena the State Police for the information it used to reach its preliminary conclusions. “It’s really bizarre that their preliminary statement is that arguably the shooting was justified,” Mr. Kulis said. Mr. Kulis said he located several witnesses whose accounts contradicted the State Police’s findings. They told him that Mr. Roberson was wearing a black ski cap with the word “Security” across the front, Mr. Kulis said. One witness also said that he screamed at the officer not to shoot Mr. Roberson. “He was yelling, ‘He’s security, he’s security, he’s security,’” Mr. Kulis said. None of those witnesses have been interviewed by the State Police, Mr. Kulis said. “I don’t know what they are relying on,” Mr. Kulis said.",The New York Times
2018,Police Thought Cotton Candy Was Meth. She Spent 3 Months in Jail for Their Mistake.,"A Georgia woman spent more than three months in jail on drug charges after sheriff’s deputies mistook congealed cotton candy they found in a car she was riding in for methamphetamine. A state crime lab eventually showed that they were wrong. Now, she’s suing. In the lawsuit, filed this month, Dasha Fincher alleges that she was wrongfully arrested and incarcerated in December 2016, when she and her boyfriend were pulled over by Monroe County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies found a blue, crystal-like substance in a bag on a floorboard in the car and evaluated it using a roadside test kit, which seemed to confirm that it was methamphetamine. Ms. Fincher said it was most likely two-day-old cotton candy discarded by the children of her friend, from whom she had borrowed the car. The next thing Ms. Fincher remembers, she was in handcuffs. “I knew it was cotton candy, and for him to come back and say it was meth, I really didn’t know what to say,” she said in an interview on Wednesday. “I kept thinking, ‘This is crazy, I’ll get out tomorrow.’ Then when I wasn’t out by Sunday, I said, ‘It’s a holiday weekend, I’ll be home Monday.’ Then every day turned into ‘I’ll be out tomorrow.’” Ms. Fincher joins a number of others who have claimed wrongful arrests after innocuous objects have tested positive for drugs — a list that includes chocolate chip cookies, tortilla dough and breath mints, according to The Washington Post. A 2016 investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times found that field test kits — the kind officers use during traffic stops — are often unreliable, yet many prosecutors accept guilty pleas based solely on evidence from the kits. Ms. Fincher is suing the Monroe County Board of Commissioners, three deputies and the manufacturer of the roadside drug test, Sirchie. Monroe County and its sheriff’s office both referred questions to a lawyer, Benjamin A. Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Sirchie also did not respond to questions on Wednesday. “It was crystal-like substances, it was in a cellophane bag, and it was under the floor mat,” said Elizabeth Bobbitt, the interim district attorney for the Towaliga Judicial Circuit, which includes Monroe County, adding that the circumstances suggested that what the deputies found were drugs and not cotton candy. “We are not crazy people down here who would like to arrest people for cotton candy.” Ms. Bobbitt said that she was aware of the reports of the false positives from the field tests, but that her office relies on law enforcement agencies to establish probable cause for an arrest. “We just deal with what comes to us,” she said. It was Dec. 31, 2016, when Ms. Fincher and her boyfriend set out to run a few errands, she said, including picking up a pawn ticket for a friend and antiques from Ms. Fincher’s aunt. They were heading to the friend’s neighborhood near Forsyth when they were pulled over by two deputies who saw a car with “very dark window tint,” according to the incident report. The deputies checked both Ms. Fincher’s and her boyfriend’s driver’s licenses, which were both suspended, and asked to search the car, which Ms. Fincher agreed to. In the report, one of the deputies said that Ms. Fincher and her boyfriend were “nervous” and that they “started to shake” when he asked them to step out of the car. Ms. Fincher disputes both claims. Then, a deputy pulled out the plastic bag with the blue substance in it, put it on the hood of his car and tested it, Ms. Fincher said. “He just said, ‘Could you all tell me why this has tested positive for methamphetamines?’” Ms. Fincher said. “We were like, ‘It shouldn’t be, it’s just cotton candy.’” She was arrested around 7 p.m. on New Year’s Eve and taken to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office Jail, where she was held until April of last year. She said she told jailers, inmates and deputies that she had been wrongfully arrested. She could not afford the $1 million bail that was set. While she was in jail, Ms. Fincher missed the birth of her grandsons and hurt her hand when she punched a concrete wall in frustration, she said. Nobody believed her story, Ms. Fincher said. She also said that while she was behind bars, her daughter had a miscarriage. “It seemed like everything was going on and I wasn’t there,” she said. “I wasn’t there for my family when they needed me.” On March 22, a state crime lab found that there was no methamphetamine in the bag, vindicating Ms. Fincher, according to the lawsuit. For reasons that are not clear, Ms. Fincher was held in jail until she was released on April 4, according to the lawsuit. On April 18, the charges were dropped. Ms. Bobbitt, the interim district attorney, said her office did not receive the crime lab report until April 3. She said that from March 22 to March 29, the report was being vetted and finalized, and she did not know why there was a delay between March 29 and when her office received it. Ms. Fincher said she was not represented by a lawyer for much of her time in jail, and eventually a public defender took the case. The public defender’s office did not respond to requests for comment. But the arrest is still on her record, Ms. Fincher said. “It’s made me not trust law enforcement,” she said. “I’ve never really had a problem with that. I get kind of, like, paranoid-scared, like butterflies in my stomach, when a police officer gets behind. I’ve never been like that.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Politics Isn’t Pretty. But Politicians Are. ,"And now for a shallow — but honest — take on the midterms. Opinion Columnist At a Beto O’Rourke rally near Dallas shortly before the midterms, Sonia Qutob, 41, turned to her friend and asked what was clearly the most pressing question about the candidate. “Do you think,” she said, “that he needs a second wife?” O’Rourke seems to me plenty happy with the first. But a fangirl can dream. And I got the sense that many fangirls and no small number of fanboys did precisely that. At the rally immediately preceding the one where Qutob swooned, dozens of them mobbed O’Rourke and clamored for selfies. The passions that animated them were clearly more than political. Before we leave the midterms too far behind and exhaust our fine-grained analysis of the electorate’s every cough and sputter, let’s take a moment to be shallow, which is to say honest. O’Rourke and Andrew Gillum soared to fame and impressive vote totals in, respectively, Texas and Florida because they were eloquent, energetic and empathetic counterpoints to their Republican rivals and to Donald Trump. Also, they’re hunks. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York became the youngest woman ever elected to the House on the strength of her story, the purity of her vision and the smarts of her strategy. But her celebrity isn’t hindered by her gorgeousness. She has nearly 825,000 followers on Instagram — more, Politico recently noted, than Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan combined. I asked O’Rourke how many of his supporters probably had a crush on him. Before he could answer, his spokesman, Chris Evans, chimed in: “They have a crush on Texas.” Give that young man a raise. And keep him close by for any future endeavors. There’s obviously ample room in politics for people of all strata of comeliness, as any gallery of presidential portraits or group photo of members of Congress shows. Capricious and baffling as Americans can be, they do seem to prioritize other qualities above looks, and pulchritude is in the eye of the voter. But many candidates’ personas are inseparable from their looks, whether those looks cast them as bookish, nurturing, approachable or, yes, hot. And in politics, as in much else, hot helps. “From a very early age, we’re drawn to more attractive faces — even babies prefer that,” Deborah Rhode, a Stanford University law professor, told me. She’s the author of “The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law.” It explains that better-looking defendants fare better with juries. But the advantages of attractiveness aren’t confined to any one situation or goal, she noted. They’re cumulative. “Teachers give less attention to less attractive children,” Rhode said. “Children ascribe intelligence to good-looking individuals and prefer them as friends.” So good-looking people wind up with more encouragement, broader social networks and more confidence, all of which beget success. “Attractiveness sets off a chain of consequences,” she added. Rhode mentioned John F. Kennedy as a prime example from the past of a politician assisted by his appearance. She mentioned Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, as an example from the present. She might as easily have mentioned President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and the viral photos of him and Trudeau jogging together at a summit meeting in Ottawa two years ago. O’Rourke, also a runner, would have fit in. “He’s athletic-looking,” said Nancy Etcoff, an evolutionary psychologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School and wrote a book titled “Survival of the Prettiest.” “He’s tall, and taller candidates almost always win.” I spoke with Etcoff before Election Day, when O’Rourke of course lost his Senate race to the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. That defeat was mostly about Republicans’ dominance in Texas, which eclipsed O’Rourke’s advantages, including the physical ones. “He’s a handsome guy,” Etcoff said. “He has a nice facial expression. Ted Cruz looks different from that.” Meaning? “I will not go further! I will not go further! This is The New York Times, after all.” Etcoff’s research suggests that people read such positive characteristics as competence, trustworthiness and vigor into someone’s attractiveness, and she told me that this might have special political relevance in our present age of saturation imagery. She said that there was almost certainly more forgiveness in the days of Abraham Lincoln, who, she noted, “considered himself homely.” According to one widely circulated but apocryphal story about the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Stephen Douglas accused him of being two-faced, and he responded, “If I had two faces, would I be wearing this one?” Etcoff asked: “Would he be elected now? I would hope the answer is yes. But it’s a real question.” So is whether there’s such a thing as too attractive, at least for women. If you’re a dazzler, Rhode said, “You have more difficulty being taken seriously.” Ocasio-Cortez has already felt the sting of this. When it comes to looks, as to so much else, women in politics are asked to thread a needle. They mustn’t ignore their appearance. But they also mustn’t flaunt it. Just imagine the reaction if Kirsten Gillibrand or Kamala Harris, two Democratic senators eyeing 2020 presidential bids, let herself be photographed in poses analogous to the biceps-forward, brawny-beefcake shots that Martin O’Malley, a Democratic candidate in 2016, and Paul Ryan allowed. Men get into trouble mainly if their physical vanity becomes much too obvious, as President Emmanuel Macron of France learned when he was mocked for spending $30,000 on makeup during his first three months in office and as John Edwards discovered in the aghast response to his $400 haircuts during his 2008 presidential campaign. O’Rourke sidestepped that problem by leaning into the Texas heat and sweating copiously through his shirts, so much so that it yielded a subgenre of journalism about his perspiration. He was a proud human sponge. But here’s the thing: Can you get away with being that soggy if you aren’t that pretty?",The New York Times
2018,Pompeo Faces a World of Challenges. Add House Democrats to the List.,"WASHINGTON — In May, just weeks after becoming secretary of state, Mike Pompeo returned to Capitol Hill for defiant and surprisingly heated exchanges about diplomacy with his former Democratic colleagues. “I’ll take a back seat to no one with respect to caring about and protecting the people,” he said of diplomatic security in one blistering answer during a hearing in the House, where he had served for six years as a Republican congressman from Kansas. Before the Senate, he dismissed another question from a Democrat as “bizarre” and “outrageous.” At the time, Mr. Pompeo could afford to dismiss minority Democrats who had little to no sway over the State Department. That will change in January, when Democrats will take over the House and have subpoena and budgetary powers on the Foreign Affairs and Appropriations Committees — both of which serve as a check on the State Department. Even in the Senate, where Republicans retain control, Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee can continue to hold up nominations at the State Department, which is struggling to fill its ambassador ranks and other senior diplomatic posts. “I hope we can work collaboratively to get the answers the American people are seeking,” Representative Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat who is in line to be the next House Foreign Affairs chairman, said in a statement. Mr. Engel said he intended “to make sure our diplomats can do their work free from partisan abuse.” The newly treacherous political environment comes as Mr. Pompeo’s honeymoon as the nation’s chief diplomat has ended within the State Department, and the administration’s foreign policy strategies are under strain around the world. President Trump has made clear he supports Mr. Pompeo’s approach. “Mike Pompeo has fit in so beautifully. He’s done an incredible job,” Mr. Trump said in a postelection news conference on Wednesday. Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said they intended to launch a stream of investigations once they were in control. They want to look at whether Mr. Trump’s international business interests have affected American foreign policy; what was said at the July summit meeting in Helsinki between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; and if State Department political appointees have used loyalty tests to screen career diplomats for choice assignments. Probing the administration’s strategies in Yemen, Afghanistan and North Korea are also priorities for Democrats, who said Mr. Pompeo and his aides had done little to answer their queries — a complaint that even Republicans quietly echo. In one example, Mr. Pompeo promised during his testimony in May to expeditiously appoint envoys to monitor anti-Semitism and L.G.B.T. rights. “You have my word we’ll move on them,” he said. The appointments are still pending. In the Senate, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is expected to be Senator Jim Risch, a little-known Idaho Republican who aligns closely with Mr. Pompeo’s traditional anti-Russia, anti-Iran conservatism. But in dealings with North Korea, Mr. Risch has quietly secured assurances that a senatorial observer be included in negotiations heading toward a treaty — ensuring a check on the sensitive talks. Beyond Washington, Mr. Pompeo’s challenges have also been mounting. A canceled meeting in New York last week between Mr. Pompeo and North Korea’s leading nuclear weapons negotiator was the latest sign that the talks are at an impasse, even as Pyongyang adds to its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals. Mr. Trump’s troop surge to resolve the 17-year war in Afghanistan appears headed for defeat or retreat. The administration’s long-gestating peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians faces severe hurdles, and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has solidified his hold over his shattered country. Venezuela continues to slide into anarchy, relations with Russia are worsening, governments in Pakistan, Turkey and across Eastern Europe are increasingly anti-democratic, and China’s influence in Latin America, Africa, South Asia and elsewhere continues to blossom. Also troubling, once reliable allies are edging away from the United States — or becoming liabilities. President Emmanuel Macron of France called last week for the creation of a European army amid a fraying NATO alliance with the United States. Tokyo and Seoul have both launched charm offensives with Beijing to hedge against an unpredictable Washington. And Saudi Arabia’s lethal tactics in Turkey and Yemen have made it an object of international opprobrium. Mr. Pompeo may have just days to rehabilitate Saudi Arabia’s reputation before Congress considers serious penalties against Riyadh. Mr. Pompeo’s call late last month for a cease-fire in Yemen, where a humanitarian disaster is intensifying, has so far been ignored. And then there is Iran. Early this month, Mr. Pompeo announced the re-imposition of the last set of sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord. Anti-Iran hawks who had eagerly awaited the moment complained that the administration did not go far enough, and it remained unclear if the rest of the world would heed the United States’ demands to reject Iranian exports. Mr. Pompeo’s handling of these myriad challenges has gotten mixed reviews in an administration dominated by a mercurial president whose blistering tweets overshadow, and often undermine, what the State Department seeks to accomplish. The primary tools Mr. Trump has employed to shape world events are tariffs and sanctions, but Mr. Pompeo has control over neither. Negotiations over North Korea, Afghanistan and Syria are among the foreign policy priorities that Mr. Pompeo leads, but so far with few successes to show. Morale at the State Department has recovered since the tenure of Rex W. Tillerson, the former secretary of state — but just barely. “Most career diplomats are proud idealists who want to advance America’s interests by making the world a better place,” said Nancy McEldowney, a former ambassador who retired last year after a 30-year career as a Foreign Service officer. “Many of them are deeply ashamed of the bullying, transactional and in many cases amoral policies of this administration.” Mr. Pompeo is widely seen as close to the president. But the president gave his chief diplomat an impossible task when he sent Mr. Pompeo to confront Riyadh in the wake of last month’s killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident, in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Pictures of Mr. Pompeo smiling and laughing with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia drew widespread condemnation and marked the lowest point of his State Department tenure. “The biggest challenge for him is that he has become Trump’s firefighter,” said James J. Carafano, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump’s presidential transition team. “Sending him to meet the Saudis and Turks accomplished nothing, and it wasn’t the right mission for him.” After months of relative quiet at Foggy Bottom, Mr. Pompeo began to emerge in recent weeks, giving a host of interviews in which he firmly stuck to administration talking points. “Securing our southern border, enforcing American sovereignty is an enormous national security issue,” Mr. Pompeo told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, on Nov. 2. “It’s why as secretary of state, I’ve been very involved in these discussions” about the migrant caravans moving through Mexico. But he has also held off-the-record talks at think tanks and academic centers, where he has been described as deeply knowledgeable and far from doctrinaire. In public, Mr. Pompeo expresses optimism about talks with Pyongyang. In private, he is far less sanguine, according to those who have spoken with him. Analysts see that divide as stemming from the fundamental difficulty of his job — managing a president whose pronouncements often diverge substantially from basic facts. As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump said talks with North Korea were “going fine.” Mr. Pompeo “reacts to the president’s momentary impulses but has no visible or articulated sense of priorities, sequencing or underlying strategy,” said Eliot A. Cohen, a military historian who worked for President George W. Bush. “But that’s probably not his fault.”",The New York Times
2018,Pompeo Meeting With North Korean Diplomat Postponed,"HONG KONG — A meeting in New York this week between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea’s leading nuclear weapons negotiator has been called off, the State Department said Wednesday. The meeting, which had been scheduled for Thursday, “will now take place at a later date,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a written statement. “We will reconvene when our respective schedules permit.” No reason was given for the decision, and the statement did not indicate which side requested it. The postponement of the meeting threw another wrench in Washington’s efforts to get North Korea to denuclearize. The State Department had said earlier that Mr. Pompeo planned to meet with Kim Yong-chol, North Korea’s former intelligence chief and top diplomat. They were expected to discuss the goals established at the June summit meeting in Singapore between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “including achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization” of North Korea, Ms. Nauert said. Mr. Pompeo traveled to North Korea last month and met with the North Korean leader, who said he would allow outside inspectors to visit a nuclear testing site the North said it had destroyed. The two men also discussed a potential second summit meeting with Mr. Trump. But the abrupt postponement of the Thursday meeting has raised questions about the potential for progress on negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang has said it wants a declaration of a formal end to the Korean War, which was only halted under an armistice. It has also called for an easing of sanctions in exchange for steps toward denuclearization. The United States, however, wants North Korea to provide a full accounting of its nuclear program as a start to the process, and has resisted any easing of sanctions. South Korean officials said that negotiations were moving ahead and cautioned against placing too much significance on the delayed meeting. “I don’t think the North Korea-U.S. talks have been canceled or dialogue has lost steam,” said Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Canceled meetings have been a regular feature of interactions between the United States and North Korea over the last year. But talks have thus far eventually proceeded after delays. Mr. Trump called off the summit meeting with Kim Jong-un in May, but then announced it was back on after he met in early June with Kim Yong-chol. The president also abruptly canceled Mr. Pompeo’s trip to North Korea in August, citing a lack of progress in talks. But Mr. Pompeo traveled to Pyongyang in October, his fourth trip in less than a year.",The New York Times
2018,"Pontius Pilate’s Name Is Found on 2,000-Year-Old Ring","The name of Pontius Pilate, the Roman official who ordered the killing of Jesus, according to the Gospel, is mentioned in thousands of sermons every year and is familiar to countless people, but little is known about his life and work. To the very short list of clues about Pilate as a historical figure, archaeologists have added one more: a 2,000-year-old copper alloy ring bearing his name. The ring was discovered in the late 1960s, one of thousands of artifacts found in the excavation of Herodium, an ancient fortress and palace south of Bethlehem, in the West Bank. But it was not until recently that researchers, analyzing those objects with advanced photography, were able to decipher the ring’s inscription. It reads “of Pilates,” in Greek letters set around a picture of a wine vessel known as a krater, and is said by archaeologists to be only the second artifact from his time ever found with his name. Kraters are a common image in artifacts of that time and place. The findings were published last week in the Israel Exploration Journal, an archaeological review in Israel. Pilate was the prefect, or governor, of the province of Judea, on the eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, roughly from A.D. 26 to 36. The report says it is unlikely that the ring belonged to Pilate, in part because such simple rings usually belonged to soldiers and lesser officials, not to someone as wealthy and powerful as a prefect. “We think it implausible that a prefect would have used a simple, all-metal, copper-alloy personal sealing ring with a motif that was already a well-known Jewish motif in Judea before and during his rule,” it says. “But in practice, we have a ring inscribed with the name Pilate and the personal connection just cries out,” Roi Porat, one of the authors of the report told The Times of Israel. The name Pilate was not common in the region at the time. The New Testament story of Pilate presenting a scourged Jesus to an angry crowd with the words “behold the man” — “ecce homo” in Latin — was a central theme of religious art for centuries. Beyond the Gospel, most of what little is known about Pilate comes from the surviving work of the ancient historians Flavius Josephus, a Jew, and Tacitus, a Roman. Herodium, where the ring was found, was built by Herod the Great, a client king of the Roman Empire, and is the site of his tomb. (One of his sons, also named Herod, was king in Jesus’ time.) The site is controlled by Israel and is claimed by Palestinians. The ring was found in a room filled with bits of glass, shards of pottery, arrowheads, coins and other items. The language of the ring’s inscription is Greek, which Roman officials used to communicate with the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean. It could have been used for official correspondence by Pilate himself and his officials who had to sign his name. The first archaeological find in Judea that mentioned Pilate was a fragment of carved stone, discovered in 1961, in the ancient port city of Caesarea. It is known as the Pilate stone and is kept at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. “It solved the problem of what actual title he had,” said Jonathan Price, professor of classics and ancient history at Tel Aviv University. According to Mr. Price, for historians of the Roman period, Pilate was just one of a string of Roman officials who were sent to Judea to govern and keep the peace. Were it not for his biblical role, “he would be remembered as a Roman official who didn’t do so well,” he said. During his decade-long tenure, which was longer than usual, Pilate displayed hostility to local residents and nearly provoked two uprisings. “He was called back and called to account for what seemed to be a lack of competence,” Mr. Price said. “And after that we don’t really hear about him.” A previous version of this article misstated the location of Judea. It was on the eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, not the western fringes.",The New York Times
2018,"Poor Disaster Oversight Imperiled Nursing Homes, Senate Report Finds","A Senate inquiry faulted state and federal oversight for fatal heat strokes and chaotic evacuations at nursing homes after last year’s hurricanes, calling for tougher disaster preparedness standards on Friday. Officials with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency that was a subject of the inquiry, have said they would clarify expectations for how nursing homes must maintain safe temperatures in emergencies. Officials added in an interview this week that they were actively seeking lessons from recent disasters. But they defended the agency’s new preparedness requirements for health care providers, which did not come under enforcement until just after last year’s hurricane season. The Senate’s report, released on Friday by the minority staff of the Finance Committee, comes weeks after several nursing homes in North Carolina and Florida flooded, lost power and required help evacuating after hurricanes. “Too many of them are not equipped to handle matters of basic safety in disasters,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in an interview. While the report noted that most nursing homes fared adequately after hurricanes in Florida and Texas last year, it concluded that tragic exceptions “resulted from inadequate regulation and oversight, ineffective planning and communications protocols, and questionable decision-making by facility administrators.” The more than 200 deaths at nursing homes and hospitals after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 led to a recognition that the nation’s health care system was unprepared for major disasters. That impression was reinforced after Hurricane Sandy struck New York City in 2012. More than 4,000 residents were rescued from nursing homes that flooded or lost power, and some of their families could not find them for weeks. Those events prompted the federal rule, completed in 2016, that mandated minimum standards in emergency preparedness for health care providers participating in Medicare or Medicaid. Officials said nearly a quarter of nursing homes surveyed under the new requirements have been cited for shortcomings, including failures to test emergency plans and train staff members. Nursing homes had to submit plans to correct the problems. “These are very thorough reviews,” said Kim Brandt, the agency’s principal deputy administrator for operations. The new rule requires nursing homes to work with local and state authorities and other community organizations to help safeguard residents in emergencies. But the Senate report argues that the regulations, which began development under the George W. Bush administration and were completed in the last days of the Obama White House, leave gaps that endanger lives. After they were questioned last year by the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare, agency officials said they would issue guidance to clarify “expectations for safeguarding temperature controls” during emergencies, including the use of portable generators. They have not yet done so. The Senate investigation was triggered by deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, which lost power to its air-conditioning chiller when Hurricane Irma struck Florida. A local medical examiner ruled that the heat-related deaths of a dozen residents were homicides. Many survivors also suffered from heat-related illnesses. Florida quickly moved to require nursing homes to have backup generators and enough fuel to maintain safe temperatures during power outages, but there are no similar national requirements. Prescribing generators “probably made a lot of sense for Florida, but it might not make a lot of sense for Montana,” said Dr. Kate Goodrich, chief medical officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, adding that other sources of energy could be more cost-effective and reliable. When the air-conditioning failed, the center in Hollywood Hills used spot coolers, which paradoxically increased the temperature through the improper venting of exhaust heat, according to expert testimony in a case that has been brought by Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration. Representatives of the home have defended its actions, saying it requested help restoring power from officials including Gov. Rick Scott. The state said the home should have evacuated residents when conditions became unsafe. The Senate report calls for federal, state and local officials to warn nursing homes about the dangers of incorrectly installed spot coolers, and recommends that officials work with utility companies to prioritize the homes for power restoration. Older and chronically ill adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat and cold. Nursing homes residents in Puerto Rico also suffered in the heat after Hurricane Maria last year. The report’s top recommendation is for the government to modernize its standards for “safe and comfortable” temperatures in nursing homes by accounting for research showing that the stressful effects of heat on the body are closely tied to the heat index, which adjusts for humidity. For nearly three decades, most long-term care facilities have been required to maintain a temperature range between 71 and 81 degrees. While outside temperatures were as low as 82 degrees in the hours before residents began dying at Hollywood Hills, the high humidity made it feel closer to 90 degrees outdoors, according to data presented in the Senate report. Medicare officials said the existing temperature range requirement had proved sufficient and applied in times of disaster, even though that is not stated explicitly in the emergency preparedness rule. “We’ve now had a few go-rounds of emergencies, and that seems to be an appropriate range based on our experience,” Ms. Brandt said. The Senate investigation noted a host of other problems. Licensing agencies received complaints about 38 skilled nursing facilities in Texas and 42 in Florida after last year’s storms. Nearly all the homes were inspected, and more than a quarter were found to be deficient or noncompliant with federal requirements. The investigators called for emergency plans to be informed by senior medical staff at nursing homes and reviewed and approved by knowledgeable regulators, a step not required in all states. Senior Care Centers, the owner of two nursing homes in Port Arthur, Tex., that flooded and required help evacuating last year, had plans that called for residents to be moved to other facilities owned by the company. But the other centers were much farther away than the 200 miles specified in its contract with an ambulance transportation company, according to the Senate report. Emergency plans also defined the meaning of a hurricane watch and warning incorrectly. The company, whose facilities received citations for substandard care from Texas health care regulators, did not respond to a message requesting comment. Nursing home administrators also need better guidance in making the difficult decision of whether to evacuate or shelter in place before a predicted hurricane or flood event, the report said. It recommended that regulators require that those decisions “be made by qualified personnel in a methodical way.” In a sign of the politically divisive times, the nursing home report was released by the Finance Committee’s minority staff, although the investigation began with letters to regulatory agencies that were signed by Mr. Wyden and the Republican committee chair, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and were sent at the request of Florida’s Republican and Democratic senators.",The New York Times
2018,Portmanfaux,"WORDPLAY Byron Walden and Joel Fagliano send us unpacking. SUNDAY PUZZLE — I had a great time solving this Walden/Fagliano confection after brunch Thursday morning, and for some reason remembered its title as “Fauxmanteau,” which made me chortle to think of out loud but was a ridiculous fabrication. Messrs. Walden and Fagliano have conspired against us before, although it’s been a while (this one from the summer of ’16 was a great challenge). Here’s hoping their brainiac bromance continues for years! The fill sparkled today. I loved the crossing of RBIS and RIBEYES (I had never made that connection); I liked the cluing for EPEE and ACAI; and some of the proper names were wonderfully evocative (OSCAR ARIAS, CORNETTI, RURITANIA). A couple of technicalisms slowed me down — IN AREA and BLUE PAPER — but they’re valid, so no complaints there or anywhere else in this grid. 20A: O.K., I’ve heard of mudpuppies, and hushpuppies, and catfish, but this is the first time I’ve seen a MUDCAT. The entry was in the puzzle once in 2011 and a few times in the 1960s. Is it any surprise it was also the title of a reality show on the National Geographic Channel? It aired when “noodling” was a fad, if you remember those halcyon days. Not that people aren’t still noodling; I’m sure as long as there are mudcats there will be noodlers. 15D: Another portmanteau alert: Twisting and jerking, both things you can do on the dance floor, can combine to the peculiar groove known as TWERKING, which is related to “can-can” dancing when you use a colloquial definition of “can.” (Some disagree with the above etymology of “twerk;” in these cases, I use the word to refer to the tough work I do every weekend looking this stuff up. Twerk!) 45D: We speak of milligrams pretty often, in medicine, vitamins and so on; a MICROGRAM is 1,000 times smaller. 64D: This is a fun entry that could have been clued with more difficulty — the “Asian fruits” element tipped me off to GOJI BERRIES pretty quick. I’d always thought of them as “superfoods” (like ACAI) and not ingredients in medicine, per se, but I’m pretty sure they’re not going to hurt you. 86D: Not only is this a debut, and a mental trigger for one of my favorite movies, but I do think GLOOP could be a portmanteau itself. It’s not cited as one, but it’s got that vibe, when you think of all the words that combine to something like this (glue + slop, maybe?). Anyhow, here’s Augustus Gloop. Apologies in advance if you want some fudge after this. You have certainly seen portmanteaux before — if you read the introduction above, you just read a few, in fact. The term “portmanteau” actually defines itself. In French, it’s a combination of “porter,” to carry, and “manteau,” a mantle (or cape), to refer to a large suitcase or traveling trunk. Linguistically, the term refers to all the marvelous words that are created by mishmashing two other words together — like an evangelist on television becomes a televangelist, or the awful air conditions on the West Coast combine smoke and fog to create noxious smog. Out here, winter is portmanteau season — we just got stuck in Snowvember, and snowpocalypse and snowmaggedon are coming. Hooray! There are new examples of portmanteaux all the time (I have been using “pregret” to refer to rich desserts and second glasses of wine for years). Today, our constructors are flipping the switch, and breaking down long-established examples of the genre into more fanciful ingredients that are all quite logical once solved, but oddball to say the least. Each entry — at 22A, 31A, 52A, 64A, 71A, 93A and 107A — consists of two ingredients in a portmanteau recipe, as well as the well-known little morsel that results from their being smashed together. The easiest one for me, which I also found amusing and adorable (amorable?), was 52A. “A late morning meal” defined the portmanteau word — BRUNCH, which we all know is the best of “breakfast” and “lunch” (eakfastlu is when you drink raw egg whites and take a cold shower). Where does “A TV family” fit in? Here’s the story: They’re talking BRADY BUNCH, which also, in a plot twist, “portmanteautifies” to brunch, making the answer BRADY BUNCH BRUNCH. The very first theme entry at 22A gave me pause for a little while, as I’d sort of forgotten about its punch line, a fashion article that once made some sartorial waves, I guess. As a cryptic clue, “Satchel for a homicide detective” solves quite respectably to MURDER CASE; if you portmanteau that, you’ll get the now ubiquitous “man purse,” or MURSE. In New York City, all these cute guys (metrosexuals, I think, another portmanteau) run around with little dogs in their murses. There’s another fashion item, a utensil, and a food that I can never think of without remembering what Paul Theroux once posited; there are also a couple of modern terms that are honestly hard to avoid. Mr. Walden: It’s always a blast constructing with Joel. It’s like playing HORSE with Michael Jordan. “Wow, that’s amazing. Wait, what, I have to match that?!” We probably could have made our task 10 times easier by cutting GREY POUPON GROUPON, but it was our favorite, so I’m very pleased we made it work. Mr. Fagliano: Byron and I have been working on this theme, on and off, since April 2016. We batted it around for a while over email, but it started to seem impossible to find enough good examples, never mind for them to work symmetrically. Still, after every fallow period over the intermittent two years, one of us would find another example and the thread would keep going. Definitely one of the most satisfying themes to finally put together, after all that work! Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. What did you think?",The New York Times
2018,"Portrait of a Marriage, Onstage and at the Barricades","The archive of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, now at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, traces more than 60 years in the theater, in the movies and at the front lines of social activism. In a 1995 joint profile in The New York Times, the actors and activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were described as being “without peer in an industry not known for nurturing black people, older people or long marriages.” Davis died in 2005, Dee nine years later. Now the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture has acquired the couple’s joint archive: more than 145 bankers boxes of photographs, letters, scripts and other material that document 60-plus years together on stage, screen and the front lines of social activism. The archive traces their rise from the African-American theater movement of the 1940s to Broadway (they were both in the original 1959 production of “A Raisin in the Sun”) and then to Hollywood, where they appeared together or separately in more than 50 movies, including Spike Lee’s “Do The Right Thing” and “Jungle Fever.” It also chronicles their role as stalwarts of the civil rights movement who navigated the sometimes contentious lines dividing different parts of the broader black freedom struggle. The couple were M.C.'s at the 1963 March on Washington, and Davis delivered a searing eulogy at Malcolm X’s funeral two years later. Kevin Young, the director of the Schomburg, said the archive traces a period of cultural history that saw the expansion of possibilities for African-American actors, driven in no small part by Dee and Davis themselves. “It’s quite a journey,” he said. “It’s one we take for granted, but it tells us a lot about the history of black expression, and popular entertainment in general.” Here is a sampling of items from the archive. Dee, who grew up in Harlem, got her professional start in 1940 at the American Negro Theater, an ensemble that performed in the building that houses the Schomburg Center. (Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte were also members.) Davis, who arrived in New York in 1939, first performed with the Rose McClendon Players, a company named for the pioneering African-American actress that worked out of the Harlem Library on 124th Street, 10 blocks downtown. But they only met when they were cast opposite each other in “Jeb,” a play by Robert Ardrey that opened on Broadway in 1946. Davis played an African-American World War II veteran who returns home to Louisiana only to have his ambitions thwarted by racism. Dee was his long-suffering sweetheart. The play — the third on Broadway that season, The Times noted in its review, dealing with “racial intolerance” — closed after only nine performances. But later that year, Dee and Davis joined “Anna Lucasta,” the first play on Broadway with an all-black cast that was not focused on racial themes. (The 1949 Hollywood film version featured an all-white cast.) Dee and Davis were married in December 1948, during their one day off from the plays they were appearing in. The archive includes more than 50 years of correspondence, much of it written when they were apart for work. “Precious Lover and Beloved,” Dee wrote in 1950. “Relaxation and contentment came to me after our talk last night. I was almost happy, and shortly after I went into the soundest sleep since our separation.” Some of Davis’s letters begin on a more irreverent note. “Hello sweetmeat,” one begins. “I got your letter this morning and wet my little panties with joy — so sweet of you to write little stinker.” Another opens with “Dear Beetle Bug.” Dee and Davis appeared in 11 plays together, including the landmark original 1959 production of Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun,” the first play by an African-American woman to run on Broadway. (Dee originated the role of Ruth Younger; Davis took over as her husband, Walter Younger, after Sidney Poitier left.) The archive includes Dee’s working script, showing many handwritten changes and notes. There are also clippings and other material relating to “integration showcases” organized that year by Actors Equity. These showcases, staged for agents and producers, featured scenes from classic plays with black and white actors — an early effort to promote what came to be called nontraditional casting. For Dee in particular, activism started early. As a teenager in New York City, she worked with a church group called the Interracial Youth Fellowship, sometimes designing programs like this one commemorating Negro History Week, the forerunner of Black History Month. The archive includes material relating to their defense of the Rosenbergs and of Paul Robeson, whose passport was revoked after he traveled to the Soviet Union. There are also letters and fliers about events they helped organize for the cultural wing of Local 1199, New York City’s hospital workers’ union. After the success of “A Raisin in the Sun,” their next appearance on Broadway came in 1961 with Davis’s own play, “Purlie Victorious.” A satire of white racism set in plantation country of the Old South, the play attracted one man not usually spotted at the theater: Malcolm X. “Black folks laughing at white folks was revolutionary — the highest kind of struggle he could imagine,” Davis later wrote, recalling Malcolm X’s reaction to the play (which became the basis for the 1970 musical “Purlie”). The archive includes 18 letters and postcards Malcolm X later sent to Davis and Dee, most sent during his trips to the Middle East and Africa in 1964, after he had broken with the Nation of Islam. There are terse postcards from Mecca and various African capitals, where he met with heads of state in order to gain support for a resolution condemning the mistreatment of African-Americans. Some of the longer missives mix politics with more tender concerns. “I’m beginning to miss my own family very much,” he wrote in a letter from Ethiopia, “but it is all part of the struggle.” There are also letters Davis got in response to the famous eulogy he delivered at Malcolm X’s funeral, hailing him as “our own shining black prince.” He later recreated the eulogy for a voice-over used at the end of Spike Lee’s 1992 film “Malcolm X.” Dee and Davis made their movie debuts together, in the 1950 Sidney Poitier racial melodrama “No Way Out.” Both were uncredited. By the 1970s, they were part of the emerging black independent film movement. The archive features photographs, scripts and other materials relating to six movies Davis wrote or directed, including “Cotton Comes to Harlem” (based on a novel by Chester Himes) and “Countdown at Kusini” (1976), a thriller set in a mythical African country moving toward independence, which also starred Dee. That film, shot in Nigeria, was funded by Delta Sigma Theta, an African-American women’s service organization, as part of an effort to produce movies about black life that countered the blaxploitation films flooding the market. It is credited as the first American feature shot entirely in Africa by black professionals. The movie had only a brief run, and all but disappeared. (The archive includes a rare copy.) But starting a decade and a half later, Dee and Davis became touchstones for and frequent collaborators with another independent filmmaker. In 1988, Spike Lee sent the couple the script for “Do the Right Thing,” along with a handwritten letter offering them the roles of Da Mayor and Mother Sister. “I’m STILL STRONG and more determined than ever,” he wrote, promising that the movie would be “better than ‘She’s Gotta Have It,’ better than ‘School Daze.’” Vincent Canby, writing in The Times, agreed, and described the couple as offering a kind of intergenerational benediction. “Miss Dee and Mr. Davis are not only figures within the film,” he wrote, “but, as themselves, they also seem to preside over it, as if ushering in a new era of black filmmaking.”",The New York Times

2018,Pound Slides as Brexit Turmoil Hits Britain Again,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Big declines in Britain’s currency, the pound, often have signaled wrenching changes for the country. Could this be the case again as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to win support for her plan to take Britain out of the European Union? The British pound on Thursday fell 2 percent against the dollar. That’s a large decline for a currency belonging to a developed economy and is the biggest one-day drop since the weeks after Britain’s vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. Though the pound is down 15 percent since that vote, it remains well above the lows it hit in January 2017, when it was becoming clear that Mrs. May’s government favored a more drastic separation from important economic arrangements with the European Union. The plunging pound has in some ways absorbed the fallout of the Brexit decision. The currency’s decline made British goods cheaper to foreign buyers, which supports the country’s exports. A weaker pound may also encourage foreigners to invest in Britain because acquisitions look cheaper. Buyouts of British companies are up nearly 150 percent this year. But there are real disadvantages to a weak currency. Foreign goods cost more in Britain, which pushes up inflation. There also is the possibility that a further slide in the pound prompts investors to dump British stocks and government bonds, leading to the sort of crisis of confidence that can slam the wider economy. The likelihood of such a rout increases if the process of Britain leaving the European Union becomes disorderly. Under the current schedule, Britain would exit in March. Earlier this week, the British government reached an agreement with the European Union on Britain’s withdrawal. [Read more about the crisis unfolding in Mrs. May’s government.] On Thursday, however, two cabinet ministers who oppose aspects of the deal resigned from Mrs. May’s government, and there are signs that Britain’s parliament may vote against the deal. What might happen next will depend on whether Mrs. May can somehow drum up support for the deal, whether her government stays in power, and whether there is support in Parliament for a different type of deal or a second Brexit referendum. The fact that the pound has not fallen back to its lows suggests investors do not believe Britain will leave the European Union without some sort of deal. But time is running out, so this could just be the start of things.",The New York Times
2018,Powell Says Fed Deserves Credit for Economic Growth,"DALLAS — Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Wednesday countered President Trump’s loud and repeated attacks on the Fed without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. Mr. Powell hammered on two simple themes during an hourlong question-and-answer session in front of several hundred people at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Fed is doing its job, he said, and the economy is doing really well. “I’m very happy about the state of the economy now,” Mr. Powell said. “There’s pretty good reason to think we’re going to continue in a positive vein like that.” He added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. “Our policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,” he said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed for raising interest rates too quickly, describing the central bank as “crazy,” “loco,” “going wild” and “out of control.” Asked about those attacks, Mr. Powell did not respond directly. Instead, he made a point of saying twice that Congress is the Fed’s overseer. “Our accountability is really to Congress,” he said, driving home the Fed’s independence from the executive branch. Independence from presidential criticism has long been a hallmark of the Fed’s existence, and a contributor to its ability to maintain monetary policy that aims to keep inflation stable and the economy running at maximum employment. He returned to the same theme later in the evening. “We have a very important job that Congress has assigned us and we have the tools to do it,” he said. “We’re just trying to do our jobs and we’re doing fine.” Mr. Powell answered questions posed by the Dallas Fed president, Robert S. Kaplan, and from members of the audience. Most of those who asked questions said they worked in financial services and asked about the economic outlook, the Fed’s plans and regulatory policy. Mr. Powell acknowledged signs that global growth might be slowing, but played down concerns about volatility in equity markets, describing stock prices as “one of many factors” the Fed evaluates in making policy decisions. He said the Fed was hearing a “rising chorus of concern” from businesses about the impact of the Trump administration’s trade restrictions. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and on a wide range of Chinese imports, and those actions have prompted retaliation by America’s trading partners on goods like metals, peanut butter and whiskey. Mr. Powell cautioned that the Fed still sees little evidence of a broad impact from the trade war in the economic data, but he said the concerns about protectionism made sense in theory. “If it winds up, perhaps inadvertently, in a place where we have more widespread protection, that would be bad for our economy,” he said. “To the extent that more and more products are subject to tariffs you could see a little bit higher inflation and a little bit slower growth.” He also said the Fed was well aware that the benefits of the economic recovery have not been distributed evenly and that there are pockets of America that have yet to rebound from the recession. “We know there are a lot of people around the edges who have not benefited yet from the recovery,” Mr. Powell said. “The best thing we can do is to try to sustain this expansion for as long as possible.” But he said there was a broad consensus among Fed officials that the central bank should keep raising its benchmark interest rate in the near term. The Fed raised the rate in September to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Investors expect an increase of one-quarter of a percentage point at the Fed’s next meeting, in December, although the recent volatility of financial markets has created a little uncertainty. Asset prices on Wednesday implied about a 73 percent chance of a December rate increase, according to the CME Group. The Fed also is expected to continue raising rates during the first half of 2019. “It wouldn’t be surprising to me that we would need to go up again in December and at least a couple of times next year,” Mary Daly, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday. Mr. Powell did not comment on the timing of future rate increases, but his upbeat economic outlook is consistent with expectations that the Fed will continue to raise rates. Mr. Powell has announced that he will hold news conferences after each of the Fed’s eight policymaking meetings next year, replacing the current pattern of quarterly news conferences. In recent years, the Fed has fallen into a pattern of announcing policy changes at meetings with a news conference. Mr. Powell said Wednesday that the Fed was reclaiming its ability to act at every meeting. “The market is going to have to get used to that,” he said. “Certainly all meetings are live now. There’s no question about it now. I think over time folks will get used to the idea that we can and will move at any meeting.” Asked for closing thoughts, Mr. Powell returned to his two themes. “I want to leave on a note of optimism about our economy,” he said. “We’ve been through a difficult time and we’ve faced difficult times before. We’re in a good place now. I do believe our economy can grow and grow faster.” And, he added, the Fed is doing a good job.",The New York Times

2018,Premier League Names Susanna Dinnage Its Next Chief Executive,"LONDON — Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, was named the next chief executive of the Premier League on Tuesday, a position that will make her one of the most prominent women in professional sports. Dinnage will replace the Premier League’s departing executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, who is stepping down by the end of the year after nearly two decades leading the organization. Scudamore’s job will be split in two in a new structure, the league said, with Dinnage as chief executive alongside a nonexecutive chairman. With Scudamore at the helm, the Premier League grew into a sporting goliath. It is by far the most popular domestic league in world soccer, generating global television rights income worth more than 3 billion pounds each season. The team of five people appointed by the league to hire Scudamore’s replacement had managed to keep their preference for Dinnage a secret until Tuesday, when they convened a special meeting of the league’s 20 teams to announce her as their preference. Dinnage, whose broad experience in broadcasting and digital media appealed to the Premier League’s search team, joins an industry where women in leadership positions continue to be the exception rather than the rule. The only other female leader of one of soccer’s top leagues is Nathalie Boy de la Tour, the president of France’s Ligue de Football Professionnel. FIFA, soccer’s governing body, appointed the former United Nations official Fatma Samoura as its secretary general in 2016. “We had a very strong field, but Susanna was the outstanding choice given her track record in managing complex businesses through transformation and digital disruption,” said Bruce Buck, the chairman of Chelsea F.C., who led the league’s nominations committee. Dinnage, who has been with Discovery for the past decade, most recently led Animal Planet, one of the company’s biggest channels. The Premier League has prospered since its inception in the early 1990s on the strength of record-breaking television contracts, and as the beneficiary of bidding competitions in which cable and satellite providers around the world repeatedly drove up the price to acquire the rights to broadcast its matches. Dinnage arrives at the Premier League amid a time of great change, however; with media consumption habits changing, she will be charged with figuring out a strategy to keep the money flowing as consumption of Premier League matches — in Britain, but also in places as far afield as Bangkok and Boston — increasingly shifts to online platforms. In two decades at the Premier League, Scudamore managed to keep the competition together amid rising tension between its richest teams — wealthy northern clubs like Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool, and the London powerhouses Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham — and the rest. The most powerful clubs’ battle for a greater slice of league revenue will most likely intensify in the coming years, as will new threats. This month, for example, leaked documents obtained by a consortium of European news media groups showed that some of the continent’s top teams, including Premier League giants like United and Liverpool, had been involved in discussions about a possible breakaway competition. Dinnage’s tasks will also include figuring out a way of keeping the Premier League, one of Britain’s biggest international success stories, prospering if the country follows through on plans to exit the European Union. British soccer leaders, like those from most other industries, have expressed great concern about the impact of Brexit on their operations, with particular concerns about player recruitment and television rights sales. Dinnage will not assume her new role until 2019, the league said, as her start date will depend on coming talks with Discovery. But Discovery’s president, J. B. Perrette, endorsed her for the new role. “She has been a fantastic teammate for all of us at Discovery and we are delighted that she has been given this unique and groundbreaking opportunity to lead one of the world’s pre-eminent sports organizations,” Perrette said in a statement released by the league.",The New York Times

2018,Preserving the Wealth That Conservation Built,"Economic View The Trump administration views conservation and the environment primarily through the lens of conflict — of business versus government. In this view, regulating pollution or setting aside public land means the private sector must be losing — and the administration says that must stop. So the administration favors looser rules on pollutants like mercury and pesticides. It has revoked the status of prominent national monuments to allow mining and drilling on the lands, and has tried to upend the Land and Water Conservation Act. For 53 years, the bipartisan conservation act supported more than 40,000 conservation projects including expanding national parks, wildlife refuges and migration corridors, historic battlefields and the like, funded by a small fee on offshore oil drillers. The administration first called for a 90 percent cut to its budget and in October, Republicans in Congress effectively killed it (or, more accurately, chose not to renew it). The problem with this kind of “zero-sum” thinking about business and the environment is that it is sometimes deeply incorrect. Sometimes, in fact, making rules more favorable to business can lead markets to fail and destroy private sector value, while cleaning up pollution or protecting public spaces can unlock value in the private sector and allow it to grow. A rather sparkly example of this comes from a building with the president’s name on it in my hometown — the Trump Hotel and Tower on the banks of the Chicago River. The tower is among the tallest buildings in America. On sunny days, the giant chrome T-R-U-M-P letters shine down on the bustling riverfront crowds below. It’s an extraordinary location where city and nature and public spaces all come together. On the water, architecture cruises, party boats and kayak tours weave around one another. On its banks, the River Walk has drawn millions of visitors and hatched a series of restaurants and shops, including the Apple Michigan Avenue store, and multiple high-end condo buildings. The Trump building includes condominiums listed for as much as $2.7 million (though these days many sellers prefer to label their listings as simply 401 N. Wabash). Yet for much of the 20th century, most people didn’t want to live anywhere near the river. Companies dumped all manner of unpleasant things in the water. It stank up the city and poisoned its residents. Environmental regulation and investment turned around the river. The cleanup was instrumental in making the neighborhood blossom and the economy boom. If Chicago had not been forced by the federal government to clean up the water beginning in the 1970s and continuing today — and had it not reserved open space and built the walk around it — the river would have remained an eyesore. There would be fewer tourists there, no Apple store, and certainly no luxury Trump Hotel and Tower. Billions of dollars of economic value would never have existed. Here, the public sector corrected a market failure. The individual companies dumping into the river were collectively ruining the neighborhood. When the government regulated their behavior, it ended up unlocking loads of private sector value. Though there are many examples of government regulations run amok, or of pointless public investments — and we should eliminate them — let us not forget the important situations where government can prevent market failures and unlock value. A recent study by David Albouy, Peter Christensen, and Ignacio Sarmiento-Barbieri, economists at the University of Illinois, was revealing. The researchers estimated the value of public parks to homeowners living near them using data on 600,000 homes sold in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. The study, “Unlocking Amenities: Estimating Public-Good Complementarity,” found that when the crime rate in a city neighborhood declined, the value of private real estate near parks soared. Investing in public safety paid dividends in the private market. Similarly, reduced pollution and more national parks can be immensely valuable, too. Closing a national monument to allow oil drilling — or terminating the Land and Water Conservation Fund — might help a company make more profit in the short run. But a vast array of benefits will also be destroyed. In a direct effect, hunters, kayakers, backpackers and visitors will simply stop going, and the Interior Department says these people spent $50 billion on recreation in federal lands last year. But think about the broader harm done by this zero-sum mentality. Accessible public lands and vibrant wildlife bring people to small towns and rural areas. They attract tourists and give residents a reason to stay, and give an enormous boost to the private sector in the very places the administration is trying to help. A shortsighted approach to public assets and the environment threatens to repeat at a national level the mistakes cities made when they industrialized waterfronts and spoiled what could have been the crown jewels of their landscapes. You would think that someone whose name is on a billion-dollar building on the banks of the Chicago River would understand that.",The New York Times
2018,President Trump Overlooks an Investment Opportunity in Climate Change,"Breakingviews Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Fighting climate change could be America’s new New Deal. The effects of global warming on virtually all aspects of American society could be devastating, according to a government report released on Friday. Rather than seize on its findings as a way to boost American innovation, economic output and jobs, President Trump’s administration pushed the report out late on Friday after Thanksgiving — and then played down its devastating findings. That’s a big missed opportunity. Unchecked, climate change could cut as much as a tenth off the nation’s gross domestic product by the end of the century, according to the authors of the 1,656-page assessment. That overall figure probably underestimates regional variances. The overall cost of the wildfires that hit California in 2017, for example, amounted to 6.5 percent of the state’s economic output, according to estimates by the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. Factor in everything from water scarcity to pollution to energy production to human health, and in some parts of the country the economic impact could be far worse. The cost in financial and human terms drops by up to 70 percent if greenhouse-gas emissions peak before the middle of the century and then drop, the report says. That requires investment, of course — which some Republicans, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, deride as being harmful to the economy. Fully decarbonizing the world’s cement, steel, plastics, trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could require investing some 0.5 percent of global G.D.P. a year using mostly existing technology, according to the Energy Transitions Commission. But it would bring efficiencies, employment and advances in technology that could more than offset the costs. Similarly, modernizing aging infrastructure has multiple benefits. Investing the $800 billion or so that is needed to upgrade America’s water systems could generate an almost 300 percent return, according to the U.S. Water Alliance — and generate 1.3 million jobs. Unlike when Franklin Roosevelt was seeking to revive the economy from the Great Depression, there’s now plenty of private capital looking to play a big role. That stretches from the fast-growing green-bond market, to public and private-equity investors jumping on the bandwagon, to innovative funding tools set up by nonprofit groups like the World Resources Institute and the Nature Conservancy. Plenty of American cities and states see the need to work with such players to tackle climate risk.

2018,President Trump to Visit California in Wake of Fires,"LOS ANGELES — President Trump plans to travel to California on Saturday to tour the damage and meet with those affected by the wildfires that have ravaged the state. He is expected to land at Beale Air Force Base and travel to Paradise, the town in Northern California that has been decimated by fire. The visit will come a week after he blamed state officials for the destructive blazes, erroneously attributing the cause of the fires to poor forest management and threatening to withhold financial payments to the state. But he has since praised the state’s efforts, praising the firefighters’ “incredible courage” and promising federal assistance. The president has visited the state just once since he was elected, preferring instead to attack its leaders and policies from a distance. “There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,” he wrote on Twitter last weekend, as firefighters were still battling back flames on both ends of the state. “Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” The statement drew a backlash from firefighters, experts and residents who were watching their homes being devoured by the infernos. Gov. Jerry Brown of California, who has frequently clashed with the president over climate change and other issues, forcefully responded to the attack by calling the fires the “new abnormal.” He added that those who deny human contribution to climate change are “definitely contributing to the tragedies that we are now witnessing and will continue to witness in the coming years.” Mr. Brown has called for a “major disaster declaration” from the White House. Mr. Trump responded on Tuesday, saying that the federal government was prepared to help and praised firefighters for doing an “incredible job” at fighting the wildfires. It is unclear just how the president will be received in the state where he is widely derided by public officials, including some from his own party. He is heading to a fairly remote part of the state, and away from heavily Democratic areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles where he is particularly unpopular. Throughout his presidency, the Trump administration has been in a kind of existential fight with California, battling over issues like the environment, recreational marijuana and immigration. In rallies before the midterm elections, the president and other Republicans used California as a rallying cry to point to liberal policies gone wrong. The Trump administration has also tried to withhold federal money over other issues, including California’s so-called sanctuary state status, which strictly limits how much local law enforcement works with immigration authorities. California has forcefully pushed back in part by filing dozens of lawsuits against the administration over land use, climate and immigration. And Gavin Newsom, the governor-elect, has been a vocal critic of the president and the administration’s policies.",The New York Times
2018,"President Trump, Saudi Arabia, Brexit: Your Friday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump stokes immigration fears, Venice grapples with rising waters and Finns observe “National Jealousy Day.” Here’s the latest: • A menacing speech in the White House. President Trump honed a fearmongering message on immigration, laden with falsehoods, ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. He laid out a vision of vast tent cities for undocumented immigrants, and said that the military troops he has ordered to the border would shoot any rock-throwers in a thousands-strong migrant caravan inching north through Mexico (two more are on the way as well). That shocked the military because, officials told us, doing so would violate its terms of engagement. Mr. Trump is chumming the waters for his base, while hoping that he won’t alienate suburban voters, who have already been abandoning Republicans in droves. Separately, emails show that during the 2016 presidential campaign, the political operative Roger Stone sold himself to Trump advisers as a potential conduit to WikiLeaks. The special counsel is investigating whether Mr. Stone knew in advance about email releases damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign or was merely hyping himself. _____ • Water, water everywhere. After receding on Wednesday, some of the highest floodwaters ever seen in Venice returned with a vengeance on Thursday. Tourists in rubber boots ate in flooded restaurants, or even frolicked in the streets, while locals agonized over the saltwater drenching of Venice’s private gardens and inestimable treasures, like St. Mark’s Basilica, above. Rising seas pose an existential threat to Venice, but planned floodgates have been unfinished for more than a decade. The full corrosive impact of the saturation will take time to show itself. _____ • The U.S. stands by the Saudi crown prince. The Trump administration has decided to back up Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 33, above, after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to officials familiar with the deliberations, having concluded that he’s almost certain to stay in power. But the U.S. is considering sanctions against the kingdom that would be limited enough to avoid a rupture with Prince Mohammed. In exchange, the White House is hoping to negotiate an end to the blockade of Qatar and the Saudi-led bombing of Yemen. Meanwhile, the Indonesian government protested Saudi Arabia’s execution, without notice, of an Indonesian citizen. The woman, a maid, was convicted seven years ago of murdering her Saudi employer; a rights group has said she was defending herself from sexual assault. _____ • Finland’s “National Jealousy Day.” Each Nov. 1, everyone’s taxable income is made public at precisely 8 a.m., and Finns start poring over the numbers. Above, journalists at a tax office in Helsinki on Thursday. Reporters look for fodder — Who might be circumventing taxes? How much did the country’s best-known pornographic film star make? — and ordinary people take stock of inequalities both nationally and in their workplaces. While there are some complaints about the invasion of privacy, many Finns told us that the ritual baring of incomes promotes egalitarianism, deters cheating and can make it easier to ask for a raise. _____ • The fate of liberal democracy. Strongmen are on the ascent around the world, in countries as different as Brazil and Hungary. Above, supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right Brazilian presidential candidate, celebrating his victory last month in Rio de Janeiro. He and other Brazilian leaders have vowed to kill criminals. Research suggests that their success may stem from weaknesses inherent to democracy itself, our columnist writes. In Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been seen by many as a dam against rising populism, but some experts told us that they saw her as one of its proximate causes, arguing that her insistence on austerity drove countries to extremes and the E.U. apart.

The Meiji Jingu Shrine, where Princess Ayako of Japan married her commoner beau earlier this week, is also a fitting symbol for Tokyo and its wonderful contradictions. While it appears ancient, the shrine, pictured above, is actually relatively new. It opened in the 1920s to commemorate Princess Ayako’s great-great-grandparents, Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. It was during their era that Japan opened up to the West. But Japan also embraced traditional culture by officially cultivating the distinctive Shinto religion. Today, Meiji Jingu is a forested refuge just steps away from Tokyo’s hipster shopping district Harajuku. And the shrine has become one of the city’s most desired locations for weddings. When this reporter’s good friend and college classmate got married there several years ago, guests gushed over her elaborate kimono and the beautiful red sake bowls and the priests and priestesses who made the ceremony oh-so-Japanese. She wasn’t alone. More couples are opting for this kind of traditional ceremony, according to local media reports. But then again, the white wedding kimono that she wore was in a style thought to have been adopted from Western wedding gowns. It goes to show the complex weaving together of old and new, of tradition and adopted tradition, in a city that’s constantly changing.

2018,"President of Spanish Soccer League Lashes Out at Rivals, and Partners","In a week when Europe’s top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain’s league took the opportunity to go on the attack. Emboldened by recent leaks of documents that implicate Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain in possible attempts to obscure their spending and establish cozy relationships with soccer regulators, the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, said in an interview that the two clubs — and others that flout soccer financial rules — should face punishments that he says are long overdue. “It was clear in the past that they were making dirty tricks; everything is crystal clear now,” Tebas said of City and P.S.G., three days after the surfacing of leaked documents that appeared to confirm his long-held complaints the clubs had manipulated financial control measures. Still, Tebas said it was not clear either club would face sanctions, in part because of a tangled web of financial relationships that City, P.S.G. and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, have with financial powers in the Middle East. The royal family of the United Arab Emirates owns Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, and the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari royal family owns both P.S.G. and beIN Sport, the network that has committed billions of dollars to televise the Champions League and other top competitions. That was why, Tebas said, UEFA has not acted to police violations. “There’s a conflict of interest,” he said. Manchester City, P.S.G. and UEFA all declined requests for comment on Tebas’s remarks. In other news reports, all three have described the recently leaked documents as malicious and have questioned their authenticity. European news organizations, led by Germany’s Der Spiegel, began publishing a cache of internal documents Friday. The documents, the publication of which has rattled executives at the highest levels of the game, also detailed plans for a potential breakaway league featuring the sport’s biggest teams — an effort that appears to be supported by Real Madrid’s billionaire president, Florentino Pérez. Under one version of the so-called super league plan, more than a dozen of Europe’s biggest teams would consider leaving their domestic competitions to play one another beginning in 2021. The clubs linked to the competition include two from La Liga (Real Madrid and Barcelona) but also Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Juventus — and Manchester City and P.S.G. Among the documents was a term sheet for a potential breakaway tournament produced by Key Capital Partners, the Madrid-based advisers to Real Madrid and Pérez’s construction company, A.C.S. “If these big European teams want to create a strategy to kill their own football fans, they can create a super league and they’ll succeed in killing these fans within 10 years,” Tebas said. Both P.S.G. and Manchester City have been sanctioned in the past over their spending, though UEFA has stopped short of handing down the harshest punishment — banning the teams from top competitions like the Champions League — though that fate has befallen other, less powerful institutions that breached the organization’s Financial Fair Play rules. Other clubs have complained about what they see as unfair treatment. “The FFP struggle is real for (some of us),” the Italian team AS Roma tweeted in response to the leaks. UEFA is once again reviewing P.S.G’s finances after its recent acquisitions of the Brazilian star Neymar and the French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappé; Neymar’s purchase more than doubled the world transfer record, and Mbappé’s move from Monaco made him the world’s second-costliest player. P.S.G. is trying to block a new UEFA review of those deals through an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Tebas’s charges of a conflict of interest were the most likely to drive a wedge between La Liga and beIN Sports, which owns the rights to Spanish soccer in multiple markets. But he dismissed any potential consequences for the league. “If they’re not willing to buy them we’ll go somewhere else to sell them,” Tebas said. “The stability of professional football in Europe can’t be bought by money.” UEFA’s financial task force will hold its first meeting since the leaks on Wednesday. Tebas said he was planning to file a complaint with Europe’s competition regulators if UEFA does not take action. But he may face questions of his own at home for his criticisms of Spain’s domestic powers. The breakaway plan involving Europe’s biggest clubs is something Pérez, the Real Madrid president, had been working on for years, Tebas added. Real didn’t respond to a request for comment about Tebas’s critique. Tebas and Real Madrid are locked in a separate battle over his plan to play an official league match in the United States, perhaps as early as this season. Tebas wants to use the match to raise the profile of the other teams in La Liga that are dwarfed by the popularity of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona is scheduled to play the first match against Girona on Jan. 26 in Miami, but players, unions, fans and — most important — the Spanish soccer federation all have objected to the idea. Without the federation’s blessing, the game cannot be played. At a dinner last month, Tebas and Luis Rubiales, the Spanish federation’s combative leader, failed to resolve the dispute. So Tebas said he was turning to the courts: La Liga plans to file a motion this week in Madrid to get the city’s mercantile court to force the federation’s hand. “We think we have the right,” Tebas said. Hours after he spoke on Monday, there was another leak, implicating more executives. “They can hack me tomorrow if they want,” he said. “They won’t find any dirty tricks in my emails.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Presidential Vengeance,"letter A reader finds it “no great surprise” that Mr. Trump would try to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. To the Editor: Re “Trump Sought to Have Foes Face Charges” (front page, Nov. 21): President Trump demonstrates time and time again that he is ignorant of American history, including the checks and balances established by our founding fathers. This coupled with his narcissistic tendencies makes for a dangerous mix. Though he says America First, this seems to be a front for Trump First. He pursues perceived personal enemies and critics with an obsessive vengeance. So his unrelenting desire to prosecute and punish Hillary Clinton and James Comey, along with other perceived enemies who crop up during his presidency, sadly comes as no great surprise. The fear is that he may attempt to take steps to undermine both the checks and balances that limit his executive power and the freedom of the press to report such abuse of power.

2018,"Prison Romances, Standing the Test of (Hard) Time and Cameras","Garrett has a lot going for him, at least in the eyes of his girlfriend, Johnna. He’s good looking and fit. He’s romantic and attentive. In the minus column, he’s a felon serving a seven-year sentence for grand theft, grand theft auto, credit card fraud, selling stolen property, drug possession and burglary. But did we mention he’s romantic and attentive? Those last two attributes were more than enough for Johnna — and for the viewers of “Love After Lockup,” the WE TV show on which Garrett was one of the first-season stars. Equal parts dating show and slice-of-life documentary, “Love After Lockup” follows six couples — one con and one “non-con,” in the shorthand of the producers — as they contemplate weddings and post-release living arrangements. The show was the fastest-growing new cable series for 2018 and returns for a second season on Dec. 7. In many ways, its popularity hinges on our seemingly bottomless fascination with all things prison-related, even as the couples themselves try to move on and put all of that jailhouse nonsense behind them. When “Love After Lockup” debuted last January, it entered a crowded field of prison-themed reality programs. Over the past decade, there have been shows about jails (“Jail,” “60 Days In”) and county jails (“Lockup: County Jails”); maximum security prisons (“Hard Time”) and megajails (“Louis Theroux: Miami Mega Jail”); female inmates (“Girls Incarcerated”) and their kids (“Born Behind Bars”); hardened lifers (“Lockdown”) and newbie guards (“Behind Bars: Rookie Year”). “Locked Up Abroad,” on Nat Geo, is still going strong, 12 seasons in. Even MSNBC’s “Lockup” franchise, which ran for 25 seasons and spawned a half dozen spinoffs before being canceled in 2017, is ubiquitous on Netflix. The popularity of these shows, for both producers and viewers, isn’t tough to figure out: They’re cheap to produce (no expensive sets to build, or professional actors to pay), and promise both voyeuristic thrills (violent prison riots! Blurred-out body cavity searches!) and reassuring morality tales where no felon goes unpunished, and then some. Elizabeth Barfoot Christian, a professor of media and communication at Louisiana College who has written about prison reality shows, believes that many of them, like “Louisiana Lockdown,” which was set in nearby Angola Prison, feed into and even promote negative stereotypes about the incarcerated. “To me, it’s no accident that that show was on ‘Animal Planet,’” she said. But Christian also notes that many of the newer criminal justice-themed programs, from dramas (Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black”) to podcasts (“Serial,” Christian’s own “Telling Lives”), humanize the characters in ways that previous shows did not. One possible reason: The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world (655 inmates for every 100,000 people, according to the World Prison Brief, a database maintained by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London), which means that there’s a good chance viewers know someone who’s in prison, or has been. “There’s a sense that this could be my brother,” she said. “This could be my father, but for not getting caught.” “Love After Lockup” is part of this larger trend toward kinder, gentler prison shows, with its sympathetic cons and lovestruck non-cons. The focus on families and friendships over rap sheets has resonated with viewers. The show’s target audience of women ages 25 to 54 nearly doubled over the course of the season; the series finale, “Prison Cells to Wedding Bells,” drew nearly 725,000 viewers. And at first glance, the show seems very similar to a batch of other prison-based relationship shows, like Lifetime’s “Prison Wives Club” and Investigation Discovery’s “Prison Wives.” But the show has one key attribute the others lack: On “Love After Lockup,” the inmates actually get out (or at least most do). And unlike other prison reality shows, which rarely leave the lockups and tend to focus on the most unsavory aspects of prison life, “Love After Lockup” is all about, well, love or what passes for it under extraordinary circumstances like these. Will Garrett still want to marry Johnna, once he’s experienced the charms of Florida’s strip clubs? Will Andrea’s friends still support her after they discover that her fiancé has been in prison for the past 18 years, not, as she has told them, in Canada? “I think the couples are all very relatable,” said Kate Farrell, one of the show’s executive producers. “They have to work out how they’re going to live together. They look at wedding dresses, and buy cars. But still, in the back of your mind you’re thinking, this person was in prison for 18 years.” The series began life in 2016 at WE TV’s annual “pitch fest,” a mandatory event in which company employees split up into 10-person teams and brainstorm ideas for new shows. The winning pitch featured elements of some of the biggest shows on WE TV, whose bread and butter are reality series aimed at women ages 25 to 54: unrealistic wives-to-be (“Bridezillas”); unlikely couples (“Marriage Boot Camp”); and personal transformations (“Mama June: From Not to Hot”). As with a lot of reality shows, “Love After Lockup” lives or dies with the cast. To assemble the six couples, the producers looked at online support groups (Facebook’s “Prison Wives of Florida Inmates”) and Instagram hashtags. According to Farrell, they were looking for non-cons who had compelling stories, wanted to get married (like, now), and were currently dating incarcerated felons, but not excessively violent ones. “No murderers, no rapists,” she said. The first season was marked by unwise acts (over a period of three years, Scott sends Lizzie, one of the show’s two female inmates, $90,000, which she spends on meth and heroin, among other things) and threats from jealous lovers (“I will hurt a chick,” says Andrea, “and I say that in the name of Jesus Christ, amen”). There are questions from nosy friends (“Has he hurt any children?”) and inquisitive family members (“Have you ever gotten shanked?”). This season stars four new couples, as well as two couples from last season whose romances were stymied by delayed prison release dates. One of the newcomers, Caitlin, is a 32-year-old administrative assistant in Washington who falls in love with Matt, a 28-year-old inmate she met through a “strictly platonic” Craigslist ad. Most of Caitlin’s family doesn’t know about her new beau, who’s in prison for possession of a firearm, stolen property and eluding the police. And although their prison meetings were limited to four visits — albeit all-day ones — she doesn’t see her relationship as all that different from other couples. “We dated,” Caitlin said in a phone interview. “Maybe not to society’s norms. But we spent five months communicating day in and day out. We took time to get to know each other.” “I get that it might not look normal to everybody else,” she conceded. And who says normal is necessarily all that great? Farrell points out that prisoners can spend more time wooing the person on the outside. “They have a lot of time to write letters. Whereas someone that you or I might date, who has a job and responsibilities, they’re not sitting there going, oh, I think I’ll write Kate a poem today.” One of the two returning non-cons is Angela, 45, who was stood up by her boyfriend Tony on his supposed release date at the end of the first season, which left Angela wondering if she had been played. That’s another not-uncommon element of the show: For many prison couples, it’s the partner on the outside who’s sweating things out, hoping their lover on the inside is telling the truth. “He is a manipulator,” Angela said by phone from her home in Mississippi. And yet, there’s something about the guy that charms. “One of the sweetest things he ever sent me was a half dozen roses he made out of toilet tissue, and colored with Kool-Aid from prison,” she said. In the end, the producers insist, the series is really all about love stories and second chances. “Sometimes you do something stupid and you get a bad break,” said Marc Juris, president of WE TV. “But that doesn’t mean you’re not a good person and you don’t deserve love.” And that sentiment is one reason the non-cons say that they sign up for a show like this. It’s certainly not for all the abuse they receive on social media from strangers calling them idiots and losers and worse. “I did not do the show for fame and fortune,” Angela said. “I did it because people who are incarcerated are so stigmatized by society. I had an opportunity to share my story on television, and let others know that, hey, it’s O.K. to be in love with an inmate. They’re people too.”",The New York Times
2018,Probiotics Do Not Ease Stomach Flu,"Treatment with probiotics did not speed recovery from gastroenteritis in children. Probiotics, the beneficial bacteria that live in our digestive tracts, are widely used to treat gastroenteritis or “stomach flu,” an inflammation of the stomach and intestines usually caused by a virus or bacterium. But a randomized clinical trial has found that the treatment is ineffective. Researchers studied 971 children 3 months to 4 years old who arrived in emergency rooms with the typical symptoms of gastroenteritis — nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea and dehydration, stomach pain and cramps. They were randomly assigned to a five-day course of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a commonly studied probiotic, or a placebo. The researchers tracked the duration and severity of symptoms for two weeks. Episodes of vomiting and diarrhea declined day by day at the same rate in both groups until almost all had recovered. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with a study showing similar results with a different probiotic combination in a clinical trial in Canada. “We looked at duration and severity of symptoms, young versus old, kids on antibiotics or not, kids that had a virus or a bacterium or no measurable cause,” said the lead author, Dr. David Schnadower, a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. “Every time, the result was the same: no effect.”",The New York Times
2018,Programmed for Success,"If you’re an 18-year-old student with no children, two college-educated parents and only one task over the next four years — to get a degree — it might not be that difficult to navigate registration, find time to get to the bookstore, or stay late after class for extra help, all leading to a high likelihood that you’ll graduate. But if you’re a single parent with a full-time job, or the first person in your family to go to college, and are perhaps attending part-time, it’s a different story. Community college students across the country struggle to complete their programs — only 25 percent of those who start as full-time students at public two-year institutions graduate, according to the United States Department of Education. Only about one of five finishes in two years. Even given twice as long to complete the coursework, just 36 percent of these students graduate. But in recent years, technological advances have given administrators a chance to offer help when and where students need it, whether it’s reminding them about due dates, nudging them to complete homework or guiding them toward resources that will help them stay enrolled. “I think all colleges need this kind of help, but community colleges see a significant number of first-time students, people who may not have family understanding of the kinds of things that are necessary,” said Bret Ingerman, vice president for information technology at Tallahassee Community College in Florida. Students can now expect to get personalized text messages from their college. Instead of a mass email listing the deadlines for payment, a student might receive a text that says: “Dear Ayana, you’re about to be dropped from your fall classes. Click this link to fix that.” These kinds of technologies allow administrators to nudge their students toward success in a way that wasn’t possible a decade ago. “There’s something about getting a message with that level of personalization, because now you know it applies to you,” Mr. Ingerman said. He said members of the administration have received messages from students expressing gratitude for the reminder, or asking for help. That opens the door for someone to intervene. Using software that was originally designed to track technology “help desk” tickets, Mr. Ingerman and his team also route faculty concerns about students who seem to be at risk of dropping out. “We can have a faculty member identify a student who’s not doing well, maybe they’re sleeping in class because they don’t have housing,” said Mr. Ingerman. “Whatever the issue may be, we know the right people to help.” Professors also have access to a fuller picture of their students, with information about how often they open their materials, or how long they spent on an assignment. Some of the most at-risk students who enter community college are those who aren’t considered “college ready” in certain subjects. They have to take remedial courses that won’t count toward a degree, but cost time and money. “We know that developmental math tends to be the main barrier to college completion. We also know that minority students are disproportionately placed in developmental math education,” said Kevin Li, dean of arts and sciences at Triton College, a public community college in the greater Chicago area. In the spring of this year, Triton opened the iLaunch Lab for math students, designed to pivot away from the lecture-based classroom and toward adaptive and individualized learning. Students sit at clusters of computers, where their progress is assessed in real-time using Aleks from McGraw-Hill, educational software that uses artificial intelligence to continuously analyze the progress of the students and adapt learning to their needs. “The change is tremendous. At my college, using technology, we’ve already proven how we can get students through remedial content in a much quicker manner,” said Mr. Li. “But in a larger picture, when we talk about competency-based education, we will be able to leverage technology to take on the assessment portion of learning,” he said. “I think that is potentially the crux of how we can really achieve competency-based education to benefit the diverse student populations.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Puberty for the Middle-Aged,"Forty-five-year-old women need a version of “the talk,” because our bodies are changing in ways that are both really weird and really uncomfortable. Ms. Davis is a writer. If only, on your 45th birthday, a doctor would sit you down, look you squarely in the eyes and say, “Here’s what’s going to happen: Eventually, your pubic hair is going to thin out everywhere but on the bikini line, exactly the opposite of what you’ve always wanted. The fat on your body will redistribute so that each of your thighs is the shape of Grimace, the McDonald’s blob monster. You will develop those wings of loose skin below your arms. You just will, no matter what you do. Also: Everything about your periods will change. They may become shorter, more frequent, more painful. And they’ll just get weirder until they desist.” If only, in other words, someone told you, “You need to really prepare, emotionally and physically, for middle age.” But of course, no one does. We put a lot of time and effort into preparing teenagers for what changes puberty will wreak, but for women, midlife brings another kind of puberty — perimenopause, a road that we in our 40s navigate blind, without enough information from our doctors or often other women, wondering in silent shame at the intensity and seeming endlessness of the changes. What is perimenopause, you might be asking? For one thing, it’s a term so underused that Microsoft’s word-processing program is telling me it’s not a word, a term that was new to many when Gwyneth Paltrow uttered it last month in a Goop video. “Peri” is Greek for “near,” and menopause is the ceasing of menstruation. So perimenopause is all the crazy stuff that happens on the way to that cessation. We need to have The Talk, but for 45-year-olds. Doctors should speak to their patients about the changes that could lie ahead and how to prepare for them. And we perimenopausal women need to talk to one another, and the rest of the world, about what’s happening. Because a lot of it, to me, is really weird, really surprising and really hard to sit comfortably through, from the stray chin hair — O.K., hairs — to the decreasing bone density. Some 40 percent of women have interrupted sleep during perimenopause. Between 10 percent and 20 percent have mood swings. Some have uterine bleeding or vaginal dryness and even that hallmark of actual menopause, hot flashes. My desire to know the full story goes beyond my health: How am I going to make jokes about these symptoms if I don’t know what they are? (I will always fondly recall Joan Rivers joking about the surprising number of things that sag as you age, starting with your genitals.) Recently I asked friends on Facebook what no one had told them about middle age. No post of mine has ever garnered so many responses, so equally divided between sad and funny. Or both.

And then there are the emotional issues: How will I feel differently about myself as my hormonal profile shifts, as I lose estrogen in the years just before my young children surge with it? The Talk doesn’t have to be all bad. Among the things my Facebook friends noted was that they felt better and stronger than they did in their 20s and 30s, and that they had become much less vain. One friend wrote, “I prioritize the things that are important to me and people I care about.” She has arrived at the still-mythical (to me) moment when people stop caring so much what others think, the beginning of the upswing of the U-shaped happiness curve, which shows that people get happier as they grow old (often the 40s are the curve’s nadir). Older people are the bearers of wisdom earned by their years, or by the sheer fatigue that has overtaken them, forcing them to pick their battles more carefully. Along with those chin hairs, solace may come.

2018,Push to Legalize E-Bikes and E-Scooters in New York City Sets Up City Hall Clash,"[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Mayor Bill de Blasio has called electric bicycles “a real danger,” and “a serious part of the problem” when it comes to the safety of city streets. He celebrated a police crackdown last year in which hundreds were confiscated. Now, a package of four City Council bills, set to be introduced Wednesday, would legalize most forms of the so-called e-bikes, the scourge of many New York residents and also a staple of the food-delivery workers who serve them. The legislation, which would also legalize electric scooters, would allow not only electric bicycles that give extra support to a pedaling rider, but also those that could be operated without pedaling, by engaging a motorcycle-like handlebar throttle. [Need a primer on e-bikes? We’re here to help.] The legislation, a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times, is likely to set off a public confrontation with Mr. de Blasio, whose administration has insisted that state law bans electric bicycles that operate with a throttle — the primary sort of e-bike used by delivery cyclists, many of whom are recent immigrants. “We love our city but let’s be clear, crossing the street in New York City should not be a harrowing experience,” Mr. de Blasio said last fall as he announced stepped-up enforcement by the Police Department against e-bikes. His stance angered some immigrant advocates. In April, the city’s Department of Transportation tried to find a middle ground, allowing for the pedal-assist bicycles but retaining a ban on bicycles that do not have to be pedaled. Mr. de Blasio has said state law prohibits e-bicycles that operate without being pedaled. That is where the e-scooters come into play. Lobbyists for the e-scooter sharing services Bird and Lime have been pressing the City Council to grant the companies permission to operate in New York City, as they do in cities including San Diego and Washington. Bird had lawyers study the relevant law, and the company argues that e-scooters could be allowed in New York City under a section of state law that permits the city to regulate certain kinds of limited-use vehicles. The section of law also applies to e-bikes, advocates say. With that in mind, the City Council is prepared to introduce one bill to legalize e-scooters and a second to legalize two forms of e-bikes. Another bill would allow for a pilot program to test the viability of e-scooter sharing in a limited area of the city — along the corridor that will be hit hardest by the shutdown of the L train next year. Riders would use Bird’s app to locate available e-scooters and pay a per-minute fee to ride them. The system is dockless, so riders would leave them wherever their trip ends. But the e-bike section of the legislation is the most complicated. The law provides for “a bicycle equipped with fully operable pedals and an electric motor” that “may be used to propel such bicycle without the operator pedaling.” The maximum speed for such bicycles, as it is for pedal-assist bicycles, would be 20 miles per hour. (E-scooters would be limited to 15 m.p.h.) Councilman Rafael L. Espinal Jr., a sponsor of the bills, has been a supporter of e-bikes for years. He said the push to allow e-scooters presented an opportunity. “I believe if we’re going to have a conversation around allowing e-scooters, we can’t move forward without addressing the e-bikes,” Mr. Espinal, a Democrat of Brooklyn, said. “What we’re trying to do is classify the e-bikes and scooters as devices instead of vehicles.” He said he believed that the City Council could do so under the law. “The mayor’s position has always been that e-bikes are a nuisance, a problem, within the five boroughs,” he said. “I think we found a path forward.” Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, stopped short of endorsing the bills, saying instead in a statement that he would “follow this legislation closely as it moves through the legislative process.” “I have sympathy for these delivery drivers who are being hit with tickets while they are trying to do their jobs,” Mr. Johnson, a Manhattan Democrat, said, “and I am open to alternative means of transportation.” Seth Stein, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said: “While e-scooters are illegal under state and city law, the mayor is committed to innovation as part of his all-of-the-above transportation strategy to get New Yorkers moving again. We look forward to reviewing the proposals.” Council members have been sensitive to the politics of allowing e-scooters, which may be seen as catering to younger and wealthier residents jetting around town, while banning e-bikes of the sort mostly used for work by poorer New Yorkers. One of the bills would create a program that would provide funds to poor workers who may need to adjust their e-bikes to make them legal under the new laws. The scooter company, Bird, too is aware of that perception, and presents itself as agnostic on the subject of e-bikes. The company has also stressed the usefulness of its scooters for city residents outside Manhattan in areas not well served by the subway. “We are excited about these bills,” Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy at Bird, said. Mr. White thanked the Council for “leadership on increasing mobility options and expanding transportation access for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Putin Knew. America Didn’t.,"Also: A surprising new story about police violence against an African-American man. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, if you’re looking for a gripping long read this weekend, I recommend “I don’t want to shoot you, brother,” by ProPublica’s Joe Sexton. It’s a surprising and important tale about a police shooting. The latest Russia plea. When I sat down this summer with Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, he wanted to make one overriding point: People weren’t paying enough attention to the suspicious ties between the Trump businesses and Russia. People are starting to pay more attention now. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The guilty plea yesterday by Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, makes clear that Trump remained focused on his business throughout much of the 2016 presidential campaign. Among other things, he was lobbying the Russian government to approve a Trump Tower in Moscow. And he was lying to the American public about it. “Trump’s actions represented an extraordinary conflict of interest,” National Review’s David French writes. “Americans were listening to Trump’s praise of Putin without realizing his profit motive.” Lying about the deal, in turn, gave Russia leverage over Trump, as the former F.B.I. agent Asha Rangappa has explained. Russia “has continued to have leverage since, because he never disclosed it and his people lied about it,” she tweeted. The plea by Cohen fits a pattern by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, the journalist Marcy Wheeler has argued. Mueller is laying out Trump officials’ misdeeds in court documents to make sure the investigation’s findings are made public even if Trump’s acting attorney general tries to suppress them. Still, no one should be sanguine about the situation. For years, Vladimir Putin has known more than the American public about Trump’s behavior, my colleague Michelle Goldberg points out, which means that “every day of the Trump presidency is a national security emergency.” Also in The Times, the legal experts Barry Berke, Noah Bookbinder and Norman Eisen write, “We can expect even bigger bombshells — and White House threats against Mueller — in the coming weeks.” And if you’re still trying to make sense of it all, The Times editorial board has a nice explainer. To return to Schiff’s point: There remain many unanswered questions about Trump’s questionable business dealings in Russia long before he ran for president — which could give further leverage to Putin.

2018,Putin Plays Down Sea Clash with Ukraine as ‘Border Incident’,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday dismissed the maritime clash between Russia and Ukraine as a criminal incident rather than the opening of a new front in the long-running conflict between the two countries, while a Russian court on the disputed Crimean peninsula sent a second group of captured Ukrainian sailors to jail. “This is a border incident, nothing more,” Mr. Putin told an international business forum in Moscow when he was asked about the confrontation on Sunday when Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian naval vessels in disputed coastal waters. It was his first public comment on the subject. In Ukraine, President Petro O. Poroshenko enacted martial law for 30 days in 10 regions, mainly those bordering areas with a Russian military presence. Mr. Poroshenko has said that the sweeping provisions of martial law — which include the suppression of civil liberties — would only be invoked in the case of a Russian invasion. “We need to rebuff the aggressor at any moment,” Mr. Poroshenko told troops at a Ukrainian training center, according to a statement on his website. Mr. Putin reiterated the Kremlin’s accusation that Mr. Poroshenko manufactured the entire incident in order to put Ukraine on a war footing and thereby enhance his flagging support before a March presidential election that he was sure to lose. “A small incident in the Black Sea and martial law was introduced,” said Mr. Putin. “It’s a game to exacerbate tensions. It’s dirty play within the country in order to crush their political opponents.” Still, Russia moved to enhance its own, already robust military posture in the region, by deploying an additional air defense missile system to the Crimean peninsula. Russia added one S-400 antiaircraft missile system to the three already there, the Interfax news agency quoted Col. Vadim Astafyev, the top Defense Ministry official in southern Russia, as saying. In Ukraine, very little changed on the ground. But Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman for the State Border Guard Service, said that it had stepped up its controls of who is allowed to enter the country and barred 150 people, including 80 Russians, in the past 24 hours. Ukraine has gathered broad Western support for its position over the disputed passage by three small naval craft through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov, which the two sides agreed to treat as joint territorial waters in a 2003 treaty. Russian border forces rammed a Ukrainian naval tug and opened fire with shells big enough to leave a gaping hole near the pilot house of one small Ukrainian artillery craft. The Russians captured the three boats with 24 crewmen, wounding three of them. President Trump has said he might cancel a planned meeting with President Putin at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires this Saturday over the clash. Yuri Ushakov, Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said Wednesday that the Kremlin believed the meeting was still scheduled and had not received any indication otherwise from Washington. “This meeting is necessary for both sides,” Mr. Ushakov told reporters. “It’s important in view of the developing situation in the world.” He noted that Mr. Putin had rejected a request from Mr. Porochenko to discuss the incident over the phone. The Ukrainian sailors have been charged with crossing the Russian border illegally and sent to jail for two months of pretrial detention. Fifteen were charged on Tuesday, including those wounded in the incident, and nine were charged in court appearances on Wednesday. Russia highlighted the fact that two of the Ukrainians were intelligence officers, suggesting that this proved that the confrontation had been planned in advance. Ukraine criticized Russia for treating the captives as common criminals rather than prisoners of war, including broadcasting some videos of what seemed to be forced confessions. In court on Wednesday, Oleh Melnychuk, the captain of the tugboat, objected to being characterized as a criminal and rejected Russian statements that the Ukrainian vessels had been maneuvering suspiciously. “I am not a criminal and I disagree with the detention,” the captain was quoted as saying by a Russian news service, RIA Novosti. “About my maneuvering — I only wanted to keep from hitting the Russian vessel. I wanted to save my crew and prevent the boat from overturning.” In recent months, Russia has been deploying more forces in and around the Sea of Azov, stopping and searching nearly 300 commercial vessels in an attempt to pressure Ukraine economically. The perception is that the Kremlin hopes to turn it into a kind of “Russian lake,” and Ukraine has responded by deploying a few ships from its meager navy there. The Sea of Azov is widely viewed as the next front in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that started with Russian forces seizing Crimea in 2014 and then helping to destabilize Ukraine by backing separatist forces in the eastern Donbass region. The fighting there ever since has claimed some 10,000 lives. Russia’s strategy in the wake of the open armed clash, however, appears to be to try to treat the whole thing as a mere border skirmish. On Tuesday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, said there was no need for the Kremlin to handle the aftermath as it could all be done by Russia’s court system.",The New York Times
2018,Puzzles and Paradoxes: Marilyn Stasio’s Latest Crime Column,"Crime Solving one of Keigo Higashino’s fiendishly difficult mysteries must be very gratifying. (I wouldn’t know, since this Japanese puzzlemeister consistently outwits me.) In Giles Murray’s translation of NEWCOMER (Minotaur, $27.99), Higashino’s fabled Tokyo Metropolitan Police detective, Kyoichiro Kaga, he of the “razor-sharp mind and bloodhound nature,” has been dispatched to the Nihonbashi precinct to investigate the inexplicable murder of a middle-aged woman who lived alone and seemed to have no enemies. Kaga directs his inquiries to Amazake Alley, a narrow street of small stores with loads of charm. (“Few other districts in the capital had shops that specialized in wicker suitcases or shamisen lutes.”) In each of these businesses, Kaga finds some minor mystery to solve: Why did the clock shop owner’s dog get lost on his walk? Who bought the cakes found at the crime scene? “I notice details,” Kaga explains. “That’s the sort of person I am.” The characters, it must be said, are thinner than the dough used to create those delicate pastries; but in a fair exchange, the author has succeeded in making problem-solving logistics sexy. Since Kaga plucks all his clues from minor background details, their trivial nature is itself important. As Higashino notes, “The precinct detective had looked into things that the rest of them had dismissed as insignificant.” Things like where you choose to sit in a taxi or whether you like sweets or who gave the victim a new pair of kitchen scissors. In addition to illustrating the subtlety of the author’s narrative style, these minutiae add up to a tidy and quite credible solution. Not that I saw it coming. ♦ Stephen Kelly’s new Inspector Lamb novel, HUSHED IN DEATH (Pegasus Crime, $25.95), would seem to push all my buttons — and possibly yours. It’s a traditional mystery set in 1942 in a British country house that’s been reconfigured as a sanitarium for military men suffering the “traumatic effects of combat.” There’s a murder on the very first page and plenty of suspects (or possible additional victims) among the patients and staff. There’s even a ghost! Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Lamb of the Hampshire Constabulary, who served on the Somme in the previous war, cuts a dashing figure as the sleuth in charge of the investigation. And Dr. Frederick Hornby, director of Elton House, was at Ypres. Both men still have nightmares filled with the faces of the dead. The setup is so familiar and so calculated that it’s impossible not to feel manipulated. But it’s the writing that really grates. “I left the house and came up the path from the village, as I usually do,” the housekeeper begins. And then, dear reader, I fell asleep. ♦ If you’re going to write a theater mystery, who better to bump off than a theater critic? In her comic novel, A SHOT IN THE DARK (Bloomsbury, paper, $17), Lynne Truss does the dastardly deed during a performance of “A Shilling in the Meter,” a slice-of-life drama being given a tryout production at a seedy theater in Brighton in 1957. A properly loathsome person, the famed and feared A. S. Crystal has already started writing his review on the train down from London, and a nasty piece of work it is too. But before the review can be published — indeed, before the play has ended — Crystal is shot dead. The mystery takes an amusing turn once the clever young Constable Peregrine Twitten starts second-guessing his superiors. “You are an impetuous, arrogant pipsqueak,” shouts the detective in charge, who tries to fire him before realizing he could use this pipsqueak’s supersize brain to his own advantage. We should be hearing more from this clever young know-it-all. ♦ Children have a way of softening up even the most hard-boiled antiheroes. They don’t come much tougher than Ken Bruen’s Irish roughneck, Jack Taylor, a man with bad habits who does good despite himself. Jack can’t escape from other people’s children in Bruen’s latest novel, IN THE GALWAY SILENCE (Mysterious Press, $26), which finds Mr. Tough Guy (“I’m not great with kids”) babysitting for his girlfriend’s 9-year-old son. “The boy was small with blond hair,” he observes, which makes young Joffrey sound nonthreatening even for the child-averse Jack. But the kid is a world-class whiner with a perpetually curled lip, “from attitude rather than design.” As if regular outings with Joffrey, who is staying with relatives while his mother is away, weren’t penance enough for his many sins, this dangerously hotheaded private detective agrees to find out who murdered a rich Frenchman’s twin sons. It’s not the kind of case Jack would normally take, but the way these men were killed — duct-taped to a wheelchair, their mouths sealed with superglue, then tossed into a river — probably appealed to his sense of the hideously absurd. But it’s another case, involving kidnapping and pedophilia, that really riles Jack, who, despite his macho posturing, is one of those decent souls who are sickened by cruelty to children, even a little brat like Joffrey.",The New York Times
2018,Q&A: The ABCs of E-Cigarettes,"As vaping grows more popular, especially among teens, here are answers to some basic questions about its health effects. The term “electronic cigarette” refers to a battery-powered device that heats a tank or cartridge of liquid usually containing nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals, but not the cancer-causing tar found in tobacco cigarettes. Users inhale and exhale the vapor. The devices come in numerous shapes, including ones that look like pens, flash drives and hookahs. Many consumers are confused about the health implications of e-cigarettes. This is a primer about what research so far shows about these devices. Yes. But that does not mean they are safe. E-cigarettes contain far fewer dangerous chemicals than those released in burning tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes typically contain 7,000 chemicals, including nearly 70 known to be carcinogenic. E-cigarettes also don’t release tar, the tobacco residue that damages lungs but also contributes to the flavor of tobacco products. In the United States, cigarettes are associated with 480,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease, stroke and numerous cancers, among other illnesses. The research on e-cigarettes is young because the products have only been around for a little over a decade. Exacerbated by the voltage of a given device, certain e-cigarette flavors can irritate the airways, researchers say: benzaldehyde (added to cherry flavored liquids), cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon flavor), and diacetyl (a buttery flavor that can cause lung tissue damage called “popcorn lung.”) Some flavors become irritants when added to vaping liquids. The process of turning liquid chemicals into vapor releases harmful particulates deep into the lungs and atmosphere, including heavy metals. It’s unclear. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the marketing of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. Observational studies of their effectiveness reveal mixed results. Some show that a majority of adult users are former smokers, suggesting the devices are useful in helping them quit. Others reveal that many e-cigarette users also smoke conventional cigarettes. Still others say that a large percentage of e-cigarette users, particularly teenagers, never smoked traditional cigarettes. A 2018 study concluded that e-cigarettes did not help smokers quit at rates faster than smokers who did not use them. But this summer, a British Parliament committee resoundingly endorsed them, even going so far as to suggest that e-cigarettes be made available by prescription through the National Health Service. Nicotine is not known to cause cancer. It is a stimulant and a sedative, helping to release dopamine in the brain’s pleasure centers. Some research suggests it can improve memory and concentration — although long-term smoking has been associated with cognitive decline. Inhaled nicotine can increase heart rate and blood pressure. The major cause for alarm is that nicotine is highly addictive. It is the chemical in tobacco and e-cigarettes that binds the user. The nicotine in smoking cessation aids like gum, patches and lozenges is absorbed more slowly than in cigarettes. “In tobacco smoke, the nicotine is delivered to the lungs, which have a large surface area,” said Maciej Goniewicz,a pharmacologist and toxicologist at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y. “In one or two puffs, the smoker feels the nicotine go right to brain.” The e-cigarette brand Juul in particular “seems to closely match tobacco cigarettes in terms of the speed and amount of nicotine delivery,” said Dr. Goniewicz, who studies the absorption of such chemicals. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The human brain develops into the mid-20s. Researchers worry that adolescents who vape will be most affected by nicotine addiction, which they can develop with less exposure than adults require. Though studies have not conclusively shown that e-cigarettes can be relied upon to help adult smokers quit, there is substantial evidence that teenagers who use them have a higher risk of smoking cigarettes. Teens are also using vapes to inhale marijuana. “It seems that kids who use e-cigarettes are more likely to use marijuana in general — smoked or vaped. Is there a gateway effect? We’re just getting data now. But it’s concerning,” said Dr. Rachel Boykan, an associate professor at Stony Brook medical school who researches adolescence and tobacco control. “E-cig use can be very challenging to detect because they are discreet devices that don’t emit much odor,” said Dr. Sharon Levy, director of the adolescent substance use and addiction program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Parents can look online for photos of devices and pods. If you find those items in your child’s room, pockets or backpack, “you should assume that your child is using it,” Dr. Levy said, “not ‘just holding it for a friend.’ ” If children say they have only tried e-cigarettes a few times, Dr. Levy said, ask them to stop. Then tell them you will check their room and backpack. “And then do it. Kids who have used only sporadically should be able to stop without much intervention.” There aren’t widely accepted protocols for teenagers. Dr. Levy urges families to consult a medical professional. Limited interventions with nicotine replacement therapies like patches, gum or medications may be effective in older teens, she said. But “this should be done in conjunction with a good evaluation, since mental health disorders like depression and anxiety and use of other substances are common in kids with nicotine use disorder,” she cautioned. On Dec. 5, the Food and Drug Administration is holding a public hearing to discuss possible nicotine withdrawal therapies specifically for teenagers which, if restrictions on flavored e-cigarette brands proceed, could be an imminent challenge.",The New York Times
2018,Queens Museum Looks to Liverpool for New Director,"After an unpleasant parting of ways with Laura Raicovich in January, the Queens Museum has named Sally Tallant, a British arts professional, as its new president and executive director, starting next spring. “Her unique combination of local and global experience in the arts world made her the superlative choice for leading the Queens Museum, and for serving the borough’s distinctively international constituency,” said Mark J. Coleman, the museum’s board chairman, in a statement. Since 2011, Ms. Tallant has served as artistic director and chief executive of Liverpool Biennial, the international contemporary art festival, where she worked closely with that city’s major arts organizations, including Tate Liverpool, National Museums Liverpool and Culture Liverpool. She previously served as head of programs at London’s Serpentine Galleries. In a statement, Ms. Tallant said, “Amid the difficulties and stress points we see in the world today, institutions like the Queens Museum are key in terms of creating cultural spaces for people to engage with the urgent issues of our time.” Ms. Raicovich resigned after clashing with the board over the handling of an event sponsored by the Israeli government.",The New York Times
2018,Questionable Political Moves,"daily crossword column Brandon Koppy makes his New York Times Crossword debut. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Update: How could I have forgotten? Today is Will Shortz’s 25th anniversary as New York Times crossword editor. Let’s wish him a happy “puzzleversary” in the comments, and if you would like to solve the first crossword he ran as editor, try this stunner by Peter Gordon. That tugging you feel today is the puzzle pulling you into midweek and toward late-week, trickier puzzles. Clues are not as straightforward, and it may take a while before the theme becomes so obvious that you think to yourself: “Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?” Brandon Koppy makes his New York Times Crossword debut today, and I spent more time today thinking about his theme than I have for most midweek puzzles I’ve solved. That increased my solving time by quite a bit. I don’t time myself, but I do have a general idea of how much time I spend on each puzzle. And because Mr. Koppy’s theme was spread throughout the puzzle, it took me longer to finish than normal. That’s not a bad thing, mind you. I like having to wrestle with a puzzle. When you have a lot of short answers and some gluey entries (ALTERER, SIEG, EFF, RLS, STA), however, it takes some of the fun out of the wrestling. But that’s for another section, and all in all, this was a decent first time at bat mostly because of its clever theme. 14A: Being expected to know your architectural moldings may seem like a lot for a Wednesday, but this particular molding — the curved OGEE — has appeared 449 times in the New York Times Crossword, so it’s worth learning. 15A: Very cute clue. “Dogs” is slang for FEET, so they are the “Dog that take you for a walk?” 21A: Hmm. Well, it’s a German word that does translate as “victory.” But personally, I’d rather not see SIEG in my puzzle because of the loaded meaning behind the Nazi phrase. That’s just me. There are also some people who might not want to see ANTIFA in the puzzle at 49D. I don’t equate the two, but I do believe that words and how they are used matter. 23A: I had SOLO at first, but realized that it had to be plural because of the clue (“Most arias”), which makes the answer SOLI. 29A: “Tube travelers?” are not people riding the British Tube, but OVA, who go on a ride of a much different kind. 54A: I guess this is technically true. “Like some dogs in dog parks” should, to my mind, be OFF LEASH, because most dogs are off lead in an enclosed dog park. I’ve seen a few dogs ON LEASH, but it’s not advised. Keeping your dog on a leash in an area like that can lead to fights between dogs. 11D: With the question mark in “Night lights?,” we’re going way beyond a nursery light and up into the sky. The answer is AURORA. Mr. Koppy packs his grid with nine theme entries (quite a lot of theme material), not counting the revealer at 63A. All of the theme entries are starred for better visibility. If the answers to the clues sound a bit offbeat, that’s because they are real phrases, but the true answers are derived by flipping the order of the words. For example, at 3D, the “Half of a 1990s cartoon duo” is to be written in as HEAD BUTT, but there was no cartoon character by that name. There was, however, a character named BUTT-HEAD in “Beavis and Butt-Head.” Similarly, I spent a lot of time wondering if anyone else knew that Mr. Peanut had a GLASS EYE (22D), but the answer is really EYEGLASS. How do we know this? All is revealed at 63A, which reads “Questionable political moves suggested by the answers to the nine starred clues,” and the answer is FLIP-FLOPS. I’m very excited about my New York Times debut. I was an economics major at the University of Chicago and now spend my days at an ad agency in Austin, Tex. I’ve been solving the Times crossword off and on since college, but with increased vigor since becoming a dad earlier this year. My new schedule comes with a good deal more at-home hours, and I’ve filled some of that newfound surplus trying out crossword construction. I had been toying with this theme idea for a while, keeping a running list of potential theme answers on my phone. I liked the idea of cluing the flipped form instead, because, in addition to the solving curveball, it allows you to showcase both versions without having to dedicate double the grid real estate. This allowed me to include nine examples of themed wordplay (plus a revealer) rather than just three or four. The most challenging part was achieving the interlock in all four quadrants, given a relatively short list of options in my theme bank. MANCAVE and PACK RAT each span two other theme entries which puts some strain on the fill in those sections. But those were two of my favorites, so I went for the higher theme density, and I think the final version worked out well. Oddly, the example that first gave me the idea (JACK BLACK/BLACKJACK) didn’t make the final version. I had it in the northwest, but was having trouble filling the surrounding area satisfactorily. Other near misses for various reasons include KINGFISHER, ARMSTRONG, and SHOW BOAT. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.

2018,"R&B Blossoms, With Hip-Hop in the Rear View","Critic’s Notebook R&B has been tussling with hip-hop for around three decades, and depending what lens you’re looking through, has been either roundly defeated or sneakily triumphant. As hip-hop rose to prominence in the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, it began to view R&B as a partner, sometimes willing, and sometimes not. There were collaborations between rappers and singers, devised to bridge the culture and generation gaps (think Jody Watley and Rakim). And hip-hop aggressively borrowed soul melodies via sampling, as exemplified by Bad Boy Records. But by the turn of the century, as hip-hop officially took its place at the center of pop innovation and mainstream dominance, R&B began to feel like a footnote. Young stars like Trey Songz and Ashanti aligned themselves with hip-hop, a strategy of survival but not of confidence. Ultimately, it reduced the R&B — once the center of black social and political culture, and the conduit that brought the energy of sacred music into the secular realm — to an accent. In the mid-to-late 2000s, singing became a full-fledged part of hip-hop, owing to the success of Drake, one of the first stars — Lauryn Hill got there earlier — who toggled cleanly between rapping and singing and understood them as variations of each other, not oppositional forces. Rappers are singers now, to the point where the framework of singing has been refracted almost wholly through the needs of hip-hop. Post Malone is a singer. Swae Lee is a singer. Young Thug is a singer. Quavo is a singer. And to varying degrees, they’ve imbibed lessons from R&B. Finding someone who solely raps, in the classical sense, in the mainstream is becoming increasingly rare. Not all hip-hop singers are mining R&B traditions; Juice WRLD works in a style derived from pop-punk, as did XXXTentacion. But if R&B was a bit player a decade ago, it has at times felt like a ghost in the years since. Which is why the resurgent swell of the genre in recent years has been so welcome. Thanks to the internet, younger artists — emerging from platforms that privilege intimacy and make room for idiosyncrasy — have been able to negotiate the genre’s new terms out of the long shadow cast by hip-hop. The last year especially has seen a robust collection of new talent committed to the genre’s core principles, more inheritors of the moody trances of the Weeknd or the tense sketches of Frank Ocean than of the muscular sensualists like Usher and Mary J. Blige, who have thrived in the hip-hop era. And so even while hip-hop is awash in performers who channel lessons from R&B, this new wave of R&B singers — the seven below are merely a sampling — has made the preservation of its turf a priority. The most vivid demonstration of R&B’s triumphant untethering from hip-hop came this summer, when Ella Mai’s “Boo’d Up,” a sterling, sturdy, 1990s-redolent hit, was heading toward its peak. Perhaps in anticipation of the track’s eventual downturn, a remix was released featuring a pair of rappers, Nicki Minaj and Quavo, which perhaps was designed to turn the singer into the side dish on her own song. Unimaginative and unwieldy, it distracted from the song’s vivid core, and largely faded from view while the original persevered, becoming one of the defining singles of this year. This British singer followed up with a sleek and understated slice of piano soul, “Trip,” which was almost as effective as the soothing sprawl of “Boo’d Up.” Both songs move at a slow ticktock, underscoring the way she drags syllables across the beat. She’s a terse singer, not an ostentatious vocal powerhouse. Ella Mai signed to the imprint of the producer Mustard following a stint singing covers on Instagram. Her self-titled debut album, which was released last month, emphasizes a fealty to the early-to-mid 1990s, when hip-hop was first making its presence heavily felt in R&B, but hadn’t yet wrestled it into submission. She channels the sweetness of that era on “Shot Clock,” flirts with new jack swing on “Dangerous” and on songs like “Cheap Shot” and “Close,” delivers vocals that are husky but fluid, at a pace that’s calm and unhurried. Ella Mai’s steady cool has a partner in the confident ooze that marks Jorja Smith’s singing. Smith, who is British as well, released her debut album, “Lost & Found,” in June. It underscored her gifts as a storytelling singer — the regretful “Teenage Fantasy” is a high point — with a voice that cleanly reconciles the stern and the sensual, as on “Wandering Romance.” The production moves with the fierceness and certainty of a thunderstorm, and sometimes verges on the glum; throughout, there are echoes of the earthen club music of Soul II Soul. Mostly, it serves as ballast for Smith, but when she’s set free, accompanied only by guitar on “Goodbyes,” her voice is lithe, vibrant and moist like a fresh wound. “Sick to my stomach, four in the morning, I can’t sleep/In and out the city, worried ’bout where you may be,” H.E.R. sings at the beginning of “I’m Not OK.” Her presence is reverent, as if in prayer, and cloaked, as if in hiding. H.E.R. — born Gabriella Wilson — has an uncommon fortitude to her singing on her two-part “I Used To Know Her” set of EPs. (The soberly tragic second part bests the first.) Her palpably grounded soul nods to the elegance of quiet-storm 1980s R&B and the eyes-shut earnestness of the folky soul of the mid-1990s. And she chooses arrangements that provide stark shadows, but little interference, because her words are pointed. In her deft hands, meditations become anthems. There is a slice of R&B that privileges texture and viscosity over lyrics, in which the voice is deployed as pure feeling far more than as a narrative tool. This is the style favored by the young singer Sabrina Claudio, who — inspired by the pacing and reserve of Sade — makes R&B that’s fully submerged, oceanically grand and catch-your-breath slow. “No Rain, No Flowers,” which was released in August, makes few concessions. It presumes a willingness to commit to a fully absorptive environment. Claudio’s sighs are a flexible tool — at different moments they signal desperation, or lust or even an exhaustion that tends toward numbness. But she’s most effective when, on “Messages From Her,” those sentiments converge, a reminder that they’re really not that far apart to begin with. For the last couple of years, the path to musical success has run through social media — not only because it’s an alternate distribution mechanism, but because emerging stars rise quickly on those platforms, and sometimes need a proper, monetizable talent to accompany their fame. (See also: Bhad Bhabie, Cardi B.) Queen Naija is the first soul star of the social media generation. She first found an audience as one half of a YouTube-vlogging married couple that collaborated on music, among other things. As her relationship began to crumble, she wrote music of her own, thriving on songs that deliver the same forthright narratives that worked so well for her online. “Medicine,” her breakthrough hit, is a lightly comedic tale about infidelity and the cycles of pain it causes. It’s the tone-setter for her impressive self-titled debut EP, which was released in July, and is full of songs that rely heavily on narrative. And while aggrievance is her best mode, as heard on “Karma,” she’s also convincing on the gospelesque “Mama’s Hand,” about the raw thrills of new motherhood. Throughout the EP, you can hear the arc of her recent tumult — her old relationship ended in divorce, and she’s moved on with a new partner. They’re expecting a child together, but more crucially, they’ve got their own YouTube channel. Follow along. On each song on “Volume 1,” the debut EP from the rising R&B singer Pink Sweats, the first element that communicates real feeling is a guitar, picked with sadness and regret. His lo-fi songs propose that an R&B Lothario can be a lonely singer-songwriter, someone who’s assured but also alienated. “You say it’s Bonnie and Clyde but I feel like Bobby and Whitney/ Don’t know if you ride for me or if you riding against me,” he laments on “Would You,” in a voice that’s sweet and breathy but that also telegraphs uncertainty. Most Pink Sweats songs are spare — the ornamentation comes in the storytelling, which is vivid and direct, communicating a great deal via impressionistic detail. The luscious and caressing “Cocaine” and the stark, Weeknd-esque “No Replacing You” both capture the aching tragedy of a life lived on the wild side, but Pink Sweats doesn’t play it for cheap thrills. He absorbs, internalizes, and then whispers his hurt. Most of the aforementioned music proactively ignores hip-hop, and doesn’t bother finding common ground to ease its path toward the mainstream, or to the radio — it avoids the conundrum of compromise. But there are still a handful of soul singers who choose a more accommodationist route and manage not to lose themselves in the process. Jacquees, signed to Cash Money Records, and a longtime collaborator with various rappers, is exactly the sort of singer who’s been sidelined in the last decade, reduced to a foil. But what’s clear on “4275,” his debut album after years of mixtapes and guest appearances, is his unwillingness to be pigeonholed, and also the specificity of his vocal gift, which is far more reminiscent of the gentle singers of the 1980s than the wrestlers of the hip-hop generation. “4275” — which was released this summer, then rereleased in an expanded version in September — is a bracing album. Jacquees is a flamboyantly talented singer, nimble and calm. It’s clear from his subject matter and phrasing that hip-hop in his DNA. But despite the raw content of his songs, he sings with rigor and conviction — he’s an R&B purist at heart. And even though there are rapper collaborations here, the more meaningful endorsements come from older R&B stars — Donell Jones, Trey Songz, Jagged Edge, LaTocha Scott of Xscape — who come through to anoint one of their own.",The New York Times
2018,"Race and Class and Youth Football in Brownsville, Brooklyn","Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. NEVER RAN, NEVER WILL Boyhood and Football in a Changing American Inner City By Albert Samaha Illustrated. 343 pp. PublicAffairs. $28 In the summers of 1973 and 1974, a former college football star turned aspiring writer named Rick Telander inhabited the basketball courts of Foster Park in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. Sometimes playing, occasionally coaching, always acutely observing, Telander produced a book, “Heaven Is a Playground” (1976), that chronicled the dazzling talent and fragile dreams of asphalt wizards like Fly Williams and Albert King. At the intersection of youthful talent and the high-stakes world of N.C.A.A. basketball, Telander portrayed the most morally complicated character of all, Rodney Parker, an unofficial agent who may or may not have been taking payoffs to deliver stellar players to certain schools. More than 40 years later, “Heaven Is a Playground” remains an iconic book of sports journalism. By my lights, it informed all the subsequent nonfiction renderings of sports in urban, black America, serving as both the inspiration and the common ancestor for such acclaimed works as “Hoop Dreams,” Steve James’s documentary about two high school basketball stars in Chicago, and “The Ticket Out,” Michael Sokolove’s book about the Crenshaw High School baseball team in South Central Los Angeles that included the future Met slugger Darryl Strawberry. Now comes Albert Samaha, a first-time author, with “Never Ran, Never Will.” Whether deliberately or by coincidence, he has set himself an especially daunting task, because his book about two seasons with a youth football team takes place in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, just down Linden Boulevard from Telander’s Flatbush, and considers in almost identical ways how sports impacts the lives of young, nonwhite, often at-risk players. Does a game like football offer lifesaving discipline, fatherly coaches and means to a scholarship? Or is it just a cruel chimera, holding out the allure of an elusive pro career? And, to add a very current concern, is the risk of a head injury at a tender age worth the potential rewards of stardom? In plumbing these profound questions, Samaha immerses himself with the Mo Better Jaguars for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. Even though the Jaguars’ three teams extend only from ages 7 to 13, existential consequences hang over their efforts. The team’s head coach, Chris Legree, who was motivated to found the Jaguars by his participation in the Million Man March, has sent four players into the N.F.L., others to college scholarships at top-rung football schools like Syracuse, and dozens to scholarships at elite private high schools like Poly Prep. But despite his ardent, paternal efforts, which Samaha captures vividly, Legree has also watched about 30 former players end up in prison. One of Legree’s best players ever was shot dead at age 19. As Legree tells one player who shows signs of choosing the street over the gridiron: “You ain’t the first guy. I’ve been around guys like you a lot of years and I know the signs. I’m always worried about you getting hooked up with the wrong people. You could get out of it and get on the right track, but you gotta be honest with me and I got to know what you want. Some guys don’t wanna be helped. The coaches, they were looking for you the other day. Because I think you got a future. You got a chance. But no one wants to deal with problems. Courts, cops, gangs, stealing, drugs.” A former college football player who now reports on criminal justice for BuzzFeed, Samaha brings empathy and scrutiny to his reporting. But his book suffers from structural problems and an inexplicable lapse in ethical judgment when it comes to identifying his characters. Sadly, these problems all could have been rectified with a firmer editing hand. The 2014 season supplies the core of the book’s drama, yet Samaha devotes the first 70-plus pages to the essentially ephemeral 2013 games. Some of his finest character portraits of coaches and parents turn up only toward the book’s end. It’s also hard to understand why Samaha uses only partial names or nicknames for all of the players — even though, in a recent essay for The Times, he was perfectly capable of fully identifying several of the Jaguars and even using their photographs. Even so, there is much to enjoy and at the best moments to admire in this book. Samaha may not finish in the top echelon of Telander disciples, the way James and Sokolove did, but “Never Ran, Never Will” proves the continued salience of urban sports as a subject for exploring larger issues of race and class.",The New York Times

2018,"Racing Across Antarctica, One Freezing Day at a Time","Louis Rudd and Colin O’Brady are in the middle of a unique race across the coldest continent, and their daily tasks range from the mundane to the death defying. Colin O'Brady sets up camp at the end of a long day of skiing in Antarctica.CreditCreditColin O'Brady Monday was not an ideal morning to ski in Antarctica. The wind was fast, and a snowstorm was producing whiteout conditions, making the skiing feel like “being inside a Ping-Pong ball,” in the words of the American adventure athlete Colin O’Brady. But there was no time to waste in a race to become the first person to cross Antarctica alone from shore to shore without any aid or support. So when O’Brady and Louis Rudd, a captain in the British Army, unzipped their tents and saw the misery they would experience on the 23rd day of their journey, they confronted it as if it were any other day. They would consume warm fluids and high-calorie snacks, and push through the unmatched exhaustion that comes from hauling a 300-pound Norwegian sled, known as a pulk, for 10 to 12 hours. [What does it mean to cross Antarctica alone and unsupported? Here are 7 takeaways from this historic journey.] Each day these two competitors, who have been traveling miles apart from each other and have not communicated with each other, have emerged amid an icy desert to battle the elements and one another. They’ve felt pain and frustration, taken risks and shed tears. As they skied through the whiteout on Monday, they stared at compasses strapped to their chests to stay on course toward the South Pole, unable to see up or down or side to side, with their sleds catching on wavelike ridges of ice known as sastrugi, forcing the occasional tumble. On this expedition, for both men, tripping and falling hard — countless times — is all part of the schedule. 6:10-7:25 a.m. O’Brady wakes up at 6:10 a.m. and lights his backpacking stove on the ice in the vestibule of his tent. He boils water for his morning meal of oatmeal with extra oil and protein powder. While he finishes breakfast, he empties his tent and packs his pulk. By then, it’s about 7 a.m., which is when Rudd wakes up and lights his stove, which he also rests in the vestibule of his tent. Rudd’s day starts with instant hot chocolate — he’s carrying more than 15 pounds of hot chocolate powder in his sled. He also eats a freeze-dried meal of porridge or onions and eggs. It’s all about calorie loading on an expedition like this. Though both men consume as many calories as possible, they still expend more calories than they take in. After all, there are only so many calories someone can carry in a sled and still be able to move it. 7:30-8:30 a.m. After breaking down his camp and packing his pulk, O’Brady clips into his harness and begins to ski at 7:30. The motion is much more like walking than it is skiing; pulling a massive sled is not exactly conducive to long, smooth skiing motions. Rudd fills two one-liter flasks with warm water, breaks camp and packs up his gear. After a last check of his campsite, he clips into his harness at 8:30 and begins to move. 8:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. O’Brady and Rudd take a similar approach to the day’s work, but with slightly different rhythms. O’Brady breaks the day up into eight 90-minute intervals. Rudd skis in eight or nine segments of 70 minutes each. For both men, the early days of the expedition were brutal. “The beginning was crazy,” Rudd, 49, said via satellite phone from his camp Monday night. “The weight was so heavy. I’ve never pulled anywhere near that before, and I’m not getting any younger.” O’Brady, who spoke via his satellite phone on Thanksgiving Day, described the first four or five days as very emotional. “Crying, frustrated, physically rocked,” he said. Both men also struggled to manage their perspiration. Sweat can be deadly in a polar environment because moisture can freeze on the skin when motion stops, which can send core temperatures plummeting toward hypothermia. Both men independently addressed the problem by skiing in just their base layers to stay cool and sweat-free. Their exertion kept them plenty warm despite the subfreezing temperatures. They have been climbing more than 9,000 feet from sea level to the South Pole (altitude 9,301 feet). They have felt the incline but haven’t always seen it, even on clear days, because there are rarely any points of reference they can use to gauge slope or distance. “You know by the pulk,” Rudd said. “You’re suddenly working 10 times harder. You look around and you can’t tell you’re going uphill, but you must be because you can really feel it.” After each segment, the men stop for five-minute breaks, taking a sip of warm water and eating a snack. O’Brady opts for a bite-size chunk of an organic, calorie-rich energy bar that his sponsor made for this expedition. Consisting of coconut oil, nuts and seeds and other ingredients, each chunk contains as many as 500 calories. Rudd grabs a fistful of chocolate and nuts or some salami and cheese from his “grazing bag.” The salami melts in his mouth, but the cheese has been frozen solid, so he keeps it tucked into his cheek like a hamster until it thaws, as he continues to move. 1:30 p.m. Rudd doesn’t bother to stop for lunch. O’Brady settles for a bowl of ramen noodles after his fourth 90-minute shift. He sits on his pulk, pours hot water from his thermos over a bowl of dried noodles and slurps away. 1:45 -7 p.m. Both Rudd and O’Brady can fire up their headphones when they want to. Rudd passes time by listening to ’80s music and audiobooks. He has already listened to a biography of Winston Churchill. O’Brady has downloaded podcasts, including The Rich Roll Podcast and The School of Greatness. He once listened to the Paul Simon album “Graceland” on repeat for an entire day. He said he enjoys the sounds of the nearly barren continent more than anything — his skis on the snow and ice, the wind streaming across the icescape. Rudd came into this race with far more experience. He had already traveled more than 2,000 miles on Antarctica. But it didn’t take long for O’Brady to find his stride. The biggest challenge of the first week was the sheer weight of the pulk. Week No. 2 brought an obstacle course of sastrugi. O’Brady continued to log a relatively high number of miles each day, though. Then, last week, the winds died down, and a frontal depression moved in from the Weddell Sea, bringing fog and snow. The men waded through a foot of fresh powder for four days. O’Brady charged as many as 20 miles in one day at first, then struggled to put up a string of 12-mile days. “I can’t control the surface conditions of the ground,” an exhausted O’Brady said on Thanksgiving, “but I know I can get out there and pull 12 hours every single day. That’s the mentality.” Rudd had so much trouble moving through snow on Thanksgiving, he took a risk, ferrying half his gear forward two miles with snow still falling. When he returned to find the other half, it was nowhere in sight. Fortunately, he had marked the location with his GPS and was able to dig it out from under the snow, but the experience shook him. If his GPS had failed at that moment, his expedition — and perhaps his life — would have been in grave danger. Once he managed to move all of his gear to the same spot, he opted to stop for the day. 7 p.m. Most days, Rudd skis for more than 10 hours. Whenever he feels like stopping, he marches an extra 11 steps before he sets up camp. It was once calculated, Rudd explained, that if the famed English explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his team had taken 11 more steps each day on their expedition in the early 1900s, they would have survived. After completing the 11th step, it takes him about 20 minutes to set up camp. 8 p.m. There is no nightfall in Antarctica at this time of year, but there is an end to the day of skiing. After about 10 hours, Rudd digs out a hole for his stove and begins melting snow into water for his warm recovery drink and a freeze-dried dinner — spaghetti Bolognese or chicken tikka. O’Brady stays on the move until roughly 8 p.m., and then sets up camp. In good conditions, it takes him about 20 minutes to unload his pulk and pitch his tent, but in strong winds it can take much longer. One day last week, with winds gusting at 40 m.p.h. late in the day, it took him 90 harrowing minutes. Once inside, O’Brady prepares his recovery drink and a bowl of chicken soup, then fills his two-liter thermos with water for the next day. Next, he enjoys a freeze-dried meal of his own. Then comes more work. There are nightly calls with their minders at Antarctica Logistics & Expeditions, the private company that arranges travel to the continent, and their expedition managers. Rudd’s team is led by Wendy Searle, a fellow polar adventurer from England. He files a daily audio blog and a picture of the day with Searle, which his sponsor posts online. O’Brady leans on his wife, Jenna Besaw. He sends her an Instagram post and answers at least one student’s question each weeknight via his satellite router; O’Brady’s expedition is being followed by students and teachers at 104 schools around the world. The last thing each does before bed at 11 p.m. is lay out or hang up their clothes to dry. Neither man has a change of clothes, or even fresh underwear. O’Brady did bring a spare pair of socks. As of Friday, they were both well over halfway to the South Pole, more than one-third through their entire 920-mile traverse, with O’Brady 12 miles ahead of Rudd. In a race as long and hard as this one, however, no lead is safe. Lately, Rudd, who has battled blisters since early in the expedition, has shown signs of renewed strength. He has nibbled into his deficit. O’Brady experienced stiffness and pain in his neck on Thanksgiving, but he didn’t consider it serious. They are both sore, but remain uninjured, if not undaunted. “A close friend of mine tragically lost his life attempting the same journey, and I can now appreciate what he went through,” Rudd said, referring to Henry Worsley, who died in 2016. “It is grueling, a different level to anything I’ve done before. So I kind of understand now what happened and why. It just takes so much out of you.” O’Brady doesn’t disagree, but he’s also found an unexpected perspective. “There’s something about the repetition and the monotony of the landscape that if you fight against it, if you start going ‘Oh, my God. I’m so lonely, I’m so cold,’” he added, “it seems like the anxiety can build quickly, but it can go the opposite way, too. I’ve been able to lock into some really deep, meditative, blissful states of mind.”",The New York Times
2018,Racist Slur Defaces African Burial Ground Monument in Lower Manhattan,"The African Burial Ground Monument in Lower Manhattan, a treasured site for the nation’s black community, was defaced with a racist slur on Thursday, the authorities said. In black marker, a vandal scrawled “Kill,” followed by the slur, on a plaque at the monument. The authorities said they did not have a suspect in the incident. Discovered in 1991 during construction of an office building, the six-acre burial ground is estimated to contain 15,000 intact skeletal remains of New York City’s colonial African-American community, who were not allowed at the time to be interred in traditional church cemeteries. Many were slaves. The monument, which is steps from City Hall, is considered a literal and figurative symbol of New York’s prominent and long-ignored role in colonial African-American culture. The graffiti was quickly scrubbed from the site on 290 Broadway. But soon after, the city was jarred by another incident of hate when “Kill All Jews” and other anti-Semitic slurs were discovered written inside a Brooklyn synagogue. The incidents came less than a week after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, killing 11 and wounding six. “Each day is getting worse,” said Hazel N. Dukes, the president of the New York State conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. According to a report from California University’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, hate crimes have increased in major American cities over the last two years. There were 339 hate crimes reported in New York City in 2017, according to the report. This year, 290 hate crimes in the city have been reported to the Police Department.",The New York Times

2018,Rains Turn Squalid Migrant Camp Near California Border Into Scene of Fetid Misery,"A downpour quickly flooded the open-air complex sheltering arrivals from Central America, reducing their few belongings to a soggy mess. CreditCredit TIJUANA, Mexico — The skies opened before the border did. A downpour, a blessing for this rain-starved region of Mexico, was a curse for thousands of migrants parked in a squalid encampment. Having started lightly overnight, the storm unleashed its full fury Thursday morning, quickly flooding the open-air sports complex near downtown Tijuana where most members of a migrant caravan from Central America have been parked since they started arriving two weeks ago. Within hours, nothing was left on the spit of dirt many had claimed and inhabited — in a tent, or a lean-to fashioned from plastic, blankets and tarp — except fetid muck. The little they had was reduced to piles of soggy blankets, backpacks and stuffed animals they struggled to protect under plastic sheets. Up to an inch of rain pounded Tijuana every hour, according to local meteorologists. Some families sought refuge under a large, overcrowded, open-sided tent. Madeline Julissa, 8, stood clutching a baby doll whose body was drier, and better covered, than her own; the girl wore a summer top and damp pants pushed up to mid-thigh. Her family of three, including her mother and baby sister, had lost their shelter, fashioned from plastic and tarp, to the heavy rainfall. Mothers wrapped babies in dirty blankets to keep them warm and dry. But they often lost sight of young children who could not resist playing in the rain, jumping in a dark, filthy river of water that lapped the sidewalk outside the encampment. A cacophony of coughs emanated from every corner and from inside tents — the ones still standing, which seemed to float on pools of muck. The rain raised widespread concerns about the spread of illnesses. So far, the Baja California state health department has provided medical care to about 2,200 people, mostly for respiratory infections. The migrants, mainly from Honduras and El Salvador, are desperate to start a new life in the United States. But for those who wish to apply for asylum, likely a minority, it will be weeks before they get the chance to present themselves at the San Ysidro checkpoint to make an asylum claim. Only 40 to 100 people a day are being processed by Customs and Border Protection. Despite the competition for scarce resources, including free meals and donated clothing, there were gestures of compassion and camaraderie among the refugees. People worked together to move tents, and helped salvage each other’s possessions and care for the sick. There was a plan by Mexican authorities to open another shelter before the storm. But it didn’t materialize in time. Migrants helped their neighbors protect tents that were being soaked with rain. Angeli Guadalupe, 11, whose little brother slept inside, shivered as she watched them. But it was no use: Rain water seeped in from above and below. Limbs and shoes were kept out of tents to avoid bringing mud inside during the downpour. At one tent, an ailing man hung his head outside to vomit. A group of migrants who found refuge under a large open-sided tent slept close together on the dirt to keep warm. The sound of rain and coughing could be heard everywhere. Mothers picked lice, which have infested the camp, out of their children’s hair. Arlen Cruz, 22, cradled her 2-year-old daughter and tried to draw strength from a Bible her husband offered her. But praying did little to slow the rain water, which swept both garbage and treasured belongings down through the camp in rushing currents. After journeying, in some cases, thousands of miles to reach the border, few at the camp felt they had anywhere to go. They were cold and wet, yet there was nowhere to get dry. “We must endure. We can’t afford a room or a hotel,” said Samuel Sorto, a migrant from Honduras whose family had to abandon their lean-to. Madeline Julissa, 8, along with her mother and baby sister, was hoping to join her father in Miami. “If someone turns themself into immigration, what are the chances they will be allowed in?” her mother, Sandra Julissa, 29, wondered aloud. Their shelter destroyed in the rain, they stuffed all they had left into three bags. Emi Escobar, 10, walked gingerly as she returned to her tent after using a portable toilet. But there was no way around the brown sludge that seeped into shoes, socks and tents. Some children played, oblivious to the deluge, while parents tried to keep their babies safe and dry. Respiratory illnesses had spread even before the rain. Valter Gutierrez, 12, who was feverish, huddled in a tent with his family. Not far away, a girl named Ashley, 7, was with her family, who said they had fled poverty and gangs in Honduras. When would their purgatory in the camp end, and what would come next? No one was sure, said Ashley’s father, José Paz. “We don’t know how we will cross into America.”",The New York Times
2018,"Raising Pressure on Nicaragua, U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Vice President","MEXICO CITY — The Trump administration imposed financial sanctions on Nicaragua’s vice president, Rosario Murillo, and a top aide on Tuesday, ratcheting up pressure on the Sandinista government to end its brutal crackdown on a popular uprising. Nicaragua has been convulsed since April, when peaceful student protests developed into a broad-based movement demanding the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and Ms. Murillo, who is his wife. Washington has called on the Nicaraguan government to move up elections as a way out of the crisis, but Mr. Ortega has said that he will serve out his term, which ends in 2021. Early attempts at talks between the government and a coalition of opposition leaders foundered. Over the summer, masked paramilitaries, often accompanied by the police, attacked protesters at barricades and regained control of the streets. Since then the government has rounded up and jailed opponents, charging many of them with terrorism. The Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights says that more than 320 people have been killed and more than 600 imprisoned since the unrest began. The Trump administration had already imposed sanctions on four high-ranking Nicaraguan officials when National Security Adviser John Bolton announced on Nov. 1 that Washington would harden its policy toward Nicaragua, which he described as part of Latin America’s “troika of tyranny” along with Cuba and Venezuela. Until “free, fair, and early elections” are held in Nicaragua, he said, the government “will feel the full weight of America’s robust sanctions regime.” The sanctions, which are imposed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, block access to any property that Ms. Murillo and the aide, Néstor Moncada Lau, might hold in the United States and prevent American financial institutions from doing any business with the two. The Treasury’s announcement was backed by an executive order signed by President Trump, who declared that the Ortega government’s actions constituted “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” The political unrest has stalled the country’s economy, which depends on tourism, agriculture and export-assembly plants. Fitch Ratings said Tuesday that it expected the economy to contract by 4 percent this year. Ms. Murillo, 67, has exerted outsize influence on the country since 2007, when Mr. Ortega, the 1980s revolutionary leader, won the presidential election and returned to power. Mr. Ortega established an increasingly autocratic rule, taking control over all branches of government. By naming Ms. Murillo as his vice president in the 2016 election, Mr. Ortega indicated that she would be his heir. Mr. Moncada Lau, 64, has long been part of the Ortegas’ inner circle and acts as their national security adviser, the Treasury Department said. “Nobody debates his rise to power as the guardian of the private affairs of the presidential family,” the Nicaraguan newspaper Confidencial wrote of Mr. Moncada Lau on Tuesday.",The New York Times
2018,"Rallies, Taxes and Bus Tours: Down to the Wire in Orange County","IRVINE, Calif. — The battle for control of Congress started in Southern California nearly a year ago — in a handful of districts represented by Republicans where Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, drew more votes than President Trump. With Election Day around the corner, these races remain among the most heavily contested in the nation, and polls show most of them up for grabs. Orange County has historically been a symbol of Republicanism — it is the birthplace of Richard M. Nixon — but its political composition has changed considerably over the past 10 years, reflecting the demographic shifts that have taken place across much of California. There are seven Republican-held seats in California that are viewed as vulnerable, and five of them are in or near Orange County. Their incumbents include some of the most conservative members of Congress, like Dana Rohrabacher and Darrell Issa (who is retiring this year), as well as Mimi Walters and Steve Knight, whose district is farther to the north in Los Angeles. (Another Southern California Republican who has drawn much attention — Duncan Hunter of San Diego, who was indicted earlier this year — does not appear to be as vulnerable). With these critical California battles in their final days, here is a look at some of the forces worth watching. Republican leaders, including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, faced a steep challenge at the start of the year: How to turn out Republican voters in California at a time of huge Democratic interest driven by anger with President Trump, with no Republican candidate for Senate and no real shot at the governorship. Their response is a ballot initiative that would repeal a gasoline tax passed by the Democratic-controlled state legislature last year over Republican objections. The ballot initiative unnerved Democrats, given that the only things less popular in California than taxes are gasoline taxes. But it looks as though the idea is not working out so well. Polls suggests that the repeal is headed to defeat, opposed by a coalition including labor, business and environmental leaders. A survey by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, released last week found the initiative losing by a wide margin, 56 percent to 40 percent. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, raised $40 million to defeat the repeal initiative, while proponents raised just $2.5 million. The governor made a rare election-season appearance on Friday to campaign against it. “Governor joins fray — but only for gas tax,” read the front-page headline in The San Francisco Chronicle. Republican leaders, facing tough races up and down the state, decided to spend their money on their candidates rather than on the repeal initiative. And some Democratic candidates tried to outmaneuver the Republicans by coming out in favor of repeal. “I made it clear that I opposed the gas tax on the grounds that it’s too regressive,” said Katie Porter, a Democrat from Irvine in a very tight race against Ms. Walters. “This was not a good time to be increasing the price that people pay at the pump.” Carl DeMaio, a Republican and former San Diego council member who is leading the repeal campaign, all but conceded defeat for his initiative, and blamed Republican leaders for walking away from it. “I don’t believe the Republican Party is using the gas tax issue as well as they should,” he said. One thing to keep in mind: For national Republicans, the goal here was not really to repeal the gas tax, but to draw a few more anti-gas-tax Republicans to the polls in crucial districts, where they would presumably vote for the Republican candidates. There have been rallies and leafleting about it in the districts where Republicans are struggling for survival. So in very close races, the repeal initiative could end up winning, even as it is losing. Matthew Sparks, a spokesman for Mr. McCarthy, said the gas tax illustrated the divide between Republicans and Democrats who controlled the California government, and would prove critical for Congressional candidates on Tuesday. As she stood in front of a half- dozen reporters on a recent morning, Young Kim boasted of her endorsements, her experience working as an aide to the congressman who represented the district for decades, and her independent streak. The news conference lasted 20 minutes, and was conducted entirely in Korean. Political and cultural transformations have swept across much of Southern California, and changed the dynamics in hard-fought races. None illustrates the changing face of Southern California’s suburbs better than the race in the 39th Congressional District, where Ms. Kim, a Republican, is running against Gil Cisneros, a Mexican-American who is seeking office for the first time. It is another of the super-tight California contests. Asians now make up about 22 percent of the district’s population, and Ms. Kim has relied heavily on her biography: Her parents left Korea in the 1940s and raised her in Guam and Hawaii, where she often served as their translator. “Most Democrats don’t know what to make of me,” she said. “I am a different kind of Republican — I am an immigrant. We have achieved our American dream, we see hope and possibility and positive change.” The district straddles northern Orange County, eastern Los Angeles County and a slice of San Bernardino. All those places have become magnets for immigrants and their children to settle, buy homes and open businesses in strip malls that often evoke architecture from Asia and Latin America. Mr. Cisneros moved to Yorba Linda, one of the wealthiest cities in the district and Richard Nixon’s birthplace, after winning a lottery jackpot. He used some of his winnings to run an education foundation, and then decided he was willing to pour millions of dollars into a campaign for Congress. His motivation, he said, came entirely after President Trump was elected. “If Young Kim goes to Washington, she is going to be a rubber stamp for the president,” Mr. Cisneros said in an interview at his field office in Brea. “That is certainly not what this district needs or wants.” Ms. Kim has walked a tightrope throughout the campaign. She sides with the president on some of his signature issues; she echoed his claim that the migrant caravan is dangerous, suggesting it would bring in “bad actors.” But she has opposed Mr. Trump’s family separation policy and his stances on so-called chain migration, noting that her own family and many other people in the district have benefited from family immigration sponsorships. California Democrats sent two of their biggest guns — Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor, and Senator Kamala Harris — to Southern California this weekend for a final round of get-out-the-vote rallies on behalf of the party’s congressional candidates. “We’re almost there — the finish line is right there,” Mr. Newsom shouted to a crowd at a hotel in Irvine Saturday afternoon, standing next to Ms. Porter. “Everything we’ve done to date won’t mean much if we don’t turn it on and turn it out on election night, and send a message to Donald Trump.” Ms. Harris drew big cheers from the overwhelmingly Democratic crowds. A sign reading “Kamala 2020” could be seen at the rally in Santa Clarita, where she was appearing on behalf of Katie Hill, the Democratic challenger to Mr. Knight. “This is a moment of time that requires us to fight for the best of who we are, so fight we will,” she said. “If it’s health care for all, let’s have that fight. If it’s civil rights for all, let’s have that fight. If it’s accepting science and getting rid of climate change, let’s have that fight.” This being California, Republicans could not quite match the Democrats when it comes to high-profile state elected officials. (Nor in celebrity power: Chelsea Handler, the comedian, was on hand at the rally in Irvine.) Democrats hold an overwhelming edge in party registration in the state and control every statewide office. But Republicans made an effort. John Cox, the Republican running against Mr. Newsom, announced his own bus tour that included appearances with Ms. Kim and Mr. Knight. Mr. Cox talked taxes and spending on what he called his “Help Is On the Way” tour. The question heard most often — of course — is who is going to win. That’s unanswerable, but here are a few things to consider. The New York Times has been conducting tracking polls in five competitive Southern California districts since Labor Day. The polls show all of them within the margin of error (though some of the polling is a few weeks old), with one exception: Mike Levin, a Democrat, seems well on his way to defeating Diane Harkey, a Republican, for the 49th District the seat now held by Mr. Issa. That was always one of the top Democratic targets, and Mr. Levin, an environmental activist, has been running there for a long time. But another Republican who Democrats thought was ripe for an upset, Mr. Rohrabacher — one of President Trump’s most ardent defenders in Congress — also appears to be very much in the game as he fights off a challenge from Harley Rouda, a former Republican turned Democrat. One final word of warning: it may not quite be over when it’s over. California is notoriously slow at counting ballots — particularly as the state has moved increasingly toward mail-in voting. In the June primary, two-thirds of the ballots were cast by mail. Elections officials have until Dec. 7 — you read that correctly — to certify the results. An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the Democratic candidate in the 39th Congressional District. He is Gil Cisneros, not Henry.",The New York Times
2018,"Ramona Ripston, California Civil Liberties Champion, Dies at 91","When Ramona Ripston was being interviewed in 1972 to be executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Southern California, an all-male board committee asked her questions like, How could she do the job while being the mother of small children? By the time they got around to asking what her priorities in the office would be, she hesitated only briefly before telling them point blank, “I’m going to change the board so that unfair questions like this don’t get asked again.” Despite her bluntness, or perhaps because of it, she got the job, becoming the first woman — and one of the few non-lawyers — to head an A.C.L.U affiliate. She went on to lead the affiliate for almost four decades, overhauling it into a crusading organization that broadened its scope beyond civil liberties to encompass matters of racial and economic justice. And as promised, she diversified the board, initially helping bring in more women and later, people of color and gays. Ms. Ripston, who had been in failing health for several months, died on Nov. 3 in Marina del Rey, said Hector Villagra, her successor as executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Southern California. She was 91. Over the years, Ms. Ripston spurred her affiliate — and the national organization — to a greater level of social activism, enlisting celebrities and ordinary citizens alike in her many causes. When she started with the American Civil Liberties Union affiliate in Los Angeles in 1972, it had six employees in one small office over a wig shop. By the time she left, in 2011, it had 50 employees in two offices. It now has 90 employees in four offices and is one of the premiere affiliates of the national A.C.L.U., which has stood on the front line of protecting civil liberties for nearly 100 years. “She took it from a small, ragtag group of committed activists and built it into a powerhouse,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the national A.C.L.U. “Obviously she cared about the core issues of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, but she pushed the envelope on education equality, police accountability, the rights of the homeless, of immigrants,” he said. “The Southern California office became the legal engine for many of the reforms and agendas that we would subsequently pursue for years. Her office was the pacesetter for this work.” As she often said in public speeches, “If you don’t have food on the table or a bed to sleep in, the promises we make to people about equity and justice are just illusions.” Among her notable achievements was starting litigation that resulted in a landmark settlement of nearly $1 billion in 2004 with the state of California to upgrade run-down schools in poor and minority neighborhoods. Another was a 2006 court decision that prevented the police from arresting homeless people for sleeping on sidewalks when they had nowhere else to go. She sued Los Angeles County for drawing political boundaries that the organization argued had denied Latino voters fair representation. She fought numerous attempts to limit abortion rights. In 1984, an A.C.L.U. SoCal lawsuit helped lead to the shutdown of the Los Angeles Police Department’s public disorder intelligence division, which had been accused of spying on elected officials and community activists and of infiltrating liberal organizations. Ms. Ripston quickly joined the outrage in 1991 over the beating of Rodney King, a black motorist who had been speeding, after several Los Angeles police officers were caught on videotape bludgeoning him with their nightsticks. The officers’ eventual acquittal on state criminal charges led to riots. In the kind of theatrical gesture at which she was adept, Ms. Ripston pushed her way to the front of a room at a crowded meeting carrying boxes of petitions calling for the resignation of the city’s police chief at the time, Daryl F. Gates, and dumped them on the table where Mr. Gates was sitting. (He later called her Ramona the Ripper and was eventually forced from office.) Later that year, when the national A.C.L.U. remained neutral on the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court, Ms. Ripston led the Southern California chapter to break ranks. “The board felt overwhelmingly that Clarence Thomas would not extend civil liberties and civil rights protection of the Supreme Court to the people in need of that protection,” she said at the time. Ms. Ripston was constantly challenging those in power, Mr. Romero said, including the governor of California, the mayor of Los Angeles and sometimes the national A.C.L.U. in New York, where the old guard has been less eager to stray outside the organization’s traditional role of defending First Amendment rights. “She survived the number of feathers she ruffled because she did it with such elegance and class and a great big smile,” Mr. Romero said, adding that she also had the determination to pursue the change she wanted. Her charm led another Los Angeles police chief, Ed Davis, to cross the divide at Ms. Ripston’s urging and attend an event sponsored by the A.C.L.U. SoCal. He was the city’s first police chief to do so. Ms. Ripston, a tall, thin former model with cascading blonde hair, cut a fashionable figure in the sometimes rumpled world of civil liberties litigation. “She could easily have been mistaken for Catherine Deneuve,” Mr. Villagra, her successor, said. “But she was an advocate through and through, and she was really impatient with people dragging their feet with injustice. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 “Beneath that glamorous exterior was a social justice warrior.” Ramona Ann Ripston was born on Feb. 18, 1927, in Queens. Her father, William Ripston, taught physics at Brooklyn College, and her mother, Elsie (Fleischman) Ripston, was a bookkeeper. She grew up in Queens and graduated in 1948 from Hunter College with a degree in political science. Unable to find a job in her field, she went into modeling and traveled the country as a consultant for the Barbizon School of Modeling and Acting. A department store advertisement from 1950 presented her as a lingerie expert, specializing in slips, and urged shoppers to come and “fire all your slip questions at her.” Bored with lingerie and always interested in civil liberties, Ms. Ripston turned to volunteering at the New York Civil Liberties Union; she joined the staff full time in 1965 and became public relations director. She quit in 1968 to join the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, saying the A.C.L.U. was not militant enough. Nonetheless, in 1972 she sought, and accepted, the position of executive director of A.C.L.U. of Southern California in Los Angeles. She served in that post until 2011, except for a period of 18 months beginning in 1986, when she was in charge of the western region for People for the American Way, the liberal advocacy group. Ms. Ripston was married five times. Driven by feminist instinct, she kept her maiden name. But she often said that her decision was a stroke of luck, since she had no inkling that she would marry so often. She is survived by two of her children, Laura Ripston and William Caplin, and three grandchildren; a second son, Mark Caplin, died in the early 1990s. Her final marriage, in 1991, was to Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt, a liberal lion on the very liberal United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. He died in March. An earlier version of this obituary misstated the position held by Daryl F. Gates when Ms. Ripston called for his resignation. He was the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, not the city’s police commissioner.",The New York Times
2018,Rams and Chiefs Add Defensive Pop in an Explosion of Points,"Rams 54, Chiefs 51 Everyone knew the points would come. And they did. In a Monday night matchup for the ages, the Los Angeles Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs locked horns in what was predicted to be an all-offense slugfest. Someone forgot to tell the defenses they were supposed to stay out of the way. In a game that featured wild momentum swings and had five touchdowns in the fourth quarter alone, the teams combined for seven forced turnovers and three defensive touchdowns, providing an unlikely source of scoring in the Rams’ eventual 54-51 victory. [Rams vs. Chiefs: Ken Belson says this scorefest is just the beginning] The rare late-season matchup between one-loss teams had been called a Super Bowl preview by many (though the New Orleans Saints might object to that characterization), and the oddsmakers took a look at these thrilling offenses and set a record for over-under in an N.F.L. game, 63.5 points. The teams surpassed that mark with 2 minutes 14 seconds left in the third quarter. They did not slow down from there, producing not only the highest-scoring “Monday Night Football” game ever, but the third-highest combined score ever, as well as the first game in N.F.L. history in which both teams topped 50 points. “It was a whirlwind,” Rams Coach Sean McVay said at his postgame news conference. “I feel like I might need a couple beverages to relax tonight.” Even with the defensive touchdowns, the quarterback duel between Jared Goff of the Rams and Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs did not disappoint. Goff, the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft, completed 31 of 49 passes for 413 yards and four touchdowns, and Mahomes, the No. 10 pick in the 2017 draft, completed 33 of 46 for 478 yards and six touchdowns. “It felt like a college game,” Goff said. “It was a lot of fun.” There were numerous offensive stars. Seven different receivers caught touchdown passes in the game — three players had two — and the offenses combined for 1,001 yards. But a huge factor for the Rams — who played at home after the game was moved from Mexico City last week because of poor field conditions there — was the stellar performance from Aaron Donald, the 2017 defensive player of the year, who has often had to watch as his team’s defense crumbled around him this season. On Monday night, though, Donald not only played above his usual standards but also got some serious help from the young linebacker Samson Ebukam as well as the team’s injury-depleted secondary. Donald first struck late in the second quarter, with the Chiefs leading by 17-16. He charged through the line, swung his right hand high in the air and swatted the ball away from Mahomes. The ball caromed far from the line of scrimmage before Ebukam scooped it up and ran untouched into the end zone — the first turnover of Mahomes’s career to result in a touchdown. On the Chiefs’ first drive of the second half, Donald again produced a strip-sack fumble, with the Rams scoring eight plays later on a 7-yard run by Goff. Ebukam, a fourth-round pick in 2017, scored again late in the third quarter when Mahomes tried to sneak a pass by him, and the linebacker tipped the ball to himself. Mahomes and Tyreek Hill, Kansas City’s undersized wide receiver, both tried to drag the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Ebukam to the ground, but he went through them with ease for a 25-yard touchdown, becoming the first player to have a sack, an interception, and multiple touchdowns in a game since the sack became an official statistic in 1982. But with an offense as potent as Kansas City’s, the game was still very much undecided even with the Rams ahead by 40-30 early in the fourth quarter. Sure enough, Mahomes connected on a 73-yard touchdown pass to Hill, and three plays later, the Chiefs’ much-maligned defense got its own big play. As Goff dropped back to pass near his own goal line, Justin Houston hit him and knocked the ball into the arms of Allen Bailey, who simply walked the ball into the end zone to give the Chiefs the lead. Goff, naturally, responded with a six-play, 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 7-yard pass to Gerald Everett. Then Mahomes put the Chiefs back in front with an eight-play, 65-yard scoring drive that made it 51-47 with 2:50 remaining in the game. But in a game where it seemed like the scoring would never end, Goff had the final say, finding Everett for a 40-yard touchdown pass that gave Los Angeles a 3-point lead. The Rams’ defense took care of the rest: Marcus Peters, a former Chief, ended one Kansas City drive with an interception, and in the final minute, Lamarcus Joyner provided another, letting Goff come out to kneel and end the game. “Until the final few seconds, you weren’t really able to breathe,” McVay said. The Rams improved to 10-1 and are on the verge of clinching the N.F.C. West (they would have clinched this week had Green Bay won on Thursday night.) The Chiefs, in Mahomes’s first year as a starter, fell to 9-2, and after a bye-week will try to get back to their winning ways in a road game against the Oakland Raiders.",The New York Times
2018,Rams vs. Chiefs Scorepalooza Is the Consequence of N.F.L.’s New Safety Rules,"On Pro Football LOS ANGELES — When the N.F.L. decided in the off-season to more strictly enforce helmet-to-helmet hits and roughing-the-passer penalties, league officials made a point of saying it was to enhance player safety. “Our focus is taking the head out of the game, to make sure we’re using the helmet as protection and not as a weapon,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said in March after the rules changes were adopted. What Goodell did not mention were the unintended consequence of those changes, which were on full display Monday night in Los Angeles in a record-setting football slugfest between the Rams and Kansas City Chiefs: an explosion of scoring that has rewarded fast, pass-heavy offenses and shredded even the strongest defenses. Monday night’s game was a perfect distillation of the new normal in the N.F.L. Two of the league’s most prolific offenses put on an entertaining show that left the Chiefs (9-2) on the short end of a 54-51 showdown with the Rams (10-1). The teams scored a combined 105 points as two of the league’s brightest star quarterbacks — Jared Goff of the Rams and Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs — swapped big play after big play, combining for more than 1,000 yards of offense. Of course, this is the N.F.L., so there were also a multitude of questionable penalties, messy and game-defining turnovers and, for good measure, two missed extra points. Despite all that, the game was the third highest scoring game ever, and the first time both teams each scored at least 50 points. The game was, in the parlance of hyperventilating announcers, an “instant classic,” only this time, the phrase wasn’t hyperbole. Dan Marino, Kurt Warner and Brett Favre taught us that scoring sells. But the way points are being scored this year is more akin to the wide open college game. The teams scored with such ease that they blew through a record pregame over/under of 64 points with more than two minutes left in the third quarter. “You’d like to win by more than 3 and score 50, but that’s the way it happened today,” Goff said afterward. The blizzard of points is not exactly what the N.F.L. envisioned in the off-season, but who are they to complain? If you’re an owner, a league sponsor or a network executive, the points bonanza has been magic for television ratings, which declined the past two years. This has given the league a much-needed boost after several years of off-field controversies, including players committing domestic violence, protests during the national anthem and deflated footballs. It would be easy to view the Rams-Chiefs showdown as a unicorn game, a once-in-a-generation aberration. But gunslinging offenses are a trend. The Chiefs are the first team since 1966 to lose two games despite scoring 40 or more points. Right after losing to the Patriots, 43-40, in Week 6, they scored 45 points against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Rams’ only loss of the season came two weeks ago in New Orleans to the Saints, 45-35. Two decades ago, the St. Louis Rams were the Greatest Show on Turf. Now several teams are vying for that title. Monday’s game was billed as a potential preview of the Super Bowl. Even if these two teams aren’t playing for the title in February, whoever does may put up just as many points. Monday’s game was more than just a scoring bonanza, it was an unofficial proxy on the N.F.L.’s return to Los Angeles after more than two decades. This is the Rams’ third season back in California. They received a lukewarm reception the first year, and won over some skeptics last year by winning 11 games. Now 10-1, the Rams have worked their way back into relevance in part because Monday’s game helped fans in and around Los Angeles forget, even for a few hours, the events of the past week and a half. On Nov. 7, a gunman killed a dozen people in Thousand Oaks, near the Rams’ training facility and offices. Then deadly wildfires raged nearby, forcing some players, coaches and staff out of their homes. The Rams managed to beat the Seattle Seahawks at home last Sunday, then flew to Colorado Springs to train at altitude in preparation for Monday’s game, which was scheduled to be played in Mexico City. A day after arriving in Colorado, the Rams learned that the league was moving the game to Los Angeles because of problems with the field at Azteca Stadium. The Rams stayed in Colorado until Saturday anyway. The Rams scrambled to host the Chiefs. They gave away about 4,000 tickets to emergency workers, firefighters and the families of victims of the shooting in Thousand Oaks, and honored the 12 victims of the shooting before the game. Los Angeles sports fans are sometimes mocked for their casual devotion to their teams. But Monday, on relatively short notice, more than 77,000 tickets were distributed. They were richly rewarded with a game for the ages at a time when the city — and the league — needed it most. “Games like this rarely live up to the hype,” Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer. “This is kind of a Hollywood script.”",The New York Times
2018,"Randolph Braham, 95, Holocaust Scholar Who Saw a Whitewash, Dies","Randolph L. Braham, who as the foremost American scholar of the Holocaust in Hungary, his homeland, rejected that country’s highest award to protest what he denounced as an official whitewash of its collusion in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews during World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 95. His son Robert said the cause was heart failure. Professor Braham (pronounced BRAY-ham) had felt too weak on the eve of a farewell speech he was scheduled to deliver on Nov. 14 at the Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies, which he founded at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in Manhattan. He canceled the lecture and was hospitalized the next day. The title of the speech, “The Struggle Between the History and Collective Memory of the 20th Century: The Holocaust vs. Communism,” encapsulated the competing visions that Professor Braham, a Holocaust survivor himself, sought to reconcile in the more than 60 books he wrote or edited. His monumental “The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary” (1981) and his three-volume “The Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary” (2013) provided the basis for what Prof. Maria M. Kovacs of Central European University, in welcoming him to Budapest last year, described as “an immensely precise, panoramic and microscopic study of the Hungarian Holocaust.” She characterized Professor Braham as “a moral compass for our profession.” In 2014, when he was in his early 90s, that compass proved to be as acute as ever. Professor Braham was outraged at the time by what he described as attempts by Hungary’s current nationalist government to equate the murder of nearly 600,000 Jews in Hungary with the suffering of other Hungarians under the German occupation — “a German occupation, as the record clearly shows, that was not only unopposed but generally applauded” by the country’s wartime regime, he wrote. In response he publicly returned the Order of Merit he had received for his research in 2011. He also asked that his name be removed from the Library and Information Center of the Holocaust Memorial Center, or Holokauszt Emlekkozpont, in Budapest, the country’s capital. “I realize that for a variety of political and economic reasons the leaders responsible for the operation of the Holokauszt Emlekkozpont would or could not speak out against the brazen drive to falsify history,” he wrote to the president of the center. “I, on the other hand, a survivor whose parents and many family members were among the hundreds of thousands of murdered Jews, cannot remain silent, especially since it was my destiny to work on the preservation of the historical record of the Holocaust.” Professor Braham conducted that work over three decades, from 1962, when City College hired him to be a lecturer, until 1992, when he retired as a distinguished professor of political science there. He founded the Rosenthal Institute in 1979 and continued to serve as its director. Professor Braham’s public gesture in 2014 reflected what Vincent Boudreau, the president of City College, lauded as “his characteristic combination of deep personal involvement and meticulously precise scholarship.” Frances Degen Horowitz, the president emerita of the Graduate Center, added that while Professor Braham had painstakingly documented the past, he had also shown “a keen eye for current events, calling out those events and actions that portend a repetition of some of the devastating events of the past."" Professor Braham was born Adolf Abraham on Dec. 20, 1922, in Bucharest, Romania, to Lajos and Eszter (Katz) Abraham. He grew up poor in Dej, a small city in Transylvania. His father was a laborer, and his mother was a homemaker in a house that had no electricity. After Hungary seized control of the region in 1940, their son was barred from public high school because he was Jewish. His parents, who could not afford tuition at a religious school, registered him at an independent school, where he could fulfill assignments without attending classes. From 1943 to 1945 he was forced to serve in a Hungarian army slave labor battalion in Ukraine. Captured by the Soviets, he escaped and was sheltered by a Hungarian Christian farmer, Istvan Novak, who was later honored by Israel as a Righteous Among the Nations, an award given to non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews during World War II. With the war over, he returned to Dej to discover that his parents had been deported and killed at Auschwitz. They had been among the first Jews shipped there from Northern Transylvania in 1944 after Germany, afraid that Hungary was bolting the Axis cause, invaded the country and began rounding up the Jews whom the government had persecuted but not deported. His sister, also sent to Auschwitz, survived. Making his way to Berlin, Professor Braham served as a translator for the United States Army. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and became a citizen in 1953, at that point changing his name to Randolph Louis Braham. He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and government and a master of science in education from City College. In 1952 he received a doctorate in political science from the New School for Social Research (now the New School). His marriage to Elizabeth Sommer, another Holocaust survivor, ended when she died in 2014. In addition to their son Robert, Professor Braham is survived by another son, Steven; two grandsons; and his partner, Mary Maudsley, a retired lawyer. At City College, Professor Braham taught comparative politics and Soviet studies and was chairman of the political science department. He also provided the historical narrative in “The Last Days,” James Moll’s Oscar-winning 1998 documentary, produced by Steven Spielberg, on the Holocaust in Hungary. Professor Braham dedicated “The Politics of Genocide” to his parents. “At a time when quack ‘history’ books maintaining that the Holocaust was all in the fevered Zionist imagination reach library shelves all over the world,” Elenore Lester wrote in The New York Times Book Review, “it is a comfort that this book will stand there, too, in its immense and meticulous documentation.” In the book, Professor Braham appraised the world’s response to the Holocaust unsparingly. “The leaders of the free world, including those of the Vatican and the International Red Cross, attached no particular urgency to the rescuing of Jews,” he wrote, and the Allies “were reluctant to liberalize their immigration policies.” They “also refused to divert resources from their war effort,” he added, “arguing — not without merit — that the quickest possible defeat of Nazi Germany was also in the best interests of the oppressed Jews.” Professor Braham “loved Hungary, and he wanted to shield us against the resurrection of our darkest demons,” Andras Heisler, president of the Association of Hungarian Jewish Religious Communities, wrote this week on the website Hungarian Spectrum. “Thanks to Professor Braham, we will never be able to free ourselves from the truth.”",The New York Times
2018,"Random Moments, Petty Lies and Quiet Pleasures","In “Taradiddle,” Charles Traub’s photographs reveal how life plays tricks on us all. Photography seems like a truthful medium. Photographs are used for scientific and forensic evidence for their supposed truthfulness. Even Edgar Allan Poe thought daguerreotypes disclosed “a more absolute truth, a more perfect identity of aspect with the thing represented.” So why did Charles Traub call his new book of photographs “Taradiddle”? “A taradiddle is by definition a petty lie, a little falsehood or trifling told often to amuse or embellish a story,” he said. “As our world is full of them, seen and witnessed through advertising, P.R., propaganda, flirtations, staged events and presentations of all sorts, I simply came to the conclusion that even the straightest of photographs made in real-world witness was also such.” Mr. Traub — who established the MFA Photography, Video and Related Media department at the School of Visual Arts where he is now chair — also believes that “the frame of the photograph recontextualizes everything around it.” His book, published this month by Damiani, is a collection of random moments, mostly in public spaces. Mr. Traub’s taradiddles appear not just within the layers of his frame but in his careful combination of images afterward, a practice similar to that of Nathan Lyons, who thought bringing two photos together on a spread created an entirely different third meaning. Using scale, depth of field, and ironic pairings of subjects, Mr. Traub creates a whimsical world. A woman in a polka-dot shirt passes by a Dalmatian, both appearing as tonal twins. A man casually leans on a tank while children play on the gun turret. Nobody seems to mind. Two photographs of very large trees share a spread, one is in a pot, the other in the ground. Next to the humans in the frame, both trees look absurdly large. “I’ve always been interested in humor,” Mr. Traub said, “and I think our medium is sort of devoid of humor.” Yet Mr. Traub, who has worked almost exclusively in color since the mid-1970s and with a digital camera since the late 1990s, doesn’t set out to photograph these casual absurdities. He doesn’t shoot with any one theme or group in mind. And he never constructs pictures. He’s interested in what he calls “real-world witness,” or collecting his observations from reality. “I just decided, be free,” he said. “Photograph whatever you see and respond to and it’ll fall together in some meaningful way.” That freedom, and the passage of time, led him to sequence about four years ago. Using a cheap printer and a pin board, he examined relationships between photographs. His assistant at the time suggested the word taradiddles. “I loved the way it sounded,” he said. “It just fit.” Mr. Traub was born in 1945 in Louisville, Kentucky. Like so many photographers, he received his first camera from his father. But it was at the University of Illinois, where he majored in English, that he was first moved by a photograph, a local landscape by Art Sinsabaugh. So he enrolled in a photography course. Mr. Sinsabaugh, along with Aaron Siskind, would later become his teachers at the Institute for Design in Chicago. His first solo show was in the late 1960s at Ralph Eugene Meatyard’s small optometrist shop gallery in Kentucky, which helped establish Mr. Traub in the art world. Now, in addition to his work at the School of Visual Arts, Mr. Traub is focused on combing through his digital files, looking for more whimsical connections. “Comedy, in a way, is much harder than tragedy to perform,” he said. “And I think we need to deal with our social traumas with a little levity.”",The New York Times
2018,Rangers Edge Blue Jackets in Shootout,"N.H.L. Roundup Jimmy Vesey scored in the fifth round of the shootout to lift the Rangers over the host Columbus Blue Jackets, 5-4, on Saturday night. Vesey beat goalie Joonas Korpisalo after the Blue Jackets’ Oliver Bjorkstrand was stopped by Alexander Georgiev to give the Rangers their fifth win in six games, bringing their record to 5-0-1. The score remained tied at 4-4 through the third period despite an 11-2 shot advantage by Columbus and a scoreless five-minute overtime period. The Blue Jackets outshot the Rangers, 38-19, for the game. Kevin Shattenkirk and Mika Zibanejad also scored in the shootout for the Rangers. Artemi Panarin and Anthony Duclair each had a goal for the Blue Jackets. Vesey and Pavel Buchnevich each had a goal and an assist in regulation, and Zibanejad and Chris Kreider also scored for the Rangers. Georgiov stopped 34 shots. Pierre-Luc Dubois had a goal and assist for Columbus, and Cam Atkinson, Alexander Wennberg and Nick Foligno also scored. Seth Jones had three assists. Korpisalo finished with 15 saves. Zibanejad scored the opening goal on a 2-on-1 rush 5 minutes 54 seconds into the game. Columbus tied it late in the first when Dubois threaded a pass into Atkinson, who tipped it in for a power-play goal. Another odd-man rush allowed Buchnevich to beat Korpisalo and give the Rangers the lead in the second period. Kreider tapped in his team-leading eighth goal of the season off a pass from Kevin Hayes later in the second to push the Rangers’ lead to 3-1. The Blue Jackets tied the score again in the second with two goals in a 32-second span. Dubois got credit for redirecting a one-timer by Jones, and Foligno tipped in the second from the door step on a rush. Wennberg got his first of the season, a short-handed tally off the post to put the Blue Jackets ahead. But the Columbus lead did not last long. Vesey capped the scoring in the busy second period to knot the score once more at the second intermission. PANTHERS 4, ISLANDERS 2 Aleksander Barkov scored the go-ahead goal in the third period as the Florida Panthers beat the visiting Islanders. Troy Brouwer, Mike Hoffman and Denis Malgin also scored for the Panthers, who won their third straight. Roberto Luongo made 29 saves for his third consecutive victory after missing nearly a month with a knee injury. Brock Nelson and Mathew Barzal scored for the Islanders, who have lost three in a row after winning their previous five. Robin Lehner had 27 saves.",The New York Times
2018,"Rangers, Led by Lundqvist’s 39 Saves and Vesey’s Two Goals, Top Sabres","N.H.L. Roundup Henrik Lundqvist was in vintage form in helping the Rangers get a big win on Sunday night. Lundqvist stopped 39 shots and Jimmy Vesey scored twice to lead the Rangers to their third straight victory, 3-1 over the Buffalo Sabres at Madison Square Garden. Lundqvist picked up his fourth win of the season and 435th of his career. He is now two victories behind Jacques Plante for seventh place on the N.H.L.’s career list. “I think we earned this type of game,” Lundqvist said, adding, “Tonight, we made some really strong plays at the right time.” Lundqvist appeared to be injured late in the second period when Rasmus Dahlin, the first overall pick in June’s entry draft, collided with his Swedish compatriot. After an extended visit from the trainer, Lundqvist remained in the game. Neal Pionk also scored for the Rangers. Conor Sheary scored for Buffalo, and Carter Hutton made 19 saves. The Rangers made the most of their first two shots in the second, scoring twice in 19 seconds. Pionk scored 41 seconds into the period when his wrist shot sailed past Hutton. On the Rangers’ next shooting attempt, Vesey, set up by a nifty drop pass from Brett Howden, scored on a wrist shot from the slot to make it 2-0. Vesey added an empty-netter with 1 minutes 51 seconds left in the game. Howden, a rookie, crashed hard into the boards later in the second period before being helped off the ice. He did not return. KINGS FIRE COACH The struggling Los Angeles Kings fired Coach John Stevens just 13 games into his second season. Willie Desjardins will be the team’s interim coach for the rest of the regular season, General Manager Rob Blake said. Los Angeles entered the day with the fewest points in the Western Conference after a 4-8-1 start and last in the league with 2.15 goals a game. The Kings, who have been without the injury-plagued goalie Jonathan Quick for all but four games, have been outscored, 45-28, but they had won two of their past three games after a six-game losing streak. The Kings went 45-29-8 under Stevens last season, finishing fourth in the Pacific Division and being swept by Vegas in the first round of the playoffs. Desjardins coached the Vancouver Canucks from 2014 to 2017.",The New York Times
2018,"Rapid Cure Approved for Sleeping Sickness, a Horrific Illness","Global health Parasites transmitted by tsetse flies travel to the brain, causing paranoia, fury and death. Until now, killing them required hospitalization and harsh drugs. The first treatment for sleeping sickness that relies on pills alone was approved on Friday by Europe’s drug regulatory agency, paving the way for use in Africa, the last bastion of the horrific disease. With treatment radically simplified, sleeping sickness could become a candidate for elimination, experts said, because there are usually fewer than 2,000 cases in the world each year. The disease, also called human African trypanosomiasis, is transmitted by tsetse flies. The protozoan parasites, injected as the flies suck blood, burrow into the brain. Before they kill, drive their victims mad in ways that resemble the last stages of rabies. The personalities of the infected change. They have terrifying hallucinations and fly into rages; they have been known to beat their children and even attack family members with machetes. They may become ravenous and scream with pain if water touches their skin. Only in the end, do they lapse into a long coma and die. The new drug, fexinidazole, cures all stages of the disease within 10 days. Previously, everyone with the parasites found in a blood test also had to undergo a spinal tap to see if the parasites had reached their brains. If so, patients had to suffer through a complex and sometimes dangerous intravenous regimen requiring hospitalization. An oral treatment that can safely be taken at home “is a completely new paradigm — it could let us bring treatment down to the village level,” said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, founder and executive director of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, which was started in 2005 by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders to find new cures for tropical diseases. Previous treatments for sleeping sickness ranged from inconvenient to nightmarish. The current intravenous drug, eflornithine, must be given over many days with intravenous fluids that weigh about 125 pounds, a big burden in the supply chain for rural hospitals, Dr. Pecoul said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Melarsoprol, the intravenous treatment used until a decade ago, contains an arsenic derivative. It corroded veins, triggered convulsions and killed 5 percent of the patients who got it. “An all-oral treatment has been a dream of mine for decades,” said Dr. Victor Kande, an adviser to the health ministry of the Democratic Republic of Congo who oversaw clinical trials of the drug. “This is a huge leap in how we can tackle this disease.” Getting fexinidazole tested and approved is one of the neglected disease initiative’s biggest triumphs. The drug was created in the 1980s by Hoechst, a German drug company, but later abandoned. In 2009, seeking new anti-parasitic medicines, the initiative asked Sanofi, which held the patent, to reformulate it for sleeping sickness. Ultimately, the drive for approval cost $63 million and involved clinical trials including 750 patients in Congo and the Central African Republic. Two million villagers were screened. The costs were paid by seven European countries, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders and other donors. About 65 million people live in regions in west and central Africa where the most common strain of sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, circulates. A less common form circulates in southern Africa, and the harsh, older treatments are still needed to cure it.",The New York Times
2018,"Rapper 6ix9ine Was Part of a Violent Street Gang, Prosecutors Say","[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox] The Brooklyn-based rapper and Instagram star known as 6ix9ine, whose talent as a performer is often overshadowed by a magnetic attraction to trouble, was part of a violent gang that sold drugs, robbed rivals and shot at people who crossed them, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Monday. The rapper, whose legal name is Daniel Hernandez, 22, was charged along with five other men, some of whom were once part of his management team, including Kifano Jordan, known as Shottie. Mr. Hernandez and Mr. Jordan were part of a gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, and committed a series of violent crimes and drug-trafficking offenses, including attempted murder and armed robbery, the indictment said. In one instance, the indictment said, a plan to shoot someone who had been disrespectful to the group led to a July 16 shooting of an innocent bystander in the foot. On April 21, one of the men shot at a rival inside the Barclays Center, but no one was hit. Gang members also robbed a man at gunpoint in Times Square in April, in an attack that prosecutors said was directed, and filmed, by Mr. Hernandez himself. “This gang, which included platinum-selling rap artist Tekashi 6ix9ine, wreaked havoc on New York City, engaging in brazen acts of violence,” Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement, referring to Mr. Hernandez by another stage name he has used. Investigators from the New York Police Department and two federal agencies — Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Homeland Security Investigations — were involved in the case. Mr. Hernandez and four of the five other men appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday and were ordered jailed without bail by Magistrate Judge Henry Pittman. They did not enter pleas, though Mr. Hernandez’s lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, portrayed his client as a target, not a ringleader, of the gang, saying that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned him last Saturday that his safety was in danger. Monday’s charges are the most serious in a series of legal problems for Mr. Hernandez, who has spent the last two years creating a divisive brand for himself. One of the charges he faces carries a minimum prison sentence of 25 years, if he is convicted. Just last week Mr. Hernandez pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges stemming from an incident with a police officer in Brooklyn earlier this year. Last month, he was sentenced to four years’ probation — including requirements that he stop affiliating with known gang members — after he pleaded guilty to using a child in a sexual performance. Mr. Hernandez had participated in a video that featured a 13-year-old girl performing a sex act, which he then posted online, prosecutors said. Mr. Hernandez, then 18, said at the time that he did not know the girl’s age and told the police that his “persona is just for shock value.” In deciding to deny him bail on Monday, Judge Pittman noted that when the F.B.I. raided an apartment Mr. Hernandez had been renting in September, agents found an AR-15 firearm and a backpack containing credit cards and identification of the man robbed in Times Square. The judge called the discovery of the stolen goods “compelling evidence corroborating his involvement” and the firearm “very troubling.” Mr. Hernandez’s career had seemed destined for success. He had built a following on SoundCloud and Instagram, where he has 15 million followers. His debut single, “Gummo,” went platinum and reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three subsequent songs cracked the Top 50, including “Fefe,” with Nicki Minaj, which also went platinum and peaked at No. 3. His debut album, “DAY69,” came out in February and reached No. 4 on the Billboard album chart. Over the weekend, Mr. Hernandez announced that his follow-up album, “Dummy Boy,” would be released Friday and feature two songs with Kanye West. But his buzz in the industry came with, and was intensified by, a dark cloud of internet beef that often metastasized into violence. Last month, just hours after he was sentenced to probation in the video case, he went to a restaurant on Manhattan’s Upper East Side to meet the head of his record label. A melee broke out, and a bodyguard for Mr. Hernandez fired a gun. Mr. Jordan was charged with assault in connection with the melee. The man injured in the shooting, Faheem Walter, known as Crippy, was also charged in the gang indictment unsealed on Monday. Earlier this month, just two weeks after the restaurant shooting, there was a shooting at a home in Beverly Hills, Calif., where Mr. Hernandez was filming a music video set to feature Mr. West and Ms. Minaj. In August, shots were fired during the filming of a music video in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, starring Mr. Hernandez and the rapper 50 Cent. In July, Mr. Hernandez was kidnapped and robbed in Brooklyn. Though he said he would decline to cooperate with the police in that investigation, a former member of his management team was arrested and charged with the robbery this month. Mr. Hernandez said last week in a radio interview with The Breakfast Club that he was cleaning house after the incidents and adhering to the judge’s orders in the video case by distancing himself from Mr. Jordan. “Everybody is gone — get out of my life,” he said. (The YouTube version of the interview has been viewed more than four million times.) The rapper added that his only legitimate business partner was Elliot Grainge, the founder of 10k Projects, Mr. Hernandez’s record label. Representatives for 10k Projects did not immediately comment on the latest arrest and how it might affect the release of the new 6ix9ine album. According to Mr. Hernandez’s lawyer, Mr. Lazzaro, after Mr. Hernandez announced in the interview that he was getting rid of his management team, the F.B.I. brought him in to warn him that agents had heard on wiretaps that some or all of the men, whom Mr. Lazzaro called “bad apples,” intended to “super violate” Mr. Hernandez in retaliation. He was offered round-the-clock surveillance but refused it, Mr. Lazzaro said. A prosecutor, Michael Longyear, said that Mr. Hernandez was arrested on Sunday after law enforcement officials learned that he planned to travel to Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, where they feared he might be a catalyst for violence. “The defendant is a violent man,” Mr. Longyear said. Mr. Hernandez seemed to foretell his fate in the interview last week, though he may not have known just how many agencies were tracking his movements. “Only two things I’m scared of in life,” he said. “God first, and the F.B.I.”",The New York Times
2018,Rapper Is Jailed for 12 Days in Russia as a Culture War Spreads,"MOSCOW — A provincial court has sentenced one of Russia’s most high-profile rappers to 12 days in jail in the latest culture war skirmish about what constitutes acceptable entertainment. The court in the southern city of Krasnodar on Thursday sentenced the rapper, Dmitri Kuznetsov, 25, known as Husky, on charges of hooliganism and of refusing to take a medical test, Russian news outlets reported. His offense? Climbing atop a car after one of his concerts was canceled without explanation and treating his disappointed fans to about 30 seconds of his music. The sentence is the latest in a series of confrontations pitting rappers against law enforcement, local officials or vigilante groups who have pushed to shut down a musical genre that the authorities say promotes drug use, suicide and other social ills. It comes amid a campaign by President Vladimir V. Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church to promote family values, with ambitious officials or groups often pushing initiatives they apparently hope will attract the Kremlin’s attention. On Nov. 1, for instance, Vladimir Petrov, a deputy in the Leningrad regional assembly, sent a letter to Russia’s prosecutor general asking that rap concerts be banned. “Many musical compositions that are popular with young people openly advocate suicide, drug addiction, Satanism, extremism and even contain calls for treason against the Motherland,” the letter said. Mr. Petrov wrote that the lyrics “abound” with “obscene language, extremist turns of phrase and elicit enmity among citizens,” which lead to brawls and other illegal activity. Mr. Kuznetsov’s lawyer, Aleksei Avanesyan, echoed the common criticism that some officials were looking more to impress the Kremlin than to address real problems. “It is easy — you don’t have to think about roads and hospitals, you can score points with simple bans,” he said. “The way they do it here is ban it first and then see what happens.” Mr. Kuznetsov is not alone in facing problems with the authorities. Russian government agencies have banned a variety of songs from YouTube over the lyrics, and a hip-hop group called Friendzone had two concerts canceled in the provinces in November with no explanation given. In the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, a vigilante group calling itself Anti-Dealer said it had worked with the police, the district attorney and the Culture Ministry to shut down the Friendzone concerts. “It is a crime against the nation to sing about drugs, same-sex love and perversion,” the group said in a statement on its page on Vkontakte, a Russian version of Facebook. It called on other Russian cities to evict the group. The legal proceedings against Mr. Kuznetsov were widely criticized. Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s leading opposition figure — whose recent protests have attracted a young demographic akin to Mr. Kuznetsov’s fan base — said that the government needed to be confronted over any attempt to limit free speech. Speaking on his YouTube talk show, Mr. Navalny said that the Russian state sought to silence everyone, wanting all Russians to behave like orderly schoolchildren. The lyrics Mr. Kuznetsov had recited on the car were from a song that was not so much about taking drugs as about the conditions that lead to it, he noted, saying, “This song is about poor people who use drugs because of their poor life; they are miserable and everything is awful.” Zakhar Prilepin, a writer who made his name with a gritty novel describing the life of young soldiers in the Chechen wars and who went on to organize fighters in the separatist regions of Ukraine, wrote a screed on Facebook in support of the rapper. His post said that “pseudomusical scum who sow vulgarity and stupidity” and hang out in their dachas abroad won medals, while the respect of the young for their country was being crushed by actions like those against Mr. Kuznetsov. “Get out of my face you ghouls,” he wrote. In court, Mr. Kuznetsov said that he had been forced into the position of addressing his fans in the street because they had not been allowed into the concert hall and that he had felt responsible for the canceled event. “I felt I needed to talk to them, that they needed to hear from me,” Mr. Kuznetsov told the court in a video posted by Open Russia, an opposition media group. Two of his other concerts were canceled in a similarly abrupt, unexplained manner, he told the court. “We did not get any official documents or official reasons for that.” The jail time could cause the rapper, who was in the middle of a 15-city tour, to miss six more concerts. One video showed the singer climbing onto a red sedan and shouting two lines from one of his most popular songs — “I will sing my music, aye, the most honest music, aye” — before the police hauled him off the car. A YouTube video of that song has attracted 2.5 million views. The music of Mr. Kuznetsov, born in eastern Siberia, sometimes has a political edge. One song from 2011, “October 7,” which happens to be Mr. Putin’s birthday, details a sumptuous feast served to a king while ordinary people endure poverty. Many view his newer songs as political just for discussing the frustrations of daily Russian life. Yet as a journalism student, Mr. Kuznetsov reportedly worked for state-controlled news media from the separatist areas of Ukraine and expressed sympathy for some of its leaders. He also rapped last year in a stage production by a Russian director, Kirill Serebrennikov, who is currently on trial on what he and government critics call baseless charges of embezzling state funds.",The New York Times
2018,Raptors Beat Knicks to Improve to League-Best 12-1,"N.B.A. Roundup A big effort from the bench helped make up for rare off-nights by two of the Toronto Raptors’ biggest scoring threats on Saturday. Pascal Siakam scored a career-high 23 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and host Toronto beat the Knicks, 128-112, improving its league-leading record to 12-1. Kawhi Leonard scored a season-low 12 points, failing to reach 20 for the second time in nine games. Kyle Lowry scored 10 points, one better than his season worst. “That was our focus, to really do a job on those two,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “You’ve got to pick a poison, and their role players really stepped up and made shots.” OG Anunoby scored 16 points, and Serge Ibaka and Delon Wright each had 12 as the Raptors won their sixth straight home meeting with the Knicks and improved to 7-0 at home this season. Toronto, which had a season-high 62 bench points, has won six straight over all. “Everyone is confident, everyone is working hard and just playing the game,” Siakam said. “It doesn’t matter what night it is, we just want to go out there and play.” Toronto’s Nick Nurse became the first coach to win 12 of his first 13 games since Lawrence Frank started 13-0 with the Nets in 2004. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 27 points and Enes Kanter had 15 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks, who have lost 16 of their past 19 against the Raptors. Siakam shot 6 for 7, including a career-best three 3-pointers, and went 8 for 9 at the free-throw line. He made up for a quiet night from Leonard, who did not make his first basket until a layup with 45 seconds to go in the first half. Leonard shot 2 for 7, missing his two 3-point attempts. After missing all six of his field-goal attempts in Wednesday’s win at Atlanta, the Knicks rookie Kevin Knox shot 4 for 11 and finished with 12 points. Toronto led by 64-53 at halftime, but the Knicks shaved the gap to three points with a 12-4 run to start the second half. The Knicks closed to one behind, but the Raptors outscored them, 30-13, over the final 8 minutes 51 seconds of the third to take a 100-82 lead. The Knicks, who host Orlando on Sunday, missed 10 of their first 11 shots from 3-point range and finished 6 for 22 from outside the arc. WARRIORS 116, NETS 100 Kevin Durant had 28 points and 11 assists, and Quinn Cook scored a season-high 27 in place of the injured Stephen Curry to help host Golden State beat the Nets. Two days after the Warriors lost Curry to a groin injury in a 23-point home loss to Milwaukee, and with Draymond Green also missing from the lineup, Durant led the way as Golden State ended the Nets’ three-game winning streak. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said that Curry was feeling better. Cook also filled in admirably when Curry missed time with injuries last season. “I just feel like Quinn thinks that he’s always supposed to be ready no matter what,” Durant said. “When his number is called, he’s able to go out there and produce, and that’s just because of the work he puts in every day.” Joe Harris scored 24 points for the Nets. Spencer Dinwiddie added 14 points and six assists, and DeAngelo Russell had 12 points.",The New York Times

THE LAST POETS By Christine Otten Translated by Jonathan Reeder 541 pp. World Editions. Paper, $17.99. David Nelson, Gylan Kain and Adiodun Oyewole christened their spoken-word collective the Last Poets on May 19, 1968, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday; they had been invited to recite their poems at a celebration in his honor. The three men were part of a flourishing Harlem artist community, and their poetry epitomized ideals of the Black Arts Movement — the multidisciplinary cultural front that was Black Power’s fraternal twin. Just as Carolyn Rodgers and Amiri Baraka made poems from the political realities and experiences of black folk, the Last Poets performed verses about the spiritual and cultural liberation of black people with backing from conga and djembe drummers, jazz musicians and funk ensembles. The Last Poets, who acknowledged Baraka as a mentor, were among Black Arts’ most fascinating offspring — forerunners of contemporary rappers. They gained national notice in October 1968 when they appeared on “Soul!,” a nationally televised program on PBS that showcased the cultural expressions of the black liberation movement. Their breakout performance on the show earned them a recording deal with Alan Douglas, a music producer who worked with Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix. As live performers and recording artists, the Last Poets fashioned a unique amalgam of multivocal, spoken-word poetics, sharp social critique and musical concepts from the African diaspora, all captured in their classic 1970 track “When the Revolution Comes”: “When the revolution comes / some of us will catch it on TV / with chicken hanging from our mouths / you’ll know it’s revolution / because there won’t be no commercials / when the revolution comes / preacher pimps are gonna split the scene / with the communion wine.” Here the Last Poets suggest that black Americans will be unprepared for the revolution because “they love commercials,” and in the last stanza the poets chide those who’ll be happy to “party and bull__” until it arrives. (As the title of another Last Poets track insists, folks won’t be ready because “Niggers Are Scared of Revolution.”) “When the Revolution Comes” was broadly influential. Six months after its release, the poet Gil Scott-Heron recorded a response: “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,” in which he stressed the power of television and advertising culture to distract people from the freedom movement. In 1993, Biggie Smalls converted the lament at the end of the poem into the title and hook of his first single, the now classic “Party and Bull__”; already in the early 1970s, the Last Poets were playing with the basic ingredients of hip-hop. (See A Tribe Called Quest, Dr. Dre and Digable Planets, all groups that sampled the Last Poets on some of their best tracks.) From its inception, however, the group had trouble maintaining its political agenda. Members argued over everything from whether to remain a trio or operate as a flexible musical unit — with different writers moving in and out of the lineup — to word choices in the poems. Nelson left the group first, creating space for the poets Felipe Luciano and Umar Bin Hassan to join. Later, Kain and Luciano departed, leaving Oyewole and Hassan to record their first album, “The Last Poets” (1970), with Jalal Mansur Nuriddin, a New York poet, and the drummer Nilija Obabi. A year later, Oyewole was in a North Carolina prison on a robbery conviction, and the Last Poets recorded “This Is Madness” (1971) without him. The former members released an album too, rebranding themselves the Original Last Poets. The dueling groups then fought over rights to the name in court. I’ve laid out this history because it’s hard to grasp from “The Last Poets,” a novelized account by Christine Otten, a Dutch playwright and author who discovered the group through her 11-year-old son, a hip-hop fan. Otten subsequently traveled to the United States, and over a period of several years conducted conversations with many of the group’s surviving members (not all agreed to speak with her), studied their albums and poems, and interviewed their musical partners and family members. The result is an unusual and often frustrating book, consisting of fragmented portraits of the Last Poets as young men coming of age during the 1960s and early ’70s, each of its six sections named after an album, song or theme the group pursued. Otten imagines the Last Poets as modern Romantics whose personal histories, performance styles and Afro-diasporic musical roots provide access to a sublime black aesthetic. Notice, for instance, the way she envisions the story of how the group got its name. Lore has it that Nelson found the name in “Towards a Walk in the Sun,” by the South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, known as Willie. Otten explains that the tale has been “repeated and written so many times that it had become a fact,” even though “the term ‘last poets’ never appeared in Kgositsile’s poem.” After reading “Towards a Walk in the Sun” for the first time, Otten writes, Nelson heard God whisper to him: “‘We are the last poets of the world / and our spirit breath rhythm words …’ That thought gave him hope. God was more reliable than history. God wouldn’t forget him.” This is a moment of Romantic epiphany: Kgositsile’s poem gives Nelson psychological ballast, divinely inspired. The book unfolds episodically, but rather than form narrative arcs that capture significant moments in the group’s history — its formation, for example, or the arrival of a new member — the episodes feel elliptical, forcing the reader to extract meaningful connections among them. They are also broken up in time, flashing forward from, say, “Akron, Ohio, 1967” to “Newark, New Jersey, September 2001,” or from “Harlem, 1970” to “Paris, September 2002.” Otten has attempted to structure her book like a docudrama by including commentary between episodes by experts on the Last Poets, among them Baraka, Douglas, the Young Lords founding member Mickey Melendez and Hassan’s adult daughter, Khadijah Hassan-Da Silva. But the interludes and jump cuts are almost always jarring, and the book requires close reading to understand how the sequences fit together. Jonathan Reeder’s translation from the Dutch is lucid. Nonetheless, this formally ambitious work demands too much of readers; Otten compels readers to shape her narrative shards into a mosaic, to labor in order to grasp such basic things as the Last Poets’ motivations for making art, or why some members decided to leave the group. In an author’s note, she explains that she wanted the novel to mirror the “raw, daring, unpredictable and jazzy” feel of the Last Poets’ aesthetic. Too often, though, her work has the texture of transcription, not invention or improvisation. The Last Poets are still around. In May, the group released “Understand What Black Is,” a new album celebrating its 50th anniversary. On one track, “The Bridge,” Hassan and Oyewole, backed by reggae musicians, dub effects, a swinging horn section and a percussionist, spit thick, spiraling verses calling on us to rehabilitate ourselves and the natural world by disconnecting from controlling technologies. The song’s refrain creates a lyrical bridge: “the way over, the way out.” The Last Poets sound timely and Romantic at once. An earlier version of a picture caption with this review, using information from Getty Images, misidentified the member of the Last Poets shown with Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan. He is Nilaja Obabi, not Abiodun Oyewole.",The New York Times

2018,"Rare Photo Is a Teenage van Gogh, but Not Vincent","AMSTERDAM — Vincent van Gogh may have been quite fond of painting his own portrait, but he was far fussier about his real-life image. For years, only two photographs of his face were known to exist. Now, that number is down to one. A photographic portrait long believed to be of a teenage Vincent is not him at all, but rather his brother Theo, researchers at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam announced on Thursday. The photograph, taken in a studio in Brussels in the 1870s, was thought to be an image of the artist at 13 and has been displayed as such since a Belgian historian first publicized it in 1957. But a recent investigation by the museum, which owns the photograph, and a forensic scientist at the University of Amsterdam, found that it could not have been Vincent. “It was the archetype portrait of the artist as a young boy and it has been used all over the world as the Vincent youth portrait,” said Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum. “It will be hard to get it out of the system, and that’s part of the reason that we brought this news into the open, because it will likely keep on popping up as the image of Vincent for some time.” The only remaining photographic portrait that experts believe is the artist is one taken when he was 19 at a photo studio in The Hague. Researchers at the museum also believe that Vincent van Gogh appears in a third photograph, a blurry image of the artist Émile Bernard, van Gogh’s good friend, seated at a table. The figure across from him is believed to be van Gogh, but the photo shows him only from the back. All the other known images of van Gogh are paintings, including some 30 self-portraits, and a few portraits of him by other artists, including Paul Gauguin. Some photos claimed to be of van Gogh as an adult have circulated over the years, but experts have cast doubt on them. “Vincent was not very keen on the medium of photography and didn’t like having his photograph taken,” Mr. Meedendorp said. “It seems like he avoided it. We have six or seven photos from Theo of different ages and we know of several photos of other family members. With Vincent there is now only one.” The misidentified photograph was first displayed in 1957 at an exhibition organized by the Belgian art historian Marc Edo Tralbaut, who identified the image as Vincent at 13. For more than half a century, it went unquestioned. But in 2014, a Dutch television program tried to use experimental imaging technologies to age-morph the image believed to be of Vincent at 13 into the image of Vincent at 19. The effort was unsuccessful, suggesting that perhaps they were not the same person. The museum’s researchers decided to explore the history of the photo, and found that it was shot by a photographer named B. Schwarz, who moved to Brussels and set up a studio there in 1870. At that point, Vincent was already 17 and living in The Hague, so it was unlikely that the photo could be Vincent at 13. However, researchers knew that his younger brother Theo, moved to Brussels in 1873 at 15, to start work for the Belgian branch of the international art dealer Goupil & Cie. The museum now thinks that the portrait of Theo was probably taken as a birthday gift to their father in 1873. The brothers looked alike, but Theo was more slender, had more delicate features and had light-blue eyes, more evidence suggesting the photo was of him and not Vincent. The photo bears a strong resemblance to one taken of Theo two years earlier in Amsterdam. The Van Gogh Museum keeps the original photograph in storage, because it is fragile and light sensitive, but it displays a copy of the image in its galleries, in a section devoted to van Gogh’s biography. Mr. Meedendorp said the museum will now move the image, and identify it as Theo. “We lost an image of Vincent, but we gained an image of Theo, so you can see it in a certain kind of positive light,” said Mr. Meedendorp.",The New York Times
2018,"Raymond Chow, Movie Producer Who Popularized Kung Fu Stars, Dies at 91","HONG KONG — Raymond Chow, a Hong Kong film producer who thrust Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan into global stardom while helping to transform the action movie genre, died on Friday in Hong Kong. He was 91. His death was confirmed in a statement by Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. The statement did not list a cause of death. A former journalist, Mr. Chow entered the film industry as a publicist in 1958, when he joined Shaw Brothers, a studio that had a pioneering role in kung fu movies and other popular low-budget films. But he quickly grew frustrated with the quality of the studio’s output. “It was hard to publicize a film that I do not believe in,” he said in a 2011 interview. “There are only so many lies I can tell. I can’t really exaggerate. Nobody will believe us.” So the studio founder, Run Run Shaw, invited him to contribute his ideas on scripts, and he soon became a producer. Mr. Chow longed for more freedom over his work, and in 1970 he left to co-found his own studio, Golden Harvest. Golden Harvest’s initial films did poorly against Shaw Brothers, which dominated the local market. But Mr. Chow then outbid his former employer to sign Bruce Lee, a young actor and martial arts expert who had appeared in the sidekick role of Kato on the American television series “The Green Hornet.” Mr. Chow had seen Mr. Lee break boards in displays of powerful kicks and punches on Hong Kong television, and learned that Shaw Brothers had been unable to sign him to a film contract. Golden Harvest offered him $15,000 for two films, along with a share of the profits and greater say in the production. Mr. Lee agreed, and Mr. Chow quickly flew his new actor to Thailand, where, in rough rural conditions, he filmed “The Big Boss” in 1971. Mr. Lee’s intense aura and florid fight scenes helped the film become the most successful one shown in Hong Kong to that point, breaking the box-office total set by “The Sound of Music.” That success was followed by hits including “Fist of Fury” and “The Way of the Dragon.” “In our early action films, we used actors who knew little about fighting,” Mr. Chow told The New York Times in 1973. “We had to use various camera tricks. But the audience can tell the difference. It knows a real fighter when it sees one. That’s why Bruce Lee has been such a hit.” After Mr. Lee’s death in 1973, Jackie Chan became a breakout star for Golden Harvest. He first imitated Mr. Lee, then modified his style to develop a more irreverent, comedic style of kung fu film. Mr. Chao also discovered Angela Mao, who is called the first female kung fu star, and produced her first major film, “Hapkido,” or “Lady Kung Fu,” in 1972. “I have to thank God and Raymond Chow,” she told The Times in 2016. Mr. Chow pursued films in Hollywood in the 1980s, and Golden Harvest produced several American box-office hits, including “The Cannonball Run,” with an ensemble cast that included Burt Reynolds. Mr. Chow found small roles for Mr. Chan and the Hong Kong comedian Michael Hui in the movie, hoping to develop the market for Chinese actors in the United States. While his works were often critically panned, Mr. Chow had an eye for box-office success. In the 1990s, Golden Harvest produced the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” series, based on earlier comic books and cartoons. The first film took in more than $200 million. Mr. Chow was born in Hong Kong on Oct. 8, 1927. He attended St. John’s University in Shanghai before returning to Hong Kong in 1949, when Mao Zedong and the Communist Party took over China. He worked as a journalist for outlets including The Hong Kong Standard and Voice of America. The names of his survivors were not immediately available. His production company had a long run of success, but it stumbled after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, just as mainland China’s film industry began to grow. He sold his stake in the company in 2007 to the mainland businessman Wu Kebo, who merged it with his own entertainment group to create Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment. In a 2013 interview with The South China Morning Post, Mr. Chow described a liberated, collaborative style as the underpinning of his work. “My philosophy is to entertain people, to make people happy,” he said. “Filmmaking also suits my way of thinking: I love freedom, and don’t like being placed under restrictions.”",The New York Times
2018,"Raymond Plank, 96, Coal Miner’s Son Who Became an Oil Tycoon, Dies","Raymond N. Plank, a coal miner’s son and former combat pilot who witnessed the atomic-bomb attack on Nagasaki and then returned from the war to help found one of the nation’s largest independent oil and gas companies, Apache, died on Thursday at his home in Ucross, Wyo. He was 96. His death was confirmed by his son Roger. World War II, as it happened, provided an impetus for Mr. Plank’s career. Back home in Minneapolis after his service and armed with a degree from Yale, he saw a postwar surge in small businesses on the horizon. And those businesses, he knew, would need accounting and tax services. He and two business partners rented a tiny third-floor walk-up apartment in Minneapolis for $10 a month, bought a war-surplus Jeep on a New Jersey dock and began prospecting for customers. Before long, the venture, which they called Northwest Business Service, was selling insurance, mutual funds and, most auspiciously, interests in drilling oil wells. With growing expertise in the kinds of investment being offered in oil and gas exploration and production, Mr. Plank and his partners, in 1954, formed the Apache Corporation, which was originally set up to raise investor funds for oil and gas drilling. It ultimately expanded into exploration and production itself, becoming one of the nation’s largest independent oil and gas companies, with reported revenue of almost $6 billion in 2017. At Apache, Mr. Plank pioneered the use of what came to be known as master limited partnerships, or M.L.P.s, an investment vehicle that can be traded publicly and offer significant tax advantages to investors. Mr. Plank’s Apache “definitely had the first partnership that was publicly traded,” said Mary S. Lyman, executive director of the National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships. In doing so, she added, Mr. Plank was responsible for “democratizing” and popularizing investments that until then had largely been confined to the rich. Oil exploration in the 1950s offered huge tax advantages at a time when the top federal income-tax brackets were 91 or 92 percent. Moreover, with the war having depleted energy resources, the government was encouraging domestic oil and gas exploration to fuel a booming postwar economy and a society increasingly dependent on automobiles, with Americans fanning out to the suburbs on newly built interstate highways. M.L.P.s helped Apache reach what Mr. Plank called “critical mass.” But when oil prices fell in the 1980s and tax laws made public drilling programs less appealing, Apache dropped the partnerships. (They still thrive elsewhere, mainly for pipelines, other energy infrastructure businesses and to some extent in financial services.) Apache, Mr. Plank wrote in a memoir, “A Small Difference” (2012), “was the first to create and enter the M.L.P. field — and the first to leave it.” A weakened Apache then moved to Denver with a plan to transform itself into a company that owned and operated oil properties for its own account. After doubling its assets and balancing its oil and gas holdings through deals with Amoco, Shell and British Petroleum, the company began to exploit a large concession in Egypt, with the help of the country’s president at the time, Hosni Mubarak. “That was an absolute diamond in the rough,” David C. Higgins, a 30-year Apache executive, said in an interview. Its stake in the Egypt concession prompted Apache to establish the nonprofit Springboard — Educating the Future, which, in concert with an initiative by Suzanne Mubarak, Egypt’s former first lady, builds and staffs one-room schools for rural Egyptian girls. Mr. Plank retired from Apache in 2009. Raymond Norwood Plank was born on May 29, 1922, in Wayzata, Minn., a small city on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, about 13 miles west of Minneapolis. His coal miner father, Raby, was also a farmer; his mother, Maude (Howe) Plank, was a homemaker. Raymond grew up on a farm, and his mother died when he was a teenager. He was in his senior year at Yale University in 1941 when World War II broke out in the United States. He left before graduation to join the Army Air Forces. Flying B-24s, he went on to survive 40 missions in the South Pacific. On Aug. 9, 1945, while stationed on an island near Okinawa, Mr. Plank risked court-martial when he and a friend made an unauthorized flight on a hunch (because all flights at the base had been cancelled) that they might witness the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan. Coming three days after the strike against Hiroshima, it was the second, and last, atomic bomb attack by American forces. Mr. Plank was one of the last surviving Americans to directly observe atomic war. With the war over, he returned to graduate from Yale in 1946 and launch himself as an entrepreneur. From its humble bookkeeping and tax-advisory infancy, Northwest Business Service built a smartly growing mix of managed assets and insurance, real estate and other interests. From this evolved Apache. (The first three letters of the name were derived from the surname initials of Mr. Plank and his partners, Truman Anderson and Chuck Arnao.) When some clients sought more liquid investments, Apache overcame a series of regulatory rebuffs to establish master limited partnerships. As the company’s chairman, Mr. Plank could be cantankerous, but he maintained a reputation for integrity. He moved the company to Houston in the mid-1990s. There he determined that the Enron Corporation, also based in Houston, was riddled with fraud and concluded that huge profits were to be made by selling its stock short. “I knew I could make a lot of money,” Mr. Plank said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. “We didn’t have any inside information,” he added. “These guys were sitting ducks.” Mr. Plank “was ahead of the curve on that one,” Mr. Higgins, the former Apache executive, said. “He nailed it.” Enron collapsed in scandal in 2001. In addition to his son Roger, Mr. Plank is survived by three other sons, Michael, Raby and Dana; two daughters, Kate Plank Sage and Pamela Plank Thaut; 12 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. His marriages to Sally Bovey Stevens, Lollie Benz and Heather Burgess ended in divorce. Mr. Plank’s philanthropy was wide-ranging. In addition to the girls’ schools in Egypt, he created the Ucross Foundation in northeastern Wyoming in 1981 and set up a conference center on a 20,000-acre working ranch there. Its artist-in-residence program has included winners of five Pulitzer Prizes — among them Annie Proulx, author of the best-selling novel “The Shipping News” — and five MacArthur Foundation “genius” awards. Another best seller written in part at Ucross was Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Eat, Pray, Love.” In 2001, Mr. Plank established the Fund for Teachers, a Houston-based foundation that each year awards fellowships to some 500 public- and private-school teachers for summer study in the United States or abroad. He also established a professorship of global energy policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and was a major supporter of numerous charitable causes in Minneapolis and Wyoming, including on behalf of ranchers and farmers in his adopted state.",The New York Times
2018,Read Trump’s Proclamation Targeting the Caravan and Asylum Seekers,"President Trump on Friday issued a proclamation that triggered tough changes to deny asylum to all migrants who fail to enter through official crossings along the southern border. The following is the text of that proclamation, as released by the White House. [For more context and coverage about the proclamation, read here.] _______________ ADDRESSING MASS MIGRATION THROUGH THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION The United States expects the arrival at the border between the United States and Mexico (southern border) of a substantial number of aliens primarily from Central America who appear to have no lawful basis for admission into our country. They are traveling in large, organized groups through Mexico and reportedly intend to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and to seek asylum, despite the fact that, based on past experience, a significant majority will not be eligible for or be granted that benefit. Many entered Mexico unlawfully — some with violence — and have rejected opportunities to apply for asylum and benefits in Mexico. The arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States. The continuing and threatened mass migration of aliens with no basis for admission into the United States through our southern border has precipitated a crisis and undermines the integrity of our borders. I therefore must take immediate action to protect the national interest, and to maintain the effectiveness of the asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the many special benefits associated with asylum. In recent weeks, an average of approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens have entered each day at our southern border. In Fiscal Year 2018 overall, 124,511 aliens were found inadmissible at ports of entry on the southern border, while 396,579 aliens were apprehended entering the United States unlawfully between such ports of entry. The great number of aliens who cross unlawfully into the United States through the southern border consumes tremendous resources as the Government seeks to surveil, apprehend, screen, process, and detain them. Aliens who enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and are subject to expedited removal may avoid being promptly removed by demonstrating, during an initial screening process, a credible fear of persecution or torture. Approximately 2 decades ago, most aliens deemed inadmissible at a port of entry or apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States through the southern border were single adults who were promptly returned to Mexico, and very few asserted a fear of return. Since then, however, there has been a massive increase in fear-of-persecution or torture claims by aliens who enter the United States through the southern border. The vast majority of such aliens are found to satisfy the credible-fear threshold, although only a fraction of the claimants whose claims are adjudicated ultimately qualify for asylum or other protection. Aliens found to have a credible fear are often released into the interior of the United States, as a result of a lack of detention space and a variety of other legal and practical difficulties, pending adjudication of their claims in a full removal proceeding in immigration court. The immigration adjudication process often takes years to complete because of the growing volume of claims and because of the need to expedite proceedings for detained aliens. During that time, many released aliens fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with subsequent orders of removal, or are difficult to locate and remove. Members of family units pose particular challenges. The Federal Government lacks sufficient facilities to house families together. Virtually all members of family units who enter the United States through the southern border, unlawfully or without proper documentation, and that are found to have a credible fear of persecution, are thus released into the United States. Against this backdrop of near-assurance of release, the number of such aliens traveling as family units who enter through the southern border and claim a credible fear of persecution has greatly increased. And large numbers of family units decide to make the dangerous and unlawful border crossing with their children. The United States has a long and proud history of offering protection to aliens who are fleeing persecution and torture and who qualify under the standards articulated in our immigration laws, including through our asylum system and the Refugee Admissions Program. But our system is being overwhelmed by migration through our southern border. Crossing the border to avoid detection and then, if apprehended, claiming a fear of persecution is in too many instances an avenue to near-automatic release into the interior of the United States. Once released, such aliens are very difficult to remove. An additional influx of large groups of aliens arriving at once through the southern border would add tremendous strain to an already taxed system, especially if they avoid orderly processing by unlawfully crossing the southern border. The entry of large numbers of aliens into the United States unlawfully between ports of entry on the southern border is contrary to the national interest, and our law has long recognized that aliens who seek to lawfully enter the United States must do so at ports of entry. Unlawful entry puts lives of both law enforcement and aliens at risk. By contrast, entry at ports of entry at the southern border allows for orderly processing, which enables the efficient deployment of law enforcement resources across our vast southern border. Failing to take immediate action to stem the mass migration the United States is currently experiencing and anticipating would only encourage additional mass unlawful migration and further overwhelming of the system. Other presidents have taken strong action to prevent mass migration. In Proclamation 4865 of September 29, 1981 (High Seas Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to an influx of Haitian nationals traveling to the United States by sea, President Reagan suspended the entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas and ordered the Coast Guard to intercept such aliens before they reached United States shores and to return them to their point of origin. In Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992 (Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to a dramatic increase in the unlawful mass migration of Haitian nationals to the United States, President Bush ordered additional measures to interdict such Haitian nationals and return them to their home country. The Supreme Court upheld the legality of those measures in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155 (1993). I am similarly acting to suspend, for a limited period, the entry of certain aliens in order to address the problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter our country unlawfully or without proper documentation. I am tailoring the suspension to channel these aliens to ports of entry, so that, if they enter the United States, they do so in an orderly and controlled manner instead of unlawfully. Under this suspension, aliens entering through the southern border, even those without proper documentation, may, consistent with this proclamation, avail themselves of our asylum system, provided that they properly present themselves for inspection at a port of entry. In anticipation of a large group of aliens arriving in the coming weeks, I am directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to commit additional resources to support our ports of entry at the southern border to assist in processing those aliens — and all others arriving at our ports of entry — as efficiently as possible. But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that became effective earlier today. Those aliens may, however, still seek other forms of protection from persecution or torture. In addition, this limited suspension will facilitate ongoing negotiations with Mexico and other countries regarding appropriate cooperative arrangements to prevent unlawful mass migration to the United States through the southern border. Thus, this proclamation is also necessary to manage and conduct the foreign affairs of the United States effectively. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), respectively) hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry of any alien into the United States across the international boundary between the United States and Mexico is hereby suspended and limited, subject to section 2 of this proclamation. That suspension and limitation shall expire 90 days after the date of this proclamation or the date on which an agreement permits the United States to remove aliens to Mexico in compliance with the terms of section 208(a)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(A)), whichever is earlier. Sec. 2. Scope and Implementation of Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall apply only to aliens who enter the United States after the date of this proclamation. (b) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to any alien who enters the United States at a port of entry and properly presents for inspection, or to any lawful permanent resident of the United States. (c) Nothing in this proclamation shall limit an alien entering the United States from being considered for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)) or protection pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the authority of the implementing legislation regarding the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, or limit the statutory processes afforded to unaccompanied alien children upon entering the United States under section 279 of title 6, United States Code, and section 1232 of title 8, United States Code. (d) No later than 90 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, a recommendation on whether an extension or renewal of the suspension or limitation on entry in section 1 of this proclamation is in the interests of the United States. Sec. 3. Interdiction. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Government of Mexico regarding appropriate steps — consistent with applicable law and the foreign policy, national security, and public-safety interests of the United States — to address the approach of large groups of aliens traveling through Mexico with the intent of entering the United States unlawfully, including efforts to deter, dissuade, and return such aliens before they physically enter United States territory through the southern border. Sec. 4. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly: (a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and (b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the failure to follow certain procedures, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.

2018,Read the Emails: The Trump Campaign and Roger Stone,"Newly revealed messages show how the political operative Roger J. Stone Jr. sold himself to Trump campaign advisers as a potential conduit to WikiLeaks, which published thousands of emails in 2016 damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. WASHINGTON — When WikiLeaks published a trove of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman a month before the 2016 election, it was widely viewed as an attempt to damage her standing, even as WikiLeaks defended the release as an effort to bring greater transparency to American politics. We have since learned that the emails were originally hacked by Russian intelligence operatives. What is still not clear is how much Trump campaign advisers knew about the hacks at the time — a subject of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — or the extent of their interactions with far-right figures eager to undermine Mrs. Clinton. Emails obtained by The New York Times provide new insight into those connections, as well as efforts by Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump and political operative, to seek funding through the campaign for his projects aimed at hurting Mrs. Clinton. The emails are verbatim, typos and all, save for email addresses deleted to protect the emailers’ privacy. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump campaign chairman and co-founder of the far-right Breitbart News, who ran the website until he joined the campaign Matthew Boyle, Breitbart’s Washington editor Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime conservative operative and confidant of President Trump Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks A month before the election, Mrs. Clinton looked to be cruising to victory. Mr. Trump’s surrogates, including Mr. Stone, were trying to come up with ways to attack her to help Mr. Trump gain ground. Mr. Stone had long claimed both publicly and privately that he had foreknowledge of the information that WikiLeaks planned to release about Mrs. Clinton and her political allies. In early October, Mr. Stone predicted on his Twitter account, which was suspended after a string of expletive-laden tweets, that the documents that Mr. Assange promised to make public would hurt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Oct. 2, 2016 @rogerjstonejr: “Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done.” Oct. 3, 2016 @rogerjstonejr: “I have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon. #LockHerUp” On the night of Oct. 3, Mr. Boyle emailed Mr. Stone. Mr. Assange had scheduled a news conference for the next day where he would announce he was releasing a new cache of documents. The emails show how closely intertwined Breitbart News and the campaign were and how people in Mr. Bannon’s orbit saw Mr. Stone as a direct link to WikiLeaks.

Hope it’s good. — Thanks, Matthew Boyle Washington Political Editor, Breitbart News http://twitter.com/mboyle1 http://www.breitbart.com/Columnists/matthew-boyle Mr. Stone had apparently been trying to get in touch with Mr. Bannon to tell him about Mr. Assange’s plans. Mr. Boyle, a protégé of Mr. Bannon’s, forwarded to him Mr. Stone’s email. But Mr. Bannon appeared uninterested in engaging. Monday, October 3, 2016FROM: Roger StoneTO: Matthew BoyleEMAIL:It is.

I’d say that’s important. The next morning, Mr. Assange told reporters in Berlin, by teleconference, that he planned to release “significant material” in the coming weeks, including some related to the American presidential election. He said WikiLeaks hoped to publish a trove of documents each week in the coming months. Mr. Assange’s comments were reported extensively in the United States. Mr. Bannon then contacted Mr. Stone directly, asking for insight into Mr. Assange’s plan. Notably, Mr. Stone did not tell Mr. Bannon anything that Mr. Assange had not said publicly. He did explain that Mr. Assange was concerned about his security, and he said in an interview that Randy Credico, a New York comedian and activist whom Mr. Stone has identified as his source about WikiLeaks, also gave him that information.

The final email in the exchange is vintage Stone. He demanded that Trump campaign surrogates convey his accusations, made without evidence, about Bill Clinton’s having a love child named Danney Williams. And he told Mr. Bannon to have the wealthy Republican donor Rebekah Mercer send money to his political organization — a 501(c)(4) group sometimes called a C-4 — which was structured to keep its donors secret. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Bannon asked Ms. Mercer to send money. In response to Mr. Bannon’s request for insider information into whether Mr. Assange had cut a deal with the Clintons not to release the emails, Mr. Stone said he did not know.

2018,Readers Respond to the 10.21.2018 Issue,"The Thread RE: GETTING OUT Reginald Dwayne Betts served time for a crime he committed at 16. He wrote about discovering how hard it is for a felon to get a second chance. This article left me in tears both for Betts’s yearslong effort to become a lawyer despite his rehabilitation and for the continued battle to make life fair for brown-skinned people in America. I couldn’t help thinking that our government just voted to allow an alleged sexual predator, and clearly a very angry white man, to the Supreme Court for life. That Betts was forced to wait for approval to the Connecticut Bar after years of self-education, motivation and extreme remorse, acting as a loving son, husband and father and contributing to society, is a shame on the institutions that incarcerated him and were responsible for deciding his ultimate fate. I’m thrilled for him that he achieved his goal and pray that he can help those who may have fallen prey to their dire circumstances or ill-advised choices as teenagers, which seemingly most white people don’t have to atone for. Amy Gittelman, New York I’m a third-year law student. Most of my friends and I will very likely go on to take the bar next summer, pass and be admitted without any of the hurdles you have faced. I can tell, simply from your writing, that you possess a deeper understanding of justice than any one of my law-school classmates. More important, you are of a stronger moral character than anyone I’ve encountered in the profession so far. That, despite your perseverance and accomplishments, you faced so much trouble being permitted to do something you are so clearly qualified to do is a disgrace, and an utter failure of the legal profession. The reality is that plenty of lawyers go on to do much more harm to society through the course of their careers than you ever did when you were a teenager. You are a model individual, and I’m sure you’ll become a superb attorney. Mike, Boston I know this man, and he is one of the most intelligent, well-read, thoughtful and talented people I know. That, of course, raises the question of how many other people like him have been lost in a prison system that cares little about rehabilitation and turning the incarcerated into “productive” citizens when they get out (as most do). It instead treats them as if they are irredeemable, unworthy. We do them and ourselves a disservice. Jennifer James, Washington RE: ALABAMA BLUES Ruth Graham wrote about Tabitha Isner, who is running for Congress in Alabama’s Second District. Thank you for an insightful article that explores the challenges of being a Democratic candidate in the state of Alabama. I am an Alabamian, white, female and a Democrat. I do not believe that Alabama is a red state by choice, but through neglect and apathy. I am not alone; there are others like me, and we are creating our own form of political activism. We understand that Democratic candidates will receive little or no support from national organizations, and that the state party organization is inept. For those of you who live in safe congressional districts, explore the positions of candidates running for these seats in deep-red states. As the article states, a little bit of money goes a long way down here. Donna McPherson Castellano, Huntsville, Ala. RE: LAUGHING MATTERS Taffy Brodesser-Akner profiled the actress Melissa McCarthy, who is trying to keep comedy alive in Hollywood. I have loved Melissa McCarthy’s characters since “Gilmore Girls.” I also confess that some of her characters have left me a bit cold — yet her presence and obvious commitment to the moment still made me want to watch. Taffy Brodesser-Akner captures so much in this profile that I didn’t want it to end! I laughed with my whole body and not only wanted a chance to hang out with McCarthy, but also really wanted to go to the movies with Taffy, too! McCarthy’s movies are comfort food in our house — our open-concept house where we have had the same conversation about beds in the kitchen. My 13-year-old daughter and I watch “Spy” and “The Heat” almost weekly simply for those consuming laughs. And the filthy language. Which is obviously part of the pleasure. Thank you for this laughter on the page. My day is already better for it. Amy Weinsheim, Bend, Ore.",The New York Times
2018,Readers Respond to the 10.28.2018 Issue,"The Thread RE: Big in Japan Tejal Rao wrote about the big business of Kit Kats in Japan. As a huge fan of Japanese Kit Kats for more than a decade — my favorite flavors are Yubari Melon and Annin Dofu, a treat popular in Yokohama — I much enjoyed your recent article. But I was mildly distressed that the author did not mention one of the key reasons Kit Kat soared in popularity in Japan since its introduction. In Japanese, “Kit Kat,” or “Kitto Katto,” sounds very much like the phrase “Kitto katsu,” which means “You will surely win,” or by extension, “You will surely pass” or simply “Good luck.” For this reason, parents would slip Kit Kat bars into the bags of schoolchildren on the morning of a big exam, as an extra confidence builder. Lisa Scheinin, M.D., Redondo Beach, Calif. My special memory of limited-edition Kit Kats is from the Japanese earthquake of 2011. As an American transiting through Narita from Seoul, my two-hour layover turned into a 24-hour-plus nightmare as the earthquake roared through Japan between my flights. Once the incredibly violent shaking stopped, everyone in the airport was evacuated to the tarmac to stand and wait for clearance to re-enter the building as they inspected for safety. No flights landed, and no flights left. Airport workers eventually brought buses for us to sit inside and stay warm. Some of us had snacks that we purchased as gifts for family, prior to the earthquake. When we got hungry (six hours into the wait to get back inside), a young American English teacher returning from her year in Japan brought out her stash of limited-edition Kit Kats, and she readily shared them, explaining how special they were and all the varieties. It was our dinner (and for some, breakfast the next day), along with the other few things we had among us. The limited-edition Kit Kats were raspberry, and I’ll never forget that experience as long as I live. Special, indeed. Kelli D. Roesch, Vancouver, Wash. I have lived in Japan for 14 years now. I used to be part of what we jokingly referred to as a “Competitive Kit Kat Hunting Team.” We went out every week to hunt for the newest flavors and knew which convenience stores were the most likely to have them first. If you ever fly through the international airport in Narita, be sure to pick up some boxes to take home. They sell the regional varieties in the airport. Julia, Japan RE: HOME SWEET HOME We featured 33 defining candies from 33 different nations. Your section on candies of the world was deliciously tantalizing, though I was surprised that the great centers of sweets — Switzerland (Lindor truffles), Austria (Sacher torte-like chocolates) and Germany (Haribo raspberry sours or Werther’s Original caramels) — were not included. But I was immensely pleased to see that strange favorite, Les Anis de Flavigny, selected for France. Oddly, in my recent experience, it has become difficult to find there. Recently, in the Marais, I went to numerous confectioner shops, grocery stores and even health-food stores, none of which carried their cunning little metal oval boxes. One chocolatier advised me that the best place to find them was at rest stops on the auto route. Finally, I found the “ginger” variety (not recommended) in a health-food store in Münster, Germany. After I returned home, on Amazon I easily ordered a three-box set (original, violet and orange) for the same price as in France and discovered that whole bagfuls can be ordered on the cheap for all those boxes I’ve saved.

2018,Readers Respond to the 11.11.2018 Issue,"The Thread Re: State of Denial Janet Reitman wrote about how American law enforcement failed to confront the rise of white nationalism. Thank you for publishing the eye-opening investigation into the rise of extremism in the United States, a conflagration facilitated by an administration that avoided naming far-right extremism as terrorism, followed by the current regime’s destaffing and defunding of efforts to coordinate and combat homegrown violence, all fueled by Fox News, Breitbart, Infowars, the internet, YouTube algorithms, 4chan and so on. Janet Reitman’s article only confirms my darkest suspicions two Novembers ago that the current president and his cronies are promoting conditions that could precipitate race and class wars. Also, Reitman’s discussion of the reluctance among multiple American administrations to label certain people domestic terrorists points to the inadequacy of our vocabulary to describe and therefore understand the dangers that extremism poses to all of us. To paraphrase, “If we can’t say it, we can’t fight it.” Risë Keller, Boulder, Colo. As an American Jew, I have always known that an armed guard would protect our synagogue during the High Holy Days; now I see the armed guard patrolling the grounds every Saturday. As a teacher of immigrant and refugee youths, I have gotten used to the sadness and dismay of my students when they speak of the hate-mongering rhetoric of our current administration. As the mother-in-law of a fine young man from El Salvador, I cringe when I think of the stress that he and his family have had to endure while trying to make a good life and be good citizens of the country they have come to know as home. And as the daughter of a lawyer who worked on the Nuremberg trials as a young man, I am reminded of my father’s reply when I once asked him how the German people could have allowed Hitler to do what he did: “The Germans were not bad people; they were just caught up in their daily lives when Hitler rose to power. They looked the other way.” Thank you for not looking away. Victoria Bernstein, Seattle Re: Why Nothing Works Gary Greenberg wrote about new research on the placebo effect. I am a health psychologist with a Ph.D. I have been thinking about the placebo effect for more than a decade. Although I have read hundreds of scientific articles on this topic, it took having a toddler to understand the immense power of placebo. Most injuries for my 2-year-old are miraculously healed with only a kiss from me on the offending “boo-boo.” Millions of mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers already know this. It’s about time the science caught up with us. Leeat Granek, assistant professor, department of public health, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Gary Greenberg overemphasizes the mysterious nature of the placebo effect. The placebo is not the pill; it is the set and setting in which the pill is given. The broader culture supplies the meaning: These are the people and the rituals that will help you. Imagine that you are the sole survivor of an airplane crash in the desert. You look out over the harsh landscape and despair. Then you spot a shack with a display that says, “Licensed desert guide.” Instead of despair, pain and fatigue, you now experience renewed energy and hope. In regard to others, you are more open to influence and will (sometimes) do what is needed to get better. In my own area, psychotherapy, the office and the diplomas on the wall do the heavy lifting. Every culture legitimizes healers, and their presence has been valuable whether they dress in frock coats or feathers and whether they bear insights, potions or scalpels. They give problems a name, describe a course and provide comfort and community. Trusting your best chance is neither irrational nor allowing yourself to be fooled. Robert A.

2018,Opinion | Real America Versus Senate America,"Some of us are more equal than others, and they like Trump. Opinion Columnist Everyone is delivering post-mortems on Tuesday’s elections, so for what it’s worth, here’s mine: Despite some bitter disappointments and lost ground in the Senate, Democrats won a huge victory. They broke the Republican monopoly on federal power, and that’s a very big deal for an administration that has engaged in blatant corruption and abuse of power, in the belief that an impenetrable red wall would always protect it from accountability. They also made major gains at the state level, which will have a big impact on future elections. But given this overall success, how do we explain those Senate losses? Many people have pointed out that this year’s Senate map was unusually bad for Democrats, consisting disproportionately of states Donald Trump won in 2016. But there was actually a deeper problem, one that will pose long-term problems, not just for Democrats, but for the legitimacy of our whole political system. For economic and demographic trends have interacted with political change to make the Senate deeply unrepresentative of American reality. How is America changing? Immigration and our growing racial and cultural diversity are only part of the story. We’re also witnessing a transformation in the geography of our economy, as dynamic industries increasingly gravitate to big metropolitan areas where there are already large numbers of highly educated workers. It’s not an accident that Amazon is planning to put its two new headquarters in New York and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, both places with an existing deep pool of talent. Obviously not everyone lives — or wants to live — in these growth centers of the new economy. But we are increasingly a nation of urbanites and suburbanites. Almost 60 percent of us live in metropolitan areas with more than a million people, more than 70 percent in areas with more than 500,000 residents. Conservative politicians may extol the virtues of a “real America” of rural areas and small towns, but the real real America in which we live, while it contains small towns, is mostly metropolitan. But here’s the thing: The Senate, which gives each state the same number of seats regardless of population — which gives fewer than 600,000 people in Wyoming the same representation as almost 40 million in California — drastically overweights those rural areas and underweights the places where most Americans live. I find it helpful to contrast the real America, the place we actually live, with what I think of as “Senate America,” the hypothetical nation implied by a simple average across states, which is what the Senate in effect represents. As I said, real America is mainly metropolitan; Senate America is still largely rural. Real America is racially and culturally diverse; Senate America is still very white. Real America includes large numbers of highly educated adults; Senate America, which underweights the dynamic metropolitan areas that attract highly educated workers, has a higher proportion of non-college people, and especially non-college whites. None of this is meant to denigrate rural, non-college, white voters. We’re all Americans, and we all deserve an equal voice in shaping our national destiny. But as it is, some of us are more equal than others. And that poses a big problem in an era of deep partisan division. Not to put too fine a point on it: What Donald Trump and his party are selling increasingly boils down to white nationalism — hatred and fear of darker people, with a hefty dose of anti-intellectualism plus anti-Semitism, which is always part of that cocktail. This message repels a majority of Americans. That’s why Tuesday’s election in the House — which despite gerrymandering and other factors is far more representative of the country as a whole than the Senate — produced a major Democratic wave. But the message does resonate with a minority of Americans. These Americans are, of course, white, and are more likely than not to reside outside big, racially diverse metropolitan areas — because racial animosity and fear of immigration always seem to be strongest in places where there are few nonwhites and hardly any immigrants. And these are precisely the places that have a disproportionate role in choosing senators. So what happened Tuesday, with Republicans getting shellacked in the House but gaining in the Senate, wasn’t just an accident of this year’s map or specific campaign issues. It reflected a deep division in culture, indeed values, between the American citizenry at large and the people who get to choose much of the Senate. This divergence will have profound implications, because the Senate has a lot of power, especially when the president — who, let us not forget, lost the popular vote — leads the party that controls it. In particular, Trump and his Senate friends will spend the next couple of years stuffing the courts with right-wing loyalists. We may, then, be looking at a growing crisis of legitimacy for the U.S. political system — even if we get through the constitutional crisis that seems to be looming over the next few months.

2018,"Real Estate Technology: Try, Try Again","Stackable apartments. Robotic valets. Infrared spas. The future has arrived, haltingly, and this time will be different. Maybe. CreditCreditPeter Bollinger Perhaps the most prescient scene in the futuristic 1960s cartoon “The Jetsons” was when George, the eager technophile, had to run as fast as he could to stay on a newfangled treadmill gone haywire. It’s an apt metaphor for some technology today, particularly in the real estate industry, which is quick to jump on the newest disruptive innovation, but often ends up with the next Bluetooth-enabled toaster instead. Is any of it really necessary? Maybe. There are real changes taking place that could have a lasting effect on housing — from land use and affordability to the fancy amenities that influence how and where we live. Some of the best tech, the kind with staying power, has been percolating for years, often after failing miserably at first. It persists because there are no perfect solutions to the problems it is attempting to solve, but there is always hope that someday someone might get it right. Among the innovations currently worth taking seriously: modular housing that can be built faster and cheaper than traditional construction; robotic parking systems that move cars safely and efficiently; signal-boosting devices that allow cellphone reception in high-rise towers; and luxury amenities like infrared saunas. Roger Krulak, the chief executive of Full Stack Modular, likes to point out that with conventional building methods “almost every construction project is past deadline and over budget.” And he asks: “What other industry could survive that?” 15 Photos View Slide Show › The solution, he said, is off-site construction, in which factory-made steel modules — outfitted with electrical and plumbing systems, high-end finishes and even elaborate facades — can be stacked on site, like Legos, in about 70 percent of the time it would take for conventional builders to complete a high-rise tower, and with considerably less waste. Plus, since the manufacturing is done indoors, weather delays and safety concerns are reduced. Part of the technology’s appeal is that it is less reliant on highly skilled workers. Using technology from the aerospace industry, a robotic camera in Full Stack’s 85,000-square-foot factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard can measure within two-thousandths of an inch, while most contractors might settle for a two-inch margin. During on-site assembly, the company deploys a drone camera that uses photogrammetry, a series of precise surveying-image measurements, to ensure the modules are correctly stacked. The modular method has already gained a foothold in hotel construction, as well as low-rise and single-family projects. Mr. Krulak estimated that there are some 30 modular buildings in New York, including Carmel Place, a 55-unit micro-apartment building in Kips Bay, completed in 2016. Of course, there have been blunders along the way. The 32-story rental tower at 461 Dean Street, in the Pacific Park complex in Brooklyn, completed in 2016 and now fully leased, was supposed to be a paragon of high-rise modular design. Instead, the project dragged on for four years amid technical snafus and a dispute between the developer, Forest City Ratner, and its partner, Skanska, which ran the modular operation. Thanks, in part, to the delays and high costs, Forest City sold the 363-unit building and left the modular business. “It was a mess,” said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, adding that the tower was too big and complex for a prefab construction project. Mr. Krulak, who also worked on it, admitted there were miscues in the process. But the city remains interested in modular construction and hopes to use it for affordable housing. The department of Housing Preservation and Development is expected to announce a deal with a subsidiary of Radson Development to build an 80-unit, 10-story modular rental tower in Far Rockaway, Queens, where all of the units will be reserved for those making no more than 70 percent of the area’s median income, or $65,730 a year for a family of three. “Part of what we’re doing, in some way, is to correct the narrative” about modular construction, Ms. Glen said. The project, on Beach 20th Street, will go up around the same time as a similar, conventionally built mid-rise on the same street by the same developer. The company hopes to finish the modular tower 30 percent faster, for only slightly more than the cost of a normal build, Ms. Glen said, although she didn’t disclose the budget. The architect is Magnusson Architecture and Planning, and Full Stack will manufacture the modules. SHoP Architects, the award-winning firm that designed 461 Dean, has plans for another project. The architects have partnered with the venture capital firm Tectonic Capital to fund an as-yet unnamed company to navigate the entire modular process — from design and manufacture to on-site assembly — and plan to bring the building to market in 2019. “The assembly will take days, not weeks,” said Chris Sharples, one of the architects, adding that the proprietary software will allow a number of regional suppliers to collaborate in a process more akin to manufacturing Boeing airliners than building with bricks and mortar. One of the problems with previous modular projects was miscommunication between the developers, the city and the suppliers, he said, which caused bottlenecks in delivery and assembly: “It’s not about product innovation; it’s about process innovation.” One recent afternoon, Yair Goldberg, an executive with the automated parking company U-Tron, pointed to the outdoor pool at Park + Garden, a 212-unit luxury rental tower in Hoboken, N.J. Then he pointed to the rooftop park and the lounge, amenities that might have been smaller, or not built at all, he said, if the developer, Bijou Properties, had opted for a traditional ramp parking lot. Original plans for the project called for a 10-story parking garage with more than 300 spaces. U-Tron’s design achieved the same goal in a four-story space, allowing the developer to add more than 30 units to the building and dedicate more room to amenities. “You’re benefiting the developer, who’s getting a much better land use, but you’re also benefiting tenants,” Mr. Goldberg said. The U-Tron system is essentially a vending machine on a giant scale, with a computerized brain. It uses big turntables, robotic arms and a network of checks and balances to ensure that cars get from point A to point B unscathed. The U-Tron system can pack cars four inches apart, with six inches of overhead clearance, resulting in two or three times the density of a normal garage. And aside from upkeep, there is no human intervention, which means the builder saves on labor, ventilation and lighting costs. With the use of an app, a driver can summon a parked car and retrieve it from a loading bay in an average of five minutes. That is, when everything goes according to plan. The robotic parking industry was poised to take off in the early 2000s when the real estate market was booming and positive reviews from overseas markets spread. Then the recession happened, and the systems — which can cost about $30,000 to $40,000 a space, or nearly twice as much as conventional parking — fell out of favor. There were also publicized failures. In 2004, at a Hoboken, N.J., automated garage recognized as the first in the country, a Cadillac DeVille fell off its pallet and crashed six stories below. The following year, a Jeep Wrangler in the same garage plummeted four stories. In 2015, residents of a luxury condo in South Florida were caught in a legal dispute between the developer and a now-defunct parking provider whose system sometimes left residents waiting hours for their cars to be retrieved. Builders today “are just afraid — they’ve heard the horror stories,” said Jerry Marcus, the owner of the Parking Advisory Group, a consultancy that works with developers and architects. But there are signs that the technology may finally be gaining traction. “There are going to be more built in the next two to three years than there have been in the last 15,” said Ian Todd, the director of automated parking systems for Westfalia Technologies, in York, Pa. His company has completed two robotic lots in the United States, and is in talks to do 25 more, mostly in the Northeast, but also in Austin, Tex., and the San Francisco Bay Area. The technology has improved, Mr. Goldberg said. U-Tron, for instance, takes 3D photographs of a car’s dimensions to ensure that it is given adequate space. The system also does a kind of housekeeping, in which it learns the habits of users and can shuffle cars to more convenient spots for removal, to keep drivers from growing impatient in the loading area. “We put an emphasis on the psychology of waiting,” he said. Jersey City Urby, a 69-story luxury rental tower across the river from Manhattan, is a certified green building, with high-tech features like keyless apartment entry with the use of a smartphone app. But the developers didn’t anticipate that the building’s energy-efficient windows and walls would create cellphone dead zones and interfere with their fancy app. “It was one of the worst cases that we’d seen,” said Alex Goge, director of sales for Illuminati Labs, the company brought in after construction to fix the signal problems. “You could not make a call. You could not make a text.” That was especially true on the top floors — that is, the prime real estate — where two-bedrooms were priced at $5,500 a month. For about $400,000, Illuminati installed a passive distributed antenna system, or D.A.S., a network of antennas, cables and signal boosters that amplified the signal from the air, without the costly infrastructure of hard-wiring the building to each of the major service providers. “Cellphone connectivity is really looked at as a utility,” said Jeffrey Gudewicz, the chief product officer at Wilson Electronics, the company whose devices were installed at Urby. “It used to be that you’d negotiate, pre-construction, with the cellular providers,” said David Barry, the president of Ironstate, one of the developers. But in the last several years cellular companies have increased the price of installing the wiring that ensures a strong signal in a building, Mr. Barry said, and it would have cost $2 million and taken more than a year to install at Urby. Whereas the Wilson system, he said, is carrier-agnostic and can be installed in weeks, not months. Now the 762-unit building, which opened in 2017, is fully leased. Others are also recognizing connectivity as an amenity. Related Companies has partnered with Starry, a Boston-based company that provides what is known as 5G fixed wireless internet service, for a flat fee of $50 a month to those who live in residential towers, with no additional rental costs or unwanted bundles. “Nobody actually knows what 5G is,” said Virginia Lam Abrams, an executive with Starry, because it represents the next generation of low-latency, high-capacity access networks with smoother performance. In Starry’s case, that means 200 megabits a second for downloads and uploads, up to a gigabit a second, with no usage caps, she said, adding that larger companies might charge double that for lower speeds or require a bundled package with cable. “There are still going to be folks who want their NY1 and their bundled content, but there’s a real desire from the younger generation,” said Joanna Rose, an executive vice president with Related, who said the service will be rolled out to all of the developer’s New York buildings, with a reduced-cost subscription in the affordable projects. Clodagh, an interior designer known for her holistic philosophy, is a big fan of a recent addition to the New York spa: the infrared sauna. “Gwyneth Paltrow, madam Goop, is very hot on it, as it were,” she said, referring to the actor’s lifestyle brand. When Clodagh designed the interiors at Citizen360, an Upper East Side condo, she included a 6-by-10-foot infrared spa made of cedar instead of a conventional spa that uses heated rocks and can raise the temperature to 200 degrees. In an infrared spa, light waves heat the body rather than the air, which works faster and keeps the room temperature between 110 and 160 degrees. Some of its health claims are unproven, but there is evidence that the treatment can be beneficial for people who have joint pain or are ill suited for hotter traditional saunas. Also, it requires less maintenance than a steam room. “It’s been very well received,” said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is marketing the building. Wellness is the theme at other new developments, too. At Waterline Square, a three-tower complex rising on the West Side of Manhattan, the buildings will share a below-grade, roughly 100,000-square-foot area with a saltwater swimming pool, an indoor tennis court, a skate park and other amenities, said Elisa Orlanski Ours, the chief planning and design officer at Corcoran Sunshine. But because the space is subterranean, the developer hired Focus Lighting to install a diurnal LED system that will change throughout the day to mimic the quality of natural light. “We didn’t want it to feel like a Vegas casino,” said Stephanie Daigle, a senior designer with Focus Lighting. The three-story space will have more than 1,000 linear feet of lighting that will mix various tones and colors to create an inviting space. Elsewhere, amenities are embracing a space-age look. At 520 West 28th Street, the futuristic condo designed by Zaha Hadid, there is an equally futuristic-looking IMAX theater — the first in a residential setting in New York. The 10-by-18-foot screen is flanked by a surround-sound system built into custom millwork that evokes the feeling of an alien spacecraft. The 12 fully reclining seats are on platforms that can retract into the wall to create a more open, social space. Not including the price of the technical equipment, the room cost well over $1 million to build. It’s all in service of attracting an upscale clientele. (Naturally, the building also has robotic parking and storage.) So far, half of the 39 units have sold, but the $50 million triplex penthouse is still on the market. Gregory H. Gushée, an executive vice president with Related, the developer, said the company has a special client in mind. In the penthouse library, there is a shelf of carefully chosen books: biographies of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, “The Lord of the Rings,” a treatise on super intelligence — all purported favorites of the Tesla co-founder Elon Musk. “We’re still working on the Elon staging,” he said.

2018,Real Estate’s Constant Conflict,"Do I rent or do I buy? It’s an eternal question, one that can’t be solved with economics alone. This is particularly fraught time to make such a seemingly monumental decision. Interest rates are rising, which means mortgage payments are going up as well. Lock in those rates now or face the prospect of their going back to, well, normal levels (over 6 percent, from today’s 4.5 percent). The stock market, except for a few small corrections, has continued to soar. What that means depends on your outlook: It may be a good time to pull some money out of equity investments and put it into a more stable (and usable) asset like a home, or it may not be the right time, since stocks could continue to rise, increasing your wealth. Unemployment is near historic lows, so people’s finances may look as good as they have in a decade. But layer over all of this the current political environment and the fears — which have persisted for years — that an economic correction must be around the corner, and making what should be a straightforward financial decision becomes tougher. So what do you do? The only thing you can. Draw up a list of pros and cons, just as real estate agents often suggest. HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY? If it’s one or two years, then rent. The costs to buy and sell the house — like that pesky 5 percent to 6 percent brokers’ commission — will make it hard for you not to lose money, Chris Herbert, managing director of Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, pointed out. But if it’s more than five to seven years, buy. Even if the housing market falls in value, your home is likely to rebound, at least to the price you paid, by the time you’re ready to sell. And you get to live there and accrue equity from paying down the mortgage. ARE YOU SETTLED? If you have small children who want outdoor space to play — or you’re tired of bundling them up and taking them to the playground when you really just want to read the paper — a house with a yard probably looks appealing. You’re settled and are likely to be in the same place for a while, dream as you might for that carefree city life of your single days. WEIGH THE COSTS Homeownership is more cost-effective than renting. Rent rises with inflation. You can potentially lock in your mortgage payment for the next 30 years. While rates rise, you have nothing to worry about. But if they drop below what you’re paying, you can refinance and pay less. YOU HAVE FREEDOM You can do what you want with your home. “You get to paint the walls the color you want,” said Christopher J. Mayer, co-director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School. “You get to have the funky granite countertop that no one else but you likes.” YOU’RE FREE You have no children, no responsibilities to anyone but yourself (or perhaps a partner or spouse), and no real ties to where you’re living and working. Rent away. It’s almost a classic example of what economists call sunk costs, — the home — versus opportunity costs, which is the ability to move when and if you want, albeit at the price of uncertain rent. HOME PRICES ARE RISING The supply of housing is low and house values are appreciating quickly. Renting is cheaper in this scenario because of what real estate economists call the price-to-rent ratio. Consider the San Francisco area, where tiny houses can cost big money. Professor Mayer warns that people who plan to stay in a place like the Bay Area may find themselves continually priced out of the housing market. “In San Francisco, home prices have been going up faster than other cities for 60 years,” he said. HEED THE WARNINGS The housing market is due for a correction, so now may be the time to wait. “There are a lot of reasons why there might be some red lights flashing on the dashboard,” Mr. Herbert said. “We’re coming off a period of very strong growth where house prices are beating inflation. What’s enabled them to grow faster is this longer trend putting downward pressure on interest rates.” With a bit of inflation, the cooling could surely start. so timing the real estate market in the short term is just as difficult as timing any other market REALITY CHECK You don’t have the down payment for a home or a steady job to pay the mortgage. Your decision is made for you.",The New York Times
2018,Real People Eat Quiche,"Eat I was writing the menu for our lunch service at Prune a few weeks ago and kept crossing out then penciling back in a classic: quiche Lorraine. I just wasn’t quite sure where we stood, as a nation, on the subject these days. In the ’80s, “quiche eater” was a casual slur to describe feminists and liberals, effeminates and intellectuals alike, prompting T-shirt sloganism and tote-bag activism in response. Grown men wore T-shirts emblazoned with “Real Men Eat Anything” the way they now wear ones that say “The Future Is Female.” You don’t want to go through the considerable work of putting together a warm, trembling, fragrant quiche Lorraine — with a perfect flaky crust and a silken custard streaked with Gruyère and salt pork — to discover that while you were downstairs in the prep kitchen, quiche had been conscripted into some new culture war. Some say it’s really quite simple to make; the phrase “set and forget” is used often. Maybe for some, but while I was putting our lunch menu into place, I made three quiches a day, and I, myself, never achieved anything worth crowing about with such a laissez-faire approach. But when I took all the pains with every step — researching the distinction between Lorraine and Alsacienne (it’s onion); keeping the dough cool and working it with a fork so my hands didn’t melt the fat while blending; blind-baking the shell; raising and reducing the temperature of the oven; grating the Gruyère on the medium teardrops of a box grater — it produced this stunner. It wobbles in the center, and the crust is crisp yet tender and the extra step of blanching the pancetta sands down the domineering top note of the pork and yields an elegant bottom one instead. The pinch of nutmeg is fleeting, but so captivating on first bite, you want to chase after it. Every human working in the restaurant from ages 19 to 53 couldn’t stop commenting on its perfection. It was, like, totally, the platonic ideal. You could make it easier on yourself with packaged dough, I guess, because the custard here is going to do most of the heavy lifting anyway. But if you enjoy working with your hands as much as I do, the sensory and tactile pleasures are immense. Dipping your measuring cup down into the cool silky flour bin. Moving back and forth to the refrigerator with an evenly buttered fluted pan, keeping the thick, milky film of butter from melting and turning greasy. Pouring in the heavy beans and noticing how they come out of the oven at half the weight they went in with; marveling at the difference when you cool your tart shell elevated on a baker’s rack instead of carelessly letting it get soggy by placing it directly on your cutting board — it’s all just work, like laying stone, but I can really vouch for its pleasures. And that’s the thing about stupid quiche. Rubbery, cold, thick, heavy, soggy, banal, underwhelming, ridiculous quiche. It’s only so if you don’t attend to the work of it — if you set it and forget it. I am lucky in that I like work more than I like food. For a chef this may sound pitiable, but happily, restaurant life is about work, about making the food, not consuming it. Every dish we cook we send out to someone else. It’s as if we are midwives to children we will not hold. We may or may not love children, but we love midwifery. We love the boiling of the water and the getting of the towels and the wiping down the surfaces. I know that there is very little argument left for doing it the hard way, and I might be its last champion on earth. My slogans are the worst: The harder the better! If it’s easy; it stinks! But I pull out the aphorisms that worked for me when I was 19 and hope they still have traction with the 19-year-old who is standing across from me at the prep table. If all the cream rises to the top, what happens to the milk? “What does the man do before enlightenment” I ask, quoting some Zen proverb from my own youth. He chops wood and hauls water! And what does he do after enlightenment? He chops wood and hauls water. I’m not sure this lands. Are we laying stone or building a cathedral, people? I’m making the case for building the tart, step by arduous step, stone by stone, with a song in your heart. I go full-bore about the bricklayers, that ultracheesy motivational story, about some visitors who arrive in a foreign city and meet a man on his knees with his masonry tools. He’s sweating and grimacing, and they ask him what he’s doing, and he says, “I am laying stone.” And they see another man on his knees up ahead with his masonry tools, and he says: “I’m building a wall; I got a wife and kids and bills to pay, man!” And they come upon the next guy on his knees with his masonry tools, and he is whistling and aglow, with a song in his heart, and he says: “Me? I’m building a cathedral.” And there you have it, the quiche, now drafted into the service of my own cultural war against shortcuts and half-measures — while back upstairs the guests have arrived for lunch, and, it turns out, they order the quiche.

2018,Real vs. Artificial Christmas Trees: Which Is the Greener Choice?,"It’s the centerpiece of the biggest holiday of the year for many American families: the Christmas tree, the focal point for parties and presents, replete with favorite ornaments and lights. Some cherish the scent of a real tree and the tradition of bringing it home, while others prefer the tidier and easier option of the plastic variety. But which is better for the environment? Here’s a look at some of the central claims — and the common misconceptions — in that debate. Don’t feel bad about cutting down a tree for the holiday. Christmas trees are crops grown on farms, like lettuce or corn. They are not cut down from wild forests on a large scale, said Bert Cregg, an expert in Christmas tree production and forestry at Michigan State University. A five- or six-foot tree takes just under a decade to grow, and once it’s cut down, the farmer will generally plant at least one in its place. The trees provide many benefits to the environment as they grow, cleaning the air and providing watersheds and habitats for wildlife. They grow best on rolling hills that are often unsuitable for other crops and, of course, they are biodegradable. Oregon is the country’s biggest grower, followed by North Carolina. Many other states also have sizable Christmas tree farms, which preserve open land from development by their very existence. Big growers tend to dominate in Oregon, like Holiday Tree Farms, which uses helicopters to harvest about a million trees annually, for sale at big box stores and other locations. In western North Carolina, the farms tend to be smaller, like the one owned by Larry Smith, who has been growing trees for more than 40 years. His business, Mountain Top Fraser Fir, was chosen to supply this year’s White House Christmas tree, a 19-foot specimen on display in the Blue Room. “Tell the kids and grandkids to keep buying real trees so we keep the local economy strong and we don’t have to sell the land to the rich people from New York City to make condos,” Mr. Smith said. Prices for real trees have reached record highs over the last few years because farmers planted fewer trees during the 2008 recession. That may have driven some families to make the leap to a manufactured one. The average price was $75 for a real tree last year, while the average price for an artificial tree — which can be reused — was $107, according to a Nielsen/Harris poll conducted on behalf of the National Christmas Tree Association, which represents sellers of real trees. Tim O’Connor, a spokesman for the organization, said the best way to ensure future supply was to buy a tree this year. A recent survey for the American Christmas Tree Association, conducted by Nielsen, found that three quarters of American households display a tree — and the vast majority of those, around 80 percent, are artificial. Most of the artificial trees on the market are made of PVC and steel in China and shipped to the United States — and eventually sent to a landfill. While that may not sound eco-friendly, the A.C.T.A., which represents manufacturers, claims the environmental impact is lower than that of a real tree if you use the artificial tree for five or more years. The group argues that getting a new, real tree each year — and possibly disposing of it in a landfill at the end of the season — has a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy use, and other areas than a reused artificial tree does. That assertion is based on a study carried out on the group’s behalf by WAP Sustainability Consulting. Mr. O’Connor of the N.C.T.A., the organization that represents sellers of real trees, said he rejected the study’s findings, saying it was “fall-off-your-horse simple that a tree made out of oil, turned into PVC plastic in China and shipped over on a boat, cannot be better than growing a real tree.” Mr. Cregg, the forestry expert at Michigan State, said the study’s parameters were too narrow. What about the effect on wildlife and local water supplies, he asked, and the benefit of preserving farmland and jobs? “Are you interested in supporting the local economy and keeping plastic out of landfills?” he said. “Those would be the questions I would focus on.” Thomas Harman, the founder and chief executive of Balsam Hill, a high-end artificial tree company, said that his factories recycle scrap plastic for use in some components of their products. But manufacturing a recyclable tree has been challenging. The copper, steel and plastic that are fused together in the production process would need to be taken apart to be recycled. In the meantime, he encouraged people to reuse trees and to adorn them with LED lights, which save energy. “We’re focused on making our trees reusable as long as possible,” Mr. Harman said. “I hope that our trees are in use 20 or 30 years later.” The preference for real trees is strongest in the Northeast and along the West Coast, data from the A.C.T.A. shows. Mr. O’Connor said that younger, more environmentally conscious consumers — the same ones who buy organic produce at the grocery store — are increasingly embracing real trees. And some families enjoy visiting farms to choose and cut their own trees. “There’s this wonderful family experience that’s just not parallel to dragging a dusty box out of the attic,” Mr. O’Connor said. Bill Ulfelder, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy in New York, said real trees were “unquestionably” the better option. He added that there are ways shoppers can lessen the impact of using a real tree: Shop locally, minimize driving and recycle the tree. New York City collects thousands of trees for MulchFest each year, and uses the mulch in public parks to enrich soil and prevent erosion. Some areas also use discarded trees to prevent beach erosion or sink them into lakes to create fish habitats. You can also avoid the need to discard an old tree entirely. Some vendors sell living Christmas trees that can be replanted. Others rent traditional Christmas trees, complete with delivery and setup. Brad McAllister, a managing director of WAP Sustainability Consulting, said he was surprised by how small the impact of either tree choice was compared with other central elements of the holidays, like air travel and shopping. “If a consumer wants to celebrate the holidays in a truly environmental fashion, they need to look beyond just the Christmas tree,” he said. Jami Warner, the executive director of the A.C.T.A., was eager to avoid a direct confrontation on the issue of real versus artificial. “We really do believe that there is no such thing as a bad Christmas tree,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Rebecca Berg, Brendan Buck","Rebecca Genelle Berg and Brendan Kelley Buck were married Nov. 17 at the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va. The Rev. Jeffrey L. Maszal, a United Church of Christ minister, officiated. Ms. Berg, 28, is a CNN political reporter based in Washington focusing on campaigns and elections. She graduated from the University of Missouri. She is a daughter of Kristi M. Gomez of San Diego, and the late Steven I. Berg. Her mother, a real estate broker, is the owner of San Diego Castles Realty in Poway, Calif., of which her father, who also was a real estate broker, was an owner. The bride is a stepdaughter of Manuel B. Gomez. The groom, 36, is the chief communications adviser to Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Mr. Buck graduated from the University of Georgia. The groom’s previous marriage ended in divorce. He is a son of Tracey Kelley Buck and Mark A. Buck of Atlanta. The groom’s mother retired as a software consultant from the Atlanta office of SAP America, which is based in Newtown Square, Pa., and continues to work as an independent software contractor in Atlanta. His father, who is retired, owned a recruiting company in Atlanta focusing on the hospitality industry. The couple met in 2013 in a basement hallway of the United States Capitol while Ms. Berg as a congressional reporter at BuzzFeed was on the phone with a source, and Mr. Buck, who was a press secretary for the House speaker at the time, John A. Boehner, mingled with reporters. She said she paused long enough to introduce herself to the press secretary who strode by in a gray suit and cowboy boots. A few weeks later she asked him out professionally, and they grabbed drinks at the Tune Inn, a bar on Capitol Hill. After speaking for hours she said it became abundantly clear there was something more romantic going on, and they began dating. “By necessity we’ve been very strict on separating the personal from the professional in our lives,” she said. Mr. Buck said that “it’s not too big of a challenge. When we’re home we don’t make work our lives.”",The New York Times
2018,"Rebuffing C.I.A., Trump Says It Only Has ‘Feelings’ About Khashoggi Killing","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump on Thursday rebuffed the C.I.A. over its conclusion that the Saudi crown prince was responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, saying the agency merely had “feelings” on the matter, and he threatened to close the entire southern border if a caravan that is so far waiting patiently on the Mexican side grows “uncontrollable.” Mr. Trump made the remarks as he fielded questions from reporters at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, expanding on the grievances that have filled his Twitter feed over the past few days. The exchange was a notable deviation on a Thanksgiving that was otherwise almost an exact replica of how the president, a known creature of habit, spent the holiday last year. There were the early-morning tweets, this year attacking perceived judicial adversaries. There was the address to American troops stationed around the world, delivered from an opulent room at Mar-a-Lago, which he has deemed “the southern White House.” There was the visit to a Coast Guard station, where he raved about the Guard’s rising “brand.” And there was his expression of thanks for his family and for his “having made a tremendous difference in this country.” Mr. Trump’s dispute with his own intelligence agencies over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, an opinion columnist for The Washington Post, trailed him into the holiday weekend. The president doubled down on his insistence that an alliance with Saudi Arabia, sweetened by low oil prices and billions in investment, had more value than repercussions for any culpability in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. “Do people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs?” Mr. Trump said of the partnership with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s day-to-day ruler. “And frankly, if we went by this standard, we wouldn’t be able to have anybody as an ally,” he added. The C.I.A. has concluded that the crown prince ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, American officials have said. But Mr. Trump insisted that Prince Mohammed “hates it more than I do” that the assassination took place, and disputed that the C.I.A. had made a conclusion that the prince was to blame, saying the agency’s leaders “have feelings, certain ways.” Pressed on who should be held to account for the murder, the president said that “maybe the world should be held accountable, because the world is a vicious place.” Mr. Trump also threatened to close the southern border if he decided that officials in Mexico had lost control of security there, again wielding the presence of the migrant caravan in Tijuana as fodder for his call for an immigration crackdown, including a possible government shutdown if Congress does not fund his border wall. The migrants are waiting there to make asylum claims. “When they lose control of the border on the Mexico side,” he said, “we’ll just close the border.” He renewed his threat to veto any budget legislation in December that does not include funding for the wall, a move that would shut down parts of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security. When Mr. Trump spoke via teleconference to the troops stationed abroad, with servers quietly setting up tables nearby, presumably for the Thanksgiving feast to come, he assured them that under his leadership, the country was prospering in their absence. He indulged in a series of riffs about their service, immigration and, in one instance, the merits of an electromagnetic catapult system. “Steam is very reliable and the electromagnetic, unfortunately, you have to be Albert Einstein to really work it properly,” Mr. Trump said to one naval officer. (“You have to be Albert Einstein to run the nuclear power plants we have here as well,” the officer said, “but we’re doing that very well.”) “How are they feeling about trade?” he asked another officer. (“We don’t see any issues in terms of trade right now,” the officer said.) “It’s a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services,” he informed another commander, referring to a federal judge’s ruling that the administration must resume accepting asylum claims. “When they tell you how to protect the border, it’s a disgrace” (There was no specific response.) During the teleconference, which included troops stationed in Afghanistan, the president hinted at a coming visit to armed forces abroad. The president, who has faced renewed scrutiny over his complicated relationship with the military, including claims that his movement of troops to the border was a political sham, has not yet visited service members overseas, as his predecessors did. Mr. Trump later stopped to deliver sandwiches at a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Fla. — forever the marketer, for the second year in a row he celebrated the flourishing “brand” of the military branch — before an afternoon at his West Palm Beach golf course. Melania Trump, the first lady, did not join him as she did last year for his visit with the Coast Guard members. But she joined him and other members of the Trump family, including his children and grandchildren, at Mar-a-Lago for the Thanksgiving dinner. Under rows of glittering chandeliers, the family, joined by guests and members of the club, dined from an extravagant display that included assorted desserts, Florida seafood, whipped and sweet potatoes, vegetables, traditional stuffing, a carving station with turkey, beef tenderloin, lamb and salmon, and a romaine-free salad bar.",The New York Times
2018,Receiver Dez Bryant to Join the New Orleans Saints,"Dez Bryant, the out-of-work star wide receiver, will be joining the New Orleans Saints, giving them another weapon in their increasingly plausible quest for an N.F.L. championship. Bryant, 30, has been out of the league since April, when he was released by the Cowboys in a salary cap move. Bryant worked out with the Saints on Tuesday. While there was no formal announcement from the Saints yet, Bryant on Wednesday retweeted several posts saying he had signed. The passionate Bryant is known for highlight reel catches. A three-time Pro Bowler, he led the league with 16 touchdown receptions in 2014. Last season, he played all 16 games for the Cowboys and finished with 838 yards and six touchdowns, both team highs. When he was released, the news came as a blow to much of the Dallas fan base, which had made him one of the team’s most popular players. Bryant has caught 73 touchdown passes in his career, fifth among active players. This season, the Cowboys (3-5) have turned, with mixed results, to receivers Cole Beasley and Michael Gallup. No Cowboy has more than two receiving touchdowns. The Saints will face the Cowboys in Dallas on Nov. 29. The Saints (7-1) are being mentioned as Super Bowl favorites, especially after a victory on Sunday over the previously undefeated Los Angeles Rams. Bryant will join a receiving corps that includes Michael Thomas, with 880 yards and five touchdowns. Thomas thrust himself onto the national stage on Sunday after a touchdown by pulling out a hidden flip phone and pretending to make a call, a homage to a stunt pulled by Joe Horn 15 years ago. Led by the future Hall-of-Famer Drew Brees at quarterback, the Saints have the N.F.L.’s seventh-ranked passing offense entering Week 10, averaging 290 yards per game. Bryant’s most memorable moment may have been on an incomplete pass. In the 2014 playoffs against the Packers, he appeared to catch a fourth-down pass near the end zone late in a close game. But after a review, it was ruled that he failed to control the ball. The Cowboys lost and have not won a playoff game since. Bryant is also known for making an X symbol with his arms after scoring. He tags some Twitter posts with “#throwupthex.” Expect to see Bryant throw up the X in Saints colors in the near future.",The New York Times

2018,Record Number of Migrants in Families Were Apprehended at Border Last Month,"WASHINGTON — The number of migrants traveling in families who were apprehended at the southwest border surged past 20,000 last month, according to new data released on Friday by the Customs and Border Protection agency. The increase was reported hours after the Trump administration issued a proclamation on new measures to limit the number of people applying for asylum in the United States. The 23,121 people traveling in families who either surrendered or were arrested by Border Patrol agents represent a record over a one-month period. In September, nearly 16,658 people in families were apprehended at the border, prompting the Trump administration to label the increase in migrants an unprecedented crisis and national security threat. Over all, the data shows that Border Patrol agents apprehended 50,975 people last month, the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. Customs and Border Protection quietly released the new data on its website on Friday evening without comment. The new data also follows Mr. Trump’s ordered deployment of 5,600 active-duty military troops to the southwest border. They are there to help stop what had been estimated as 6,000 migrants heading to the United States after fleeing the grinding poverty and violence of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Many of the migrants, currently traveling through Mexico, have said they intend to seek asylum in the United States. The number of people in the caravan has declined in recent days, and it is unclear how many will reach the border. The group is still weeks away. The increase in migrants is certain to put more pressure on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary whose job security is seen as increasingly vulnerable. Mr. Trump has repeatedly complained that Ms. Nielsen has failed to stem the flow of illegal migration that rose after the administration’s first year. It was unknown if Mr. Trump, who was traveling to Paris, had been briefed on the new apprehension numbers. The president has made clear that he is frustrated by the rising border numbers. In a proclamation issued on Friday, the Trump administration said it would deny asylum to all migrants who tried to enter the United States at the southwest border, except through official American ports of entry. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union had filed a lawsuit to stop the changes. In the lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in San Francisco, lawyers for the group said that the president’s proclamation was “in direct violation of Congress’s clear command that manner of entry cannot constitute a categorical asylum bar.” It also accused the administration of moving ahead “without the required procedural steps and without good cause for immediately putting the rule into effect.”",The New York Times
2018,Record and Share Your Family History in 5 Steps,"TECH TIP Holiday gatherings offer a great time to create a multimedia digital archive of interviews with your relatives so they can share their memories with the current — and future — branches of the tree. Many people have pieced together their own family tree. But how much do you really know about the early lives of your living relatives, especially those with decades of stories to share? To learn more, take the time to talk during family gatherings over Thanksgiving and the holiday season. And make sure to save that oral history for future generations: Record and preserve it with a multimedia digital archive, with video or audio, or with both. Here are five simple steps to get you started. Do everyone a favor and plan ahead. To be as thorough and efficient as possible, you’ll want to know what to ask before you whip out the recorder to interview the family matriarch over her pumpkin pie. And find a relaxed setting to calm any stage fright. Ask your relatives to dig back in their pasts: What’s your first memory? What was your favorite song growing up? How did you win that medal? If you don’t want to put your interviewees on the spot, send them the questions ahead of time. And ask them to tell treasured family tales in their own words. If you’re not sure what to ask, search a few family history websites like Ancestry.com or The Genealogy Guide for sample questions. The Center for Oral History Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, also has a good list of questions. Smartphones and digital cameras are great for video interviews, and you can use video-editing software to edit the clips later. But consider getting a tabletop tripod for the phone or camera (often less than $25) to stabilize the recording and free you up to interact more with your subject. If you’re serious about sound quality, an external microphone can also improve your interview. A good small clip-on lapel (lavaliere) microphone for smartphone or camera — like the Boya BY-M1 or the Rode SmartLav+ — costs $20 to $60 and can make your subjects more at ease than a hand-held mic shoved in their faces. Video files can be huge and some relatives may be uncomfortable on camera, so recording a simple audio session is another approach. The iPhone has a Voice Memos app, and if your Android phone didn’t come with a voice recorder, go to the Google Play store. An external microphone can help here, too. If you prefer not to load up your phone’s storage, a pocket digital voice recorder is an alternative. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests and reviews products, recommends the Sony UX560 model, which can record up to 39 hours of MP3 audio and has a USB connector for moving the files to the computer. Recording directly onto the laptop with an external microphone (like a podcast) is another way to capture the spoken-word history. Free software like the cross-platform Audacity or GarageBand for iOS and macOS can also be used to edit the interviews. Some family historians started recording long before the modern tech boom, like a grandfather’s World War II experiences saved on an audio cassette. If you have treasured recordings on ancient formats made with long-gone devices, look for a well-reviewed conversion service that will transform the material into digital files. Memories Renewed (favored by Wirecutter) and Lotus Media are among the mail-in media conversion shops that handle several formats, including 8- and 16-millimeter film reels, VHS and Hi8 video, and audiotape. Walgreens and Costco also have media-transfer services. If you still have the old video playback hardware, kits like the $70 Roxio Easy VHS to DVD 3 package (or a similar product) let you do it yourself. For old cassettes, gadgets like the ClearClick Cassette Tape to USB Converter or ION Audio’s Tape Express Plus connect to the computer’s USB port and digitize the audio when you push “Play.” When you have finished and edited your interviews, loop in the rest of the family. You can post the files to a password-protected file-sharing site (like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud or OneDrive) for others to stream or download. Some genealogy sites allow media uploads to family-tree pages. If you have an account with one of these services, see if it can handle audio and video files. And if your site doesn’t allow uploads, store the content on a sharing site and post links in the biographical sections for each recorded relative in your tree. If you have a large family, compiling the interviews from your archive can be a lot of work. But generations down the line, the voices of your ancestors will still be heard.",The New York Times
2018,Recount Ordered in Florida Senate Race as Governor’s Contest Nears End,"RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. — Florida concluded the first phase of a tumultuous recount of its midterm election on Thursday, with state officials ordering a manual recount in the hotly contested Senate race between Rick Scott, the Republican governor, and the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson. Mr. Scott maintained a slim lead over his opponent. Ron DeSantis, a fiery conservative and enthusiastic ally of President Trump, held onto a more substantial lead in the race for governor, avoiding a next round of recounts despite the vow of his Democratic opponent, Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, to push the authorities to count additional ballots. “It is not over until every legally casted vote is counted,” Mr. Gillum declared at the end of another chaotic day — nine days after the election — in which the state’s two marquee races remained disconcertingly up in the air. From the early morning hours through midafternoon, when the results of the state’s machine recount were posted, lawyers for both parties filed new lawsuits, rushed to court hearings and issued statements challenging the conduct of the vote — crucial arguments on voter suppression and ballot recognition that will help lay the legal groundwork for the 2020 election. Confusion and disorder reigned through much of the five-day machine recount. Broward County, the scene of several years of vote-counting problems, was two minutes late in reporting its data and state officials refused to accept its tallies. Authorities in Hillsborough County said they could not submit recount totals because their new tally had 846 fewer votes than originally counted. The office had two power failures during the recount that may have led to the discrepancy, they said. “We have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election,” Judge Mark E. Walker of the Federal District Court in Tallahassee told lawyers Thursday morning. “Yet we still chose not to fix it.” In results reported by the Florida secretary of state, Mr. DeSantis held a 33,683-vote lead over Mr. Gillum, a margin of 0.41 percentage points — enough to avoid an order by state officials for a manual recount. Mr. Gillum said he would continue his push to have all ballots — including some of those initially rejected because of mismatched signatures or other problems — counted before any election results were certified. “A vote denied is justice denied — the State of Florida must count every legally cast vote,” he said in a statement. But people close to Mr. Gillum said he had few illusions about pulling out a victory at this point, and his decision to remain in the race was less about strategy than recognizing voters and supporters who wanted him to keep fighting until every alternative had been exhausted. [Follow the latest Florida election results] Mr. DeSantis said the new results were “clear and unambiguous, just as they were on election night.” Mr. Gillum initially delivered an emotional concession speech to his supporters late on Election Day, then withdrew his concession as the vote margin narrowed and Democratic lawyers filed a flurry of lawsuits to allow additional ballots to be counted. Meanwhile, state officials ordered a manual recount in the Senate race, where Mr. Scott held a 12,603-vote lead over Mr. Nelson, a margin of 0.15 percentage points. Under state law, a manual recount is ordered when the margin is less than 0.25 percentage points. The Associated Press said it would not call any of Florida’s races until the results were certified by state elections authorities. That is scheduled to happen on Nov. 20. Mr. Scott, who has joined Mr. Trump in publicly berating Mr. Nelson for not quitting the race, renewed his call for Mr. Nelson to drop out immediately. “Last week, Florida voters elected me as their next U.S. senator and now the ballots have been counted twice,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. “Our state needs to move forward. We need to put this election behind us, and it is time for Bill Nelson to respect the will of the voters and graciously bring this process to an end, rather than proceed with yet another count of the votes — which will yield the same result, and bring more embarrassment to the state that we both love and have served.” Mr. Nelson, backed by a high-powered Washington legal team, disregarded those calls, and remained committed to fighting until all his legal options are exhausted, several people close to the three-term senator said. His lawyer, Marc Elias, said the manual recount — which must be completed by Sunday — would finally provide the answers the Nelson campaign had sought. He predicted that tens of thousands of as-yet uncounted votes would swing the race in his client’s favor. The new count will not tally all votes cast, but will examine all ballots in which voters either cast two votes for one race, known as an overvote, or none, known as an undervote. Mr. Elias in a conference call Thursday evening suggested there were as many as 23,000 of those kinds of votes in Broward County alone. We’re tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins. “We will be able to see whether there were markings on those ballots or not,” Mr. Elias said. Veterans of Florida elections from both parties expressed disgust over an array of technical breakdowns, human glitches and missed deadlines that seem to plague the state’s decentralized, county-based elections system with Groundhog Day predictability. Broward County, where election workers had toiled late into the night for days on end to recount their votes, saw it all amount to nothing when state officials rejected the tally as too late. “Basically I just worked my ass off for nothing,” said Joseph D’Alessandro, the county’s election planning and development director. He said he had had difficulty uploading the results because he was not familiar with the website. The machine recount broke down completely in Palm Beach County. Authorities there said the tabulation equipment came up short “a significant number” of ballots in the final Senate tally, making it impossible for the county to meet the Thursday deadline. Many of the antiquated tabulation machines used by the county overheated earlier this week, creating the need to count nearly 200,000 votes again. An additional problem surfaced later, according to the Palm Beach County elections supervisor, Susan Bucher. After the mechanical failure was corrected and the machines were restarted, they apparently failed to tabulate entire boxes of votes; the totals did not add up, Ms. Bucher said. Ms. Bucher would not say exactly how many boxes of ballots were missing from the count. “A little bit more than a dozen precincts lost substantial numbers,” she said. Workers were having to look through count logs to see how many ballots are missing from each precinct, and to try to figure out, based on the numbers of ballots in the box, which of them might have to be put through the machine again, she said. Despite all the problems, most election workers in Palm Beach County did not show up for work until about 10 a.m. on Thursday. Ms. Bucher defended her decision to let her exhausted staff go home at 9 p.m. the night before to sleep and eat. A skilled team of three workers needed to be alert on Thursday morning to try to solve the machine malfunctions, she said. “You can’t just have anybody run this,” she said. In all three counties that did not have recount results accepted, initial tallies reported before the statewide machine recounts will stand. Perhaps inevitably, the various snafus have led to lawsuits, most of them filed by Mr. Nelson’s campaign and allied Democratic groups. The initial phase of the recount was the subject of about a dozen lawsuits over which ballots would be counted and what deadlines would apply. With Palm Beach County unable to produce a final tally in time, lawyers held a hearing in federal court Thursday morning on a Democratic Party effort to get the recount deadlines extended. Judge Walker asked a question none of the lawyers seemed able to answer: Would it be legal to proceed with recount results that are missing one county? “There is no constitutional right to have your vote counted a second time or a third time,” Mohammad Omar Jazil, a lawyer for the Florida secretary of state, told the court. Democratic lawyers filed a new lawsuit Thursday afternoon against Palm Beach County, seeking a hand recount of all ballots in the county “due to systematic machine failure during the machine count,” Mr. Nelson’s lawyer, Mr. Elias, said on Twitter. Separately, Judge Walker ruled early Thursday that a state law allowing county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots because voters’ signatures do not match the ones on file threatens to unconstitutionally disenfranchise thousands of voters. His order gives voters whose ballots were invalidated by signature mismatches until 5 p.m. Saturday to resolve the problems with their ballots. The new deadline would apply to some of the just over 4,000 voters who were notified late that their mail-in ballots had been rejected because of a signature mismatch. Those voters will now have until Saturday to confirm their identities. “There are dozens of reasons a signature mismatch may occur, even when the individual signing is in fact the voter,” the judge wrote. “What this case comes down to is that without procedural safeguards, the use of signature matching is not reasonable and may lead to unconstitutional disenfranchisement.” Although the rejected ballots were split among party lines, with slightly more Democratic votes, they disproportionately affected young voters. Daniel A. Smith, an elections expert at the University of Florida, said 26 percent of the ballots rejected for user error belonged to people under 30, even though young voters constituted only about 7 percent of those who voted by mail. Mr. Smith’s tabulations show that 10,000 ballots were rejected for signature or other user error problems, more than double the preliminary figures the state provided to the federal court. Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which this year commissioned Mr. Smith to conduct a study on various problems with mail-in voting, said the problems with Florida’s methods of reviewing signatures on ballots have long been apparent. “It’s not like nobody could see this coming,” he said.",The New York Times

If you’re wondering why you haven’t seen this at this box office, it’s because it’s not a movie. It’s a video game. To put those numbers in context, this year’s biggest Marvel film, “Avengers: Infinity War,” grossed about $640 million worldwide in its opening weekend. In popular entertainment, nothing is bigger than video games, and the holiday shopping season is when many of the year’s most anticipated releases hit stores. Yet video games remain something of a second-class cultural medium, even as geek culture has otherwise ascended into the mainstream. Today’s elite tastemakers might be perfectly comfortable discussing the inner workings of the banking system in Westeros, but gaming is still stigmatized, at best as a guilty pleasure, and at worst as a psychologically destructive hobby for socially stunted young men. So the perception is that video games don’t really matter, because they have nothing — or at least nothing important — to say. This is understandable, but wrong. Yes, many video games are violent and frivolous, and the most devoted players still tend to be young and male. But the best games reveal a mass cultural medium that has come fully into its own, artistically flourishing in ways that resemble the movie industry during its 20th-century peak and television over the past 20 years. From “The Searchers” to “The Godfather,” from “The Sopranos” to “The Americans,” what connects these eras, and their most outstanding works, is a shared ambition, a desire to be both grand and granular, telling individual stories against the backdrop of national and cultural identity, deconstructing their genres while advancing the form. If ever a video game has risen to the level of those classics, it’s Red Dead Redemption 2. With an enormous production budget, seven years of development and a script running about 2,000 pages just for the main story, it might well be the most ambitious game ever made. Like the classic westerns and gangster stories it draws from, it can be crude and violent. But it is also richly cinematic and even literary, serving up breathtaking digital vistas reminiscent of John Ford films along with a mix of deftly scripted stories about outlaws, immigrants, hustlers, con artists, lawmen and entrepreneurs, all trying to eke out an existence on the edges of civilization. It’s a game about power, violence, frontier justice and murky moral choices — a new American epic for the digital age. As a technical achievement, it has no peers. Red Dead Redemption 2 teems with life. Towns have daily rhythms, tied to time and weather, that seem to go on without you. Wildlife roams the countryside, growing skittish if you move too close. Many video games allow players to interact with other characters only by attacking them; here, every character, even the least important digital extra, can be spoken to, and often conversed with at length. Violence is anything but mindless. You play as the outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, whose goal is to help restore the gang to glory after a significant defeat. There are plenty of shootouts, chases and heists. But you can usually choose to avoid them — and when you don’t, they almost always come with a cost: Sheriffs and bounty hunters chase you down, important game options disappear, whole towns become hostile territory, horses you’ve bonded with (making them faster or more responsive) die. Instead of indulging no-regrets fantasy violence, it is a literary experience that emphasizes — and simulates — tragedy and personal consequences. There is a big narrative difference between games and novels and movies: Instead of consuming a story, in a game you become part of it, choosing how it will unfold — even, in some cases, changing how it ends. Most choices, however, are smaller in scale, focused on the mechanics of interacting with the world. In both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Fallout 76 — an ambitious open-world game set in a post-apocalyptic West Virginia released this month — the emphasis is on staying alive: While playing, you must manage virtual campsites, and eat or drink to avoid in-game penalties. These activities can feel like chores, but they also nudge players into a more contemplative style of play, forcing them to slow down and explore their surroundings, scrounging for supplies instead of running toward the next objective. These games are existential journeys built on the rhythms of survival. Fallout 76 is similarly obsessed with Americana — but with its end rather than its formation. You emerge from a fallout shelter and are given the task of following in the footsteps of its former Overseer. Along the way, you encounter the ruins of the nation after a nuclear holocaust, often in the form of written or recorded letters and diaries. Enter a dilapidated capitol and you might discover a series of notes about a legislative initiative. It’s a game set in a world in which West Virginia is an echo lost to war, an interactive history lesson for you to explore. Because they take so long to play — 60 hours is typical, and 100 or more is not unheard-of — games can make for unhealthy attachments. Yet these games can also provide a way of confronting reality or, at the very least, an artificially rendered simulacrum of it that is heightened, shaped and structured by an authorial presence. The best of these works create an empathetic connection between viewer and character. In Red Dead Redemption 2, the fact that the player controls much of the action enhances the connection; you feel for Arthur Morgan, a bad man with a good heart, because his choices are, in fact, your own. Gaming’s cultural reputation is born partly from the sense that playing is a way of avoiding responsibility, of escaping into virtual worlds where nothing matters. But Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about both making choices and living with them, about taking responsibility for how you’ve lived. It’s a game, in other words, that implicitly tells its players to grow up — and it’s as sure a sign as any that video games are starting to do just that.

2018,Red Wings Snap Rangers’ Winning Streak,"N.H.L. Roundup Dylan Larkin scored with 5.1 seconds remaining in overtime, capping an impressive late comeback by the Detroit Red Wings in a 3-2 victory over the visiting Rangers on Friday night. Andreas Athanasiou, who had tied the game with 2 minutes 2 seconds remaining in the third period, backhanded a pass to Larkin, who redirected the puck past Henrik Lundqvist for his seventh goal of the season. The Rangers had been leading by 2-0 after two periods, but their four-game winning streak came to an end. Detroit has won five of its last six games after winning just one of its first 10. The Rangers scored twice, 40 seconds apart, while Detroit’s Jacob de la Rose was serving a double minor for high-sticking. Kevin Shattenkirk beat goaltender Jimmy Howard with a wrist shot from the top of the left circle. Then, with de la Rose still in the box, Neal Pionk’s perimeter shot appeared to deflect off a Detroit player on its way in. Lundqvist’s bid for his first shutout in nearly a year ended with 18:14 left in the third. Gustav Nyquist took the puck from Rangers defenseman Brendan Smith and fed Justin Abdelkader on the doorstep for an easy goal. MAPLE LEAFS 6, DEVILS 1 John Tavares scored his ninth goal of the season, Patrick Marleau had his 600th N.H.L. assist, and the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the visiting Devils. Nazem Kadri, Connor Brown, Andreas Johnsson, Morgan Rielly and Tyler Ennis also scored, and Frederik Andersen made 38 saves. Toronto improved to 11-5-0 with its third straight victory. Travis Zajac scored for the Devils. Playing their sixth game on a seven-game trip, the Devils have won just two of their last 10 games. They are 1-5 on the trip and have been outscored by 29-15.",The New York Times
2018,Red-State Voters Stand by Republicans Despite Trump’s Trade War Pain,"WASHINGTON — Voters in red states largely shrugged off concerns about the economic effect of President Trump’s global trade war, throwing their support behind Republican candidates who embraced the administration’s protectionist agenda despite attempts by Democrats to turn it into a wedge issue. In a series of high-stakes Senate races in states exposed to Mr. Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs, voters ousted three incumbent Democrats on Tuesday who tried, in varying degrees, to tie their Republican opponents to the president’s tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese goods. Those tariffs have provoked retaliatory levies on agricultural and industrial products in Republican strongholds. Democrats tried to seize on the issue, to little effect. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota ran ads accusing her opponent, Representative Kevin Cramer, of failing to protect farmers from China’s retaliation — remarking that her state needed Mr. Trump’s help “like a cow needs a hamburger.” Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri toured a nail company that said it was going to go out of business as a result of steel and aluminum tariffs. Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana said the tariffs would cause “lasting harm” for Hoosier farmers. All of them lost, and badly. Mr. Cramer, who mildly criticized the tariffs but praised Mr. Trump’s overall approach, beat Ms. Heitkamp by nearly 11 points. Josh Hawley, who unseated Ms. McCaskill, and Mike Braun, who trounced Mr. Donnelly by nearly 10 points, did not back away from their support for the tariffs. “Senator McCaskill thought she could drive a wedge between Josh and the ag community. It didn’t work,” said Kyle Plotkin, Mr. Hawley’s campaign manager, referring to the agricultural community. In many ways, the races were a test of whether Mr. Trump’s strategy of emphasizing short-term pain for long-term gain would resonate with parts of the country battered by, or hostile to, globalization. “People are willing to deal with some short-term pain to serve a long-term goal,” said Eric Branstad, a former administration official in the Commerce Department who ran Mr. Trump’s campaign in the state two years ago. “The fact that Trump concluded a deal with Canada and Mexico gave people a sense that things were moving in the right direction,” Mr. Branstad said. “There’s also the trust factor for him here.” Republicans lost two House seats in Iowa, which has also been hit by retaliatory tariffs on soybeans, pigs and other agricultural products. But those losses had less to do with trade than with suburban gains by Democrats in more affluent and educated areas adjacent to midsize cities like Des Moines and Davenport. In North Dakota, where soybean farmers have struggled with China’s retaliatory tariffs, 93 percent of Republican voters supported the president’s positions on trade, about the national average for Republicans, according to exit polls from CNN. Nationally, less than a third of all voters said that Mr. Trump’s trade policies had hurt them. It is impossible to quantify the influence of the president’s trade policies, especially in industrial states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, in which support for Democrats surged significantly. But Democratic consultants in those states said the tariffs contributed to a general anti-Trump sentiment, but were not a central issue in the midterm elections. An analysis by The New York Times of election results and economic data showed that Mr. Trump’s party continued to perform strongly in agriculture-rich House districts — which helped create a rural firewall that largely limited the party’s losses to suburban areas. Republicans held onto 17 of the 25 districts that are the most dependent on agricultural jobs. Democrats retained the four they held, with two seats held by Republicans yet to be decided. Mr. Trump’s overall popularity in rural America seems to be growing — and it seems to have been stoked by the tactic, employed by China and other trading partners, of targeting retaliatory tariffs at Trump-friendly districts. “I think our pain definitely has a purpose,” said Doug Schroeder, a corn and soybean farmer from Mahomet, Ill., a district that voted Republican on Tuesday. “I don’t think the balance of trade with China has been fair for a long time. Someone needed to stand up and do something.” In Washington State’s Fourth Congressional District, which includes much of the state’s wine-producing region, Representative Dan Newhouse, the Republican incumbent, defeated his challenger by 28 points on Tuesday. Two years ago, in a far more Republican-friendly environment over all, Mr. Newhouse won by just 16 points. The expansion of the Republican majority in the Senate, and the failure of the tariffs to ignite a political brush fire, is likely to embolden Mr. Trump as he contemplates additional tariffs on all Chinese imports before he meets with President Xi Jinping of China this month in Buenos Aires. Mr. Trump, speaking on Wednesday at a White House news conference, signaled he would continue his pugilistic approach to trade. Mr. Trump heralded the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which still needs to be approved by Congress and expressed hope that Democrats, who now control the House, will help shepherd it through. He boasted that tariffs on China were filling the coffers at the Treasury Department. And he reiterated his threat to impose tariffs on automobiles from countries that do not agree to trade deals that benefit the United States, suggesting that tariffs on Japanese cars could soon be in store. “Say hello to Shinzo,” Mr. Trump told a Japanese reporter, referring to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “I’m sure he’s happy about tariffs on his cars.” Still, the trade issue, so central to Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and appeal to voters in the Midwest, was little more than background noise in states like Indiana and Missouri, overshadowed by the fierce and polarizing debates over health care, immigration and Mr. Trump himself. And even in North Dakota, where farmers are reporting a sharp decrease in Chinese demand for soybeans, the political consequence was barely detectable. Mr. Trump, who authorized a $12 billion bailout in July for farmers hit by China’s tariffs, made a point of playing down his own responsibility for the pain felt by local businesses and farms, repeatedly placing the blame on Beijing. In September, a staff member for a Republican congressional candidate in Iowa contacted the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, with word that The Des Moines Register was running a paid supplement from a Chinese state-run news organization trying to undercut support for Mr. Trump among Iowans. Days later, at the United Nations, Mr. Trump used the paper to accuse China of “trying to meddle in our elections” — a charge Beijing vehemently denied. “China was very attuned to our internal politics, and they tried to maximize the angst that was felt in some of these Trump areas, but they clearly missed the mark,” said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has analyzed the patterns of retaliatory tariffs in red states. “The thought that American voters pick a candidate based on how they position themselves on the issues,” he added. “They didn’t realize that a person’s partisan affiliation determines their positions, even when the policy directly impacts them, not vice versa.” Resistance to Mr. Trump’s trade policies from Republican lawmakers and business leaders is unlikely to abate even if his voters are willing to weather them. Speaking at a forum on Wednesday in Singapore, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, warned about the prospects of an “economic iron curtain” and said that he feared that large parts of the global economy would be closed off to free trade and investment. “Nobody wins a trade war,” said Mr. Paulson, who remains close with Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary. Joshua Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, said on Wednesday that he was still hopeful that Mr. Trump would pursue a more “cooperative” trade agenda in the second half of his term. “What the business community will be looking for over the next two years of the Trump Administration is a lessening of the conflict with our good friends, allies and trading partners,” Mr. Bolten said.",The New York Times
2018,Reformed Gang Leader in Denmark Is Shot Dead Leaving Book Party,"COPENHAGEN — In the eyes of his former associates, Nedim Yasar, once the leader of a notorious Danish gang, did something much worse than just leave the criminal life: He talked about it, becoming a nationally recognized expert on gang violence. Mr. Yasir was fatally shot on Monday night at what should have been a high point in his reformed life — he had just left a party in Copenhagen celebrating the release of a book about him, written with his cooperation. His death was big news in Denmark, lamented on the front pages of many newspapers. “He was killed for what he said, not just because he left a brotherhood,” said Aydin Soei, an author and sociologist who interviews and writes about gang members. “The code is to leave the gang and shut up about it, but he went the other way. He stood up with his story, burning to break the chain feeding the gangs new members and to encourage others by saying there is an alternative to the gangs.” The police in Copenhagen said they did not have any suspects and appealed for witnesses. In a statement, investigators said they were aware of an attempt on Mr. Yasar’s life at his home last year, but they had not been aware of any recent threats. Mr. Yasar had founded a gang, Los Guerreros, that became involved in drug trafficking, and he spent time in jail for violence, robbery, blackmail and unlawful imprisonment. Five years ago, he entered a state-run exit program for gang members, then became a radio host and a respected voice in Denmark’s debate about gang violence. On Tuesday came the release of “Rodder: A Gangster’s Way Out,” written by a journalist, Marie Louise Toksvig. The Danish word “rodder” is used to mean both “roots” and “troublemakers.” In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Yasar, who was born in Turkey and had lived in Denmark since age 4, said his decision to leave the gang took shape when he learned he was having a son. “I was afraid he would look at me like I saw my father, so I had to choose: Do you want a son growing up looking at you thinking you’re cool and then join the gangs and do crime to get your recognition?” he told TV2. “Or do you want to leave the environment so your son can see you in a different way and respect you for the human being you are?” Mr. Yasar was shot while getting into his car after a book reception at the offices of the Danish Red Cross youth branch, where he had been a mentor to troubled youths. “He was inspiring, but never lecturing. It’s a big difference,” said Anders Folmer Buhelt, the organization’s director. “Nedim was very strong on values and very clear on what society he wanted to create. But he was also clear on who he used to be.” Mr. Soei, the sociologist, said he could not think of a more important voice warning young men against entering the dangerous and paranoid lifestyle of a low-level gang member, which is far removed from the tales of fame and wealth told by gang recruiters. Politicians including the prime minister and the minister of justice deplored the killing of Mr. Yasar and celebrated his contributions after he left the gang. “This terrible tragedy raises the question if we as society offer the right protection to those people wishing to step out of the shadows and back in to society,” the justice minister, Soren Pape Poulsen, wrote on Twitter. Jakob Kvist, the publisher of “Rodder,” said: “My concern is that violence works, and this will deter others from coming forward and from seeking an exit from this environment. My concern is that the people he was fighting for who are living outside the state’s protection under alternative regimes in the ghettos will find it harder to get out.” Gang violence in Denmark has never reached the levels seen in some other countries and rarely results in death, but it is one of the hottest topics on the political agenda, linked to arguments over how open the country should be to immigrants. For decades biker and immigrant-heavy gangs have fought on and off over control of illegal markets, internal conflicts and revenge. Attacks usually target members of rival gangs, but shots are sometimes fired in crowded areas, near innocent bystanders — a rare threat and source of concern in a generally peaceful country. The most recent gang war, in 2017, lasted six months, leaving three people dead and 25 wounded. Little gang-related violence has been reported this year.",The New York Times
2018,Reggae Music Is Added to Unesco Cultural Heritage List,"This article was updated on Nov. 29. Wa-ka, wa-ka is the sound of the first riffs that open up Bob Marley’s “Stir It Up.” Sister Nancy’s “Bam Bam” begins with slow-paced horns that give way to her cool cadence. Drums pause with the guitars at the top of Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It.” It’s reggae: smooth, lovely, cool, collected, classic. Jamaica, where the sound first gave a voice to the oppressed and the hopeful, applied to add reggae to Unesco’s list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, and the genre received the honor on Thursday, along with several other new additions. “It will be a major achievement for Jamaica if we are successful in having the designation declared by Unesco,” Olivia Grange, the country’s culture minister, said at a news conference last month. Unlike Unesco’s World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the pyramids of Giza in Egypt or the Taj Mahal in India, the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity documents elements and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition. Another, Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, includes endangered elements of a culture that are at risk of fading away. Reggae, which rose to prominence in the 1960s, often celebrates Jah, or God; ganja, or marijuana; and Ras Tafari, also known as Haile Selassie, the former Ethiopian emperor, whom Rastafarians revere as the messiah. It is also meant to put listeners in a calm groove. As the sound bridged continents and gave the disparaged a way to heal and sing, it inspired many other genres, including dancehall; reggaeton, which is popular in Latin America, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; and reggae fusion, which includes elements of jazz, hip-hop or pop and is popular in the United States and Europe. Reggae has also been a pillar in the foundation of hip-hop. Songs like “Bam Bam” have been sampled countless times by artists including Jay-Z, Kanye West and Lauryn Hill. Jamaica hoped to protect this facet of its rich culture by having radio stations that continuously play reggae and interview people in the world of the genre. It is also mounting public exhibitions and presentations on reggae music in museums and will celebrate Reggae Month in February, the birth month of Bob Marley. Other new additions to Unesco’s list include Ireland’s hurling game, Japan’s Raiho-shin rituals and Kazakhstan’s traditional spring festive rites.",The New York Times
2018,Regular Exercise May Keep Your Body 30 Years ‘Younger’,"Phys Ed The muscles of older men and women who have exercised for decades are indistinguishable in many ways from those of healthy 25-year-olds. The muscles of older men and women who have exercised for decades are indistinguishable in many ways from those of healthy 25-year-olds, according to an uplifting new study of a group of active septuagenarians. These men and women also had much higher aerobic capacities than most people their age, the study showed, making them biologically about 30 years younger than their chronological ages, the study’s authors concluded. All of us are aging every second, of course, which leads many of us also to be deeply interested in what we can expect from our bodies and health as those seconds — and subsequent years and decades — mount. Worryingly, statistics and simple observation suggest that many elderly people experience frailty, illness and dependence. But science has not established whether and to what extent such physical decline is inevitable with age or if it is at least partially a byproduct of our modern lifestyles and perhaps amenable to change. There have been hints, though, that physical activity might alter how we age. Recent studies have found that older athletes have healthier muscles, brains, immune systems and hearts than people of the same age who are sedentary. But many of these studies have concentrated on competitive masters athletes, not people who exercise recreationally, and few have included many women. So for the new study, which was published in August in the Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., decided to look at a distinctive set of older men and women. “We were very interested in people who had started exercising during the running and exercise booms of the 1970s,” says Scott Trappe, the director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State and the new study’s senior author. That era, bookended to some extent by the passage of Title IX in 1972 and the publication of “The Complete Book of Running” in 1977, introduced a generation of young men and women to recreational physical activity, Dr. Trappe says. “They took up exercise as a hobby,” he says. Some of them then maintained that hobby throughout the next 50 or so years, running, cycling, swimming or otherwise working out often, even if they rarely or never competed, he says. Those were the men and women, most now well into their 70s, he and his colleagues sought to study. Using local advertisements and other recruitment methods, they found 28 of them, including seven women, each of whom had been physically active for the past five decades. They also recruited a second group of age-matched older people who had not exercised during adulthood and a third group of active young people in their 20s. They brought everyone into the lab, tested their aerobic capacities and, using tissue samples, measured the number of capillaries and levels of certain enzymes in the muscles. High numbers for each indicate muscular health. The researchers focused on the cardiovascular system and muscles because they are believed inevitably to decline with age and the scientists had expected they would see what Dr. Trappe describes as a “hierarchical pattern” in differences between the groups. The young people, they thought, would possess the most robust muscles and aerobic capacities, with the lifelong exercisers being slightly weaker on both counts and the older non-exercisers punier still. But that outcome is not precisely what they found. Instead, the muscles of the older exercisers resembled those of the young people, with as many capillaries and enzymes as theirs, and far more than in the muscles of the sedentary elderly. The active elderly group did have lower aerobic capacities than the young people, but their capacities were about 40 percent higher than those of their inactive peers. In fact, when the researchers compared the active older people’s aerobic capacities to those of established data about “normal” capacities at different ages, they calculated that the aged, active group had the cardiovascular health of people 30 years younger than themselves. Together, these findings about muscular and cardiovascular health in active older people suggest that what we now consider to be normal physical deterioration with aging “may not be normal or inevitable,” Dr. Trappe says. However, this study was cross-sectional, highlighting a single moment in people’s lives, and cannot tell us whether their exercise habits directly caused differences in health or if and how genes, income, diet and similar lifestyle factors contributed. It also did not look at muscle mass and other important measures of health or whether you can begin exercising late in life and benefit to the same extent. The researchers plan to explore some of these issues in future studies, Dr. Trappe says. But already the findings from this experiment suggest that exercise could help us “to build a reserve” of good health now that might enable us to slow or evade physical frailty later, Dr. Trappe says. “These people were so vigorous,” he says. “I’m in my 50s and they certainly inspire me to stay active.”",The New York Times
2018,Reimagining Norman Rockwell’s America,"In 2012, Hank Willis Thomas saw a poster of Norman Rockwell’s painting of a family seated around a holiday table, the matriarch presenting a turkey to her guests. For Mr. Thomas, a 42-year-old black artist raised in Manhattan, the pale complexions in Mr. Rockwell’s 1943 masterpiece did little to represent his experience of a diverse America. So he decided to create a tableau of his own. Mr. Thomas and the photographer Emily Shur rented a home in Los Angeles for a weekend in May. There, they shot several images that harked back to Mr. Rockwell’s “Freedom From Want,” one in a series of four paintings inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1941 speech to Congress celebrating America’s freedom and democratic values. “The image haunted me because of the world we live in,” the artist said, referring to today’s divisive political climate. “I wanted to imagine what it would look like today.” Mr. Rockwell, who died 40 years ago on Nov. 8, is among America’s most influential illustrators. And he is experiencing a resurgence this year. The “Four Freedoms” series is touring the United States in celebration of its 75th anniversary. And The Saturday Evening Post, the literary magazine that published Mr. Rockwell’s series and many of his other illustrations, recently announced it was putting its archives online. But it is the interpretation of the artist’s classic images, perhaps, that has given Mr. Rockwell’s work renewed life. Mr. Thomas is one of a number of artists who have reimagined “Four Freedoms,” most of them spurred by racial and political tension that has divided the country. Among those is Maurice (Pops) Peterson, an artist from Hillsdale, N.Y., about 20 miles from Stockbridge, where the Norman Rockwell Museum is situated and where Mr. Rockwell had a studio in his later years. Mr. Peterson, 66, was unnerved by the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. “We do not all have freedom from fear,” he said in an interview. Mr. Peterson used his iPhone in 2015 to create “Freedom From What?,” a photographic compilation he made based on Mr. Rockwell’s “Freedom From Fear.” In Mr. Peterson’s interpretation, a black man holds a newspaper with the words “I Can’t Breathe,” a reference to Eric Garner, the unarmed black man from Staten Island who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by the police. “It was then my art became personal,” Mr. Peterson said. Mr. Rockwell’s portraits of Americana in the 1940s and 1950s were quite popular, but largely limited to white, Anglo-Saxon subjects who were friends or acquaintances of the artist. His “Four Freedoms” series helped boost patriotism in a country on the brink of war, a visual reminder of American ideals. During World War II, they were turned into posters to muster sales of war bonds. Laurie Norton Moffatt, director of the Norman Rockwell Museum, said, “Rockwell worked for hire and had to address the norms” of The Saturday Evening Post. Later, in the 1960s, the artist joined Look magazine and depicted civil rights and poverty. “We saw him progressively move toward more representation,” she said. “But it was an evolution.” Ms. Moffatt said the museum embraces the work of Mr. Peterson — he has given lectures there — and others because it wants to connect the ideals in Mr. Rockwell’s paintings to current culture. But it also blunts criticism that Mr. Rockwell’s work is solely for a white audience. “It is a new way of stimulating the public and bringing him to a young audience,” Mr. Peterson said. As part of the “Four Freedoms” tour, the organizers are showing works by contemporary artists inspired by the artist. Mr. Thomas, a founder of For Freedoms, which produces exhibitions, public art and a billboard campaign to spur civic activism, said he first approached Ms. Shur about creating the photographic series in 2017. But even so, finding a cast of diverse subjects was fraught. “What does a Muslim look like?” Mr. Thomas asked. “What does a Jew look like? We were worried about tokenism.” The project came together in early 2018. Well, sort of. Mr. Thomas and Ms. Shur planned to shoot the tableaus at the “Into Action” festival in downtown Los Angeles in January. But the morning of the shoot, they lost their space. “The logistics were crazy,” Ms. Shur said. “He has the ideas and I have to execute.” They were prepared to drop the project altogether, but within hours Mr. Thomas found an empty studio across the street. That weekend a parade of people streamed through the front doors to be photographed for recreations of Mr. Rockwell’s “Freedom of Speech” and “Freedom of Worship.” The actress Rosario Dawson showed up. So, too, did the rapper Chuck D, a founder of Public Enemy. Mr. Thomas said Gina Belafonte, the daughter of the actor and activist Harry Belafonte, came with a group of ecumenical leaders. Even Dolores Huerta, a co-founder of the United Farm Workers with the activist Cesar Chavez, stopped by. By the end of the weekend, more than 150 people had been photographed, Mr. Thomas said. They became the underpinnings for the final photographic compilations. “All of these people have their own communities,” he said of those photographed. “Everyone wants to be a good person. The demonizing of people doesn’t help.” That’s what led Maggie Meiners, an artist from suburban Chicago, to create a series of her own. In 2008, she visited the Norman Rockwell Museum with her husband and was struck by the elderly couple at the head of the table in “Freedom From Want.” That year, Californians had voted to overturn an earlier decision of the California Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage. “Why should the courts get to decide what constitutes a family?” she said. The ban on gay marriage was later deemed unconstitutional. And in 2015, Ms. Meiners, 46, recreated the photograph with two married, gay friends serving their guests. Ms. Meiners, like Mr. Rockwell, photographs people she knows. In 2017, soon after the inauguration of President Trump, she said, an American-born Muslim man came to speak at her Christian church. At the time, Mr. Trump was using anti-Muslim rhetoric to whip up support for his ban on immigration from mostly Muslim countries. Ms. Meiners was moved by the speaker’s story. “I don’t know a lot of Muslims, and that was disconcerting,” she said. So, she asked him out for coffee. “I said, ‘I feel that the group most targeted is Muslims,’” she said. “I said: ‘I don’t know any Muslims. I really want people to know who you are.’ We had a good conversation.” She asked him if he and a group of his friends would be willing to pose for one of her photographs. “He said, ‘Tell me where to meet and I will bring the people,’” she said. One of the women brought a hijab patterned after the American flag.

2018,"Reimposing Iran Sanctions, Trump Places 3 Bets (One a Long Shot)","News Analysis WASHINGTON — As the United States reimposes severe economic sanctions on Iran early Monday, President Trump is placing a series of bets that he can not only change Iran’s behavior, but also use American economic power to bludgeon reluctant allies into joining him. He is gambling that even as the United States seeks to cut off much of Iran’s oil revenue, the country will not dare restart its program to enrich nuclear fuel — the pathway to a bomb. He is also betting that while European nations criticize the White House for abandoning a landmark 2015 nuclear deal that they say was working, European banks, manufacturers and oil companies will not violate the sanctions and risk being cut off from the far larger American market. [Read more: As U.S. sanctions on Iran kick in, Europe is looking for a workaround.] And finally, he is wagering that the Iranian government will crack in some way — that it will renegotiate the nuclear deal more along Mr. Trump’s terms, or that it will collapse under economic pressures that have sent the country’s exports and currency into a tailspin. “We want to restore democracy there,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week, walking just to the edge of declaring that regime change is the goal. “We think the Iranian people want that same thing.” Many outside experts who have dealt with Iran over the decades say they believe that Mr. Trump may succeed at his first two bets, but fail on cracking the government of President Hassan Rouhani. “Iran’s oil production is down, its revenues are down, and the country is more isolated than it was” before Mr. Trump withdrew from the deal, said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department and National Security Council official under several Republican presidents. “But there is nothing about the history of sanctions that suggests they can coerce any country into doing something big and dramatic,” he said. “And this is a government that is unlikely to want to be seen as being coerced. That goes against the DNA of the Iranian revolution.” Coercion, of course, is the core of Mr. Trump’s approach to allies and adversaries alike. In this case, the sanctions are the culmination of a vow Mr. Trump made during the 2016 campaign, when he repeatedly declared that he would scrap a “horrible” agreement with Iran, a line that always drew cheers. Today, Mr. Trump lists the declaration as one of his “promises kept.” The Europeans, Chinese and Russians — the other signatories to the deal — have vowed not to follow the United States in renouncing it, and the Europeans say they are moving toward a barter system that would enable them to buy Iranian oil without doing business in dollars and defying the sanctions. As the Europeans maneuver, Mr. Trump is clearly enjoying causing them pain. He announced in May that he was leaving the accord over the protest of European leaders, including Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The Europeans thought until hours before the announcement that they were moving toward a new approach to keep the accord in place and negotiate additional agreements with Tehran to limit missile tests and support for terrorist groups. While Mr. Trump is expected to issue exemptions to China, India, Japan, South Korea and Iraq, among others, allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil for a limited time, the closest European allies will be given no such leeway. On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted out a takeoff on a poster for “Game of Thrones” picturing him in the lead role and superimposing the words “Sanctions Are Coming” across his chest. It was a play on the “Winter Is Coming” teaser by the popular HBO series. (“We were not aware of this messaging,” HBO said in a statement, “and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.) It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will completely succeed at bringing winter to the Iranian economy, but he is off to a strong start. An economy that was expanding early in the year is now expected to slip into recession. But Iranian officials have insisted that they plan to stick to the deal that they negotiated with former Secretary of State John Kerry in Vienna in the summer of 2015, agreeing to a 15-year hiatus in their ability to produce significant amounts of nuclear fuel. In a meeting with reporters in September in New York, Mr. Rouhani declared that “the United States is not capable of bringing our oil exports to zero,” and suggested that he would brush off the sanctions. Whether that restraint continues, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in New York last month, is “dependent on a series of future judgments.” Another one of Mr. Trump’s bets is also paying off: While governments are declaring that they will stick with Iran while it sticks with the deal, companies are fleeing. Boeing has canceled a $20 billion deal struck after the 2015 nuclear agreement to deliver aircraft to Iran’s decrepit fleet; the French oil giant Total S.A. has said it will not go through with a lucrative contract to develop oil fields; and Maersk, the shipping giant, is stopping its movement of Iranian goods. The contrast with three years ago is stark: Mr. Kerry traveled to Europe after the deal was reached to urge European companies to engage with Iran so that the nation would feel the benefits of giving up 97 percent of its uranium stockpile and dismantling uranium and plutonium production facilities. But even with the sanctions fully in place on Monday, it is far from clear that Iran will move to renegotiate the deal with the United States. Mr. Rouhani insisted during his visit to New York that the United States would first have to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal. For his part, Mr. Trump will have to navigate two other major hurdles. The first is justifying the growing pressure on Iran when the major ally it is depending on to contain that country, Saudi Arabia, is admitting that a 15-member hit squad killed the dissident Jamal Khashoggi and so far refusing to stop its bombing in Yemen. Mr. Pompeo has vowed to follow the Khashoggi investigation wherever it goes, but American diplomats note that he has refused to call the killing an act of terrorism. Iran gets different treatment: On Sunday, Mr. Pompeo accused Iran of plotting assassinations in Europe as part of his claim that the country is the largest exporter of terrorism. Mr. Trump’s biggest long-term challenge may be explaining how he can invoke new sanctions on Iran — which the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared is abiding by its commitments to halt nuclear production — while declaring that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat.” Unlike Iran, the North already has nuclear weapons, and by the account of American intelligence agencies is continuing to produce them.",The New York Times
2018,"Remembering Roy Hargrove, Who Brought Jazz History Into Tomorrow","Hosted by Jon Caramanica; produced by Pedro Rosado. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove died last week at 49. He was a highly regarded performer who managed to be perceived simultaneously as one of the musicians most responsible for keeping jazz history alive and relevant, and also one of the artists most comfortable putting jazz in dialogue with contemporary music. He released moving versions of old standards, composed his own affecting additions to the contemporary-jazz songbook, and led fusion projects with R&B musicians and Afro-Cuban luminaries. Outside of jazz, he was one of the animating forces on a trio of albums released in 2000 — D’Angelo’s “Voodoo,” Erykah Badu’s “Mama’s Gun” and Common’s “Like Water for Chocolate” — that were high water marks for the Soulquarian movement of earthy, historically minded hip-hop and soul. Mentored by Wynton Marsalis when he was still in high school, Mr. Hargrove went on to become a relentless nurturer of young talent, collaborating on recordings and bandstands across the world, and providing space for upstart performers at the Jazz Gallery in New York.

2018,"Remembering World War I, 100 Years Later","AT WAR At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices. Nov. 11 marks 100 years since the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. We asked readers to tell us how their families commemorated the centennial. Here are some of their stories. A United States Army Ceremony in France Last July, I spent a week in France as a historian for an Army commemoration of World War I. In the small French village of Fismette, several dozen American soldiers tramped across the old stone bridge dividing Fismette from Fismes, its neighboring town, gathering at the edge of the lazy-flowing Vesle River. One hundred years prior, this space had been swept by German machine guns and pounded by artillery as American engineers labored to maintain a bridgehead over the swollen river. At the ceremony, historians described the horrors that faced the members of the Pennsylvania National Guard’s 28th U.S. Division in the weeks they were engaged here. Among the group of soldiers in attendance were current members of the division. A French boy, tightly holding a picture of an American soldier from World War I, approached one of the soldiers. The soldier spoke no French, but he pointed to the bridge and then at the keystone patch on his shoulder. Reconstructed after the war, the bridge had been dedicated to the 28th Division and bears a large image of its patch. The boy’s gaze went from the bridge and then back to the tall soldier with the two stars on his chest. The soldier reached into his pocket, drew out a keystone patch and handed it to the boy. “Pour moi?” the boy asked. Holding the symbol of the Army’s intervention in his town, the boy ran back to his friends, tossing back an excited “Merci!” to the soldier. He had picked the right one; that soldier was the commanding general of the 28th Division. — Jonathan Bratten, Portland, Me. The Final Moments of a Soldier’s Life on the Battlefield This summer, my family visited France to commemorate the centennial of the death of First Lt. George Baldwin McCoy, my great-grand-uncle. He was killed on July 20, 1918, leading a charge against German machine guns during the Second Battle of the Marne. He was 25. I stood next to my father in the wheat field before dawn while he peered at a laminated map using a flashlight, on the 100th anniversary of when Lieutenant McCoy’s unit launched their attack, down to the minute. After a long moment of silence and reflection, we loaded back into the car and drove forward a few hundred yards to the farmhouse where Lieutenant McCoy was mortally wounded. We then retraced his steps to the field hospital, and then found the graveyard where my ancestor was temporarily buried. Through my father’s research, we had learned that my great-great-grandfather Judge Walter Irving McCoy campaigned to bring home the bodies of his son and other fallen Americans. When he finally succeeded, the Army accidentally chopped the feet off Lieutenant McCoy’s corpse with a shovel, making the family fear that the corpse was not actually their son. A furious Judge McCoy proceeded to raise hell, prompting congressional hearings and an investigation by the Army. After they determined that they had indeed sent the correct body, my great-grand-uncle was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. — Alexander McCoy, New York, N.Y. Tracking the History of an Ancestor’s Death When I was growing up, my grandfather told me that Pfc. John A. Olien, my great-uncle, was killed by German machine gunners, but the family never learned of the circumstances. In 1918, they celebrated the armistice on Nov. 11 not knowing John had been killed. Notification of his death arrived in early December. I eventually found the history of John’s unit in the University of Michigan library. He charged the German lines with his captain and a handful of other men. They captured three outposts before they realized they were surrounded on three sides. His captain was killed, and John was critically wounded, lying on the battlefield, tended by a fellow soldier until both were captured by the Germans. John died while German medics were taking him to an aid station. In 1921, my family chose to bring John’s remains home to be interred on the highest hill of a rural cemetery near New Richmond, Wis. When I was young, I visited the grave site with my grandfather on Memorial Day, on John’s birthday, on the anniversary of his death and every Nov. 11. In August 2017, a French guide led me to the spot where John was killed during the Meuse-Argonne offensive in 1918. — David Olien, Madison, Wis. [Sign up for a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox.] Returning to Alsace We have a relative killed in a battle near Linthal, Alsace, in 1918 along with 48 other Americans. A historian from the village tracked down the descendants of the Americans killed and invited them to a commemoration ceremony in September.

Putin of Russia were among the dozens of world leaders who gathered to observe the moment when guns fell silent after four years of brutal warfare.

2018,Opinion | Remembering the Forgotten War,"Technically, Korea wasn’t even a war. But that doesn’t mean we can ignore the veterans who fought in it. Mr. Sides is the author, most recently, of “On Desperate Ground: The Marines at the Reservoir, the Korean War’s Greatest Battle.” SANTA FE, N.M. — Although more than 1.8 million Americans served in the Korean War — and more than 33,000 were killed in action — it is still our Forgotten War, a kind of also-ran in our historical consciousness. Perhaps it’s because the war ended in stalemate. The closing battle lines were more or less where they started, along the 38th Parallel. “We died for a tie,” Korean War vets sometimes say, and there’s something deeply unsatisfying about that narrative. We Americans understand military victory, and we’ve come to understand loss, but we can’t quite get our heads around a draw. The men who bled and died in Korea are now taking their bows. They have certainly not forgotten Korea, and they are rightly proud of their accomplishments there. They stopped a naked act of Communist aggression and opposed three malevolent dictators — Stalin, Mao and Kim — while helping South Korea take wing as a democracy. Many Korean War veterans seem mystified that aside from endless reruns of “MASH,” their deeds have been given such short shrift in our national culture. A few months ago, I had the good fortune to visit South Korea with a large group of American veterans. The trip was part of a generous program, led by the South Korean government, to formally thank these now old men who helped save this tiny country from destruction and set it on the road to what it is now — a modern, technologically advanced society and a staunch American ally, with the world’s 11th-largest economy. The South Koreans lavished them with free flights, five-star hotels, air-conditioned coaches, bullet train excursions. At the DMZ, across snarls of concertina wire, we gazed upon the police state that South Korea might have become. We were dazzled by the coruscating metropolis of Seoul, which, the last time these men saw it, lay smoldering in ruins. The veterans seemed tremendously moved to learn firsthand: They aren’t forgotten after all. By and large, though, these stoic, thick-skinned men have come to accept that their achievements will probably always play second fiddle to those of World War II, the marquee event their uncles and older brothers and cousins — the “Greatest Generation” — fought. Recently I’ve gotten to know one of these Korean War veterans. His name is Franklin Chapman, known as Jack; he’s a retired college security chief and part Cherokee Indian who lives here in Santa Fe. In December 1950, on a subzero night in the mountain wilds near North Korea’s Chosin Reservoir, Mr. Chapman’s convoy, part of the Seventh Infantry Division, came under withering attack by the Chinese. Nearby, the American operator of a 75-millimeter recoilless rifle, mounted on the back of a truck, lost his nerve and abandoned his post in a panic. A captain stomped among the men, demanding a volunteer to take over the gun. Private Chapman, a 17-year-old string bean from Oklahoma, raised his hand. To this day, he doesn’t know why. “Maybe I was brave,” he told me. “Maybe I was stupid.” Climbing aboard the truck, Private Chapman could see hundreds of Chinese pressing in, with bugles blaring and bullets sputtering across the snow. He swiveled the big gun and fired. Manning a weapon as lethal as this, Private Chapman knew it was only a matter of time before the Chinese found him. They shot him in the left arm, then the right leg, then the right arm. A medic treated his wounds, and Private Chapman climbed back on the truck. This time he was hit in the hip, then took numerous pieces of shrapnel. He had just finished reloading when a bullet struck his forehead, embedding itself in his skull. It knocked him off the truck, rendering him unconscious. The Chinese overran his unit and cut it to pieces. The engagement, known as the Battle of Hellfire Valley, had ended. Hours later, Private Chapman awoke to find himself with 10 other captives, hunched on the dirt floor of a farmhouse. Chinese guards marched them on mountain trails for 19 days until they reached a place called Kanggye, near the Manchurian border. Private Chapman languished there for nearly three years. When he returned from the war, no parades or celebrations greeted him. His heroics weren’t written up in newspapers or magazines. He quietly went about his life. He joined the Air Force and served for nearly 16 years. When he kept having debilitating headaches, a surgeon removed the bullet lodged in his skull. He keeps it as a relic. Mr. Chapman, who is 85 and mostly homebound, suffers from neuropathy in his feet from frostbite, a common malady among Korean War veterans. His body is a miscellany of aches from his war wounds and his years in the prison camps. He has also experienced PTSD, although through most of his life the condition wasn’t dignified with a name. It seems somehow apt, for a Korean veteran, that he now suffers from severe memory loss. Sometimes he can’t recognize his own daughter. But his recollections of his war experiences are stark and vivid. Men like Jack Chapman are gradually exiting our stage. They’re unassuming, uncomplaining men who answered the call and fought for a principle, long ago and far from home, in a war that was not “officially” a war — a war that curiously became a dormant account in our public memory bank. Stalwart and humble old soldiers like Jack Chapman are the reason, on this Veterans Day, we should make the Korean War the Remembered War.

2018,"Remembering the House F.D.R. Built (Well, His Mother Did)","The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin stood in a place she had described in her most recent book. “This was where he crawled,” she said. “He” was a middle-aged man, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The place was the library in the Manhattan townhouse where he struggled to regain the use of his body — by literally crawling on the floor — after he was all but paralyzed by polio in 1921, when he was nearing 40. Ms. Goodwin was there because of something that happened years later: Roosevelt sold the townhouse to Hunter College for $50,000. On Tuesday, during a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the moment the Roosevelts handed over the keys, Jennifer J. Raab, the president of Hunter, called it “surely the real estate bargain of the 20th century.” (Maybe, maybe not. That amount, in today’s dollars, would be $726,000, far less than a townhouse on the Upper East Side would probably go for now. One in the next block is on the market for $24.5 million, according to the real estate site Trulia.) Then she called Ms. Goodwin to the stage for a conversation with Harold Holzer, the director of Roosevelt House, now the headquarters of Hunter’s public policy institute. They talked about presidential character and how personal setbacks had prepared four presidents to lead the country — Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, his distant relative Theodore Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, the subjects of the book, “Leadership in Turbulent Times.” “My guys,” Ms. Goodwin called them. As she noted, the house made several appearances in “Leadership in Turbulent Times.” In one passage, she wrote that after he was stricken with polio, “he would ask to be lifted from the wheelchair and set down on the library floor so that he could further exercise his back and arms by crawling around the room.” She said she had pictured Roosevelt in the library in the mansion of his family’s estate in Hyde Park, N.Y. But the book described the library in the Manhattan townhouse as the rehearsal room for Roosevelt’s appearance at the Democratic convention at Madison Square Garden in 1924. By then, Roosevelt, a rising star in Democratic circles, had progressed from crawling on the library floor to measuring the distance he would have to cover at the Garden — and trying to walk that far. She wrote that he crossed the library “toward the imaginary podium” while gripping his 16-year-old son James’s arm. Roosevelt’s practice paid off at the convention, where he made it to the lectern, gripping it the way he had gripped his son’s arm and flashing a triumphant smile. “Twelve thousand voices exploded with admiration,” Ms. Goodwin wrote, “even before his speech had begun.” Roosevelt delivered the famous “happy warrior” speech nominating Gov. Al Smith of New York. But after 103 ballots, the nomination went to John W. Davis, who lost the election in a landslide to the Republican candidate, President Calvin Coolidge. The townhouse was commissioned in 1906 as a Christmas present for the future president and his wife from his mother, Sara. She sent them a sketch of a townhouse on note paper, smoke spiraling from a chimney, and wrote, “Number and street to be decided.” Before long, she bought two brownstones on East 65th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, and demolished them. The new townhouse that was completed a couple of years later looked pretty much like the one on the card. There was one doorway. But there were two residences inside. Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt lived in one. His mother — her mother-in-law — lived in the other. “Everyone out there who thought they had mother-in-law problems,” Ms. Raab said in 2012, after Hunter renovated the house, “this probably trumps anyone’s story.” After Sara Roosevelt’s death in 1941, Franklin Roosevelt had wanted $60,000 for the house but reduced the price $10,000, to $50,000, under pressure from Eleanor Roosevelt, who wanted it to go to Hunter and feared that the school could not afford the higher sum. Hunter then made plans for the Roosevelts to attend a ceremony in November 1943 marking the change in ownership. Mr. Holzer said Mrs. Roosevelt went by herself because a wartime strategy conference forced a change in the president’s schedule. “When F.D.R. was supposed to be at Hunter to hand over the keys,” he said, “he was instead on the U.S.S. Iowa, steaming to Tehran, for a conference with Churchill and Stalin.” On the way, there was a close call when an American destroyer accidentally fired a torpedo in the direction of the Iowa. Mr. Holzer said the Iowa managed to maneuver out of the way, and later, when the torpedoman on the destroyer was court-martialed, the president intervened, sparing the sailor a long prison sentence. Ms. Goodwin looked awe-struck as she stood in the room with the fireplace that Roosevelt sat in front of when he gave a radio talk after the 1932 election. Mr. Holzer said that talk was a precursor of the famous fireside chats, the first of which was broadcast soon after his inauguration in March 1933. In the library, Ms. Goodwin looked at a poster of the “Franklin D. Roosevelt for President Club” with the signatures of, among others, the members of Congress who had supported Roosevelt in 1936. Mr. Holzer, the Roosevelt House director, said there was an extra signature on the poster — Lyndon B. Johnson’s. He was not actually a member of Congress in 1936. He was elected to his first term in the House in 1937. That did not stop Johnson from grabbing a pen and signing the poster, apparently on a visit to the White House, Mr. Holzer said. Ms. Goodwin laughed. “That is the best Johnson story,” she said. “He manages to inject himself into the past.” An earlier version of this article misstated the office held by Calvin Coolidge when he defeated John W. Davis. He was president, not vice president.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Remembrance of Recipes Past,"Thanksgiving is the one time of year when family bonds matter more than the food. Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — All fall, in random hours, I’ve been looking for my great-grandmother’s recipe for corn cakes. I have a perfectly serviceable recipe for everyday cornbread, but it’s nothing like those corn cakes I find myself returning to in memory. My cornbread is prepared in the usual way and baked as cornbread should always be baked: in a cast-iron skillet. I’ve made it so many times I don’t need to consult the recipe anymore, and maybe that’s the reason I’ve never found the recipe for my great-grandmother’s corn cakes, too. It’s likely there never was a recipe. I keep searching anyway because winter makes me long for those glistening golden discs that Mother Ollie made right on the stovetop, dropping a dollop of thin batter, pancake style, into a shallow pool of heated oil in her own cast-iron skillet. The circles would spread out in the oil, thinner and thinner, until they formed a kind of lace around the edges. A properly formed corn cake is golden in the center, soft and puffy, with lacy edges that are crisp and almost brown. When they look like that, it’s time to flip them over and cook the other side. Mother Ollie’s cooking technique I remember well enough; it’s her recipe for the batter that’s lost to me now. I found her recipe for gruel (“good for ailing folks,” the card notes) and a recipe in my grandmother’s hand for buttermilk rolls, as well as two different copies of the cream-cheese poundcake invented by Miss Tommie, my grandmother’s best friend. But in the recipe box I inherited from my mother there is no card for corn cakes. Yes, yes, I know the internet is full of recipes for every possible kind of cornbread. Google “lacy corn cakes,” and half a dozen recipes will pop up, though none of them look just right in the pictures. Some call for a mixture of plain cornmeal and flour; some call for self-rising cornmeal; some require buttermilk, and some make do with water. It’s a surprising variety of options for a food made from no more than four ingredients, and I tell myself I don’t have time to test them all. The truth is that I don’t want to cook from a stranger’s recipe. I want to cook from a family recipe. It’s Thanksgiving, when I am always most homesick for beloved elders no longer here. I am searching for a very particular taste, for a mixture of corn and salt and butter that will take me instantly back to a farmhouse in Lower Alabama, the house where my people lived for generations. I want my kitchen to be filled with the same scents that came from that old kitchen when the house was full of family. The recipe I’m looking for might still turn up. In her life, my mother created inscrutable taxonomies of every kind, and the cards in her recipe box were no exception. Just because a cornbread recipe isn’t in the bread section does not mean it isn’t in the box somewhere else. And there are hundreds of recipe cards that aren’t in the box at all anymore because Mom pulled them out and never put them back. During the last years of her life, she ate supper at my house every night. Her own stove was unplugged for safety’s sake, and there was no reason for her to spend hours poring over recipes for dishes she was never going to cook. She left the cards in little piles all over her house anyway — on bookcase shelves, on the floor beside her bed, on every side table in every room. I gathered them up in the days after her sudden death and dumped them into various baskets and boxes. Six years later, I still can’t bring myself to sort through them. When I was growing up, my mother put a hot meal on the table every night, but she was never an enthusiastic cook — no one greeted the invention of Hamburger Helper with more gratitude. I don’t know why, decades later, she kept pulling out the recipe cards. Maybe she was looking for a particular recipe, too, hoping I might be persuaded to cook a dish she remembered and suddenly missed. Or maybe she wanted only to remember her own beloved dead. For me it is always both heartbreaking and comforting to open my mother’s recipe box on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The family Thanksgiving recipes are there, of course — the squash dressing, creamed spinach and pecan pie that my children regard as holiday nonnegotiables in the same way I did when I was in my 20s and feeling both the intoxication and anxiety of independence. Thanksgiving is not a time for culinary experimentation, at least not in our family. There’s comfort in a traditional holiday meal that goes far beyond the notion of comfort food. But my mother’s recipe box is also a kind of living document, an annotated interplay of generations. Recipes in my great-grandmother’s hand are adjusted in my grandmother’s, and then again in my mother’s. Tucked behind Mom’s recipe for a ground-beef-and-sour-cream casserole is my recipe for spinach lasagna — I don’t remember copying it out for Mom, but I recognize the notebook paper I habitually used in graduate school. There’s a recipe for pork tenderloin in my mother-in-law’s handwriting, too, and countless recipes from friends and relations whose handwriting I can still identify even decades after their deaths. I could create a timeline of my own life from those recipe cards. My children have grown up eating Sister Shubert’s rolls on Thanksgiving Day, and they will not be brokenhearted if I never find Mother Ollie’s recipe for corn cakes, though I am not giving up the search. Even if I don’t find it in time, I hope my grandmother’s recipe for yeast rolls, newly recovered from the unfathomable mysteries of my mother’s recipe box, will fill my kitchen with the scent of home.

The ejection came days after the lecturer stopped class to demand that the student remove her feet from the back of a seat, a pet peeve of the instructor. A video of the student’s removal from class was shared on Twitter on Monday and has been viewed more than four million times. In announcing the conclusion of the investigations, the university’s president, Taylor Eighmy, said that the results “in no way diminish” the school’s commitment to inclusivity. “After hearing from so many students, faculty and staff regarding their feelings of marginalization, disrespect and fear, I am more convinced than ever that this is a top priority,” he wrote in a Wednesday email to faculty members, staff members and students. The conclusion that racial bias did not play a role in the instructor’s actions was “based primarily on the opinion of the student,” Dr. Eighmy wrote. The lecturer, who had already been relieved of her duties for the semester, will be required to undergo classroom management training before returning for the 2019 spring semester, he added. The episode follows numerous recent instances in which videos have captured white people needlessly involving the police in encounters with people of color. In October, a white woman called the police on a black man in Georgia who was babysitting for two white children. In April, a white woman called the police on two black men grilling at a lake in Oakland, Calif. In the reports, the University of Texas at San Antonio identified the lecturer as Dr. Moss. Jasmine Lane, a junior in the class, said that the instructor was Anita Moss and added that the class was human anatomy and physiology. In the video, Dr. Moss, who appears to be white, is seen speaking to uniformed officers at the side of the classroom. She leads them to the student, who stands up after one of the officers approaches. The student then follows all three out without incident. The video was shared on Twitter by a user named Apurva Rawal, who identified himself as a student in the class. Another user, with the handle “FavoritePaigeee,” said she was the one escorted from the room. Neither responded to requests for comment, but Ms. Lane confirmed that Mr. Rawal was in the class and that the student who was removed is named Paige. According to the findings of one of the investigations, based on interviews with the student, the instructor and others in the class, Dr. Moss had a “preoccupation” with students placing their feet on seats. “Because of her preoccupation, Dr. Moss perceives this behavior to be uncivil, while disciplinary colleagues and other faculty would likely disagree,” Howard Grimes, an interim dean of the College of Sciences, wrote in the report. The removal of the student from class on Monday followed an exchange in Friday’s class in which Dr. Moss interrupted her lecture to ask the student to remove her feet from a chair, according to the report. The student complied and Dr. Moss then confronted the class over what she described as its general lack of civility, Ms. Lane said. On Sunday, Dr. Moss emailed the student to tell her that she would not be allowed in class until the two met privately to discuss her behavior. But, according to the report, Dr. Moss had emailed the wrong student. So, when the student whom Dr. Moss had chastised on Friday showed up to class again on Monday, Dr. Moss approached her and asked her to leave immediately or she would call campus police, according to the report. The student insisted on staying, telling Dr. Moss that the class was “very important” to her. So Dr. Moss left the room and called the police. After the student was escorted out, some of her classmates confronted Dr. Moss, arguing that involving the campus police was uncivil itself and took time away from the lecture, according to Ms. Lane and Mr. Rawal. Eventually, Dr. Moss ended the lecture early and left the room. On Twitter, the user who identified herself as the student removed from the classroom said she was “completely overwhelmed and thankful” for the support. Speaking before the report was issued, Ms. Lane, who is black, said she did not believe the instructor’s actions were based on racial bias. “She’s been fair to me and a bunch of my other peers of color and our class is very diverse, so to say that was racially motivated would kind of take away from how she treated all of us,” Ms. Lane said. Still, Ms. Lane said she was disappointed with Dr. Moss’s decision to involve the police, noting the many instances in which people of color have been killed or harmed in interactions with the authorities despite doing little or nothing to provoke them. Dr. Moss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",The New York Times
2018,Renewing ‘Vows’: How the Times Wedding Section Is Changing ,"gender letter A peek inside one of the most loved (and reviled) sections of the paper. Gender Letter helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it. Tell me what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. This year is winding down, readers, and I hope that for you all, Thanksgiving has been a lovefest (or more realistically, low on family drama). In that spirit, I wanted to take a moment to talk about one of my favorite long-weekend guilty pleasures: reading about other peoples’ weddings. For many of us, The Times’s Wedding section conjures scenes from “Sex and the City,” when Carrie and the gang gather to hate-read tales of Manhattan upper-crusters in love over Sunday brunch. It has prompted fake Twitter accounts; inspired comic parodies (here’s a particularly funny one about a serial killer couple, from the comedian Jena Friedman); books and endless fodder for blog snark (R.I.P., Gawker). One announcement I love to side-eye is this story about two Princeton grads with posh pedigrees who met while piloting their respective seafaring vessels in North Haven, Me. [Sign up here to get future installments of the Gender Letter delivered to your inbox!] But if you’ve been reading lately, you may have noticed a marked shift. In the last few months, the Vows column — those longer, more reported features in the Wedding section that run alongside the shorter, classic wedding announcements — has published stories of a quadruple amputee determined to walk down the aisle, below; a same-sex couple who met in the emergency room (one was the doctor); and a love connection that flourished despite cultural and physical disparities. I asked LeAnn Wilcox, the Times weddings editor — and a former a copy editor on the sports desk, among others — how Weddings has changed since she took over as editor two years ago... and to debunk some of the persistent myths about her job. Tell us about some of your favorite Vows. A recent one was this Wisconsin couple. As high schoolers, she learned she was pregnant after they broke up. The baby was placed for adoption. She moved away. Both married more than once. They hadn’t talked in decades. They were reconnected when their son began searching for his biological parents. They were suddenly thrown back into their past and fell in love back in that small Wisconsin town. And their son was the officiant at their wedding. But I have a new favorite Vows all the time: whether poignant (Sam Siatta and Ashley Volk); incredibly hopeful (a Seattle homeless couple); unexpected (a 98- and a 94-year-old who met at the gym); or a fairy tale (a woman meets an Ethiopian prince in a nightclub). What misconceptions do people have about the Times wedding section that you’d like to dispel for good? Often people believe that our wedding announcements are paid. They are not. They’re free, and anyone may submit. [Want to submit? You can do so here. No Ivy-league degree necessary.] But just because you submit, doesn’t mean you are in. And just because you are chosen doesn’t mean we take your word for everything. These announcements are reported and fact-checked. How do you decide whom to choose? I don’t choose couples because they are old-school money, are Harvard and Yale elites, have Mayflower ancestors — though I might choose them. I try my best to have a selection of interesting and diverse people every week in our pages. Some would argue that having a wedding section at all is pretty retro. Aren't there more substantive stories we could be telling? People are interested in other people and their love stories. What’s not to like about love? Weddings, I think, are a guilty pleasure. I’ll admit, it’s hard to shake the patrician image some people have of our pages, but if they actually read the pages, they might be surprised. ______ Tis the season — to say no.

[The New York Times] ______ In 2002, Daniel Andrew Gross and Steven Goldstein made history as the first same-sex couple to (finally) get an announcement in the The New York Times wedding pages. When Mr. Goldstein got the good news in his email, he “started screaming, ‘Daniel! Daniel! The New York Times has changed its policy!’” he told The Times last year. “‘And we’re going to be the first couple!’” At that time, only a couple of states allowed for domestic partnership or civil union status. Same-sex marriage was not legal in any state until 2004, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized it. “Nothing helped the cause of marriage equality more than the stories of same-sex couples falling in love, and having the same joys and challenges as any other couple,” Mr. Goldstein said.

2018,"Renoir Estimated at $180,000 Is Stolen From Austrian Auction House","At 5:15 p.m. on Monday, three apparently middle-aged men — one carrying a bag from a shoe shop — walked into the Dorotheum auction house in Vienna and went to the second floor. There, they walked up to “Golfe, mer, falaises vertes” — an 1895 painting of some green cliffs and the sea by Pierre-Auguste Renoir that was to be auctioned Wednesday for an estimated $131,000 to $181,000. Then they took it out of its frame and walked out. The robbery lasted just minutes. The men made next to no effort to hide their appearance. The Vienna police were investigating, said Inspector Patrick Maierhofer, one of the force’s spokesmen, who provided the above account of the suspects’ actions, which were played out on closed-circuit TV footage. “It was very quick,” he said. “Nobody noticed.” The suspects did not cut the work out of its frame, he added, but he would not say how it was removed. “We don’t want to give advice to other people,” Inspector Maierhofer said. Such blatant robberies from auction houses are rare, said James Roundell, director of Impressionist and Modern art at Dickinson, a London art dealer, who previously worked for 22 years at Christie’s in London. In 1984, robbers armed with sawed-off shotguns stole jewelry worth over $1 million from Christie’s, but that was the only similar event that came to mind, Mr. Roundell said. “People pocket things from auction houses,” he said. “With a print sale, someone can slip one into their catalog. But paintings, I haven’t really come across it. I can’t imagine auction houses would be too keen to publicize it.” The Dorotheum — Vienna’s most renowned auction house, which was formed in 1707 by Emperor Joseph I — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “This is a brazen crime that sends a shiver down any curator’s spine,” said Esther Bell, chief curator at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., which is holding a major Renoir exhibition next year. “Paintings are delicate and easily prone to damage,” she added in an email. “Beyond the outrage of the theft, for museum professionals, there’s the worry about the safety of the object. “We spend our careers trying to protect and preserve these paintings, and it is truly stomach-churning to think of this Renoir in the hands of criminals who clearly have no interest in the protection of cultural assets.”",The New York Times
2018,"Representative Mia Love, Once a Republican Star, Loses Re-election in Utah","Ben McAdams, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake County, unseated Representative Mia Love, the first and only black Republican woman in Congress, whose bid for re-election in deep red Utah failed by a narrow margin on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press. After two drawn-out weeks of vote counting, Mr. McAdams, 43, won with 50.1 percent, or about 700 votes, in the Fourth District, a feat that many viewed as unlikely in a district where fewer than 15 percent of voters are registered Democrats. With this victory, the Democrats have now picked up 38 House seats in the midterm elections. Three House races have yet to be called — two in New York and one in Georgia. Ms. Love, 42, had been seen as a rising star in her party even before she was elected to Congress in 2014. She was given a prime speaking spot at the Republican National Convention in 2012, when she had mounted an unsuccessful congressional bid while serving as the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah. Her family’s immigration from Haiti was a central theme of her speech. The election results were a distinct departure from Ms. Love’s re-election in 2016, when she sailed to victory by 13 points. It also underscored the degree to which unease with President Trump is a bipartisan issue in Utah, where his hard-line policies and disdain for decorum has upset liberals and many conservatives whose political attitudes are shaped by the Mormon Church. Mr. Trump won just 45 percent of the vote in Utah in 2016. Mr. McAdams, who has served two terms as the mayor of Salt Lake County, capitalized on that discontent and on what he portrayed as Ms. Love’s closeness to Mr. Trump and his agenda. Although she has criticized the president’s attitude toward immigrants and refugees, Ms. Love voted for policies favored by Mr. Trump almost 96 percent of the time, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight. A lawyer and a seventh-generation Utahn, Mr. McAdams took a page from the Democrats’ national playbook and focused his campaign on kitchen-table issues, like passing an infrastructure bill, improving health care and cleaning up corruption in Washington. He portrayed Ms. Love as an out-of-touch creature of Washington, a line of attack strengthened by a campaign finance complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by a progressive group, Alliance for a Better Utah, that forced Ms. Love to admit she had improperly raised more than $1 million in campaign funds. Ms. Love raised the money during the primary period, even though she knew she would have no primary challenger after she won the nomination at the party convention in April. Her campaign called the complaint “completely false and desperate” but agreed to redesignate $372,000 for her general election campaign and pay back up to $10,000. Ms. Love’s unique profile — daughter of Haitian immigrants, a convert to the Mormon Church and the only Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus — presented a challenge to Democrats who sought to depict her as a Trump loyalist. She did not enlist the president’s help in her campaign, which he seemed to interpret as a snub. At a televised news conference the day after votes were cast, Mr. Trump attacked Republicans who lost their seats for what he saw as their insufficient support of him and his agenda. The result of Ms. Love’s race was still days from being called, but Mr. Trump scornfully lumped her in with the losers anyway. “Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.” Mr. McAdams rode to victory in the Fourth District — which includes a slice of progressive Salt Lake City but extends south to incorporate a string of more conservative cities and towns in Juab, Sanpete and Utah Counties — in part thanks to his record as mayor of Salt Lake County, which covers 85 percent of the district. The city has emerged as a progressive oasis in recent years, and Mr. McAdams has positioned himself as a centrist able to meet the needs of its disparate constituencies. They include immigrants, gay people, religious conservatives, tech employees and investors arriving from out of state. Mr. McAdams became well known for negotiating a deal among Republicans, religious leaders and the gay community on a nondiscrimination ordinance, and worked with Republicans in the State Legislature to alleviate homelessness in the region. As part of that effort, Mr. McAdams secretly posed as a homeless man for three days. For her part, Ms. Love portrayed Mr. McAdams as the politician who was out of touch with the district, casting him as a liberal supporter of Hillary Clinton and abortion rights who would not represent the wishes of Utahns in Congress. In the end, it was not enough.",The New York Times
2018,Republican Purges and Feuds in Oklahoma Show the Pitfalls of One-Party Rule,"MUSKOGEE, Okla. — The mailers arrived in people’s homes mysteriously, hitting some of the most conservative lawmakers in Oklahoma. George Faught, a hard-line Republican running for his sixth term in the Oklahoma House, was attacked for not being a true conservative. Another Republican incumbent had a flier accusing him of “working to expand Obamacare.” The men called each other, sharing notes: Who was doing this? By the time they found out, nearly all of them had lost in primary runoffs in August. The campaign against the hard-liners, they discovered, was coming from inside the caucus. “Once you cut out the cancer that was attacking us, we’re now in a position to heal and move forward,” said State Representative Chris Kannady, a moderate Republican who has gone public as the ringleader of the internal purge, which he called the Project. “We are now,” he said, “unified as one.” Oklahoma in 2018 is as close as you get to a one-party state. President Trump won by 36 points two years ago, taking every county. Republicans have supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature. They hold every statewide office and all the congressional seats. But “one-party” is not always as convivial as it sounds. As parties grow, they change; old priorities jostle with new ones, factions form and constituencies move around, even in an era of hyperpolarization and even in a state as deep crimson as Oklahoma — perhaps especially in a state as deep crimson as Oklahoma. At risk is not just the party’s cohesiveness on policy, but also, on a larger scale, its top-to-bottom control of the state. A blue wave is not expected here, but there are signs of an awakened Democratic Party. In a congressional district that includes most of booming Oklahoma City, a Democratic challenger has substantially outraised the Republican incumbent. Even tighter is the governor’s race, which is close enough that the Democratic Governors Association has jumped in. The Democrat, Drew Edmondson, has a last name that goes back decades in state politics but is in a party completely out of power; he is narrowly trailing the Republican, Kevin Stitt, a Tulsa businessman with no political experience. It is essentially a contest over who has the least to do with the current state government, which drew national attention last spring when teachers protested statewide over severely underfunded schools. When two parties are in charge, a run of bad news like this would set off a round of partisan blame-throwing. With one party, it can bring what one Republican lawmaker openly called civil war. “Republicans thought they couldn’t lose and Democrats thought they couldn’t win,” John Feary, a moderate Republican, said of the last decade of Oklahoma politics. Mr. Feary ran in 2016 for a reliably Republican State Senate seat in the Tulsa suburbs; in a hint of things to come, he lost in the primary this year to a hard-liner — who went on to lose, in a shocker, to a Democrat. “Sometimes,” Mr. Feary said, “something just has to fall apart before you can build it up again the right way.” It is fair to say that things in Oklahoma had been falling apart. A plunge in oil prices caught up with years of tax-slashing and the results were ugly: cash-strapped school districts going to four-day weeks, prisons dangerously overcrowding and rural hospitals shutting down. The two-term Republican governor, Mary Fallin, shows up in poll after poll with approval numbers well below freezing, reliably among the least-popular governors in the country. As in Louisiana and Kansas, the fallout of fiscal austerity had spread quickly to politics. Anti-incumbent anger swelled statewide but particularly in the cities, once the homeland of the Oklahoma Republicans. Democrats have won several statehouse special elections in Republican-held districts mostly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Similarly situated Republican seats are in danger in November, eyed by energized Democrats and disaffected moderate Republicans. Some school districts are scheduling a holiday on Tuesday for teachers and staff to vote, and women in ruby-red suburbs are working the phone banks for Democrats. Meanwhile, the fail-safe switch near at hand for Republicans for eight years is no longer there to pull. “You got elected because you weren’t Obama,” said Anthony Sykes, a conservative state senator, speaking of some of his hard-line colleagues. “But the Obama well went dry. And you’ve got to produce some results now.” That a purge of hard-right lawmakers had even been considered is a function of the scale of Republican domination in Oklahoma. Long a minority party operating chiefly out of the Chambers of Commerce and Rotary Clubs of Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Republicans went on a partisan land rush over the past couple of decades, winning rural and small town seats that had been in Democratic hands since statehood. “When I got elected it was kind of a fluke,” said Mr. Faught, who in 2006 won a seat in Muskogee that had never been held by a Republican. With ever-expanding majorities, longtime Republicans saw a chance to pass long-delayed priorities like tort reform, but the arrivals from the party’s new frontiers came with their own ideas. Lawmakers barely known by the party leaders were now in the headlines for forming a legislative caucus to stamp out the Muslim Brotherhood in Oklahoma or proposing to screen thousands of students for possible deportation. This was messy but manageable in the good times. Then the fiscal emergency hit. Party leaders knew they had to come up with a plan, but a vote to raise taxes, already extremely difficult in Oklahoma, was proving next to impossible, even with a supermajority. In March, the House finally, and barely, managed to pass a tax package to pay for teacher raises. Nineteen Republicans voted against it. “You had the governing Republicans versus what I call the ‘Let’s barely keep the doors open’ Republicans,” said Chad Alexander, a former chairman of the state Republican Party. “And the Democrats.” Of those 19 ‘no’ votes on the tax package, only four are left running in the general election. The rest either ran into term limits, chose not to run or lost in primaries, defeated by fired-up teachers and the dark-money-fueled housecleaning of the Project. Mr. Kannady insists that he was only acting in self-defense against primary challenges and that, with an array of business interests helping fund the operation, he was the only lawmaker involved. Both of the claims are hotly disputed by his Republican adversaries. Mr. Kannady did acknowledge, however, that the lawmakers who were targeted had long been considered trouble within the caucus. “This group, all they really knew was the red button,” Mr. Kannady said. “They voted against everybody’s issues.” For all the ugliness of the primaries, Mr. Kannady concluded, the caucus is “stronger and more unified than it’s been since the Republicans have taken over.” They are not so sure about that in Muskogee. “War is made up of battles,” said Tom Montgomery, a Republican state committeeman in Muskogee and a strong supporter of Mr. Faught. “My boys lost some battles, there’s no other way of saying it. But I think the war is not won yet.” The Democrat in the race, Jack Reavis, a soft-spoken high school civics teacher, has a decent chance now. Some of his votes will come from Republicans fed up with the ideological rigidity of legislators like Mr. Faught. Some votes will come from Mr. Faught’s biggest fans. “I could have probably voted a straight ticket if it wasn’t for that one race,” said Lisa McManus, a beekeeper in Muskogee who answers the door with a gun in her hand. Disgusted by the campaign against Mr. Faught, she has already voted in the general election, by absentee ballot, for Mr. Reavis. A likely short-lived Democratic win would be a small cost to bear in the larger custody battle over the Republican Party. This is, after all, a one-party state.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Republicans Had One Black Woman in Congress. Now They Have None. ,"Mia Love was supposed to be the future. She was really an anomaly. Opinion Columnist From proud Republican harbinger to sad Republican castaway — that’s the story of Representative Mia Love, who finally conceded her extraordinarily close House race on Monday. It’s the story of her party, really. Of what it once realized about the future and how it slouched backward into the past. Of trading the elixir of hope for the toxin of fear. It charts Republicans’ ugly drift under Donald Trump, who rooted for her defeat not only as the votes in Utah’s Fourth Congressional District were still being counted (“Mia Love gave me no love,” the president pouted) but with all that he said on the campaign trail and has done in the White House. Tacitly and explicitly, he has sown disdain for the likes of Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who, in 2014, became the first black Republican woman ever elected to either chamber of Congress. She remains the only one. When she leaves at the end of this congressional session, there will be just two black Republican men — one in the House and one in the Senate. Everything you heard about the exciting diversification of midterm races? About the significantly increased numbers of women running for office, of people of color, of L.G.B.T. candidates? That was on the Democratic side. The Republicans either couldn’t be bothered, couldn’t find any takers or — my guess — both. Love called that out in a remarkable concession speech on Monday. To the victor go the spoils, but from the vanquished comes the candor. “Because Republicans never take minority communities into their home and citizens into their homes and into their hearts, they stay with Democrats,” Love said. Democrats “do take them home — or at least make them feel like they have a home.” In defeat, she added, “I am unleashed, I am untethered and I am unshackled, and I can say exactly what’s on my mind.” That language was a measure of her anger, an admission of how much she had concealed and an example of why she’s a flawed messenger, her righteousness in full flower only now that there’s no immediate price to pay for it. She should be listened to nonetheless. Go back to 2012. She was the 36-year-old mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and Republican leaders couldn’t embrace her tightly enough. They loved her profile, her arc: parents who had fled poverty and chaos (and who didn’t become American citizens until after her birth); the family’s new beginning in Brooklyn; her college education; her interracial marriage; her three children. By promoting her, those leaders advertised openness to young people, to minorities, to immigrants. They steered her candidacy for the House that year, sending Washington political reporters her way and giving her a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. She alluded glowingly to Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks even as she urged that President Barack Obama not be re-elected. She became a national story. That may be why she lost that race: She seemed too far ahead of herself, too far afield of local concerns. But two years later, she won, becoming not just the first black Republican woman in Congress but also the first Haitian-American. These were the first sentences of a Washington Post article about her victory: “For at least half a century, the party of Lincoln has battled charges that it is racist, sexist and anti-immigrant. Today, voters from a conservative state made those arguments a little bit harder to make.” “This was huge,” the article went on to say. “A party threatened with electoral extinction among African-Americans and immigrants now has someone to brag about in Washington.” This was when Republicans were still seriously mulling the famous “autopsy” after Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat, a document that cautioned them against harsh rhetoric and resistance to the country’s demographic changes. This was about six months before Trump came down that escalator in Trump Tower and ranted about rapists from Mexico. Then came the Muslim ban, the singling-out of black athletes, the equivocation over white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., and the reported use of a vulgar adjective to denigrate countries, including Haiti, from which immigrants of color came to the United States. Love issued a public statement about that last indignity, denouncing the president’s remarks and imploring him to apologize. Of course he never did. And during her 2018 re-election bid, she kept him at arm’s length, as did many other Republicans campaigning in areas, like hers, where support for him wasn’t strong. Asked by a reporter whether she’d back the president in 2020, she said, “I don’t know.” Did he cost her the election anyway? Impossible to say. She had her own shortcomings. But this much is certain: Once heralded as a Republican ambassador, she has been established as a Republican anomaly. The House is about to welcome nine new black lawmakers. None are Republicans. It’s about to welcome at least 36 new female lawmakers. Only one is Republican. Among a total count of at least 102 women in the new House, there are nearly seven times as many Democrats as Republicans. For now, maybe, these numbers don’t spell the Republican Party’s death. But they’re no way to live. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni).",The New York Times
2018,"Republicans Have a Humming Economy to Tout, but Trump Rhetoric Muddies the Message","In normal political times, a glowing report on the nation’s economy just before Election Day would be a gift to the party in power and a uniform talking point for its candidates. But entering the final weekend before Tuesday’s midterm vote, President Trump’s blistering message of nativist fear has become the dominant theme of the campaign’s last days, threatening to overshadow the good economic news. This is a political bind Republicans did not envision. They spent the final months of 2017 working on a package of sweeping tax cuts they hoped could be the centerpiece of their 2018 campaign message, buttressed by a soaring stock market and a low unemployment rate. And they got what they wanted, passing a $1.5 trillion tax bill last December. A new jobs report released Friday highlighted the continued strength of the economy, as employers added about 250,000 jobs in October while the unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent, a nearly 50-year low. But Mr. Trump, again, has upended the traditional political playbook. Candidates are frequently forced to answer for his inflammatory and baseless tweets. And at the political rallies that are becoming a daily event as the election draws closer, the president has waded into racially fraught waters, using a broad brush to paint immigrants as villainous and dangerous. “They all say, ‘Speak about the economy, speak about the economy,” Mr. Trump said Friday, during a rally in West Virginia. “Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it’s not as exciting to talk about the economy.” On the campaign trail, Republican candidates have taken a split-screen approach to Mr. Trump’s nationalist message; many, recognizing its political potency with the conservative base, are continuing to embrace it. Democrats have “open borders psychosis,” Kris Kobach, the hard-right Republican candidate for governor in Kansas, told a crowd in Kansas City, Mo., during a rally on Friday with Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier in the day, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas began a stump speech by boasting about the economy, but quickly shifted to a more foreboding theme closely aligned to Mr. Trump’s warnings about a migrant “invasion.” “You mean the people of Texas want to stop the caravan?” bellowed Mr. Cruz, who is in a competitive, closely watched race against Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic challenger. The crowd responded with chants of “build the wall.” Other Republicans, however, are straining to avoid the president’s strident language and focusing instead on an economy-first message. In Winterset, Iowa, Representative David Young, a Republican in a very close race, spent the bulk of an address to voters talking about the strong economy and Republican job creation. “Right now we’re seeing a real economy renaissance going on in the country,” he said. “Here in rural Iowa, the incredible things going on with our economy are quite spectacular. I just want to keep the federal government out of your way so people can work, small businesses can grow, larger businesses can hire more people, we can keep the economy growing like today.” In campaign appearances this week, two Illinois Republicans locked in tough races in Chicago’s suburbs, downplayed the immigration issue. Randy Hultgren, the incumbent in the 14th Congressional District, appeared at a metal forging plant Friday and did not mention Mr. Trump’s immigration speech at the White House the day before. Peter Roskam, a Republican who is facing his own tough challenge, told McClatchy the immigration rhetoric was not important to his constituency. That message “skips right past this district,” Mr. Roskam said. “This district hears that and kind of shrugs.” A top aide to Paul D. Ryan, the retiring House Speaker, also pleaded with Republicans to tout the jobs report. “Were going to spend all day and weekend talking about the strong economy, right?” the aide, Brendan Buck, tweeted. One problem for Republicans trying to extol the economy is that the tax cuts did not turn out to be the political windfall they envisioned. Polls showed the tax breaks enjoyed only middling popularity as many Americans came to see them as a gift to the richest Americans that did little to address the problem of wage stagnation. Some Democrats have actually weaponized the tax package against their opponents, including Danny O’Connor, a Democrat running in a tight race against a Republican incumbent, Troy Balderson, in Ohio. In the run-up to a special election in August — they are squaring off again in Tuesday’s general election — Mr. O’Connor and his backers spent more money attacking the tax cuts than Mr. Balderson and his allies spent defending it. Traditional Republican pollsters and strategists said hewing too closely to Mr. Trump’s incendiary strategy could contain more risk than reward for candidates in the campaign’s final days. They warn of possible backlash among minority voters and college-educated whites, two groups that could be especially crucial in deciding congressional control. Polling suggests that the same suburban independents who broke for Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election could shift back to Democrats this time around. And Republican campaign veterans said that while Mr. Trump’s fear-mongering is firing up his base, it could energize other voters who were previously apathetic to vote for a Democrat next Tuesday. “The problem is Republicans have a good story to tell in the economy,” said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Jeb Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney. “But the Republican with the largest microphone only wants to go on these rants about immigration.” Mr. Trump, he said, is “managing to offend every swing voter in the country.” That could prove particularly risky in competitive races for the House of Representatives. Republicans are defending many seats in diverse metropolitan regions where the president’s heated language could prove a hindrance. Mr. Trump even acknowledged at his rally Friday that Republicans could lose the House, saying, “it could happen, could happen.” In the Senate, both parties have clung to nervous optimism about the half-dozen most competitive races. But in Missouri, which has one of the most closely watched Senate races, officials in both parties said internal polling indicated Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, had gained ground in her race against her Republican challenger, Josh Hawley, the state’s attorney general. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said he did not think Mr. Trump’s closing message was harmful, even if it was not aligned with the economic arguments the state’s Republican candidates were offering. “As long as the noneconomic issues that he is talking about do not run counter to the core of what defines us as a state, I don’t think he is a distraction,” Mr. Kaufmann said. “I almost think his presence and his energy at this point in our midterms is more important than specifically what he is saying.” Still, some Republicans have expressed dismay that their party is offering an inflammatory closing argument. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is retiring at the end of his term, called the party’s tone “unseemly.” Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, who is also retiring, said Mr. Trump’s immigration stances have distracted from the party’s best midterm message. “We all know challenges of suburban” Republicans,” he tweeted. “So now POTUS, out of nowhere, brings birthright citizenship up. Besides being basic tenet of America, it’s political malpractice.” But some Republicans — and the voters who support them — have said Mr. Trump’s explicit language mirrors their own beliefs. “The radical left is on the move,” said Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican facing a tough re-election campaign in a suburban swing district, who also appeared at the rally with Mr. Pence. “They’re on the march. And this radical left is based on socialism.” At Mr. Cruz’s rally in Fort Worth, Bill Ranelle, 75, said that on a scale of one to 10, he rated his concerns about immigration an eight, and gave voice to some unfounded characterizations of migrants. “My grandparents came through Ellis Island and their purpose was to live the American dream and become part of the American culture,” he said. “I don’t see the illegals wishing to do that.”",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Hit Rock Bottom in New York. Can They Bounce Back?,"ALBANY — It is the party of Theodore Roosevelt, Nelson A. Rockefeller and, yes, President Trump. It led the New York State Senate for almost all of the last 75 years. And its backers include such deep-pocketed, well-connected interests as charter schools and New York City real estate moguls. But after an Election Day shellacking, the New York Republican Party has hit bottom. The party lost a whopping eight seats in the State Senate, evaporating its razor-thin majority, and got pounded by Democrats in every statewide race, extending a losing streak that dates to 2002. The best that might be said for the Republicans was that they did not lose any ground in the State Assembly, where they are outnumbered by 64 seats. So come January, when the new Legislature is sworn in, not a single Republican in Albany will have so much as a committee chairmanship. All of which makes any Pollyannaish take rather difficult. “Someday the Republican Party might come back,” said Gerry O’Brien, a longtime Republican consultant from Brooklyn who recently changed his party registration to become an independent. “But, of course, someday we’ll also have flying cars and personal jet packs.” [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The news on a federal level was no better. Democrats claimed victory over three Republican House incumbents, including Representative Dan Donovan of Staten Island, leaving New York City without a single Republican representative. All told, 21 of the state’s 27 House members will be Democrats, as are both of its senators. (Senator Kirsten Gillibrand easily won her second full term on Election Day.) And one of the six Republican House members — Chris Collins of the Buffalo area — is under federal indictment. Such a wipeout, and the prospect of a long stay in the political wilderness, has left Republican loyalists trying to find a way forward and the state party chairman, Edward F. Cox, trying to explain his, and his party’s, dismal performance. “It was a bigger wave than anyone expected,” Mr. Cox said in an interview last week. “There were red swaths across the state. But in the suburbs and the city, we really got hit.” Indeed, the state’s electoral schism looks much like that of the nation as a whole, with every urban and many suburban areas solidly blue, and rural districts a deep red. But the math of that divide is bad for the Republicans: Residents of New York City, for example, which is overwhelmingly Democratic, make up about 40 percent of the state’s voters, spelling almost certain doom for Republicans running statewide in any year in which Democrats turn out. That geographic split also prompted questions about whether the leader of Albany’s upper chamber, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, could maintain his position amid calls for new leadership from upstate members and support for Senator Catharine M. Young, from western New York. Mr. Flanagan summoned the remaining 23 Republican members to the Capitol on Friday for a vote, despite a strong snowstorm. Mr. Flanagan prevailed, but the 14-to-9 tally was indicative of fissures in his weakened ranks. Mr. Cox’s leadership of the state party has also been questioned by some, though he said he was committed to staying in his role. Consultants in both parties agree that the state’s most famous Republican, Mr. Trump, is making life difficult for that party’s candidates in state and local races by turning off independent voters. “His brand of sleaze has totally turned off anybody who ever might even consider voting for a Republican,” Mr. O’Brien said. William F. B. O’Reilly, a consultant to Marcus J. Molinaro, the Republican candidate who was trounced by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, agreed about the Trump effect. “He’s a devastating factor in New York and New England and other largely blue states, but he won’t be there forever,” he said. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] To that end, Mr. O’Reilly and other Republican strategists say the party needs to embrace its role as the opposition and see the losses as an opportunity return to bedrock, bankbook issues like lower taxes and job creation, fiscal oversight, and the reining in of government spending. Mr. O’Reilly would also push for the party to embrace ideas like right-to-work legislation and term limits, and to take hard looks at public-service pension costs. “They may go down in the flames in the Legislature, but at least you’re talking about issues,” Mr. O’Reilly said. Other consultants note that the party needs to build up its grass-roots operation, something that progressive groups did successfully in 2018, while finding true believers to raise big money to compete with Mr. Cuomo’s ample fund-raising operation, as Republicans’ traditional institutional donors, like real estate interests, will want to back winners. Republicans also need to choose their shots, said O’Brien Murray, a Republican consultant who ran Keith Wofford’s losing campaign for state attorney general. “Pick races we know we can win and show we can win,” he said. “And with that comes the belief we can get things done.” Overall, Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one in New York, and heavy turnout helped Democrats prevail in tight Senate races in suburban districts that had been bastions of moderate Republicans. On Long Island, Senator Kemp Hannon, a 29-year incumbent from Nassau County, and Senator Carl Marcellino, who had represented a district straddling Nassau and Suffolk Counties since 1995, lost their seats. Elaine Phillips, elected in 2016 to represent the Seventh District in Nassau, also was defeated. The party lost an additional battle for an open seat in the Third District in Suffolk. Those losses were echoed in other parts of the state: There were two in the Hudson Valley and one each in the Catskills and in Brooklyn, where Senator Martin J. Golden, an eight-term incumbent, was ousted. Despite a solid thumping, Mr. Cox said the issues that Mr. Molinaro tried against Mr. Cuomo — corruption in Albany, the shabby city subways, cutting property taxes statewide — would eventually bear fruit. “Those are the kind of things that were developed during the campaign,” he said. “And we’re going to keep that up.” Mr. Cox also hoped that the Democrats — whose last stint as a majority party in the Senate dissolved into chaos — would prove to be their own worst enemies. “There’s a sense now that they have complete power in Albany,” he said. “They blew it once; they’ll blow it again. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.”",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Lose Another California House Seat,"Republicans suffered another setback in California on Tuesday as Representative Jeff Denham was knocked out of office after four terms in a district representing a sweep of farmland in the Central Valley. He was defeated by his Democratic challenger, Josh Harder, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Harder’s lead had grown over the last week, and the latest update on Tuesday night showed him 4,919 votes ahead, a margin that Mr. Denham would not be able to make up. Mr. Harder’s victory over an entrenched Republican is the latest sign of Democratic strength this year in California and the nation. The Democrats set out to unseat up to seven Republicans in California in districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 but where registered Republicans outnumbered registered Democrats. Mr. Denham’s loss to Mr. Harder, a venture capitalist, marked the fourth upset by a Democrat in California. Two key congressional contests in the state remained too close to call. In the 45th District, Representative Mimi Walters, an Orange County Republican, is facing a challenge by Katie Porter, a Democrat. And in the 39th District, one Republican, Young Kim, is seeking to fill the seat being vacated by another, Representative Ed Royce of Orange County. Ms. Kim is opposed by the Democratic candidate Gil Cisneros. With Mr. Harder’s victory, the Democrats have gained 33 seats in the House and appear on track to gain between 35 and 40 once all the nationwide counting is complete.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Republicans Need a Suburban Agenda,"These voters are leaving the Republican Party and we need to win them back. Mr. Cantor is a former Republican House majority leader. An election provides a certain definitiveness for political candidates, win or lose. I know from experience, having lived through both the ups and the downs. For political parties, elections also provide a chance to reflect, learn and move forward with the business of attracting more voters next time. Or at least they should. For Republicans, losing the House majority in last week’s midterm elections is a clear demonstration that the party must do more to appeal to suburban voters, especially college-educated women. Once a Republican mainstay, this group has been slowly moving away from us for the past few cycles. The data is indisputable, and Republicans must address it. We need a Republican suburban agenda. There is no doubt that some of the loss in support this year from college-educated women, for example, is a result of the negative opinion these voters have of President Trump. But it is also true that Republicans have not had much to offer suburban voters on what they consistently say are their top issues, including health care, child care, education, the environment and transportation. A suburban agenda would not just address pre-existing conditions in insurance coverage but also commit to medical research that offers treatments for a child with a chronic disease or a cure for a parent’s Alzheimer’s. Republicans also need to unify around a plan to ensure that every woman who needs it has access to paid maternity leave from her job and addresses the cost of child care for working families. You wouldn’t know it from most 2018 campaigns, but Republicans actually doubled the child tax credit in last year’s tax bill. No one likes spending time in traffic, but that is exactly where suburban voters are stuck a lot of the time. Republicans need to think about investments in infrastructure not just as an economic issue but also to improve the quality of life of their voters — and the people we need to bring back to our party. Finally, we should continue our commitment to reducing energy costs using an all-of-the-above approach, but emphasize energy efficiency and sustainable, renewable power. Republicans, however, are not alone in not being able to reach people for whom their message used to resonate. The Senate results demonstrated that the Democratic Party continues to suffer from its loss of non-college-educated white men. Exit polls showed these men favored Republicans by a whopping 34 points. A decade ago, these voters split pretty much evenly between the parties. Not surprisingly, of the Senate seats that flipped to Republican, the share of non-college-educated white men in each state exceeds the national average by 2 points. What does the Democratic Party have to say to non-college-educated white men who so often see the party as hostile to them on social and cultural issues and out of touch on issues like securing the border and law and order? Unfortunately, in the past week, both parties have so far sought to explain where they fell short in the midterms by placing the blame on factors outside of their direct control. House Republicans have linked the loss to a record number of retirements and open seats. Senate Democrats have attributed their poor night on the “map” and having to defend so many seats in states President Trump carried in 2016. There are some truths in both excuses, but those small truths mask the bigger picture: Both parties have given up on competing for large portions of the electorate. Instead, it’s all about maximizing turnout for each side’s most partisan supporters. There is a better way. Two of the most popular Republican governors, each re-elected in a landslide on Tuesday, happen to be from two of the bluest states in the country — Massachusetts and Maryland. They have figured out how to maintain support among base Republicans while still appealing to independents and even Democrats. In my home state of Virginia, the suburbs throughout the state have been trending blue for some time. Last year in the race for governor, Democrats faced a choice: Double down on the gains they had made in the suburbs of Washington, Richmond and Norfolk or try to hold those voters while simultaneously appealing to rural areas. On election night, our Republican nominee got more votes than any candidate for governor in the history of the commonwealth except one, our current Democratic governor. Both sides turned out their core voters, but the Democrats won in part by reducing the Republican margin of victory in some of the reddest areas of the state. Put another way, they broadened their appeal. The 2020 election season has now begun. After last week’s niceties of calls and congratulations, what comes next will foreshadow whether these lessons were internalized or ignored. Will Republicans have something to offer suburban, college-educated women? Will Democrats have anything to say to white, non-college-educated men in the rural areas? There is an added bonus for all the beleaguered voters who aren’t quite ready to dive back into a divisive political process: A campaign where you’re trying to bring more people into your party tends to be more civil and less toxic than what we just experienced.

2018,Republicans Say They Will Protect Pre-existing Conditions. Their Records Say Something Else. ,"This is particularly true of the president. See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis. In campaign speeches, advertisements and interviews, Republican politicians are showing a zeal for protecting Americans with pre-existing health conditions. President Trump has gone the furthest, saying not only that he will ensure protections for the previously ill, but also pledging that his party will do so more effectively than Democrats. There are many reasons to doubt these words. The recent history of health care politics in the United States suggests that the president has things backward. (My colleagues Peter Baker and Linda Qiu declared the tweet “false” in an assessment of many recent statements by the president.) It is Democrats, by passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010, who introduced meaningful protections for Americans with prior illnesses. And Republican officeholders have taken numerous actions that would tend to weaken those protections — in Congress, in states and in courts. The Trump administration introduced a sweeping new policy just last week that would allow states to sidestep Obamacare’s requirement to cover pre-existing conditions. The Republican claims emerge amid growing evidence that health care is a motivating issue for many voters, and that Obamacare’s protections for people with prior illnesses are popular. Pre-existing conditions have been a central theme in Democratic campaigns around the country. Although it is possible to provide for people with prior illnesses using mechanisms other than Obamacare, few Republican politicians are pointing to any specific plan that would do so. The president certainly isn’t. Given that silence, it is worth comparing politicians’ promises with their records. Last year, Republicans in Congress led an extended but ultimately unsuccessful effort to, in their words, “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. Although a bill passed through the House of Representatives, Republicans in the Senate were unable to agree on a particular replacement for Obamacare. The House bill, called the American Health Care Act, had provisions that would have weakened current protections for people with pre-existing illnesses. It would have allowed states to eliminate Obamacare’s rules that health insurance must cover a standard set of benefits, like prescription drugs and mental health care, and its rule that insurance companies must charge the same prices to customers whether they are healthy or sick. The House bill created a small pool of money for states to help sick customers who might be shut out of such markets. A majority of House Republicans voted for this bill. Had this bill become law, the precise results would have depended on the choices by individual states. But the Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in a state that would have pursued such a waiver from standard benefits. The consequences, the C.B.O. said, would have been coverage that was unaffordable to many with pre-existing illnesses, along with holes in coverage for many serious conditions. For example, someone with a substance-abuse disorder might have lived where plans for people with that condition were very expensive and didn’t include addiction treatment. The Senate considered several bills. A majority of Republican senators supported them all. Two would have included slightly different programs that would have allowed states to sidestep Obamacare protections. Nearly every Republican incumbent who is now pledging to protect pre-existing conditions supported one of these measures. That’s true of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once helped to shut down the entire federal government over a demand that Obamacare be reversed. It is also true of Dana Rohrabacher, a congressman from California, and Martha McSally, a congresswoman running for Senate in Arizona. President Trump has said he continues to back repeal efforts. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said recently that Congress would consider such legislation if Republicans retained their control after the election. Several Republican senators have co-sponsored a bill that would ensure that people with pre-existing illnesses could buy insurance at standard prices if Obamacare were repealed or overturned. But that bill includes a large loophole: Insurers would not have to cover any care related to that condition. That bill is not scheduled for a vote, and the president has not endorsed it. A federal judge in Texas is expected to rule soon on a court challenge to Obamacare brought by Republican officials in 20 states. The lawsuit argues that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and should be overturned. Among the state officials who are bringing the lawsuit are Josh Hawley, the attorney general from Missouri who is running for Senate, and Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general from West Virginia running for Senate there. In most such lawsuits, the Justice Department defends laws passed by Congress. But the Trump administration has declined to do so. Its position is that most of the law should stand, but that the court should eliminate only the provisions that protect Americans with pre-existing health conditions. Trump administration officials have repeatedly blamed Obamacare for increases in insurance prices and reduced consumer choice. And they have taken several steps on their own meant to allow people to wiggle around the health law’s rules, including those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Just last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Obamacare programs, announced that it would welcome state applications to waive many of Obamacare’s rules for what insurance must cover and how it is funded. Trump administration officials made clear that they might let states use federal subsidies to pay for health plans that do not cover people with pre-existing conditions. As long as a similar number of people have some sort of health coverage, and a comprehensive option exists for people who want it, states will be allowed to adopt plans that expand skimpy coverage for the well and increase the costs of coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. The recent proposal builds on another recent administration policy allowing insurance companies to offer so-called short-term insurance plans. The plans can exclude many common benefits and deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Short-term plans hit the markets in many states this fall. Because they cover fewer benefits and because sick people can’t buy them, they tend to be cheaper than the more comprehensive policies that must follow Obamacare’s rules. After years of political losses linked to Obamacare, Democrats are suddenly taking pride in the health law. It established very clear protections for people with pre-existing conditions, in employer insurance, and especially in the individual market for health insurance. Under Obamacare’s rules, health plans cannot discriminate against customers who have been sick in the past. They can’t charge them higher prices than they would a healthy person in the same place and of the same age. All plans have to cover the same benefits, so it is not possible for a plan to offer coverage to a cancer patient but exclude cancer coverage, as some plans did in the years before the Affordable Care Act. Those current protections are the legal status quo.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Subpoena James Comey and Loretta Lynch Over Clinton Email Case,"The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas for James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Loretta E. Lynch, the former attorney general, as part of an investigation into their handling of inquiries into Hillary Clinton’s email server and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The subpoenas, issued on Wednesday by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee’s chairman and a Republican, require Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch to appear in closed-door sessions with members of Mr. Goodlatte’s committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. Comey has been called to appear on Dec. 3, and Ms. Lynch a day later. On Twitter, Mr. Comey objected to the format that Republicans are demanding for the interview. “I’m still happy to sit in the light and answer all questions,” he said. “But I will resist a ‘closed door’ thing because I’ve seen enough of their selective leaking and distortion. Let’s have a hearing and invite everyone to see.” Several Republicans have said they believe that Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch were part of a deeply rooted bias within the F.B.I. and the Justice Department that allowed Ms. Clinton to escape prosecution for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The Republicans have also alleged impropriety in the origins of the investigation into the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia. With Democrats seizing the majority in the House in the midterm elections — and preparing their own wave of subpoenas against Trump administration officials — House Republicans have a short window to press their case against Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch. Earlier this year, a Justice Department inspector general’s report found that Mr. Comey had been “insubordinate” when he announced that the F.B.I. would not recommend that charges be brought against Mrs. Clinton. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, also found fault with Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac. But Mr. Horowitz did not challenge the outcome of the Clinton investigation or find any of evidence of bias.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans and Democrats Cannot Agree on Absolutely Anything. Except This.,"News Analysis From immigration to tax cuts to who won Florida, there is very little that Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on these days. But there may be one thing: the need to repair the nation’s criminal justice system. It is a cause that has made for strange alliances, including the liberal Center for American Progress, the conservative Koch brothers, law enforcement groups, Kim Kardashian and now, President Trump, who on Wednesday endorsed a bill that would improve prison conditions and lower some sentences. The view that punishment is too harsh, and rehabilitative measures too scarce, is broadly supported in public opinion polls, especially as crime has hovered at a 20-year low. That popular support has translated into political backing. “Out in the real world where people live, it’s not even controversial anymore,” said Mark Holden, who leads Koch Industries’ work on criminal justice issues. Of course, not all the everyday people and the politicians who represent them arrived at this shared conclusion via the same path. The left is persuaded by vast racial disparities and the fact that the United States is a global outlier, with the world’s highest incarceration rate. Those on the right often point to unsustainable costs. The policy wonks arm themselves with reams of data on the system’s failure to lower recidivism or protect from wrongful conviction. And, somewhere in the mix, is the notion of redemption and second chances. [Read more here about how the new bill could bring about the most significant changes to the criminal justice system in a generation.] The bill endorsed by Mr. Trump on Wednesday has been years in the making, bolstered by state-level changes — often led by Republicans in party strongholds like Georgia, South Carolina, Oklahoma and, more recently, Louisiana — that repeatedly demonstrated that prison populations could be reduced with no increase in crime. The trend can be traced back to Texas in 2007, when Rick Perry, then the governor, saw a projection that the state would need 14,000 more prison beds at a cost of more than half a billion dollars. Marc Levin, a lawyer, had recently started a criminal justice program at a conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and he was ready with an alternative: treatment and drug courts that would give judges an alternative to locking people up. “There was a lot of luck involved that it turned out in 2007 things all came together,” Mr. Levin recalled. “And obviously, it was Texas — if Vermont had done this, no one would have noticed.” Instead, Mr. Levin found himself fielding inquiries from state after state. “Tough on crime” had been a political mantra. Mr. Levin called his campaign Right on Crime. Later, the Obama administration would chime in with Smart on Crime. Advocates acknowledge that they vary their tactics depending on the audience. “It’s common sense but we look at it through three different lenses: It’s a moral, constitutional and a fiscal issue,” Mr. Holden said. With other sea changes, he said, “People have seen some type of moral outrage — abolition, suffrage, civil rights, marriage equality, they’ve all been, basically, people coming together from all sides.” The messenger matters as well: Public polling has shown that people trust police officers the most, then the formerly incarcerated. The Koch brothers were attracted to the topic because of the proliferation of criminal statutes — too many on the federal level to even count, Mr. Holden said. But they went on to tackle issues like high bail and poor legal representation for the poor. Mr. Levin, for his part, thought that if conservatives were going to be skeptical of the government’s role in areas like education and welfare, they should also be willing to apply that scrutiny to criminal justice. He also saw an argument that appealed to the Tea Party’s distaste for government interference. “There’s a group of people that could be self-sufficient if we just remove the barriers that the government’s imposed,” he said, referring to laws that bar former felons from obtaining certain kinds of licenses. “We’re doing more harm than good by keeping people in prison who don’t need to be there.” Crime has long been an issue in election season. Few political veterans can forget the 1988 presidential campaign in which President George H.W. Bush bashed Michael Dukakis for releasing a prisoner, Willie Horton, on furlough who later went on to commit assault, armed robbery and rape. Six years later, President Bill Clinton signed a major anti-crime bill that set lengthy prison sentences and flooded the streets with police officers. It is often cited as a driver of mass incarceration. “Both parties were competing for who can be the most tough on crime throughout the 1980s and ’90s, and then the Republicans came to their senses first, for financial reasons,” said Inimai Chettiar, director of the Brennan Center for Justice. “So now you’re going to have this happen, if it happens, under a very conservative president.” In Ms. Chettiar’s view, reining in the criminal justice system did not become a mainstream Democratic issue until 2016, when Hillary Clinton came out in favor of it and Bill Clinton apologized for the 1994 bill. Bipartisanship on the need for change has helped inoculate candidates from Willie Horton-style attacks, and conservatives have been willing to give liberals political cover. In 2012, when Gov. Jerry Brown of California was considering a bill that would allow reconsideration for people sentenced to life without parole as juveniles, his office asked Right on Crime for help, Mr. Levin recalled. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and Pat Nolan, a Republican legislator, became active in prisoner advocacy after serving time on a racketeering charge, wrote an op-ed in The San Diego Union-Tribune in favor of the bill, and ten days later Mr. Brown signed it into law. Of course, Mr. Trump’s endorsement will provide more cover for wavering politicians than perhaps anyone else could. “There are no politicians more popular than Donald Trump in Kentucky,” said Holly Harris, executive director of U.S. Justice Action Network, a main proponent of the bill. “I can say that because I live there.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Republicans, Bolt","letter A reader suggests that onetime Republicans form a party of their own. To the Editor: Re “Trump Can’t Unite Us. Can Anyone?,” by Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat (The Conversation, nytimes.com, Oct. 30): Respectable former Republicans have left their party, while others, who bear little resemblance to traditional conservatives, opportunistically attach themselves to the party. Max Boot, a conservative who has left the Republican Party, reflects: “You used to belong to a conservative party with a white-nationalist fringe. Now it’s a white-nationalist party with a conservative fringe.” The party of the past was based on solid conservative values; it was not a home for anti-immigrant nativists or for “alternative facts” and conspiracy theories. Alt-right hangers-on now run as Republicans, with encouragement from the head of the party. Republicans who can no longer identify with their morphed party should form a new party that provides a sane home for rational conservatives. They would pull traditional conservatives away from the existing party (and might pick up some centrist Democrats). In the process of separating themselves from the alt-right, they would finally be able to “stop Trump,” which is exactly what they want to do. Perhaps we need a third, centrist party that believes truth exists and values matter, and cares about preserving our institutions and getting things done.

2018,Rescheduled Copa Libertadores Final Will Be Played in Madrid,"The game billed as the biggest match in South American soccer history — the delayed second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between the Argentine archrivals Boca Juniors and River Plate — will be held in Europe. Alejandro Domínguez, the president of Conmebol, South American soccer’s governing body, said Thursday that Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium would host the match on Dec. 9. Fans of both clubs will be permitted to attend, despite the fact that the game, originally scheduled to be played in Buenos Aires on Nov. 25, was postponed twice last weekend after an attack by River fans on the bus carrying the Boca Juniors team resulted in injuries to several players. Boca Juniors had requested that the game be canceled and that River Plate, its bitter crosstown rival, be forced to forfeit the trophy as punishment for the attack outside River’s Monumental stadium. Though River Plate was fined $400,000 by Conmebol on Thursday and was ordered to play its next two home fixtures in continental competition behind closed doors, the organization rejected Boca’s appeal and announced that the match would go ahead. Rejecting the prospect that the game be rescheduled in Argentina, Domínguez said Conmebol decided that it would go ahead only on “neutral” territory. A number of cities volunteered, including Doha, Qatar; Medellín, Colombia; Genoa, Italy; and Miami. Domínguez was ultimately convinced that the game could be best staged in safety and security — without losing its “essence” — in the Spanish capital after a telephone conversation with Florentino Pérez, the president of Real Madrid. “He told me within two minutes that the Bernabéu was available,” Domínguez said. “Spain has the highest population of Argentines outside Argentina,” Domínguez added. “It is the 10th safest city in the world. Its airport has the most connections with Latin America in the world. And it has a great tradition of football.” He confirmed that all proceeds from the game would be donated to a fund to “eradicate violence from Argentine soccer,” and he said Conmebol would seek to reimburse fans who had paid for tickets to the original game at the Monumental. (Boca Juniors hosted the final’s first leg on Nov. 11, a 2-2 tie.) The decision to hold the game in Spain has consequences far beyond Argentina, however. The R.F.E.F., Spanish soccer’s governing body, has agreed to the game’s being held on its territory at the same time it is objecting to La Liga’s plans to host a regular-season Spanish league game in the United States in January. FIFA, too, granted its approval for the Copa Libertadores move, despite the objections of its president, Gianni Infantino, to the same Liga proposal on the grounds that competitions should not be held outside their home country. A FIFA-sanctioned Copa Libertadores outside South America could also come to be seen by UEFA as a precedent should it choose to try to host a Champions League final away from Europe. Aleksander Ceferin, UEFA’s president, has raised the possibility of moving that final, the richest and most glamorous game in club soccer, to North America or the Middle East, and UEFA is examining the possibility.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Rescue the Drama Book Shop,"letter A reader suggests that the theater community establish a fund to pay the rent. To the Editor: Re “Drama Book Shop Plans to Relocate Over Rent” (Weekend section, Oct. 26): Why is the Drama Book Shop having difficulty paying its rent? For that matter, why is this revered and treasured resource still subject to the brutal forces of free-market real estate in the Manhattan theater district? Creating an endowment of $5 million and allowing the store to operate under the auspices of a nonprofit foundation would cushion it against the marketplace and enable it to continue in the wonderful space that it now occupies on West 40th Street. This amount is small change for the New York City theater community! Get busy, folks. The Drama Book Shop helped many of you over the years by putting your work before the public when no one else would. Time to give back! Robin BreonToronto",The New York Times
2018,Restlessly Seeking Celine,"Phoebe Philo has left the house, but fans are still chasing the designer’s greatest hits. Gabrielle Boucinha, a freelance graphic designer, introduced her Instagram account in the wake of Phoebe Philo’s much lamented exit from Celine. Her feed, @oldceline, a compilation of images dating from Ms. Philo’s decade-long tenure at the luxury house, has drawn an ardent following, swelling from a few hundred in September, when Hedi Slimane was set to replace Ms. Philo as creative director, to a current 143,000. Combined with a surge in sales of recent and more vintage Philo designs, that figure, Ms. Boucinha said, would seem to suggest a consumer reaction — a mini-revolt, if you will — unmatched in recent memory. “At luxury houses, designers come and go,” she said. “But I’ve never seen this kind of response to a switch in a house’s creative direction.” As late as this month, when the new bag that Mr. Slimane designed arrived in stores, Ms. Philo’s champions (Philo-philes, in fashion parlance) were still chasing down trophies bearing the designer’s singular stamp, prowling shops and foraging for castoffs on eBay and consignment sites like Tradesy, Vestiaire Collective and the RealReal. The rush appeared to signal disenchantment with Mr. Slimane, who in his debut collection for the house swapped Ms. Philo’s deftly underplayed, slightly masculine swagger for a steamier rock-meets-young-Hollywood look. But that discontent only partly accounts for the recent spike in Philo fever. Supplies may dwindle or vanish entirely from stores, but demand remains robust. “My spend on Celine increased this season,” said Ramya Giangola, the founder of Gogoluxe, a luxury brand consultancy. Spurred by what she called “the sense of an ending,” Ms. Giangola, who was in Paris during fashion week, went to Celine on Avenue Montaigne the weekend after Mr. Slimane’s runway show. At the store, the scene was hectic, she recalled. “In terms of the crowds, it felt like being at Zara,” Ms. Giangola said. “There was the feeling that you had to grab it all, and if you didn’t, the next day it would all be gone.” Rarely has an exiting designer been so pursued — or so eulogized. “Bar perhaps Coco Chanel, I can’t think of another designer whose every piece was instantaneously ‘a classic,’” Lucy Chadwick, an influential art dealer, told T magazine earlier this fall. “In a time of eternally rotating fads and disposability and waste, nothing felt more necessary.” Ms. Philo’s sustained impact can also be measured through online searches and sales. On eBay, searches jumped 225 percent on Sept. 29, the day after Mr. Slimane showed his first collection. Sales, which sprinted ahead 35 percent from September to October, continue to climb, up 10 percent month over month, according to the company. At the RealReal, searches increased in October, with a sustained growth of 32 percent over the same period last year, said Rati Sahi Levesque, the chief merchant of the company. Prices have climbed by 30 percent over last year at this time, she noted, and revenues are up 35 percent. Demand for Philo-era knitwear, statement outerwear, dresses and jackets has been especially keen, Ms. Levesque said: “Overall, customers are looking at all Phoebe Philo clothing items as collectors’ pieces.” In accessories, the so-called box clasp handbag, a structured design worthy of British royalty, remains on the company’s most-wanted list. The capacious luggage bag, Ms. Levesque said, stands to survive as a classic. At Tradesy, searches for Celine have increased 34 percent since September, compared with June through August. In October, the average selling price leapt 35 percent, according to Tracy DiNunzio, the company’s founder and chief executive. “The things that cost more were the things that sold,” Ms. DiNunzio said. “We have more people asking, ‘Oh, what do you have in Celine?’” said Ina Bernstein, the owner of the Ina group of consignment stores in Manhattan. “Philo designs have alway gone fast, but they go even faster now. We can’t keep the signature trapeze and luggage bags in stock.” Never mind prices that range from $1,800 to about $2,500. A pair of boots combining pony, camel, black leather and leopard, outré by conservative standards, sold the day they arrived, Ms. Bernstein said. The rush on Ms. Philo’s creations attests to a loyalty her contemporaries seldom command. Her aesthetic, some argue, represented a sea change. “She gave us a long slit dress in place of a short one, wide-leg pants that got us out of clingy jeans,” Ms. Boucinha said. The Philo look, built on sumptuous fabrics, loose cuts and lavish layering, “makes a statement that when it comes to looking sexy, you don't have to try so hard,” she added. Ms. Philo “redefined femininity,” Ms. Bernstein said. “Her oversize dresses and coats layered over trousers stressed comfort and elegance over blatant sex appeal. She gave women permission to walk around in big clunky shoes and sneakers.” “Look around,” she said. “No one is walking all day in high heels any more.” Ms. Philo’s acolytes tend to shop with a collector’s discernment. “Since discovering Celine, I’ve thought less about quantity and more about quality,” Ms. Giangola said. “I started shopping less and focusing more on the way I spent money and wore clothes.” She might say that her purchases were justified by the longevity of Ms. Philo’s designs. So might Lizzie Hanes, an aesthetician in Brooklyn who was spotted last week eyeing a Philo cream-colored coat at the RealReal in SoHo. “So much Celine that I bought I’m going to have forever,” Ms. Hanes said. “If I were to buy an Ulla Johnson dress, I would probably be tired of it in a season or two.” Fur-lined Birkenstocks and blush-tone coats aside, it’s often not easy to tell what season a Celine piece is from, Ms. Bernstein said, suggesting that Ms. Philo’s designs have no apparent sell-by date. “They’re all very timeless,” she said, adding a bit dourly. “So much of fashion isn’t timeless right now.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Restore Funding for Gun Violence Research ,"letter A reader is heartened that some candidates are campaigning on gun control issues. To the Editor: It was incredibly heartening in this political climate to read “Not Afraid to Claim an F From the N.R.A.” (news article, Nov. 5). As a lifelong Democrat and a physician, I have found it frustrating to watch candidates waffle over gun laws, when guns are responsible for so many more American deaths than more heavily restricted and legislated activities like air travel. I would ask that we take this momentum one step further and support repealing the Dickey Amendment, which restricts federal funding for research on gun violence. Knowledge truly is power, and federal funding for an issue of such great public health importance is critical if we want to discover effective interventions to reduce gun violence. We should all stand behind evidence-based and scientifically sound research meant to save American lives. Grace FergusonPittsburgh",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Restore the Hall of Fame for Great Americans,"letter A reader recalls a favorite spot in his Bronx childhood. To the Editor: Re “Hard to Circle This Hall of Fame and Not Notice the Disrepair,” by James Barron (Grace Notes column, Nov. 5): I read with sadness the poor state of repair of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx. Having grown up in the Bronx more than 50 years ago, I recall those warm spring afternoons when we would walk the few blocks from our school to the campus of what was then uptown New York University. We would play on the paths and sit on the lawns of the graceful campus, admire the Stanford White buildings and end up at the colonnaded Hall of Fame. Our fifth-grade teacher was an avid student of history, and she would patiently instruct us about the lives of the great and the not-so-great who were enshrined there. I hope that the Hall of Fame will be restored so that once again it can serve as an elegant symbol of our civic pride and cultural history. Harold B. AspisScarsdale, N.Y.",The New York Times
2018,"Resy Acquires Reserve, in the Fierce Tussle Over Restaurant Reservations","OpenTable is still the biggest player, but that dominance is under challenge by Resy and other rivals. Resy, the restaurant-reservation service founded in 2014, said Friday that it had acquired its smaller competitor Reserve. Though Resy is the nation’s largest privately held reservation service, it is still small in comparison with OpenTable, which was bought by the publicly traded Priceline Group (now called Booking Holdings) in 2014 for $2.6 billion and is used by nearly 50,000 restaurants around the world. But Resy’s expansion is the latest sign that OpenTable’s dominance in the field may be threatened as small, young companies fiercely pursue restaurants’ business with lower fees and newer technology. Resy would not disclose the financial details of the deal, which was signed on Oct. 27. But it said that with the addition of Reserve, which works with about 1,000 restaurants, most of them in Chicago, Washington and Boston, it will now serve about 4,000 restaurants in the United States. And since April, when it connected several international reservation platforms to its technology, Resy is used by 10,000 restaurants worldwide. In April, Resy also bought ClubKviar, a luxury reservation service in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. A year ago, Resy acquired Servy, a market research service, which it will integrate into its own software, allowing restaurants to survey their customers and learn more about them. OpenTable, founded in 1998, charges restaurants based on the number of reservations it makes for them, in addition to a flat rate, but says it is experimenting with a new pricing model it will roll out in the next quarter. Reserve and Resy, which both started in 2014, charge restaurants only a flat rate for use of their software. (None of the three charge diners.) “We’re attacking and dismantling some very stale, inadequate, overpriced products,” Ben Leventhal, one of Resy’s founders and its chief executive, said in an interview last week. He said the company’s revenue has doubled in each of the last four years. It now seats about 1.4 million diners each week, and its no-show rate — a critical metric for restaurants, which lose money when people with reservations don’t turn up — averages just under 5 percent, Mr. Leventhal said. The industry average is closer to 15 percent, and can spike around holidays like Valentine’s Day. Tock, a competitor that popularized a ticketlike reservations system in which diners pay for their meals in advance (as they would for baseball games or concerts), says it found that asking diners to put down deposits as small as $5 greatly reduced the no-show rate. But all reservation services are fighting for somewhat limited turf: Two-thirds of restaurant reservations are still made over the phone, according to Yelp, another competitor, which offers reservations on its listings pages. To grow, these services have to find ways to make the booking process more efficient and reliable, combat no-shows and offer new, useful features to keep restaurants organized and booked. “The market for OpenTable and such companies was always more limited, because some people just didn't use it,"" said John A. Gordon, a principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group, which analyzes restaurants’ strategies and earnings. “We’ve got over a million restaurants in the United States and all restaurants are trying to collect more information about their customers,” he added. “That information is useful because it can create a deeper relationship with the brand and it’s more personal and more efficient than running an ad.” Mr. Leventhal, who also founded the website Eater, said Resy is focused on helping restaurants market themselves more strategically to their diners. If a restaurant has, say, a waiting list of 200 on a Saturday night, it can use Resy to get in touch with those diners and bring them in for dinner on a slower night with the offer of a free drink. Or, if a customer is repeatedly showing up on a wait list and not able to get in, Resy can identify the pattern and alert the restaurant, so it can make him a reservation and, most likely, create a regular. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Mr. Leventhal said. “Our goal in five years is for every restaurant that works with Resy to not worry about closing.” When Resy started four years ago, it operated under a very different model, charging diners a premium for prime-time, hard-to-score seats at popular restaurants and earning itself unflattering comparisons to intermediaries like ticket scalpers. “We moved away from that because restaurants told us there was a bigger opportunity,” Mr. Leventhal said. “Restaurants helped us understand we were focused on something pretty niche, in the end.” High-profile users of Resy now include Delicious Hospitality Group (which runs Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones in New York City), Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group and Hillstone Restaurant Group. Reserve’s clients include Major Food Group and the Chicago chef Rick Bayless’s Frontera Restaurants. Mr. Leventhal said most of Reserve’s staff of 34 people, who are based in Chicago and New York, would join Resy, which has about 135 employees working out of the company’s headquarters in SoHo and an office in London, as well as remotely. For now, Resy will continue to run Reserve’s service as it is. The work of moving restaurants from Reserve to Resy’s platform will happen slowly, beginning early in 2019, after the holiday rush of private parties and events — the most chaotic time of the year in the restaurant business. As Mr. Leventhal put it, “We can’t ask restaurants to just rip and replace tech as critical as reservations.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,Retrieving Body of Missionary Killed on Remote Indian Island Is a Struggle,"When Indian police officers in a small boat pulled within sight of the remote island, they saw something strange. A group of islanders were huddled on the beach. Carrying bows, arrows and spears, they appeared to be guarding something. Police officials said it could have been the body of John Allen Chau. The 26-year-old American missionary was killed last week as he tried to spread Christianity to North Sentinel, a forbidden island in the Andaman Sea with a long history of repelling outsiders. The crew turned off the boat’s motor. They peered at the islanders through binoculars, making sure to stay several hundred yards off shore, out of bow-and-arrow range. “The Sentinelese were watchful,” Dependra Pathak, the area’s police chief, said on Saturday. “They were patrolling the beach, at the same spot John was killed, with weapons.” “Had we approached,” he said, “they would have attacked.” So instead of retrieving Mr. Chau’s body or determining where it is, the police officers, after sketching out the crime scene, motored away. “This case is the strangest and toughest in my life,” Mr. Pathak said. “We are trying to enter into another civilization’s world.” North Sentinel Island is home to one of the last undiluted hunter-and-gatherer societies, a rugged, Manhattan-sized island where a few dozen people live trapped in time and in total isolation. For decades, India has kept North Sentinel in a museum case. Mr. Chau’s death has shattered the glass. Efforts to retrieve Mr. Chau’s body — the first step in most murder investigations — are proving difficult and some anthropologists say it will be impossible. The search symbolizes the larger quandary India confronts in trying to enforce a society’s rules in a place that has been intentionally set away from the rest of that society. Indian law says North Sentinel’s culture is so precious and unique that its people should be left totally alone and no outsiders are allowed there. It also says that murderers should be punished. That is the bind police officers are facing. Last week, a group of fishermen reported seeing Mr. Chau’s body buried on the beach, apparently after the islanders shot him with bows and arrows. But police officials have yet to locate a corpse. Just about anyone who has stepped ashore on this island has been attacked with bows and arrows and anthropologists are warning the government to move gingerly. “You can’t take the Sentinelese for granted,” said T.N. Pandit, an anthropologist who visited the island years ago. “You can’t bring the army and take away the body. It’s not like that. They need to observe utmost caution.” Though the Andaman and Nicobar Island chain is India’s farthest flung outpost, it is no longer so out of reach. The Indian government recently pushed to open more islands to tourism. The biggest town, Port Blair, has new resorts, new roads, new clothing shops, a major naval base, good cellular phone service and an increasingly busy airport. North Sentinel lies less than 35 miles away. The Indian Navy patrols the waters around the island, trying to make sure no outsiders ever reach it. But as Mr. Chau showed, that ring of security could easily be breached. On the night of Nov. 14, Mr. Chau, who lived in Washington state, set off under the cover of darkness with a group of fishermen he paid to take him to the island. A graduate of Oral Roberts University and a passionate Christian, Mr. Chau told friends he was willing to risk his life to bring Christianity to North Sentinel, a place so shrouded in mystery that the Indian government says no outsiders know the language or the customs of the people there. It is unclear what exactly happened to him. For two days, he used a kayak to paddle the half-mile between the boat and North Sentinel, where he rattled off passages from Genesis to the islanders. Sometimes the islanders simply stared at him. Other times they laughed. The frustration built. In a 13-page letter Mr. Chau gave to the fishermen, in which he detailed those failures to win over the islanders, he pleaded with God for clarity: “I don’t want to die. Who will take my place if I do?” On the morning of Nov. 17, the fishermen saw a group of islanders dragging his body on the beach, then burying it in a shallow grave in the sand. The fishermen and one other man who the police say helped Mr. Chau reach the island have been arrested and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and with violating rules protecting aboriginal tribes. Another case has been filed against “unknown persons,” the islanders, for killing Mr. Chau. The investigation is now heading into uncharted territory. On Friday, authorities sent police officers, along with some of the arrested fishermen, on a boat to observe North Sentinel and establish where Mr. Chau was killed. But will any of the islanders actually face prosecution? And if arrested, would they die in captivity from disease, their immune systems no match for modern microbes? In 2006, two crab fishermen were killed by islanders after washing up on North Sentinel’s shores. Police officials are now poring through the records of those killings, looking for clues about what happened to the fishermen’s bodies. Mr. Pathak said that about a week after the islanders buried the fishermen in shallow graves on the beach, they dug up the bodies and stood them up by tying them to lengths of bamboo. “If they follow the same pattern,” Mr. Pathak said, they may soon take out Mr. Chau’s body, although he suggested that it might never be recovered. In the case of the two fishermen, Mr. Pathak doesn’t think their bodies were ever recovered and he seemed to indicate that was a possibility in this case as well. “If maybe, from a distance, we can see John’s body, then at least his death gets fully established,” he said. In his last letter, Mr. Chau was clear about what he wanted done in case he died. “Don’t retrieve my body,” he wrote, underlining it. “This is not a pointless thing — the eternal lives of this tribe is at hand.”",The New York Times
2018,Return of African Artifacts Sets a Tricky Precedent for Europe’s Museums,"LONDON — When President Emmanuel Macron of France received a report he had commissioned on the restitution of African treasures, he wasted no time in announcing that the Quai Branly Museum in Paris would return 26 objects, looted by French colonial forces in 1892, to Benin. But that was as far as the president went in publicly endorsing the report on Friday. Its authors, Bénédicte Savoy of France and Felwine Sarr of Senegal, recommend that all objects removed without consent from Africa and sent to France be permanently returned if the countries of origin ask for them. Mr. Macron instead assigned his culture and foreign ministers to help fulfill an objective he set a year ago: to ensure that the cultural treasures of sub-Saharan Africa be accessible in Africa through restitutions, but also exhibitions, exchanges and loans. He also called for an international conference in early 2019 on the return of African artifacts. In Europe, the restitution announcement drew tepid reactions from museum directors, as it sets a tricky precedent. Leaders of cultural institutions were quick to emphasize that Mr. Macron was speaking for France and France alone, but acknowledged that his actions and pronouncements on African heritage had energized and accelerated discussions on the subject elsewhere. In Africa, the announcement was met with a mix of enthusiasm and caution. The restitution of 26 objects to Benin “does not change the policy of the British Museum, nor legislation in Great Britain,” said Hartwig Fischer, the director of the London institution, which has 73,000 objects from sub-Saharan Africa in its collections, many obtained in colonial times. The museum has been in a decades-long dispute with Greece over the so-called Elgin marbles, which came from the Parthenon, and the governor of Easter Island requested last week the return of Hoa Hakananai’a, a statue that is among the British Museum’s most popular items. Mr. Fischer said that while the British Museum’s trustees were open to all forms of cooperation, “the collections have to be preserved as whole.” He recognized that Mr. Macron’s announcement would “intensify the debate” about access, and would contribute to “the next dimension of cooperation” as African countries develop their cultural and museum infrastructure. Hartmut Dorgerloh, the director of the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, a giant museum of non-Western art set to open next year, said in an interview that Mr. Macron’s pledge to return the 26 objects had made issues of Africa’s heritage “more obvious, more visible and also more urgent.” In the future, he said, European museums would “have to return” objects in some cases, while in others, the inclusion of artifacts in collections would have to be viewed as “the result of European or global history.” “How far back will you go? Until Roman times?” he said. “Because many items in Rome were robbed somewhere in Greece or in ancient Egypt.” The objects that Mr. Macron is giving back to Benin are a star attraction of the Quai Branly Museum. Seized when French colonial forces ransacked the capital of the 300-year-old Kingdom of Dahomey, they were royal treasures that the fleeing king left behind: statues, thrones, and even the carved polychrome doors of his palace. Although the report by Ms. Savoy and Mr. Sarr advises against measures such as long-term loans, Mr. Macron has spoken favorably in the past of “temporary restitution.” One example of the kind of cooperation that Mr. Macron could be looking for is the Benin Dialogue Group, which includes representatives from Nigeria and from major European museums that own treasures of the Kingdom of Benin, in what is now southern Nigeria. Those artifacts — mostly sculptures and relief plaques — were looted from royal palaces during a British expedition in 1897. They were taken to Britain or sold on the open market, and eventually ended up in museums in Europe and the United States. Some are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago. Edo State in Nigeria hopes to open a museum by 2021 to house several hundred of the artifacts, lent short-term by the British Museum, among others. Prince Kum’a Ndumbe III of the Duala people in Cameroon, who runs AfricAvenir International, a nonprofit that calls for the restitution of artifacts taken without consent, said that the French report was “the first step in the right direction.” He added that such a political commitment had been awaited since Cameroon and much of the rest of Francophone Africa gained independence from France in 1960. “This is not just about the return of African art,” he said. “When someone’s stolen your soul, it’s very difficult to survive as a people.” He invited Britain and Germany to follow the French example and commission their own restitution reports. Stéphane Martin, president of the Quai Branly Museum, which has 70,000 objects from sub-Saharan Africa in its collections, said in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro that last week’s report was “a bad answer to the courageous question posed by the president.” While restitution was “not a word that I’m scandalized by,” he added, there are “other ways to engage in cultural cooperation with Africa.” In a separate interview with Europe 1 radio on Sunday, Mr. Martin said it was he who had suggested that the 26 objects from his museum be returned to Benin. “Museums must not be hostages to the painful history of colonization,” he said. Mr. Martin did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article. Mr. Fischer of the British Museum described the French report as “a radical proposal” that made a “moral argument” against colonialism, whereby “everything that took place under the conditions of colonialism is eligible for restitution.” He also noted that Mr. Macron’s statement on Friday was “much more nuanced” than the report, and left open the door for options other than returning objects. The ball is now in the court of France’s culture minister and foreign minister, who have been asked to bring together African and European museum managers and cultural professionals to ensure that works of art circulate not only among the major museums of the world — which hold 90 percent to 95 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s cultural heritage, according to the report — but also on the African continent. The Paris conference next year will be a test of that process. Sindika Dokolo, a businessman from the Democratic Republic of Congo who runs an art foundation in Angola and who has bought back looted African art, said the French president’s restitution offer had “no precedent.” “Macron has opened a Pandora’s box,” he said. At the same time, Mr. Dokolo urged African leaders to respond quickly, before a change of government or mood in France — to “put their foot in the door before it closes.”",The New York Times
2018,Return to Campus for Students Who Survived Thousand Oaks Shooting,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — It was college night when a gunman entered Borderline Bar & Grill late last Wednesday, the dance floor packed with students trying to let off some steam, drink a little beer and line dance to the country music blaring in the background. It was the type of night that would be familiar to college students anywhere. But also familiar for this generation and the young people at Borderline are the regular lockdowns and active shooter drills that are a part of campus life where mass shootings seem like a constant threat. This time, the shooting wasn’t on campus, but many of those who survived were students at nearby schools, including California State University Channel Islands and California Lutheran University. Among the 12 people killed that night was Alaina Housley, a freshman at Pepperdine University, and Justin Meek, who graduated from California Lutheran University in May. [Read the latest developments on the California fires.] After the shooting, several campuses canceled classes. More colleges did the same a day later, when thousands were forced to evacuate because of wildfires. On Monday, Cal Lutheran reopened, but the campus remained unusually quiet, with many students still absorbing the news and mourning the death of Mr. Meek, who worked as a bouncer at Borderline. The campus chapel has been open around the clock and professors have promised to give students as much time as they need to complete their coursework. It will take a long time for campuses to return to normal. We spoke to several students as they returned to classes about the shooting and what Borderline meant to them. I’ve been going to Borderline as long as I’ve been in college. My friend Justin Meek, who was killed there that night, worked as a bouncer. We’d go once or twice a month and there was always Justin. There was never a time where I felt unsafe in any way. When we arrived around 10:30 p.m. I gave Justin a big hug at the door and we just kind of made our rounds. We were hanging out near the back wall looking at the stage when we heard the loud noise. I thought someone had dropped something in the kitchen at first. But then I heard more and I went under a high table. I heard more rounds, grabbed my friends and yelled “Get down. This is happening, this is happening right now.” I waited for a delay in the shots, and the second I heard that, I assumed he was reloading. I grabbed my friend who didn’t want to get up. I told her, “We’ve got to go right now.” We jumped out of the window out back and started running. We stopped at another restaurant and started banging at the door. They immediately barricaded the doors and took us into the kitchen. That’s where we saw my friend had a severe wound on her hand from the window. My father is a registered gun owner, so that’s how I knew what to listen for at the right second. When I was younger, he made sure we were very educated, to take away any chance of us getting curious without him. He took us to the gun range and was very adamant that we knew safety around guns. It was strictly for the purpose of home defense and at the shooting range. I recognize this was a handgun. But there is no reason any of those assault weapons should ever be accessible to civilians. They should never fall into the hands of someone not trained with the military. I am not of the opinion that we need to or should take everyone’s guns away. We also really need to check up on someone’s mental health. People who might do harm, people who are on the edge, they should not have their hands on a gun. There’s not much for people who are underage to do, so Borderline was it for us. I’m there virtually every week. There were always people there who teach you how to dance. I saw him come in and reach up to the desk and didn’t think anything of it. Then I saw him reach for the gun and I knew right away what it was. I grew up around guns, we went to a shooting range for the first time when I was 9 years old. We were taught the strictest gun safety, that this is not something to play with. Somehow when it happened all the fear drained out of me. I just knew everyone needs to get out now. I looked for the closest out and went. I ran toward the road and saw officers pointing rifles. Then I felt safe. I stayed in the parking lot until 8 a.m. Then I went to the teen center, where people were still waiting for others. That seemed like the best thing to do. I am a big proponent of allowing concealed firearms. And that’s next to impossible to get in California. Good people need guns. But that being said, Borderline would not have been a place for that. Taking a gun into a place with alcohol is the biggest no-no for people who are smart. You need to have good judgment, and the biggest thing that effects judgment is alcohol. There should have been armed security. But I am of the mind-set that it all depends on the situation. Guns aren’t a black and white issue. This was my place, where you could decompress after a hard week and dance and be care free. Almost everyone was a student or recent graduate. I was in the middle of the dance floor and heard three or four loud pops. I turned to where the door was and saw flashes and that was kind of when everyone realized what was going on. I ran off the dance floor and dove underneath a table. I realized that there was an exit door to my left and I ran out of there, that’s when the second round of shots started. People were screaming to get down, and I felt like I was the last person to leave the dance floor. I felt like I was standing there for longer than everyone else — all by myself. It was just me, alone, but with him. [Here’s how you can help those affected by the fires.] I think everyone knew, they just didn’t want to believe that’s what it was, and you have to understand so you can act fast. After I moved here from England when I was 10, we always did lockdown drills in school. But no one can ever really prepare you to be in a bar like this. There’s nowhere to hide. This is absolutely something you can’t ever really prepare yourself for. Gun control should be taken a hell of a lot more seriously. It should have happened after Columbine, it should have happened after Sandy Hook. I’ve never done anything about it myself, but obviously I feel a lot more strongly now. It gives you a whole new motivation, to fight for ourselves and the people who were killed. It’s still so early: People haven’t even picked up their cars from the bar yet. We’re just talking and being there for each other in town for now. I’ve been going there almost every Wednesday since 2017, sometimes other nights too. It’s a great place for dancing. I spend the whole time dancing many nights, so that’s where I was when the shots started. Sometimes there’s problems with the sound system, so that’s what I first thought, even though the pops weren’t coming from that direction. Then people started to scream and duck. I started running to the back and tripped over someone as the gun shots continued. I moved to the back door and it was just chaotic. I ran up the street toward the freeway. I was in complete shock, with just so much adrenaline. I was not thinking. I would have expected to be more scared. I’ve seen all these things on television, who hasn’t, but never for a second worried about it happening in a place I was. What are the chances I’d be at a place someone would want to shoot up? Not here. I want to go back, maybe. It’s hard to say. It’s too early. Mostly I’ve just been spending time with friends, people who were there that night. We’re all still in shock. Then there were the fires so nothing is normal yet.",The New York Times
2018,"Reuben Foster, Days After Domestic Violence Arrest, Is Claimed by Redskins","Just three days after a domestic violence arrest that led to his release by the San Francisco 49ers, Reuben Foster on Tuesday was claimed off waivers by the Washington Redskins. Foster was arrested late Saturday at the 49ers’ hotel by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office in Florida on a charge of misdemeanor domestic violence. It was Foster’s second arrest of the year — he was charged with domestic violence against the same woman in the spring, though that was later dropped — and it violated a zero-tolerance policy the 49ers had reaffirmed after Foster’s earlier arrest. The 49ers dropped Foster, a linebacker whom they acquired in the first round of the 2017 draft after trading up to select him, on Sunday morning before their game against Tampa Bay. The Redskins claimed him off waivers, immediately putting his contract under their control, and the N.F.L. later announced that Foster had been put on the commissioner’s exempt list, barring him from practicing and attending games. He is allowed to be present at team facilities for meetings, workouts, therapy and rehabilitation. The move by Washington was met with immediate criticism online, forcing Doug Williams, the Redskins’ senior vice president for player personnel, to release a statement explaining the decision. “Today, we have claimed the rights to LB Reuben Foster,” he said in the statement. “The Redskins fully understand the severity of the recent allegations made against Reuben. If true, you can be sure these allegations are nothing our organization would ever condone.” The statement went on to say that Foster would have to clear several hurdles with the league and his new team to be allowed to suit up for Washington; it added that the team had consulted with a number of Foster’s former teammates at Alabama before making the decision. The Redskins have four former Alabama teammates of Foster on their roster: Shaun Dion Hamilton, Daron Payne, Jonathan Allen and Ryan Anderson. “Nothing is promised to Reuben, but we are hopeful being around so many of his former teammates and friends will eventually provide him with the best possible environment to succeed both personally and professionally,” Williams’s statement said. Foster’s legal troubles began at the N.F.L. scouting combine last year when his confrontation with a hospital worker over his drug test resulted in his being sent home without meeting any teams. That episode, and the diluted drug test sample that was later announced, led to Foster’s entering the N.F.L.’s substance-abuse program, and he was selected at No. 31 after being projected as a likely top-10 pick. After a promising rookie year, Foster had a tumultuous off-season, which included the initial domestic violence charge as well as a misdemeanor marijuana-possession charge. While his accuser recanted the initial domestic violence charge, saying she had made up the charges to harm his career, the N.F.L. determined that between the two arrests, Foster had violated the N.F.L.’s conduct and substance-abuse policies, and the league suspended him for the first two games of the season. The report from Saturday’s arrest stated that “Foster slapped her phone out of her hand, pushed her in the chest area and slapped her with an open hand on the left side of her face. Officers observed a one-inch scratch on the victim’s left collarbone.” Foster was initially held without bail, but after a hearing on Sunday morning, he was released on $2,000 bail and was told to have no contact with his accuser. Foster, who received the 2016 Butkus Award as the top linebacker in college football, appeared in 16 games for the 49ers over two seasons. He is currently working his way back from a hamstring injury amid a disappointing season on the field, in which he has played in just six games and collected 29 tackles.",The New York Times
2018,Reuters Photojournalist Talks About Photo of Children Fleeing Tear Gas at Border in Mexico,"In the photograph, a woman clutches two children in diapers, one of them barefoot, as they run from a smoking tear gas canister fired by American border officials. That arresting image, taken in Tijuana, Mexico, by the photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon of Reuters, spread rapidly online. It prompted outrage after a peaceful march by Central American migrants in Mexico veered out of control on Sunday afternoon, as hundreds of people tried to evade a Mexican police blockade and ran toward a border crossing into San Diego. In response to the chaos, which the Homeland Security secretary said included some migrants throwing projectiles at Customs and Border Protection workers, American border officials temporarily shut down the crossing in both directions and fired tear gas to push back migrants from the border fence. The photo drew anger from many over President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, harsh tactics and uncompromising policies. It also made its way onto the front pages of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New York Post and other publications. “I was quite surprised,” Mr. Kim said Monday of the strong response to that and other photographs he took at the march. “Whenever I’m on assignment, it’s natural to take good pictures, to tell a story,” he said in an interview. The woman in the photo, identified by BuzzFeed News as Maria Meza, told the online news site that she feels like crying whenever she looks at the image. “I felt sad, I was scared. I wanted to cry. That’s when I grabbed my daughters and ran,” Ms. Meza, 39, told BuzzFeed. “I thought my kids were going to die with me because of the gas we inhaled.” To some of those expressing outrage, the photograph offered evidence of what they say is the Trump administration’s draconian approach to immigration, including his response to a caravan of migrants, whom Mr. Trump has vilified without evidence, as well as immigrants and refugees fleeing violence in their homelands. Several Democratic lawmakers denounced the use of tear gas on vulnerable people. “Federal agents’ use of tear gas on innocent civilians, many of them children, at our southern border is a shocking and heavy-handed use of force that we must condemn and heavily scrutinize,” Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado said on Twitter. “Throwing tear gas at asylum seekers — many of whom are women and children — is a new low,” said Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin. Tear gas can cause burning in the eyes, nose and mouth, as well as on the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can also cause shortness of breath and a choking sensation. A large enough dose in a confined space can cause blindness and chemical burns, while studies suggest that tear gas has the potential to cause serious harm to vulnerable populations, including children. Mr. Kim said he was dispatched by Reuters to Mexico almost two weeks ago to cover the caravan. There, Mr. Kim found subjects in the caravan to follow and traveled with them to the American border. He was covering the march in Tijuana, near San Diego, on Sunday, his last day covering the caravan before returning to Japan, when a group of migrants broke away and rushed toward the United States border. A few men started digging around a border fence, he said, and within minutes officials with the United States Customs and Border Protection agency fired tear gas into the crowd. “Once tear gas was thrown behind the family, they started running,” according to Mr. Kim. In the photo, an American flag can be seen poking above a border wall in the background, with crowds of people clustered throughout. The smoking tear gas canister sits in a culvert to the left, behind the woman, who is wearing a shirt with characters from Disney’s “Frozen” on it, and the two children. One of the children is barefoot, while the other, who is clutching a plastic ball, would soon lose the sandals, too, according to Mr. Kim. A second photograph shows that child in tears, a reaction prompted, Mr. Kim said, by the tear gas and the pain of running barefoot. After the migrants who broke from the march retreated from the border, at least two dozen canisters of tear gas could be seen on the Mexican side of the border. Law enforcement used tear gas against migrants in at least two of the locations.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Revelations in a Wheelchair,"Opinion A recently disabled New York City photographer gets an education in the discrimination that people like him must face. A doctor examining the feet of the author. A lack of sensation can lead to injuries.CreditCreditPhotographs by Nolan Ryan Trowe Mr. Trowe is a photographer in New York. I’m a documentary photographer who was raised in California and now lives in New York, and I sometimes feel I’ve already lived two lives — but not because of the changes in geography I’ve experienced. A little more than two years ago, when I was 23, I suffered a spinal cord injury while cliff diving on the Yuba River in Northern California. In a matter of seconds, I became disabled. I was mostly paralyzed from the waist down, and began using a wheelchair. The doctors could not guarantee that I would walk again, but I persevered. A year later, I had regained some ability to move. I did not regain feeling in the lower half of my body, but I could walk again. That was when I moved to New York to attend school. The layout of the city pushed me to walk even more. I walked so much that the skin on one of my heels wore completely away (I still lacked the feeling to realize I had injured myself), and the doctor ordered me back to the wheelchair until my foot healed. I decided I would make the best of it by shooting photographs that would show people what New York looks like from a wheelchair. It started as a fun project, but it quickly evolved into something more when I began to notice how people treated me when I was in the chair. Many people out on the streets would automatically assume I was homeless, or that I was about to ask for money. Some would turn away from me; some would gawk. While some people showed me consideration and kindness, many did not. I found that when you are in a wheelchair in public, there’s rarely a middle ground. There’s never normalized space in that moment, or more generally, in society. I wanted to capture those moments in these photographs. One of my first days back in the chair, I decided to roll down Houston Street to meet a friend for coffee. It was a beautiful fall day. Autumn has always been my favorite time of the year; I feel the happiest then. I wanted to check the time on my phone, but it was out of power, so I rolled up to a young, well-dressed couple, a man and a woman, on the corner of Houston and Second Avenue. Looking up, I made eye contact with the man. His expression suddenly changed. He grasped the woman by the arm and moved away from me, muttering, “Sorry, we don’t have any money.” I grabbed my wheels and brought myself to a halt. In that moment I didn’t notice the trees with their yellow and red leaves. I didn’t notice the crisp air or the small white clouds in the blue sky or the colorful murals on the buildings. I noticed my cold hands. I noticed that my head hurt. I noticed nerve pain pulsing through my legs. I learned quickly that the lack of accessibility in the city’s subway system adds to the frustration and humiliation. Subway station elevators to the train platforms are frequently broken and there are often no accessible stations where I need to go. I am not supposed to walk, but at times I am forced to ask someone to carry my chair down or up the steps, while I make my way tentatively on foot, putting me at risk of further injury and infection. On the platform during rush hours, packed trains roll into the station, while dozens of riders crowd in front of the doors, waiting to cram themselves into a car. I am often unable to force my wheelchair into the mass of standing people. On many days, I wait for two or three trains before finding one that has space for me in the car. Once I’m inside people surround me from all angles. My view consists of elbows, buttocks, feet and hands clutching phones. Faces are mostly out of sight. The city estimates that there are nearly 100,000 wheelchair users in New York City. Fewer than one-quarter of city subway stations are accessible. Activist groups like the People’s M.T.A., the Center for Independence of the Disabled, New York, and Transportation Alternatives have been pressuring the city to make the transportation system usable by all. Sometimes it feels as though my previous life was a dream. I can barely remember what it was like to be able-bodied. The outline remains, but the details are missing. My experience has woken me up to the fact that rights for people with disabilities are far behind where they should be. It has given me a new vantage point, and a new appreciation for the many people with disabilities who must struggle to conduct their daily lives in a world that has not taken the steps to accommodate them.

2018,Review: 10 Glimpses of Twyla Tharp the Minimalist,"The choreographer Twyla Tharp has been a classicist, a modernist, a postmodernist — often at the same time — and maybe now and then a feminist and a Romantic, too. She also has a strong streak of the clown: tough, solemn-deadpan, with crazy timing, making a joke of how impossible things can be. Now, in “Minimalism and Me,” a production that began life last year in Chicago, and which is currently at the Joyce for four weeks — with six Tharp dancers, some old films and photographs, and 10 other people playing onstage audience members — Tharp reminds us that she was once a minimalist. It’s evident that this was just an early phase: Minimalism wasn’t big enough to contain a temperament with her streaks of rococo excess and genre crossover, but she wryly tells us that her work from then on had to do with “less is more,” as she takes us through 10 works she made from 1965 to ’71. Increasingly since the 1980s, Ms. Tharp has become a memoirist, too — in writing, on TV (using film of her earlier work) and in live performance. Reading from a lectern onstage, she narrates the first half of this show, a retrospective of her first seven years of making dances. In her earliest work, “Tank Dive” (1965), she stayed in motionless dance positions for whole minutes while Petula Clark’s “Downtown” played; she now connects this to the painters Barnett Newman and Frank Stella, whose studios were close to the loft where she lived at the time, on Franklin Street in New York. Minimalism is her starting point; “Me” (or at least her work) is her main fascination. Yet she is our most obvious problem here: Her way of talking mixes seriousness and comedy in an awkward amalgam and in vocal tones that lack any spontaneity. Both her vocal delivery and her dances get laughs at some unlikely moments, while some of her funniest lines elicit no reaction. And, though she’s keen to demonstrate the creative sophistication she quickly built up in the 1960s, she seems to be rewatching her early work impatiently, with the fast-forward button. The excerpts are fascinating but, until we reach 1970, too brief. By 1968, she was famous enough to be included in what has become an often-reproduced Jack Mitchell photograph of eight modern-dance artists of several generations: Martha Graham at its center, and featuring José Limón, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Don Redlich, Yvonne Rainer and the youngest, Ms. Tharp. In excerpts from the late-1960s — there are snippets of original-cast film, too — you see the emergence of Tharpian style. This included the shrug, the shimmy, the wriggle. When I first experienced her work, in 1980, it was the most kinesthetically intoxicating dance style I’d ever experienced. It is not Ms. Tharp’s task to make connections between herself and other choreographers of her time, but that photograph is not the only reason many of us will do so. Taylor’s 1950s experimental pieces, not least “3 Epitaphs” (1956), seem to have been an influence, and when we see the different solos coinciding in one space, we’re likely to think of Cunningham. These early works, and that Tharpian style itself, all have a pronounced kinship to Ms. Rainer’s development of “democratic dance” (non-virtuoso movement related to the everyday). We see only half of the 20-minute work “The Fugue” (1970) at the Joyce, but that’s enough to show why she considers it her real Opus 1. (It’s the earliest work she has regularly revived.) An arrangement of 20th-century tap-related movement sequences in baroque-type musical structures — less a single fugue than a series of mini-fugues, with no music than the sound made by the dancers’ hands and shoes — it made her the formal classicist of her generation. But its blend of seeming informality and objectivity has always looked related to other dances from her generation, like Ms. Rainer’s “Trio A” (1966) and Trisha Brown’s “Opal Loop” (1980). Its first cast was made up of three women. (Viewers saw it as women’s liberation onstage.) B y the time I first saw it in 1980, it had three men, but other combinations have been used. On Wednesday, it was danced by Kara Chan, Kellie Drobnick and Reed Tankersley — elegantly, exactly, charmingly. I find these dancers somewhat slick when I compare them to the Tharp stylists I watched in the 1980s, but that’s not a new complaint: Today’s Tharp dancers, almost too accomplished in lines and rhythms, lack the juicy, weighty texture that emanated from their predecessors’ whole body language. That’s true also of the one full piece shown here, “Eight Jelly Rolls” (1971), the first piece she made to fit its musical accompaniment (old jazz recordings by Jelly Roll Morton and Charles Luke), and one of her greatest comedies. Since Ms. Tharp has staged this with the assistance of Sara Rudner, the greatest of Ms. Tharp’s collaborators — I was lucky to see them both in this work and others — trouble has certainly been taken. Here, too, men now have some of the originally female roles. There are marvelously right moments, as when Ron Todorowski suddenly suspends a gesture of both arms in midair; Ms. Tharp’s drastic contrasts of dynamics are often brilliant. This “Eight Jelly Rolls” — its dancers dressed in white, replacing the previous black — is alive, if lightweight. I’m glad today’s audience can see it. It’s immediately followed by a new encore that Ms. Tharp has added: a Jelly Roll sequel of sorts in which she dances, too, in her consciously eccentric way. The main joke is that she’s chasing to keep up. I’d like to join in the applause for this flimsy footnote: She’s in good shape, and it ought to be fun to see her back in clown mode. Perhaps the comedy will click into focus as the Joyce run continues.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A 92-Year-Old’s ‘Endgame’ Opera Is Patiently Perfect,"Critic’s Pick MILAN — In the middle of Samuel Beckett’s bleak but endlessly wry play “Endgame,” a character tells a joke about a man who goes to the tailor to get a pair of pants. The tailor dithers and dawdles, making one tiny change at a time. Finally, the customer explodes: God made the world in six days, he screams, “and you are not bloody well capable of making me a pair of trousers in three months!” The tailor answers, “But, my dear sir, my dear sir, look” — with a disdainful gesture — “at the world, and look” — lovingly, proudly — “at my trousers!” The punch line had extra relish at the Teatro alla Scala here in Milan on Thursday when “Fin de Partie,” the eminent Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag’s operatic adaptation of “Endgame,” had its long, long-awaited premiere. Mr. Kurtag, 92, has taken a protracted path to this patiently, perfectly tailored work, his first opera. [Read our profile of Mr. Kurtag.] Over the past decade, we were told time and again that the opening was coming. Time and again, the pants were not quite ready. “Fin de Partie,” based on Beckett’s original French version of the play, became the white whale of contemporary music. As Mr. Kurtag turned 85, then 90, we could be forgiven for quietly fearing it would never be finished. And it wouldn’t, perhaps, have been too much of a surprise if it hadn’t been: A master of miniatures, best known for collections of pieces a few dozen seconds each, Mr. Kurtag had stubbornly resisted the idea of working on a vaster canvas. But Beckett had already provided him with vital inspiration for other works over the years. And “Endgame” — its text, like Mr. Kurtag’s classics, an assemblage of small self-sufficiencies surrounded by space — was an apt partner for what the play calls “the prolonged creative effort.” If Mr. Kurtag felt uncertain about how to sustain his gnomic style over a two-hour span, it’s undetectable in an opera that, even constructed as a series of discrete “scenes and monologues,” unfolds with the confidence — the paradoxically unsettled serenity — of his best music. He can revel in mood, color and agile, even raucous, rhythms because there is barely a plot to convey. A sick man in a wheelchair (Hamm), his companion (Clov), his father (Nagg) and his mother (Nell) recall the joys and sorrows of the past and curse the indignities of the present and future. That’s all; that’s everything. Shuffling around nervously, Clov (the robustly gruff baritone Leigh Melrose) is characterized in jittery blots of music, as if he consists entirely of punctuation marks. The orchestra quietly trembles under the bass Frode Olsen’s more authoritative roars as Hamm. Old Nagg (the tenor Leonardo Cortellazzi) and Nell (the contralto Hilary Summers), stuffed by Beckett into side-by-side ashcans, exist in a sphere of ethereal nostalgia and thread-thin high notes that Ms. Summers, in particular, spins with the eerie softness of elderly skin. Though spare, Mr. Kurtag’s music isn’t severe. The string sound has been pared back, so the ensemble feels transparent and winds-heavy, with an airy chamber-music intimacy, whipping occasionally into passionate outpourings and embroidered here and there with the coppery twang of cimbalom. The vocal line is often mirrored in the orchestra, giving a feeling of purity, coherence and deceptive simplicity. (There is nothing simple about it.) There are echoes of Monteverdi in the piece’s declamatory, text-forward quality; Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande,” in its atmospheric ambiguity; Berg’s “Wozzeck,” in its episodic structure and concentrated expression. Glistening and nimble, the Scala orchestra is conducted by Markus Stenz, who leads an exceptionally delicate score — its balances and pauses fragile and exposed — with naturalness and a sense of spontaneity. Pierre Audi’s staging provides some of the physical comedy Beckett intended, while slyly inverting the play’s scenic indications. Rather than looking out from an interior, the characters here are outside a small, grim house, looking in. (The designer is Christof Hetzer.) The house, partly overhung by the shells of yet larger structures, rotates with each scene change; Hamm, in turn, rotates in his wheelchair. It is a little solar system onstage, a theater of the cosmos. I had worried that Mr. Kurtag would stint the music-hall roots of Beckett’s dramaturgy, but bits of accordion and whistles peep out from the orchestra, faraway glimpses of vaudeville. The opera extracts roughly half of the play, meaning we lose some of the slapstick circularity; what’s gained is starkness, each episode standing in harsh isolation. We lose, too, the full depth of the relationship — defined by Beckettian repetition — between Hamm and Clov. So the opera’s final scene of simultaneous separation and togetherness, while powerful, doesn’t quite break your heart. Nagg and Nell, their music luminous, are now the emotional center — appropriate for a work that is, if not quite autobiographical, then at least resonant on the subject of growing old alongside one’s mate. (Mr. Kurtag’s wife of more than 70 years, Marta, has long been his close collaborator in composition and performance.) “Fin de Partie” is a farewell not just to a life and a marriage, but also to a whole culture. Mr. Kurtag is one of the last who remain of the generation of avant-garde composers that came of age during World War II and in its wake: Boulez, Ligeti, Henze, Stockhausen, Schnittke. Even if the great final scene equivocates — modernism is always on the verge of leaving, it seems to say, yet it is also always here to stay — the opera, drawn from a play that Mr. Kurtag saw in Paris as a young man, is truly goodbye to all that. It’s a world that ends, in his telling, with both a bang and a whimper: apocalyptic brass chords alternating with a hushed stillness, off which rises a mist of cimbalom and suspended cymbal. This kind of quick transition from seizure to stillness is a characteristically Kurtagian move, as in the final of his six “Moments Musicaux” for string quartet, from 2005, when a sudden ripping roar fades to a faint march, pricked by an even fainter violin. It is a gesture that challenges the very notion of an ending. And Mr. Kurtag may not be done yet; he has mulled filling in some of the gaps he has left in creating the “Fin de Partie” libretto. Future presentations — the work travels next to Amsterdam, in March — may well set more of the play’s text. But it by no means feels curtailed in its current form. Look at our world, indeed, then look at this exquisite opera, a miracle of dedication, craft and care. This, as Clov says near the end of the piece, is what we call making an exit.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: A Balanchine Festival, With Masterpieces in Safe Hands","A sense of momentousness charged the air on Wednesday night when New York City Ballet performed “Symphony in C.” That 1947 masterpiece by George Balanchine is a staple of the company’s repertory, so the big deal wasn’t the performance so much as where it was happening: not at the company’s decades-old Lincoln Center home, but at New York City Center. The occasion was the first program of “Balanchine: The City Center Years,” a major festival, running through Sunday, that the theater has organized as part of a season celebrating its own 75th anniversary as an institution. The historical echoes were large. “Symphony in C” came last, a foolproof finale. It doesn’t just provoke applause, though. It inspires conversion. When Jerome Robbins attended the first performance of City Ballet, at New York City Center in 1948, he was already an in-demand choreographer, in ballet and on Broadway. But “Symphony in C” moved him to put that at risk and offer his services and devotion to the fledging troupe. It’s had a similar effect on many others. It was on a program that inspired Morton Baum, the businessman who was chairman of City Center’s finance committee in 1948, to offer Balanchine a home, leading to the creation of City Ballet. It’s hard to overstate the importance of that offer in the history of ballet and of the arts in America. It gave Balanchine, the Russian choreographer who had been brought to America by Lincoln Kirstein in 1933, the security of an official (if not yet well-funded) institution. In 1964, the company would move to a larger theater created for it at Lincoln Center. Yet the City Center years were crucial, not just for the astonishing variety and power of the works Balanchine choreographed, but also for the consolidation and expansion of his American style of classicism and the preservation of what he had accomplished before 1948. To commemorate all this, City Center wanted to throw a big, fancy party of a festival, and to make the party big and fancy it has concentrated on the guest list. Eight companies are participating, an attention-getting representation of the world’s greatest ones, including the Paris Opera Ballet, the Mariinsky from Russia and the Royal Ballet from England. Four companies perform on each of the festival’s six programs, presenting a total of 13 works. That’s a logistical achievement. But scheduling must have determined a lot of the programming, and which pieces to present. Those choices raise questions: What do the guests bring to the party? And is that more important than thematic considerations? Does the starry celebration get in the way of showing what was important about Balanchine’s years at City Center? Opening night provided some clues. The evening began with “Serenade,” the first work that Balanchine choreographed in America, in 1934. A beloved, enduring dance, ingenious in construction, elusive in its hints of story, it establishes so much of the promise of what he would do here. And performing it, Miami City Ballet proved that it belongs in the festival. An offshoot of City Ballet, the Miami company understands what Balanchine discovered and taught: how exactitude needn’t sacrifice warmth; how even in Romanticism, rhythmic accuracy allows momentum to build. As the company in which Balanchine was raised, the Mariinsky arguably belongs in the festival too. “Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux,” a 1960 supercharging of Russian tradition, is a show-off vehicle, and Kimin Kim, a Korean star with a modest manner, made the audience gasp with softly powered jumps that hung in the air. His partner, Viktoria Tereshkina, was lovely, correct and coy in a slightly haughty Russian manner, but I couldn’t help but miss the exciting sense of risk that City Ballet dancers bring to this piece. Comparisons of style would seem to be a benefit of the multiple-company approach, but only “Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux” will be performed (on Thursday) by members of another troupe, Anna Rose O’Sullivan and Marcelino Sambé of the Royal Ballet. On Wednesday, they danced “Tarantella,” another workout duet, but in ballet-Neopolitan style, with tambourines. Since it’s the final piece that Balanchine choreographed at City Center, there’s some justification for its inclusion, but the cute, too careful performance of Ms. O’Sullivan and Mr. Sambé had me thinking about more works that didn’t make the cut — ballets harder to stage but more important. “Symphony in C” stirs no such doubts. And City Ballet, dancing it, demonstrated what it means to have Balanchine style in your bones. Tiler Peck, leading the first movement, showed what pouncing on top of the rhythm is all about, and Sara Mearns, gliding through the second, revealed how much tragic emotion can be conveyed through musical dancing. That’s especially apparent at City Center, where the audience is much closer to the dancers than at Lincoln Center. It’s easier to see faces, prompting thoughts about how important they are or aren’t. When the whole huge cast fills the stage at the unbeatable end of “Symphony in C,” they really fill it at City Center, giving a different perspective on how Balanchine’s choreography can activate space. Seeing City Ballet dance “Symphony in C” at City Center does give something you can’t quite get at Lincoln Center. But the main emotional impact is the same as ever, shaded with gratitude. Balanchine made the dance for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947. It might have inspired France to offer him a home. Instead City Center did. And we got Balanchine.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Baroque Start to the New York Philharmonic’s Holiday,"The holiday season began at the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday, with the crisp snap of strings and the dignified mellow blare of horns. Christmastime is associated with Baroque music — “Messiah,” the “Brandenburg” Concertos — and the orchestra was happy to oblige, with a program of Handel and Rameau at David Geffen Hall. Leading the polished, if muted, festivities from the harpsichord was Emmanuelle Haïm, a French conductor making her Philharmonic debut. A specialist in this repertory, with an instinct for the crucial balance between energy and eloquence, she has given me two of my most memorable opera performances in recent years, Rameau’s “Hippolyte et Aricie” in Paris in 2012 and a thrillingly vigorous rendition of Handel’s “Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno” at the Aix Festival in 2016. As with many conductors who concentrate on early music, Ms. Haïm makes the strongest impression at the podium of the period ensemble she founded (Le Concert d’Astrée, formed in 2000). But she has become a go-to leader for modern orchestras making once- or twice-a-year forays into the early 18th century and thereabouts. You can’t turn the New York Philharmonic into Le Concert d’Astrée in a few days of rehearsal, nor would you want to. Reduced to about 30 players for this program, the Philharmonic obviously uses modern instruments and has sacrificed none of its rich vibrato to conform precisely to Baroque style. Yet it played on Wednesday with lean grace in Handel’s Concerto Grosso in G (Op. 6, No. 1); the first and third of his “Water Music” suites; and selections from Rameau’s opera “Dardanus.” What was lacking was spirit, texture, variety. The Philharmonic went gamely through the motions of the Baroque, but there was little surprise or delight, essential in this repertory. The Handel pieces, radiating good cheer, were smoothed over, lacking in contrast; there was more color and range of mood in the 35-minute Rameau suite Ms. Haïm compiled, but also no sustained flair or danciness. Tempos were basically moderate; I kept wanting more headlong vitality in intense passages, and more luxuriance at moments of slow melancholy. There was the sense of falling between stools I’ve often perceived when big symphonies have approached the Baroque: They’re not willing to go for the full-orchestra, Technicolor, often delicious arrangements that were in vogue in the middle of last century, but neither are they able to conjure the dizzying freshness with which specialist ensembles like Le Concert d’Astrée have spoiled us. On offer, in any case, is a pretty, pleasant program — certainly nothing to challenge the steady digestion of Thanksgiving turkey and mashed potatoes this weekend.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Cast Change Adds Suspense to the Met Opera’s ‘Pearl Fishers’,"Opera is an art form awash with preposterous endings. If there were a competition, Bizet’s “Les Pêcheurs de Perles” (“The Pearl Fishers”), which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday night, would win the Could Not Be Bothered Prize. Two men, friends since childhood, love the virgin priestess Leïla, who is sworn to chastity. But she falls for one of them,the hunter Nadir, and a terrible storm pummels the village of pearl fishers. So Zurga, a local leader, condemns his friend and Leïla to death. But then! Zurga has a better idea. He sets fire to his village so Nadir and Leïla can escape. They seem as confused as the audience at this point, but Zurga only tells them to be on their way and settles down to wait for the police to arrive. Curtain. Even Penny Woolcock’s intelligent production, set in a tsunami-prone shantytown in Sri Lanka, can’t paper over the musical flaws of this musically luscious opera. And yet tension crackled on Wednesday — thanks to a mid-performance cast change that provided the suspense that had eluded Bizet. When this production opened in 2015, the love triangle consisted of Diana Damrau as Leïla, Matthew Polenzani as Nadir and Mariusz Kwiecien as Zurga. Of these three, only Mr. Kwiecien, a coolly charismatic baritone, has returned. He sounded solid in the first half, even if one note broke into a wobble and, at moments, his voice boomed more than it soared. After the intermission, it was announced that Mr. Kwiecien had fallen ill and would be replaced by his understudy, Alexander Birch Elliott. Mr. Elliott is 32. This was his Met debut. Zurga’s first appearance after the break comes after Leïla and Nadir have been canoodling under a religious shrine, heedless of the nearby armed guard. Zurga enters after they have been discovered, as an angry mob gathers under a menacing sky. Against this tableau, Mr. Elliott’s first notes sounded forlorn. That all changed in the next scene, which finds Zurga pacing the floor of his office, chewing over his friend’s betrayal. Mr. Elliott tore into the music with heated intensity, his voice a beguiling timbre of mahogany carried by boyish ardor. When he was done, the audience cheered. There were bumps here and there in the coordination between Mr. Elliott and the conductor, Emmanuel Villaume, but none that could detract from a thrilling debut. The tenor Javier Camarena, as Nadir, and the soprano Pretty Yende, as Leïla, returned to a house that has grown justifiably fond of them in recent years. Mr. Camarena’s role calls for a tenor who is not just able to reach the heights of the range but can make his home there. He does so comfortably, even if his voice sometimes hardens to a metallic sheen. His rendition of the exquisite aria “Je crois entendre encore” didn’t quite have the silken interiority of Mr. Polenzani’s 2015 performance, but it was a marvelous tribute to Bizet’s melodic genius. And with the embattled Mr. Kwiecien before his departure, he brought great heaps of lyricism and pathos to the bromance duet “Au fond du temple saint.” In the role of Leïla, suppressed erotic longing is sublimated into pure vocalism lavishly ornamented with arabesques and grace notes. Ms. Yende’s singing has itself much of that birdlike quality, her pert and fresh soprano seeming to alight on each note with dainty precision. The Met chorus sounded splendid. Only at the end did a strange lethargy seem to overcome its members, who slunk away rather than ran from the planned execution to save their children from burning houses. Somehow, these villagers seemed to know that the fire was just a ruse to make them clear out and bring the opera to an end.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Chic but Dull ‘Tenant’ With James Whiteside,"Apartment life can be a nightmare. You move into a new place and discover something left by the previous tenant, reminding you that the place isn’t new at all — that you might have inherited someone else’s problems. And the neighbors! You can’t be quiet enough for them. If you so much as walk, they start banging on the walls. It could drive a person crazy. That’s what happens to the main character in “The Tenant,” a 90-minute dance-drama that had its premiere at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday. Except that this story is rather more extreme. The previous tenant killed herself. And the new tenant, played by the American Ballet Theater star James Whiteside, moves not just into her room but all the way into her persona and pain. This, in other words, is a psychological thriller — like the Roland Topor novel on which it is based or the more famous (and love-it-or-hate-it campy) 1976 Roman Polanski film adaptation. Directed and choreographed by Arthur Pita, it is chic, well made and impressive in just about all aspects except the ones that matter most. It’s hard to imagine anyone reading the novel or watching the movie and thinking, “This needs to be a dance!” Apart from the suicide — a balcony leap — the story is unusually low on dramatic action. For long stretches of this “Tenant,” it can seem that all Mr. Whiteside does is undress and dress, go to sleep and wake up. This isn’t dull, though. The dancing is. In that discrepancy lies what’s right and wrong about the production, its shiny skill and its fatal flaw. So many of the ingredients are high grade. Mr. Whiteside is a gorgeous dancer with more than enough star power to carry a show. He gives this one his all (and bares it all, too). As the previous tenant, his Ballet Theater colleague Cassandra Trenary is gutsy and explosive, beautiful and touching even when trying to do herself in. Kibrea Carmichael, as a woman Mr. Whiteside brings home for some acrobatic sex, is exceptionally striking. Their versatility is topped by that of the composer, Frank Moon. Visible beside the stage, he plays late-night jazz and spooky chords on the piano, switching to violin, jaw harp or high-pitched vocals to regulate the mood expertly. The sound of breaking glass in his score is the production’s most artful device of suspense. Scene to scene, Mr. Pita’s direction is sure-handed and clear, adeptly doling out thumping from unseen neighbors to bring on madness. But whenever the dancing starts, the tension drops. The strongest section, choreographically, comes near the end, when Ms. Trenary reprises the suicide dance that starts the show, and Mr. Whiteside, now dressed as her, replicates it a few seconds behind. For a moment, the dancing reveals something about the story that only dancing can. But most of the choreography seems superfluous and jumbled, its strained attempts at psychological extremity at odds with its show-off dance effects and the narrative’s established naturalism. The elements don’t cohere, especially not Mr. Pita’s is-that-supposed-to-be-funny surrealism, like the Little Dutch Boy lawn ornament that belches smoke. Throughout “The Tenant,” the lingering question just grows louder: Why was it made? Although it is set in the near future, it struck me as oddly retrograde. More than tension, what rises is a suspicion that the true justification and purpose for the work is merely to allow Mr. Whiteside to go full frontal and wear a dress. And aren’t there simpler ways, in 2018, to do that?",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Hip-Hop Sidekick Eyes Center Stage in ‘Hype Man’,"As important as they can be to a hip-hop act, hype men are supporting characters: They are there to valorize the M.C. and are meant to stay in their lane. A few, like Jay-Z, went on to fame but mostly nobody ever thought Flavor Flav had more to say than Chuck D in Public Enemy. What happens when one of these sidekicks steps forward sets in motion the plot of “Hype Man: a break beat play,” Idris Goodwin’s likable but overstuffed new show at the Flea Theater in Manhattan. For years, Verb (Shakur Tolliver) and his best friend, Pinnacle (Matt Stango), have had an arrangement: Pinnacle rhymes, and Verb gets the crowd going. This works for both of them, but left unsaid is that the presence of Verb, who is black, legitimizes Pinnacle, who is white. In the middle is their beatmaker, Peep One (Tay Bass), a woman of mixed race — in this show, you don’t have to squint too hard to read messages. Just as they are about to hit the big time with an appearance on “The Tonight Show,” Verb is shaken by an instance of police brutality, in which a black teenager is shot 18 times. Usually a party-happy guy, he wants to take a stand on national television. Peep One and Pinnacle are less than thrilled. “This is our introduction to a lot of new people,” she says. “Probably shouldn’t come out the gates making political statements.” Verb pays them no heed, and his action upsets the professional and personal relationships that bind the trio. Mr. Goodwin (“This Is Modern Art”) packs in a lot of ideas and not enough connective tissue, leading to abrupt transitions and a rushed feeling. Peep One feels especially underwritten as she explains her desire to be a role model for aspiring female hip-hop producers and tries to placate the two men. Mostly she feels like a bystander in the central conflict. The show is more interested in race than in gender anyway. Pinnacle grandstands about growing up in a rough neighborhood, but he is oblivious to the built-in advantages his race has given him, and does not show much empathy for his friend’s politicization. “I don’t have a viewpoint on it,” Pinnacle says of the killing. “Verb got a viewpoint. He should write it. Oh that’s right — he can’t!” Unfortunately, Mr. Goodwin does not fully explore the complicated relationship between a hype man and an M.C., especially when they’re of different colors. Pinnacle had started marginalizing Verb on creative grounds even before the “Tonight Show” caper; on a larger scale, American entertainment has a long history of sticking people of color in supporting roles designed mainly to make a white star shine brighter. The parallels do not appear to have occurred to Pinnacle. The production, staged by Kristan Seemel and the Flea’s artistic director, Niegel Smith, zips along, at least. Mr. Stango gives Pinnacle an appropriately weaselly mien, and Mr. Tolliver has a confident swagger that is effective when Verb is goofing off as much as when he’s raging. And when the trio gets cranking on musical numbers — Mr. Goodwin is also an M.C. with several releases under his belt, while Wendell Hanes composed the earworms — you won’t need a hype man’s injunctions to put your hands up in the air.

2018,Review: A Rare Staging Finds the Magic in Schumann’s ‘Faust’,"Critic’s Pick HAMBURG — One reason Schumann’s “Scenes From Goethe’s ‘Faust’” is so rarely performed is its hybrid shape: part literary oratorio, part opera. Another handicap is his selections. While other composers drawn to Goethe’s tragedy about a dissatisfied man who makes a pact with the devil have focused on the dark scenes from Part I — Faust’s ruinous love for Gretchen and the destructive vortex of events wrought by Mephistopheles — Schumann set his sights on the epilogue in heaven. Here Goethe imagines a metaphysical tug-of-war over Faust’s soul that zooms toward redemption in a way that is brainy, sublime and devilishly hard to stage. An entrancing new production by Achim Freyer for the Hamburg State Opera, though, argues that it’s well worth trying. Mr. Freyer, an artist and director with a penchant for dense symbolism, takes a restrained approach to this overlooked gem. He conjures a world that, for all its surreal touches, has a zany beauty that gently smooths over Schumann’s dramatic flaws. Mr. Freyer places the orchestra, choir, children’s chorus and most of the soloists on stage behind a black scrim. In front of the scrim, atop where the orchestra pit has been covered, actors in dark clothes and green faces move in slow motion, carrying and rearranging objects: a tin drum, a cutout of a church, the blue flower that was a key symbol of German Romanticism. Between scrim and covered pit, blocking the audience’s view of the conductor, is a stylized copy of “The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog,” Caspar David Friedrich’s painting of a man, seen from behind, looking out over swirling mists. Mr. Freyer’s “Wanderer,” though, is missing its head. By stepping behind the copy, Mr. Gerhaher’s Faust could merge with the painted seeker — either while gazing through the scrim toward the dark mystery of music, or out at the detritus of life and, beyond, the judgment of the audience. As with so many classic works of Romanticism, Friedrich’s image came to be co-opted by the Nazis as a symbol of national exceptionalism. Thus the duality in Faust — knowledge and destruction — blends with the duality of the Romantic mountaineer who is the model of, simultaneously, contemplation and conquest. The shadowy stage workers creep about cradling objects that sometimes seed a wealth of associations and sometimes pull into focus a narrative thread dropped by Schumann. A fragment of Goethe’s color wheel, a kabbalistic tetragram, and two dwarves with a Snow White apple all appear and vanish. But in Schumann’s most operatic scene, in which Gretchen prays in church, plagued by guilt, a pantomime of props tells the full story. Bloodied rags, a naked baby doll, and a pair of wings remind the audience that the desperate Gretchen killed her illegitimate child in desperation. Schumann assembles that scene brilliantly, with the solo soprano (here the glowingly effusive Christina Gansch) offset by a churning orchestra, taunted by Mephisto (Franz-Josef Selig, singing with kid-glove sarcasm). Soon the choir muscles in with a ferocious “Dies irae.” The composer wields his large forces in a way that doesn’t overpower individual voices or the text. In the magisterial baritone Christian Gerhaher he found an interpreter able to let Goethe’s densely brilliant lines shine through the music. Mr. Gerhaher has the power to project clarion vigor where needed. But more often his voice seems to become a vehicle for the words, with some passages delivered with a tone so lightened of vibrato that it approached the near-spoken style more commonly heard in modernist works. In the latter part of the evening, when he embodied the allegorical Dr. Marianus, whose worship of the Holy Virgin paves the way for Faust’s redemption, Mr. Gerhaher’s voice turned velvet and weightless. The final apotheosis is a magnificent blend of soloists, choir and orchestra that pays homage to Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy.” By then Mr. Freyer’s objects had been abstracted into geometric shapes of pure color, while video projections of the faces of Faust and Gretchen drifted upward on the scrim. It would have been nice to lift that scrim for the applause, which the ensemble musicians rightfully shared with the soloists. The conductor Kent Nagano, who had led a burnished reading of the exquisite score, came to the front for his bow. But the choir and orchestra remained partially obscured in Mr. Freyer’s realm of music and mystery.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Rediscovered Symphony Radiates Cosmic Grandeur,"Critic’s Pick Julius Eastman died destitute in 1990, but his Symphony No. 2 inhabits a world of plenty. He composed this work, which received a belated premiere on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall, as a parting gift to a lover in 1983. By then Eastman had been evicted from his home — his scores stacked on the curb along with the rest of his things — and had become acquainted with New York City’s park benches and shelters. Somehow, he still composed music of cosmic grandeur. A familiarity with the biography of Eastman — black, gay, emotionally vulnerable — is not necessary to appreciate his music, which can be ceremonial, cunning and brash. Still, it was hard not to listen for hints of instability during the exciting performance on Tuesday by the Mannes Orchestra, led by Luciano Chessa, who also edited the score. [Read about the rediscovery of Eastman’s Symphony No. 2.] Yes, the work ends abruptly, on a handful of exhausted staccato notes. And embedded in a texture of spendthrift immensity — stacked with extra tubas, contrabassoons, bass clarinets and 24 timpani — individual voices sound frightfully naked. But what’s most striking is the composer’s command of these monstrous forces. The work opens with unison strings tracing a meandering line at a ritualistic pace. A dull, dissonant chord releases a dark haze, and from there on the music proceeds in an opposition between human gait and atmospheric forces. For much of the work’s duration, the timpani keep up a low, ominous rumble. When they ratchet up the volume, the sound rises like a tsunami that temporarily submerges everything else in darkness. The end is carried by low wind instruments playing at the upper edge of their comfort zone, where the sound grows reedy and tense. The feeling that lingered for me as the audience erupted in applause was one of sacrifice, or at least surrender. The concert opened with Sarah Kirkland Snider’s “Something for the Dark,” which also approaches sound as a vast, malleable substance. In this sophisticated piece, repetition transforms the emotional charge of musical motifs. A turn of phrase may appear pretty at first, then take on shades of nostalgia before registering as a creepy obsession haunting the ear. Ms. Snider skillfully draws a wide arc, with throbbing brass accents and slashing chords driving up tension. The work ends quietly, as if on a question. The evening ended with an inspired performance of Einojuhani Rautavaara’s Symphony No. 3, a work from 1960 that uncannily manages to use serial technique in a way that sounds like Bruckner. The fine orchestra, led here, as in Ms. Snider’s work, by its music director, David Hayes, beautifully brought out the symphony’s Neo-Romantic textures and sweeping melodies. The Scherzo, including hard-driving passages and a terrifying crescendo up to a cliff’s-edge silence, spoke of the players’ courage and trust in Mr. Hayes. For me, the quality of this student orchestra was as much a revelation as the dark brilliance of Eastman’s rediscovered work.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: A Sensational Prison Escape, Without the Sensation","You’re serving a long sentence, and if you want freedom, you’ll need to take matters into your own hands. It’s the plot of “Escape at Dannemora,” and it’s also the experience of watching it. The escape of the convicted murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat from the Clinton Correctional Facility in 2015, aided by the prison employee Joyce Mitchell, captured the imagination because of its sensationalistic elements: a desperate manhunt in the forests and fields of upstate New York that ended in violent death, accompanied by lurid reports of prison sex. It was the stuff great B movies are made of. That’s not what the writers Brett Johnson, Michael Tolkin and Jerry Stahl and the director Ben Stiller have made in “Escape at Dannemora,” a seven-hour mini-series that begins Sunday on Showtime. (Johnson and Tolkin are credited as the show’s creators.) It doesn’t have the energy or excitement of a B picture, though it does, despite its general somberness, manage to feel exploitative. Set mostly inside the state penitentiary where Matt (Benicio Del Toro) and Sweat (Paul Dano) plan their escape and have furtive couplings with the discontented Mitchell (a thoroughly deglamorized Patricia Arquette), their supervisor in the prison tailor shop, “Dannemora” is a series of misses — a not very thrilling thriller, a social-problem story that lacks conviction, a satire without teeth. A lot of conscientious effort has gone into reconstructing events and rendering the small-town settings, and “Dannemora” works sufficiently well as a ticktock account of the story. Del Toro and especially Dano are good in the prison scenes, conveying Matt’s relaxed mastery of the system and Sweat’s quiet anguish. Stiller, directing his first full-on drama, presents the routines and milieus of the prison convincingly, though he indulges in the occasional superfluous tracking shot or odd camera angle. Less credible is the show’s treatment of Mitchell and her loyal husband, Lyle (Eric Lange). The show tries to put her actions in a context of rural economic malaise and male entitlement, but it mostly condescends to her, and Lyle comes off as a hapless bumpkin. (Matt and Sweat, by comparison, are soulful poètes maudits.) Whether on their own or at Stiller’s direction, both Arquette and Lange adopt exaggerated, “Fargo”-style accents that are a major distraction. There’s an overall sense of self-consciousness to “Dannemora,” of reining in — as if the creative team were unwilling (or unable) to exploit the story’s naturally pulpy essence, but also were unwilling to fully explore its possibilities for uncomfortable humor. (Tolkin, author of the screenplays for “The Player” and “The New Age,” is no stranger to satire.) Stiller supplies a lot of handsome images, but the series doesn’t supply a point of view, beyond a curious propensity to emulate a 1970s television crime movie in its fonts, music and cinematography. The atmosphere of artifice is compounded by a late device that fills in — at great length and in grisly detail — how Matt and Sweat ended up in the penitentiary (and how Mitchell ended up working there). It’s an art-house touch, and it’s also a narrative and thematic expedience: After spending most of its time depicting the escapees in a generally sympathetic light, the series pauses to remind us, “Hey, they’re killers,” in time for the sad finale. Watching the series in one sitting, as a critic is likely to do, is daunting, but it might be the better approach. In a seven-hour session, the series takes on an epic quality, keeping you interested on a narrative level at least; week to week, the individual episodes won’t necessarily deliver enough to make you want to come back. “Dannemora,” like the escape it portrays, is a meticulously planned and executed operation that doesn’t go anywhere.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Sex Scandal Upends a Campaign in ‘The Front Runner’,"Senator Gary Hart’s second presidential campaign began on April 13, 1987, with an idealistic oration amid the natural grandeur of Red Rocks, Colo. It ended a little more than three weeks later in a Denver hotel ballroom with a bitter excoriation of the press and the political process. Between those two speeches, rumors about Hart’s extramarital escapades — in particular his association with a former model named Donna Rice — overshadowed his efforts to articulate a new agenda for the Democratic Party. The swift collapse of Hart’s candidacy (not including his short-lived, inconsequential attempt to revive it a few months later) is the subject of “The Front Runner,” Jason Reitman’s busy, bossy new film. A number of recent movies have taken a heroic view of the press, in particular the old-fashioned, printed-on-paper kind. “Spotlight” and “The Post,” for instance, depict journalists as tribunes of civic righteousness. “The Front Runner,” based on a book by Matt Bai, a former writer for The New York Times Magazine, takes a dimmer view of the fourth estate. It belongs to the accusatory tradition of “Ace in the Hole,” “Network” and “Absence of Malice,” movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering. Hart himself, played with sober, dignified charisma and a saving flash of wit by Hugh Jackman, is presented onscreen much as he presented himself at the time: as a serious, cerebral politician uncomfortable with the kind of personal display a modern national campaign seems to demand. Handsome and thoughtful, the senator is a rugged intellectual, conversant in the minutiae of policy and the grand themes of literature. He lends a reporter his dog-eared copy of “War and Peace.” He scores a clean bull’s-eye at a county fair ax-throwing competition. He has his flaws, though. The question “The Front Runner” poses is whether those flaws, which have less to do with lust than with stubbornness and pride, should have cost the nation the chance of a Hart presidency. Following the argument of Bai’s book, Reitman, who wrote the screenplay with Bai and Jay Carson, depicts his hero as a man struggling to protect his privacy and that of his family against the predatory prurience of the news media. After a prologue set in 1984, when Hart made an unexpectedly strong primary run against Walter Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee (defeated by Ronald Reagan in a general-election landslide), the movie starts out as a brisk procedural full of nifty period details and lively, nose-to-the-grindstone performances. Political operatives and reporters smoke cigarettes, whisper into pay phones and drink scotch in bars outfitted with dark wood fixtures and deep-red banquettes. J.K. Simmons, a Reitman staple and a peerless character actor, pockets a handful of scenes as Bill Dixon, Hart’s campaign manager. Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion. But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play. The villain is Tom Fiedler (Steve Zissis), a Miami Herald reporter who is in every way Hart’s opposite: slovenly, craven, opportunistic, inarticulate. Fiedler follows up on the rumors about Rice (Sara Paxton) — who met Hart at a party on board a yacht called Monkey Business — and follows Rice herself from Florida to Washington, where Fiedler and his colleagues stake out the senator’s house. Fiedler’s cravenness is also contrasted to the ethical anguish of A.J. Parker (Mamoudou Athie), a Washington Post reporter who pursues the adultery story with reluctance and distaste. (Fiedler is a real person. Parker is a fictional composite, partly based on E.J. Dionne.) Hart’s frustration bubbles over at times — when he snaps at Parker that reporters should “follow me around”; when he confronts Herald reporters outside his Georgetown brownstone in the middle of the night; when he lashes out at the editor of The Herald during a policy forum in New York — but the real suffering is borne by his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga). She is the surest magnet for the audience’s sympathy, a woman compelled by her husband’s carelessness (at least) and the press’s insensitivity (at best) to play a role for which she has no appetite. Lee is also the film’s alibi. Her innocence authorizes its slippery and simplistic handling of complicated themes. A scene in which Ann Devroy, a co-worker of Parker’s (played by Ari Graynor) defends the idea of holding powerful men accountable for their private behavior functions like a “to be sure” paragraph in an op-ed column. Apart from Lee, the women in the movie are either naïve, like Rice, or treacherous, like Irene Kelly (Molly Ephraim), the (fictional) Hart staffer who sells out Rice. In this movie to be a politician’s wife is to be granted a share of tragic nobility. For a woman, to be anything else, above all a professional, is to live in a state of moral compromise. At various points men, including Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina) are heard to reminisce about the old days when journalists ignored the sex lives of politicians. This cozy, old-boy arrangement is not explicitly endorsed, but the logic of “The Front Runner” identifies it with the finest traditions of American democracy itself. Those traditions were undermined when Fiedler and his buddies “hid in the bushes” (in Hart’s words) to catch the senator in a compromising position, distracting the public from graver matters. That moment, according to the original subtitle of Bai’s book, was when “politics went tabloid.” But it is hard to square that notion with either the previous history of American campaigning — see the examples of Grover Cleveland and Nelson Rockefeller, among others — or subsequent events. The death of privacy in the digital age (a theme of Reitman’s similarly misbegotten “Men, Women & Children”) has little to do with newspapers, and politicians have long since learned to survive worse scandals than Hart’s. “The Front Runner” regards the spectacle of American democracy, which has often been messy, unfair and ridiculous, with high-minded disdain. The film excites our curiosity about Hart’s behavior and then declares it to be none of our business. It scolds rather than illuminates, and prefers the defense of power to the pursuit of truth. That may be its sole claim to relevance.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A ‘Chinese Lady’ on Heart-Rending Display,"Critic’s Pick The teenage Afong Moy made headlines when she arrived in New York by ship in 1834. It’s impossible to prove that she was the first Chinese woman in the United States, but it’s certain that she was a rarity, brought here to be displayed before paying crowds of gawkers. “It is human nature to be curious,” she tells us in Lloyd Suh’s piercing and intimate new play, “The Chinese Lady,” a time-skipping, gently comical drama inspired by the story of the real Afong Moy. Chattel in a two-year deal struck between her family and some American importers, Afong (Shannon Tyo) is just 14 when the play begins. Aided, and sometimes foiled, by her put-upon translator, Atung (Daniel K. Isaac), she spends her days performing a distorted version of Chinese identity. Inside a little room decorated in chinoiserie, she is a living, breathing museum exhibit: price of admission 25 cents, 10 cents for children. Dressed in a silken costume (ooh!), she eats with chopsticks (ahh!) and — here comes the highlight — even walks around the room on her tiny bound feet. “I have noticed that my feet are a source of constant fascination,” she muses as she takes her little stroll. But Afong likes her feet, and she can’t help noticing, too, that some practices in the West are at least as barbaric as foot-binding is purported to be. “Such as corsets,” she says lightly. “Or the trans-Atlantic slave trade.” Dexterously directed by Ralph B. Peña for Ma-Yi Theater Company, this quiet play steadily deepens in complexity as we trail the idealistic Afong and the more knowing Atung through the decades, bickering with each other all the way. Ms. Tyo and Mr. Isaac have gorgeous chemistry, and with their rapport they cast a spell that Fabian Obispo’s music and Oliver Wason’s lighting unobtrusively fortify. The clever set (by Junghyun Georgia Lee, who also designed the costumes) begins as a shipping container, which opens to become the room in the museum. These are the walls that box in Afong and Atung’s cultural identity, as seen through white American eyes. It’s that gaze that infuses this beautifully acted play with pain and shame and sorrow — so it is both practical and kind that Mr. Suh has softened his script with humor. Because of course it is also human nature to look on difference with suspicion or hostility. That has been a wounding part of the experience of Chinese people in this country, which barred them from citizenship — and severely restricted legal immigration — for many years. Though Afong didn’t come to the United States voluntarily, and didn’t mean to stay, “The Chinese Lady” is an immigrant’s tale. We watch her slowly acclimate to her new country, and grow more distant from the nation of her childhood. Throughout, she retains the palpable loneliness of an only — someone who, by virtue of being so outnumbered, is judged as a stand-in for an entire population. But by the end of Mr. Suh’s extraordinary play, we look at Afong and see whole centuries of American history. She’s no longer the Chinese lady. She is us.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A ‘Distant Constellation’ Where Little Is Illuminated,"It would take a telescope to observe anything exciting in “Distant Constellation,” Shevaun Mizrahi’s aptly named exercise in extreme-minimalist documentary. Said to be intended as a reflection on shifts in Turkish history and identity, it is too diffuse and withholding to add up to a cogent result. Mizrahi has cited the influence of the Portuguese director Pedro Costa, who in a trilogy of films shot in the Lisbon slum of Fontainhas allowed residents to shape their dialogue and scenes. Mizrahi, taking her cues from her subjects, has appropriated Costa’s style pretty faithfully. For the location, she has selected a retirement home and an adjacent construction site in the Istanbul neighborhood where her father grew up. The home’s residents include a photographer who fusses with his old Nikon but can no longer see, and a dirty old man (there’s no other phrase for it) who shares recollections of sex parties and, late in the film, tentatively proposes marriage to the offscreen filmmaker, who did her own camera and sound work. Most interestingly, a centenarian woman who asks to be identified only as Selma shares memories of surviving the Armenian genocide. Her family took on Turkish names and was forced to convert to Islam. At one point she nods off on camera; Mizrahi cuts to her waking up and apologizing — an inclusion that seems partly humorous and partly cruel. A case can be made for the sterile beauty of the home’s shadowy bedrooms and of the snowfall outside. “Distant Constellation” maintains an unadorned purity at the expense of quite a bit else.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’ That’s More Speedy Than Dreamy,"When a show’s cast welcomes the audience by dancing to Elvis Crespo’s merengue hit “Suavemente” and Beyoncé’s “Countdown,” as happened at the Tuesday performance of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at the Public Theater, you have to wonder where the play could possibly go. When the party needle is in the red right from the start, there’s a high risk the only way is down. Amazingly, Jenny Koons’s perkily ramshackle production manages to keep the energy up for the next 90 minutes. As a result, quite a bit is lost in the rush, from chunks of text to nuance — this is not the most polished Shakespeare you’ll ever see, or even in the top 20. But like a fair number of productions from the Public’s Mobile Unit, the show has a likable messy élan that compensates for many sins. The Public’s Shakespeare in the Park series has become an institution, with everything that term implies: It is as beloved as the old Rolling Stones and as rocking as that band’s current version, and it can be just as difficult to get tickets. The Mobile Unit, on the other hand, is the D.Y.I. punk kid who keeps alive Joe Papp’s dream of Shakespeare for the masses by taking abridged, stripped-down versions of the plays to unconventional venues — community centers, retirement homes, shelters, detention centers — all over the five boroughs before ending with a short run at the mothership. (This fall the program went national for the first time with an 18-stop Midwest tour of Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat.”) The focus in this “Midsummer Night’s Dream” is decidedly on the play’s comic side, sacrificing the dreamlike atmosphere and the story’s bittersweet undercurrents in favor of speed and slapstick. Everything goes so fast that you almost don’t notice that a plot point involves slipping someone a roofie. This works best, of course, with the scenes involving the staging of the play within the play by the inept amateur thespians known as the “rude mechanicals” — here including a barista, a bike courier and a hawker in a TodayTix vest. Christopher Ryan Grant appropriately chews the scenery and spits out the splinters as Bottom, a blustering contractor who can’t even pronounce the name of the character he’s meant to play. Balancing the mechanicals’ scenes are the ones focusing on the foursome of mismatched young lovers, whose antics have a youthful mix of eagerness and awkwardness. Best is Rosanny Zayas as Helena, who demonstrates nimble comic timing and always seems to be completely in the moment — a rarer ability than you’d think, even among the best actors. The play’s third main element, the fantastical fairy realm, takes a back seat in this decidedly earthbound production. Still, it’s fun to watch Natalie Woolams-Torres portray the sprite Puck as the keen, fumbling aide of a queen bee (Marinda Anderson’s Hippolyta); the type will be familiar to anybody who has ever watched a high school-set comedy. Not everything works here, by a long stretch. But enough does that the show could be a gateway production for many people. That may well be enough magic for one play.

2018,Review: A ‘Waiting for Godot’ as Comically Futile as a Looney Tune,"Critic’s Pick Have you ever paused to consider the spiritual and physical affinities between the desolate universe of Samuel Beckett and the wacky world of vintage Warner Brothers cartoons? Me neither. Or at least not until I saw the Druid Theater’s production of Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” part of the White Light Festival at Lincoln Center. Watching Garry Hynes’s highly stylized and very funny staging of this classic of modern literature — which opened over the weekend at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College in Manhattan — I found myself transported to Saturday mornings with Looney Tunes from my childhood. Little did I know then, as I chuckled over the frantic antics of Daffy and Bugs and company, that I was taking an extended course in existential futility. Just think about these elements, for example: An unchanging landscape (often with a boulder and a tree or two) that its exasperated denizens keep returning to no matter how far they think they’ve wandered or how hard they’ve run; badly battered bodies, subjected to random and whimsical acts of violence, that rebel against their owner’s commands; and the sense that no matter how hard and cruel the day has been, those who lived through it are ready to begin the same old punishing routine the next morning. Then there’s the suspicion, which freezes into certainty, that those who work so ardently to achieve their elusive goals will never, ever be rewarded: not Wile E. Coyote in pursuit of the fleet Road Runner, nor Sylvester the Cat, hungry eyes forever trained on the unreachable Tweety Bird. They may be determined and industrious, these poor souls, but their existences are nothing but waiting games. Such, too, are the lives of Vladimir and Estragon of “Godot” — Didi and Gogo to their friends, who would appear to be limited to each other. While scholars have long noted the vaudevillian and music-hall-clown nature of these characters, the improbably elastic pair of Aaron Monaghan (Gogo) and Marty Rea (Didi) float them into the stratosphere of the Looney Tunes menagerie. This means, for starters, that they are funny simply to look at, these two quarrelsome, symbiotically bonded tramps, in their dusty bowler hats and shredded boots. Most of Mr. Rea’s body, thin and towering, is taken up by his legs. The shorter Mr. Monaghan has the look of someone who has been smushed into concentrated shape by a clothing press. (Give credit to Francis O’Connor’s shape-defining costumes.) Frozen in tableau against Mr. O’Connor’s exquisitely barren set, with its lone tree and single, time-smoothed boulder, they are Mutt and Jeff in limbo. Once they start to move, they seem to have been drawn into being by some diabolical animator. Watch Mr. Rea’s legs shoot out at perpendicular angles, or Mr. Monaghan spring into the air from a sitting position. When they scan the horizon in search of He whose arrival they perpetually anticipate, one Mr. Godot, they strike the exaggerated eye-shielding poses of sailors from an operetta chorus. Trying to figure out the best way to remove Gogo’s shoes, or to hang themselves with a frustratingly short length of rope, they morph into a writhing human pretzel. The geometric possibilities of bodies in contact and collision are further multiplied with the arrival of two other travelers, the arrogant and bloated Pozzo (Rory Nolan) and his broken-down lackey, Lucky (Garrett Lombard). Pozzo and Lucky — if you’ll excuse the shift in frame of reference — may remind you of the glorious grotesques from Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland.” Certainly, Mr. Nolan’s Pozzo is close kin to such arbitrary authority figures as that celebrated advocate of child beating, the Duchess. And when the hitherto mute Lucky is prompted into polysyllabic speech, it comes across as a pyrotechnic explosion of Carroll-style, grown-up gobbledygook. Everybody tends to sound slightly less, or more, than human when they speak. Even as they ponder the vagaries and vagueness of time and mortality, Gogo and Didi often communicate in squeaky Mickey Mouse voices. When Pozzo delivers his much-quoted, annihilating pronouncement — the one that begins “they give birth astride a grave” — it’s in the tones of a crypt keeper. I can’t say I felt the mortal shivers here that often descend when I hear those words. Ms. Hynes — the imaginative director who introduced New York to the macabre mind of Martin McDonagh with “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” in 1998 — has presented one of the most accessible, and enjoyable, “Godots” on record. It’s lively and sensibly silly enough to take a child to, at least for its first act. For more mature minds, if such there be, this production has the virtues of uniformity of style, which is less common in Beckett interpretations than it should be, and gleaming clarity of expression. Every one of the jokes, in all their fugue-like repetition, lands solidly. And lines to which I’ve never paid much attention before stand out in illuminated relief, as when Gogo observes, “Everything oozes. It’s never the same pus from one minute to the next.” What you may find yourself missing is the deeply touching familiarity of Gogo and Didi’s relationship, a portrait of marriage of sorts, in which interdependence is mixed with impatience and irritability. In more naturalistic interpretations — such as that provided by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in Sean Mathias’s 2013 Broadway revival — those eternally linked pals give affecting resonance to the idea of being with someone you can neither live with nor live without. Still, for theatergoers new to Beckett, I can’t imagine a better introduction than this lucid and entertaining cartoon of a show. That its comic exaggeration can feel a bit distancing may be for the best, especially for newcomers, in this anxious era. The pain at the center of this study of human purposelessness can be hard to take for someone unprepared for the bright glare of Beckett’s unbounded bleakness. An earlier version of this review misstated the title of a play from 1998. It is “The Beauty Queen of Leenane,” not “The Beauty of Leenane.” This information was last updated on Nov. 5, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: An Orchestral Season That’s (Almost) Entirely Female,"Time travel. Tennis. An all-female lineup of composers, a mostly black roster of soloists, and one violinist bowing the wrong way. The American Composers Orchestra gave classical conventions the cold shoulder on Friday at Zankel Hall with a program called “Phenomenal Women.” That title was taken from one of two premieres on offer, a work by Valerie Coleman that was in turn inspired by a poem of the same name by Maya Angelou. The spirit of that poem — sassy, sensual and confident — hovered over this evening full of surprises. This orchestra, led by the indefatigable George Manahan, has run a robust and diverse commissioning program for years; by happy accident, almost exclusively female composers are featured this season. (The ensemble will play a single piece by Morton Feldman in April.) Friday evening opened with a birthday celebration for the composer Joan Tower, who turned 80 in September. In a humorous onstage interview, she chafed at the idea of being framed as the “traditionalist” on this occasion, alongside Ms. Coleman, born in 1970, and Alex Temple, 35. “It’s weird,” Ms. Tower said. “I used to be the rebel.” But there was nothing staid about her “Chamber Dance” from 2006. Slinky, fast-flowing and infused with a strong sense of rhythm, it’s an infectious piece of orchestral writing. Ms. Coleman’s “Phenomenal Women” is a six-part concerto grosso for wind quintet, written for the ensemble Imani Winds. (She was the group’s founding flutist.) The juxtaposition of instrumental solos, chamber ensemble and orchestral textures created moments of memorable freshness and color. Five movements are dedicated to women who inspired Ms. Coleman — Angelou, the NACA (later NASA) mathematician Katherine Johnson, the tennis star Serena Williams, former first lady Michelle Obama, and Claressa Shields, an Olympic boxer. This allowed Ms. Coleman to show off her gifts for tone painting. She brilliantly captured the thwack-thwack of a tennis ball bounced in preparation for a serve. Staccato oboe notes tapped out a stream of digits in the movement dedicated to Johnson, while excited ascending figures traced the eventual liftoff of a spacecraft. The five Imani players performed the music with charisma and verve. Tucked between these portraits was a poignant movement dedicated to the mothers walking in the caravan of migrants headed for the American border. A solo flute (the elegant Brandon Patrick George) wove echoes of Brahms’s classic Lullaby into a series of increasingly agitated flourishes. The music spoke of both tenderness and terror. The evening ended with Ms. Temple’s brilliant and zany “Three Principles of Noir,” a kind of cabaret cantata about a historian who decides to travel back in time to kill the great-great-grandmother of a rival scholar who has stolen her research. (The plan goes awry.) Meaghan Burke was the outstanding soloist, convincing both in long stretches of spoken monologue and in Brechtian sung ballads, which seemed tailored to her street-smart, feline voice. Ms. Temple’s music zooms across time, blending Prohibition-era cheek with recorded electronics that evoke mid-20th-century sci-fi. The orchestra proved an enthusiastic partner throughout. My eye kept wandering to Sander Strenger, a rare example of a violinist who holds the instrument with his right arm and bows with his left. On a night dedicated to minorities in music, he captured this ensemble’s knack for playing against the grain.",The New York Times
2019,"Review: At the Big Apple Circus, Discs Fly and So Do People","Critic’s Pick The weather is a misery, the subways are a disaster, the news is unspeakable. But inside a tent tucked into a rear corner of Lincoln Center Plaza, a poodle is tooling around in a miniature sports car, his sequined scarf fluttering. Which is to say that the Big Apple Circus is in town and a little more joy is loosed upon the city. This year’s show, again written and directed by Mark Lonergan, is high flying, but also more low key. The marquee acts are fewer and gone is Barry Lubin, a beloved clown I’d always found hinky and unfunny, fired from the circus for sexual misconduct. He’s been replaced by Adam Kuchler, a nifty juggler dressed like a Jazz Age swell. Mr. Kuchler has a sidekick, Mark Gindick, disguised as a phone-glued weekend dad who wanders into the ring by mistake. Together they groove to the cheerful live music. (The choreography is by Grady McLeod Bowman.) Also new: the ringmaster Stephanie Monseu, sparkly, but underused. Couldn’t she eat just a bit of fire? Only her lace-up bustier cues her origins in the adult Bindlestiff Family Cirkus. The show kicks off with Emil Faltyny balancing on the free-standing ladder, an act that requires astounding discipline, but isn’t much to look at, until he adds a soccer ball, improvising a lulu of a penalty kick. By contrast, Victor Moiseev’s horizontal juggling is visually ravishing — balls shaped like giant cranberries besiege him on all sides — but unastounding. “It looks like he’s doing magic, but really he’s not,” my 5-year-old, cotton-candy-drunk date said sagely. Valeriy Sychev and Ekaterina Abakarova perform a steamy aerial straps act, a soaring sex ballet in which Mr. Sychev enfolds Ms. Abakarova and lifts her toward acrophilic bliss before grounding and then ghosting her. It included some dazzling holds, as when Ms. Abakarova keeps herself aloft through thigh strength alone. A rousingly egalitarian doubles act comes courtesy of Virginia Tuells and Ihosvanys Perez, a married couple who perform as Duo Fusion. Do they know this is also the name of an antacid? Their acrobatic balance begins typically, but after a few moves, Ms. Tuells takes a turn as the anchor, supporting Mr. Perez. She bends into a bridge and he does a handstand atop her abdomen (is that the antacid tie-in?) and good lord is it wonderful. I kept nudging the 5-year-old in a see-girls-really-can-do-it-all way; she never imagined they couldn’t and took the wonders in stride. An act called Spicy Circus bounds atop twinned trampolines, and I took no notes as the Flying Tunizianis flung themselves toward their trapezes because it turns out I can’t write while I’m gaping. This year’s routine involved two catchers and, during the finale, a spangled foursome seems to square dance midair. The Flying Tunizianis perform with a safety net, which may nettle some thrill seekers, but I’ve always found the alternative too stressful. For absolute gladness, there is no topping Jenny Vidbel’s animal acts. The use of animals in circuses is controversial, but Ms. Vidbel, who works only with domestic animals, lives with them year-round and continues to care for them in their retirement, makes it seem a friendly and virtuous thing. (Her costumes all have treats pockets.) The stallions are grand; the miniature horses cuddly; the potbellied pig deserves a string of kiss-blowing emojis the width of this page. To see her dogs catch flying discs — which yes, most dogs do, but these dogs do it better and in time with the band — is to be on barking terms with delight. “You have to write down that this part is good,” my date demanded. These may sound like damning words, but — with the bustier and aerial straps maybe excepted — the Big Apple Circus is wholesome family entertainment. It is good-hearted and pleasure-minded. The acts don’t overstay their welcome (honestly, that pig could have stayed forever) and the cast is robustly international. In the finale, everyone returns to the ring, shimmying together like a spangled, more flexible United Nations. I left happy and even though she’s a tough customer and I’d confiscated her cotton candy, my date did, too. The circus ran away with us.

2018,"Review: At the Philharmonic, a Screaming Reflection on War","Critic’s Pick Shostakovich’s “Leningrad” Symphony is a sprawling score that heaves, blasts, marches and meanders for nearly 80 minutes. Written in 1941, while Hitler’s forces were devastating Leningrad in a siege that would last 900 days and take at least a million lives, the work practically screams, “This is a big statement!” And scream it did on Thursday at Geffen Hall, where Jaap van Zweden led the New York Philharmonic in a performance of the “Leningrad” that was intense and powerful — sometimes overly so. Shostakovich began composing this symphony, his seventh, before the German invasion. Debates continue over whether he intended it as a grim portrait of a historic city under siege, or as a more general cry against tyranny. Are there coded, anti-Stalinist messages in the piece? And are those long stretches of militaristic-sounding marches bitterly ironic? Mr. van Zweden seemed to take the piece at face value — in the best sense. He laid out this shifting score clearly, letting it speak for itself. He pushed the orchestra to blaring extremes at times, but the excessiveness of the music may call for that. (Critics who question the symphony’s merits, including Virgil Thomson, have found it obvious and steeped in banality.) From the Philharmonic strings, Mr. van Zweden drew a dark, deep tone in the opening theme: a stern yet elusive melodic line, played in unison, that is soon goaded by bursts of drums and trumpets. The transition from there into a quizzically lyrical passage was deftly handled. The most curious section of the nearly half-hour first movement comes when you expect a development section to begin. Instead, a snare drum plays an obsessive march rhythm. Over it, individual instruments, then groups, play what sounds like a jaunty march tune — over and over. Each statement becomes bigger, louder and more elaborately orchestrated. This roughly 10-minute section has aptly been described as Shostakovich’s “Boléro.” Mr. van Zweden and the orchestra played it straight, building inexorably to an assaultive fortissimo climax. The Philharmonic’s high level of the performance continued throughout the symphony: the second movement’s cross between a scherzo and lyrical reminiscence; the restless slow movement; and the often frenzied finale, which drives toward of seemingly triumphant (or bitter?) coda of victory. Mr. van Zweden opened the program with what proved an ideal companion piece: Britten’s Violin Concerto, featuring the brilliant 33-year-old Dutch violinist Simone Lamsma, in her Philharmonic debut. Ms. Lamsma, who first worked with her countryman Mr. van Zweden in 2007, played splendidly, with crisp clarity and brightly radiant sound, conveying both the rhapsodic fervor and intriguing pensiveness of the music. Britten completed this concerto in 1939, while living in the United States. (The Philharmonic gave its premiere in 1940.) It opens with a simple riff for timpani, a curiously insistent march rhythm that runs through whole sections of the piece. The third movement is written as a mercurial, almost memorial passacaglia. It, too, seems a reflection on war.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Brutal Intimacy and Exuberance Defines ‘Usual Girls’,"Critic’s Pick Heads up, fans of Sarah DeLappe’s soccer play, “The Wolves” — admirers of the original cast in particular. Ming Peiffer’s new play “Usual Girls,” at Roundabout Theater Company, has almost nothing to do with sports, yet it feels very much of the same youthfully female-centric world, and its ribald, raucous comedy is similarly embedded with pain. Well done, then, in choosing as its star Midori Francis, who in the ensemble cast of “The Wolves” played No. 8, the sweet nerd who delivered the epiphanic line: “Omigosh, you guys, does that mean we’re hobbits?” In “Usual Girls” Ms. Francis plays Kyeoung, who when we first meet her is a child learning a playground game called lava monster. She’s new at this school, somewhere in 1980s Ohio, but she’s a self-possessed little thing. Already she has made some friends who will be in her life for years: Lindsay (Nicole Rodenburg), a rigid alpha; and Anna (Abby Corrigan), who’s endearingly weird. With the blurting unselfconsciousness of the very young (all of the children here are played by adults), these three are talking about sex. Or, rather, piecing together the intel they’ve gathered about it — from Victoria’s Secret catalogs and Kyeoung’s messed-up father’s stash of “special magazines.” Overhearing Anna use a vulgarity, an easily offended bully named Rory (Raviv Ullman) threatens to tell a grown-up unless one of them kisses him. “Why do you even need a kiss?” Kyeoung asks. “Because that’s what girls are supposed to give boys,” Rory says. “That’s why we even play with them.” What girls are expected to give to boys, and women to men, is the searing core of “Usual Girls,” which over 90 minutes follows Kyeoung from elementary school through adolescence to college and beyond. Racism figures prominently, too; Rory is not the only one who thinks that Kyeoung’s Korean ancestry means she has a different anatomy than white girls. This is partly a play about the brutal intimacy of growing up together, and if you’ve ever been a girl, the friendships here — in their details and dynamics — may give you stinging flashbacks. Their exuberance, though, may give you flashbacks of joy. Impeccably directed by Tyne Rafaeli in Roundabout Underground’s tiny Black Box Theater, “Usual Girls” has a fine cast of nine, and a stellar design team that includes Arnulfo Maldonado (set), Ásta Bennie Hostetter (costumes), Jen Schriever (lights) and Tei Blow (sound). With Jennifer Lim as a woman looking back on her past, it’s a memory play, really, though that phrase suggests a work far gauzier than what Ms. Peiffer has constructed, which gets very dark when it touches on predation and violence. In vivid, time-jumping scenes, we see the myriad ways that Kyeoung and the other girls are punished from an early age — and encouraged to punish one another — for sexual curiosity, desire, experience, attractiveness or lack thereof. These inquisitive young humans soak in the culture around them, imbibing some profoundly warping ideas. The script’s weakness is in Ms. Peiffer’s tendency to finish scenes with lines that feel like flourishes. She undermines the play’s ending with a similar lack of subtlety, detracting from the overall power. Without a lead as bold, moving and full-on funny as Ms. Francis, in a production less accomplished than Ms. Rafaeli’s, those quibbles would matter more. But in its world premiere, “Usual Girls” is exciting to watch. With hilarity and grimness, it connects the dots between pleasure, pain and shame.

2018,Review: Chris Thile Is the God of Small Sounds,"Critic’s Pick Unplugged, Chris Thile is the god of small sounds. He plays the mandolin, which means he coaxes music out of notes that are shy and short-lived. Mr. Thile is a superstar on this instrument, with multiple Grammys, a MacArthur “genius” grant and hosting duties on the radio variety show “Live From Here” (formerly “A Prairie Home Companion”) among his credits. But when he plays an acoustic solo program at Carnegie Hall, he has to do so in the pocket-size Weill Recital Hall. Even in such an intimate space, listening to each tiny note requires physical commitment, like catching snowflakes on your tongue. His concert on Wednesday — I caught the first of two sets — was part of a series Mr. Thile designed for Carnegie, where he holds the Debs Composer’s Chair this season, drawing on his wide musical interests and collaborations with jazz and bluegrass artists. The program contained selections from his transcriptions of Bach’s partitas for solo violin, bluegrass standards, arrangements of pop songs and Mr. Thile’s own compositions — full of whimsy and breathless virtuosity. Bach’s own virtuosity translates to a different effect on the mandolin. In a fast movement such as the Gigue from the D minor Partita, Mr. Thile has an advantage on a violinist: Without any large muscle groups involved in the production of sound, he can play the runs with lightning speed — or at least as fast as his pick can keep up. The music flies by in one joyous arc, with the linear melody and vertical harmony blurring into a single web of gossamer beauty. In a slow movement like the Sarabande from the B minor Partita, the mandolin’s inability to sustain sounds adds poignancy. The noble gestures are muted; statements become mere suggestions. But what comes through vividly in this arrangement is the genetic strand of the sarabande as a Spanish dance with Arabic roots. Mr. Thile’s playing spoke of the debt owed by Bach to much older, unnamed masters of the oud. By the same token, Mr. Thile allowed contemporary songs to grow organically out of Bach. His own wistful “This Is the Song” emerged from the last bar of a Bach Courante gently, his transparent voice floating in space. His guileless, clear vocals belong to the world of pop, but are fueled by serious technique. On sustained notes, he sometimes produced a light version of the “messa di voce” that is part of an opera singer’s tool kit, placing a note quietly, as in the palm of his hand, then letting it swell before reining it back again. The effect is all the more stunning accompanied by the furious, hyperkinetic strumming required to draw a similar crescendo out of the mandolin. Without printed lyrics, it was sometimes hard to make out the words Mr. Thile was singing. It didn’t seem to matter much in some of the bluegrass numbers, which raced by in a delirious gallop with snippets of text — was he really singing about a chicken on his back? — flashing past. But I would have liked a chance to better acquaint myself with the words to a new political triptych that drew some of Mr. Thile’s darkest music, with dense chromatic chords and snarky jazz interludes. It was the only time I found myself wishing he had a microphone.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Demystifying a Diva in ‘Maria by Callas’,"Toward the end of “Maria by Callas,” the legendary opera singer (1923-1977) describes the music she interprets as “the only language I really know.” That description is belied by this documentary, a compendium of interviews, performances and writings from Callas in which she proves an eloquent narrator of her own life. By sifting through these materials four decades after Callas’s death, the movie aims to correct a popular perception — spread by the news media and interpretive biographies (Terrence McNally’s play “Master Class”) — that Callas was a diva offstage as well as on. Whether the results qualify as a comprehensive portrayal is best debated by opera historians, but what is clear is that “Maria by Callas” provides an excellent introduction to Callas’s artistry. The director, Tom Volf, allows several arias to play in full, so that it’s possible to hear the astonishing sustained quality of her voice and to see, in performances of Bizet and Bellini, among others, what we are repeatedly told — that she was also a good actress. The documentary runs, chronologically, through career highlights, including a ridiculed 1958 performance of “Norma” that was canceled after one act (Callas had bronchitis) to her eyebrow-raising more-than-friendship with Aristotle Onassis, which began when both were married to others and ended, for a while anyway, after she learned, apparently from news reports, that he was marrying Jackie Kennedy. The movie is to Callas what last year’s “Jane” was to Jane Goodall: A documentary that revitalizes history through primary sources, to illuminating, at times enthralling effect.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Du Yun Conjures a Musical World of Legos and Chants,"Critic’s Pick Given the option, the composer and performer Du Yun often pushes into multiple disciplines. This isn’t only the case when she is providing new scores for vintage silent films, or creating new works for the stage, like her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Angel’s Bone.” Even presentations of her chamber pieces are likely to come outfitted with projected video art. The risk is that notes and rhythms can get lost in the shuffle. I remember one concert at which I decided to shut my eyes and focus on Ms. Du’s music, which often provides a thrilling sense of dramatic development, skating wide of traditional timbres by employing extended techniques. During the first half of a Composer Portrait concert on Thursday, at the Miller Theater at Columbia University, Ms. Du’s multimedia impulse was once again in evidence, thanks to Nicholas Houfek’s lighting design and some theatrical, mod-futurist costuming provided by a few players in the International Contemporary Ensemble — which counts Ms. Du as a founding composer. This time, the visuals and the music worked together. Played without interruption, this half of the evening featured what Ms. Du described as a series of “Legos,” with performers standing or seated on appropriately rectangular blocks positioned on the Miller stage. As lights at the front of the stage dimmed, a solo performer whose piece had concluded could quietly shuffle off, as the wisp of the following piece sounded from another corner — and as Mr. Houfek’s lighting design played with ombre tints and arrangements of polygons on a large screen at the rear of the hall. It was gripping, partly the result of some judicious editing. By taking a collection of her past chamber pieces and linking them together this way — and in one case superimposing them — Ms. Du managed to create a brisk, effective tour of her style. The exaggerated vibrato in the violin solo “Under a tree, an udatta” has an analogue in the sometimes woozy cello part of “Zinc Oxide, a tale of a seagull.” Yet these similarities of gesture do not create sound-alike works. In “Zinc Oxide,” Ms. Du’s own vocalizations — sometimes doled out as solemn chants, and sometimes belted, as though issuing from a cabaret in a sci-fi film — joined with her string writing to create a distinct, incantatory gravity. The International Contemporary Ensemble’s many years of familiarity with her works also helped create a sense of unity among the pieces. The saxophonist Ryan Muncy performed “Dinosaur Scar” on a recent album of Ms. Du’s works with the same title. It’s a terrific take. But on Thursday he sounded even more excited by the long-held tones that occasionally burst into striated, frizzy pops, and by the work’s shorter flurries of dizzying melody. Perhaps that was because he was sometimes spurred along by another of Ms. Du’s solos, “Ixtab, 10pm,” which was played simultaneously — and with similar intensity — by the bassoonist Rebekah Heller. The larger ensemble pieces that followed this Lego-and-light show suffered only a bit by comparison. A performance of “Impeccable Quake” lacked a bit of the bite that the International Contemporary Ensemble provided on its recent recording — if only because the playing of the virtuoso guitarist Daniel Lippel was mixed too low inside the Miller. It was the only point at which the many qualities of Ms. Du’s ambitious art seemed momentarily out of balance.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Exploring Addiction in ‘Chasing the New White Whale’,"“Chasing the New White Whale” scores points for sheer gumption. The Forty Hour Club production, which just opened at La MaMa, borrows elements from “Moby-Dick” to depict the ravages brought on by the opioid epidemic, particularly on the New England working class. There are boats moving about on wheeled scaffolds as well as projections onto a sail-like screen; a two-person band supplies an omnipresent live score. The story features sermons and ghosts, drug-running and tempests at sea, not to mention high-stakes fishing. It would be exciting to report that the playwright Mike Gorman found a way to tie all these strands together — if only because modern theater does not write enough about either blue-collar characters or drug addiction — but “Chasing the New White Whale” is a muddle of ideas in search of coherence and falls short of its ambition. The show declares a parallel between Melville’s creations and the plague of drugs. “What was Ahab, but an addict, really, and what was the white whale, but an allusion to opium, and heroin, its contemporary scourge?” asks a Quaker chaplain (Mr. Gorman), who pops up at regular intervals to deliver flowery homilies. In between these sermons we follow the story of Robby (Alan Barnes Netherton), a fisherman who’s doomed by the threat of drug addiction and his obsession with fishing. Since he was a kid, you see, Robby has been driven by the one that got away. “I’ve got one more trip to catch a big halibut and then I’m out,” he says at one point. Halibut pales next to a giant white whale in the metaphor department, but fine, let’s go with it. Robby gets in cahoots with a smuggler, Ray (Mark Daly), to raise money for a boat, all the while exhibiting stunning naïveté as to what’s in the hold: “You said it was going to be guns,” he tells Ray. Oh, guns, so much better. Meanwhile, young Steven (Khari Constantine) represents a new generation’s evergreen idealism as he wants to make a go at resurrecting old-fashioned practices, like hook fishing. There is the germ of an interesting tale lurking in there, if only because the author’s anger is palpable. Mr. Gorman, the recently appointed playwright in residence at La MaMa, lost a brother who was a fisherman to a heroin overdose, and denouncing the blight of opioids has become his artistic quest. But obsessions are by nature difficult to tame and the show is all over the place. The parallels between addiction and “Moby-Dick” do not sync up, and neither do the realistic and symbolic scenes. The actors moving silently among the main cast are meant to evoke both Ahab’s ghostly crew and modern addicts, for instance, but the device is mystifying rather than effective. The script also takes so many narrative shortcuts that the lead characters are reduced to brush strokes. Mr. Gorman tries to pack too much in 75 minutes, and so does the director Arthur Adair, who overcompensates with bells and whistles — the occasional live video feed à la Ivo van Hove is awkward and expendable, for instance. The show is best at its most direct, and a storm heaving Robby’s boat about is haunting in its simplicity. The core of the story is there: a man, tossed about by life and elements, trying to survive.

2019,Review: Going From Schlub to Slick in ‘The Other Josh Cohen’,"One is beamish: a smooth, guitar-strumming cutup. The other is sweet but borderline pathetic. And yet, in “The Other Josh Cohen,” the two characters — played delightfully by David Rossmer and Steve Rosen, who also wrote the show — are really the same man, just one year apart. The idea is a neat one, and gives the peppy musical, which opened on Monday at the Westside Theater in Hell’s Kitchen, a solid foundation. In tracing the comic pathway by which a schlub becomes more self-assured, it tells a morality tale about the value of persistence. The show’s success, after eight years of tortuous development, does too. Mr. Rosen plays Josh Cohen as he was a year ago, in the midst of a series of travails that will be familiar to young New Yorkers of any era. Hoping to be a writer, he scrapes by as a temp; hoping for love, he strikes out embarrassingly with every at-bat. And now, in the run-up to Valentine’s Day — that trial by fire for the lonely — he comes home to find his shabby apartment fully cleaned out by a burglar, except for things he never wanted. A Neil Diamond CD. A “Hang In There, Kitty” page-a-day calendar. This would be depressing, in the cute musical comedy manner, were it not for the constant presence of the upbeat Mr. Rossmer, who narrates the story from a happier place a year later. We see right away that things turned out well because this so-called Narrator Josh, dressed (by Nicole V. Moody) exactly like Mr. Rosen’s Josh, has lost both weight and an unfortunate mustache. Though Narrator Josh cannot directly shape the past in which regular Josh is moping, he can certainly shape our view of it. With lyrics like “Losing everything is only the beginning,” he lets us know that the tide will soon turn. Perhaps not quite soon enough; even at 90 minutes this is something of a shaggy dog — or shaggy kitten — story. But the shagginess pays off once Josh receives a mysterious letter from a woman in Florida who may or may not be a relative. (His “immigrant horndog” great-grandfather left a lot of Cohens strewn about.) The letter includes a gift that will supercharge Josh’s life if only he can accept it. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Much of the show’s humor and heart derives from the ethical wrangling that results. It’s no spoiler to say that Josh’s painful choice eventually leads him to happiness. Only when adversity helps him understand who he really is can he find his “beshert”: his “meant to be.” How the authors get there is better left in their hands — and those of the five other cast members, who play dozens of characters while doubling as the show’s band and backup. And if the songs never quite develop a signature sound, except for a few that aptly invoke Neil Diamond, they make up for it in their off-center point of view. The gravel-voiced Mr. Diamond is sketched by Kate Wetherhead, who is terrific in a role listed in the program as A Lot of People. Louis Tucci (A Bunch of People), Hannah Elless (A Bunch of Other People), Luke Darnell (The Rest of the People) and Elizabeth Nestlerode (At Least One More Person) ably fill out the quirky story. Their quick-take skills — along with those of Mr. Rossmer (“Peter and the Starcatcher”) and Mr. Rosen (“Spamalot”) — underline the loose-limbed, unscripted feel of the material. (The authors met, as children, during an improv exercise at arts camp.) The style recalls that of musicals like “[title of show]” and “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” with their apparently spontaneous digressions into the odd and outré. That effect is of course an illusion here; the authors have been refining their show for years. In 2010, under the title “V-Day,” it played a few performances at the New York Musical Theater Festival; under the current title, it ran at the SoHo Playhouse for a month in 2012. Subsequent productions at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., and the Geva Theater Center in Rochester honed but also rethought the story, direction and design. That “The Other Josh Cohen” avoided the curse of overprocessing as it trekked from theaters accommodating a few dozen to the Paper Mill’s 1,200 is thus a bit of a miracle, not unlike the one that eventually rewards Josh for his tenacity. At the 250-seat Westside, under the unpretentious direction of Hunter Foster, it has achieved a fitting size and shape. To take it any further, as the authors may hope, would be to tempt fate — and also to undermine the modesty of the material. “The Other Josh Cohen” is a charmer, touching on real issues without pummeling them. It doesn’t need to push harder or further; in knowing itself, it has already found its beshert. This information was last updated on March 14, 2019",The New York Times
2018,Review: Hungarian National Ballet Opens With a Stale ‘Swan Lake’,"Programming is tricky business. What should a ballet company bring to a city like New York, which already has plenty of offerings? For its first solo evening at Lincoln Center, the Hungarian National Ballet went with safe and sound: “Swan Lake.” But was it really safe? No two “Swan Lakes” are exactly alike, and this one, created in 1988 by the Dutch choreographer Rudi van Dantzig, turned out to be more stale than sound: It was both dramatically peculiar and roughly danced. Performed Wednesday night at the David H. Koch Theater, “Swan Lake” was a one-off. The company, directed by Tamas Solymosi, made its United States debut at a gala on Sunday, and will present two more programs: “Don Quixote” on Friday and a triple bill devoted to works by Hans van Manen, another Dutch choreographer, on Sunday. [Read about how Hungary’s rightward turn has benefited the state opera and ballet companies] Mr. van Dantzig, who died in 2012, was known for creating dances with a social message; there’s a light touch of that in his “Swan Lake,” which clocked in at nearly four hours. In Act 1, we see that Prince Siegfried’s haughty tutor, Von Rasposen (Alekszandr Komarov), doesn’t want Siegfried (Gergely Leblanc) mixing with the local villagers. He also seems to have an aversion to the Prince’s best friend, Alexander (Dmitry Diachkov), a young man with whom Siegfried shares more chemistry than with any maiden or swan. In Act 2, it becomes clear that Von Rasposen is a manifestation of Rothbart (Mikalai Radziush), the evil magician responsible for turning the princess Odette (Tatiana Melnik) into a swan. In the Act 3 ballroom scene, Von Rasposen and Rothbart share the stage and some of the credit for manipulating Siegfried into proposing marriage to Odile, Odette’s malevolent doppelgänger. “Swan Lake” always requires a hearty suspension of disbelief, but the twists here are baffling. The mood is off too. “Swan Lake” is about a man who finds purpose and love and then squanders it, yet this rendition is passionless. The swans in “Swan Lake” — their white feathers, the way they show their skin, their only-come-out-at-night existence — are the epitome of elegance and inherently sexy: They are the ballet world’s showgirls. But here, as throughout, the dancers hit the right marks without becoming swept up in the music. Mr. van Dantzig’s choreography, imbued with oddities here and there, was repetitive and frequently unmusical; it seemed to unfold in slow motion, and the cast responded with hesitant, mannered dancing. Perhaps it was the pressure, but they seemed tense and disconnected — especially Ms. Melnik — and as they strived for perfection of line, they seemed to lose the art of actual dancing. There were also quirks in the Act 3 folk dances, choreographed by Toer van Schayk. (He also designed the set and costumes.) The prospective brides for Siegfried had more character development than usual, especially in the case of one hopeful (Emi Uehara), who had to be pushed onto the stage; she was bashful and then danced her heart out. One of the Spanish dancers, Lea Földi, seemed to know Rothbart from outside of the ballroom (they shared a kiss behind his hat); and Odile, at the start of her seduction scene, danced with six men in masks. In all, it was more fussy than inventive. Rothbart — dressed in green scales and looking like a sea creature in a drag show — made for a perpetually grim sight. His movement extended little beyond a furious flap of the wings and a scissoring leap. And his stage time was, let’s say, abundant; if he wasn’t cutting in between the swans, he was poised on a cliff directing their movements. As for Siegfried and Odette? In the end, their connection was tenuous. Mr. Leblanc, handsome but remote, seemed more drawn to the swirling harmony of the swans than to any one swan in particular. When Odette departed for the last time and he drowned in the lake, who was there to retrieve his lifeless body from the waves? Alexander. Odette never had a chance.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In Alexei Ratmansky’s ‘Bayadère,’ Mostly Good Revelations","BERLIN — What’s a classic and why? The Russian ballet “La Bayadère” (1877) was largely unknown in the West until the 1960s, when its Shades scene was danced, out of context, by the Kirov (now the Mariinsky) and then the Royal Ballet. The scene builds cumulatively, beginning with a slow, hypnotic, single-file entrance by the female corps de ballet, 32 women dressed in identical white tutus. In unison, these women — the Shades — dance the same to-and-fro phrase: a zigzag walk punctuated by a linear gesture forward into space and then a stretch back with arms making a halo around the head. The scene seems plotless, timeless, placeless, an Elysian echo-chamber: the 19th-century prototype of the 20th century’s many non-narrative classical ballets. The choreographer Alexei Ratmansky’s reconstruction of “La Bayadère” for the Staatsballett Berlin, which had its world premiere on Sunday night, is the latest in a series of Western full-length “Bayadère” productions that, since 1980, have shown how the Shades scene fits into this stylistically patchy ballet’s melodramatic story of love, politics and religion set in pre-British India. It’s also the latest in a recent series of Ratmansky reconstructions of late-19th-century Russian ballet classics. Like his “Sleeping Beauty” (2015) and “Swan Lake” (2016), it’s often revelatory. It does much to strip away the Soviet Russian distortions that have laden this classic with showy dance tricks, while significantly enriching our understanding of the art of its original choreographer, Marius Petipa (1818-1910) — mainly to the good, but not all. The Shades scene was the centerpiece of Petipa’s third act. During his day, the fourth and final act was often thought to surpass it. Today, however, there are large gaps in the historical sources for that act’s choreography; and tastes have changed. That conclusion’s intense drama makes a lighter impression than the Shades scene, which still seems astonishingly imaginative. Where Petipa’s original allows, this Ratmansky “Bayadère” is a tightly coherent narrative drama. The Shades are the opium dream of the hero Solor — they multiply the essence of Nikia, his newly dead beloved — but it has seldom been so clear as here that they’re descending from the slopes of the Himalayas. The designer, Jérôme Kaplan, even makes the Shades, their arms swathed in cloudy white net, seem a continuation of the mists on his moonlit mountains. These Staatsballett Shades enter fluently, faster than any other “Bayadère” corps I can remember (this tempo feels right for the music), and with wonderful phrasing. The ensuing scene makes more dramatic sense than ever: In one telling touch, Nikia and Solor simply walk together around the space, each holding both of the other’s hands, echoing an earlier walk they took in the temple. Elsewhere Mr. Ratmansky restores a wealth of detail to Nikia, the title bayadère (or devadasi, a female temple dancer), who’s consecrated to the temple and its rituals. She also plays a lute, and must, at the ballet’s tragic crisis, dance while playing music in honor of Solor’s betrothal to the Rajah’s daughter Gamsatti. Solor, however, has sworn to love Nikia over the temple’s holy flame. This oath, like Nikia’s artist nature, has never been more potent as a motif. Nikia herself is the one reason apart from the Shades scene that “Bayadère” may count as a classic. She’s both a victim and an avenger: Having lost Solor to Gamsatti in this world, she invokes the gods to bring about a devastating earthquake, so she can reclaim Solor in the afterlife. At Sunday’s premiere, Nikia was danced by Polina Semionova (who has worked with Mr. Ratmansky at American Ballet Theater, where he is the artist in residence). Her whole body moves expressively; she effortlessly catches the tricky dichotomy of being an Indian dancer who goes to classical-ballet paradise. Most of the Berlin dancers are excellent in mime. Some characters, like the ayah (Birgit Brux), attendant to Gamsatti, become newly three-dimensional. As Solor, Alejandro Virelles was stiff in acting though never wooden; in his final-scene wedding to Gamsatti, he admirably danced a stylish jumping variation reconstructed by Mr. Ratmansky. Here the role of the dangerously vindictive Gamsatti becomes largely a non-dance role: even in her dance-laden betrothal scene, she remains a spectator. Then — surprise! — at her wedding she suddenly reveals a virtuoso-ballerina side. On Sunday, Yolanda Correa showed that she had both the poise and the technique to carry this off. There are too few records for this final scene. There’s nothing even to tell us even what music Gamsatti danced her solo variation to. So Mr. Ratmansky gives her a familiar number (music and choreography) usually performed by Kitri, the heroine of another Petipa-Minkus ballet, “Don Quixote,” in its Vision Scene. True, such interpolations were not uncommon in Petipa’s day — but this one is still jarring. Several other features make this production uneven. And some of these are surely the fault of Petipa and Ludwig Minkus, the original composer. (Minkus’s score, which has several trite passages, has been arranged here by Lars Payne and Gavin Sutherland.) Mr. Ratmansky, having unearthed several unfamiliar musical passages, fits the stage action to them felicitously. But the betrothal and wedding scenes are both bogged down by divertissements that are quaint at best. And the final scene’s score gives no support to Nikia as ghost. When she interrupts her rival’s wedding, the brass-heavy music makes no differentiation between her and Gamsatti. At first viewing, there’s so much to see in this “Bayadère” that you can forget about this ballet’s central problem today: a cultural imperialism that, despite sumptuous scenery and costumes, gives us a coarse cartoon idea of Indian culture. Petipa’s four acts are played with just one intermission, but some scene changes necessitate uncomfortably long pauses. Though Mr. Kaplan’s backdrops are splendidly picturesque, the stage’s wings are designed like tawdry interior décor. Solor’s opium chamber works poorly as a place either to receive Gamsatti or to envision Nikia. These flaws do not keep this production from being fascinating and impressive. This production, nonetheless, cannot solve the unevenness of “Bayadère” itself. An earlier version of this article misidentified the date of the final performance in a production of “La Bayadère” at Staatsballett Berlin. It is Feb. 9, not Feb. 2.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘A Christmas Carol in Harlem,’ Scrooge Wants to Make You Laugh","A gentle snow is falling as a child sings a holiday song on a city street, her small metal crutch laid on the ground beside the plastic cup she’s brought for donations. This is Tiny Timothia, and she’s trying to raise money for music lessons. But when her great-uncle, Scrooge, passes by and she tells him she’s busking, he begs to differ. “You mean begging,” he growls, and gives her nothing. In “A Christmas Carol in Harlem,” a new adaptation of the Dickens novella presented by the Classical Theater of Harlem and City College Center for the Arts, Scrooge is a contemporary tightwad of a deludedly selfish variety — the kind of guy who thinks he owes his material success to no one but himself, so would never dream of helping anyone out. This is willed amnesia, of course; Scrooge (Anthony Vaughn Merchant), who makes his money in real estate, has forgotten how vulnerable he once was, and how much kindness meant to him then. In Dickens’s telling, the Ghost of Christmas Past calls the mission to redeem Scrooge a “reclamation,” because once upon a time, he was warm and decent. He’s just lost his way. Truth be told, this brisk, 90-minute production — which the Classical Theater of Harlem hopes to nurture into an annual tradition — has yet to find its way. Directed by Steve H. Broadnax III at Aaron Davis Hall, it has a curiously unfestive air despite some lovely interspersed a cappella carols (the music director is Kahlil X Daniel) and dance (choreographed by Tiffany Rea-Fisher) that’s eye-catching from the opening scene, a balletic snow frolic. Part of the trouble is scenic: a plain set (by Izmir Ickbal) designed to accommodate plentiful projections (by Kate Ducey) that, in the cold electronic nature of the medium, feel at odds with a story that is so essentially about the human heart. Shawn René Graham’s script is problematic, too, whittling away at both the depth and number of characters. One significant figure she adds is Sierra Jones (Alexandria Danielle King), a community organizer whose purpose seems almost purely didactic. Tiny Timothia (Emery Jones) is an only child here, and the crowded Cratchit Christmas that Dickens made so joyous and instructive in love becomes a dour little affair. Mrs. Cratchit (Kenzie Ross) sounds like a health care ad as she lectures her husband, “You have a job and still can’t get necessary coverage, Bob.” Because Ms. Graham has made Bob (Jeffrey Rashad) Scrooge’s nephew, there is no traditional nephew Fred, and without him we don’t get the fun of Fred’s party scene. Scrooge’s fondly remembered old boss, Fezz (Daniel Echevarria), does make an appearance, but too briefly for his emotional importance to register. Feeling, unfortunately, goes by the wayside in this “Christmas Carol,” though it does have some fun with a roller-skating Spirit of Christmas Past (Brandon Gregory) and a shimmery, scene-stealing Spirit of Christmas Present (Jason C. Brown, glamorously costumed by Lex Liang). As for Scrooge, Mr. Merchant — a comic standout last summer in the Classical Theater of Harlem’s visually stunning “Antigone” — goes for laughs this time, too. His Scrooge doesn’t seem all that mean, but he never seems fully formed either. And if he’s merely a clown, how much can we care?

2018,"Review: In ‘All Is Calm,’ Thrilling Song in the Trenches","A caroling session in a melancholy key, Theater Latté Da’s “All is Calm: The Christmas Truce of 1914” is a World War I documentary musical describing a brief ceasefire. In 1914, with the war just five months old, enlisted men on both sides emerged from their no-man’s-land trenches on Christmas Day to bury their dead and exchange small gifts. Also, they sang, and if you had been standing in the mud and the cold near Ypres, Belgium, you could have heard those voices joined in “Auld Lang Syne” before the shells began to wail again. Theater Latté Da, a musical theater company based in Minneapolis, has been refilling this particular cup of kindness since 2007 before bringing it to the Sheen Center. On a mostly bare stage, dotted with packing crates and wreathed in haze, a chorus of ten men trade carols and popular songs in English, German and French. Occasionally one man will step forward and recite a short excerpt from a poem or a letter, the words bridging the 30-some songs. The arc of “All is Calm,” written and directed by Peter Rothstein, is coolly predictable, urging the men from enlistment to deployment to battle to détente to battle again, and the choice of song and excerpt aren’t so surprising either. You can count down the minutes until “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary” and “Keep the Home-Fires Burning” are heard, and of course the poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon put in appearances. (No Rupert Brooke? That is a surprise.) More extraordinary is the beauty of the songs, shrewdly arranged by Erick Lichte and Timothy C. Takach. The first song, the traditional Scots ballad “Will Ye Go to Flanders,” begins with a tenor’s youthful peal. But from one verse to the next, lower voices enter, and the final, lowering notes are given over to the bass alone, suggesting how hope curdles into bleakness. Mr. Lichte and Mr. Takach are similarly clever in the ordering and intercutting of the songs. Near the end of “All Is Calm,” they allow “Auld Lang Syne” to cede to “We’re Here Because We’re Here,” a bitter musical joke: An ode to fellowship and a ditty to futility, they share the same tune. The plangent tenors, lush baritones and rumbling basses are in excellent voice, and when they come together, the sensation is tremendous and the musical chill effect engulfing. I can’t have been the only person who spent the evening in a pretty much constant state of horripilation. The show is a lesson, if any were needed, in music as a vehicle for emotion. More than the story, it is the music that moves. For a musical about a war — or more precisely, a caesura between hostilities — “All Is Calm” is a staunchly apolitical and warily genteel work. The descriptions of battle are restrained, the poetic excerpts polite. The Western Front seems a very decent sort of place, no blown out brains or trenchfoot here. The moral — that if we could only see each other as people, as singers in the same song, war would cease — is unimpeachable and very nice. But a century later, does heavenly peace feel any closer?

2018,"Review: In ‘Daughters of the Sexual Revolution,’ Pompoms and Patriotism","Would that the title of “Daughters of the Sexual Revolution: The Untold Story of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders” had been edited as punchily as the movie it announces. Perky and informative, this gabby, gossipy documentary from Dana Adam Shapiro follows the founding and stratospheric rise of the original spangled squad and the controversies it kicked up with those famous white boots. The movie’s central dispute, though — were the women symbols of liberation or victims of exploitation? — remains unsettled, probably because the two options aren’t mutually exclusive. If Super Bowl X in 1976 made them lucrative TV-camera candy — especially the close-ups known as “honey shots” — they were still paid only $15 per game. Their indomitable director, Suzanne Mitchell (who ruled from 1976-89), might have fiercely protected their public image and private safety — at one point she describes taking on the mafia on their behalf — yet she also rigidly controlled their weight and even limited their water intake. You need training for the dehydration of dancing in 110-degree heat. Set against the sexual turbulence of the 1970s and ‘80s, when Roe v. Wade and “Debbie Does Dallas” were equally prominent, “Daughters” flows on the glowing memories of a parade of former cheerleaders. The tone is unabashedly partial, yet the women are such entertaining company it’s hard to mind. The affection they have for Mitchell (who died in 2016 and who lends this film its backbone) beams from the screen, as does their pride in the volunteer work that often took them overseas to buck up American troops. These recollections, backed by a treasure trove of archival footage, reveal a band of astonishingly hardworking young women, many with careers and all ferociously loyal to their brand and one another. “I was somebody, and that really was all that mattered,” one says. To have motives so clarifyingly pure, we should all be so lucky.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Enemies,’ There’s No Doubt Who’s the Enemy in Chief","Critic’s Pick “Enemies: The President, Justice & the F.B.I.” goes beyond ripped-from-the-headlines. It’s waiting for the headlines. With the Sword of Donald possibly hanging over the head of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Showtime attached a disclaimer to screeners of the fourth and final episode, saying it “will be updated to reflect current events in D.C.” Television documentaries these days are often about President Trump even when they aren’t. It’s unlikely that multiple shows would signal the 20th anniversary of Bill Clinton’s impeachment if the current office holder were less controversial. Charles Ferguson’s Watergate documentary series for the History Channel never mentioned Trump, but he was always there, just outside the frame. “Enemies,” arriving Sunday and directed by Jed Rothstein and the prolific Alex Gibney, doesn’t hesitate to talk about Trump — the in-progress fourth episode is entirely about his relationship with James Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired shortly after his inauguration. And he pops up in the earlier episodes, hourlong case studies of Watergate, Iran-contra and the scandals of the Clinton years: Cut from Trump complaining about a witch hunt to Clinton’s being questioned about Monica Lewinsky. Cut from Ronald Reagan denying knowledge of arms-for-hostages to Trump denying collusion with Russia. Based on the book “Enemies: A History of the F.B.I.” by Tim Weiner, a former investigative reporter for The New York Times, the series is more a survey course than a graduate seminar. Dramatic anecdotes and striking juxtapositions are more plentiful than deep analysis or striking insights. That’s not to say it isn’t serious — and more than a little alarmist — but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s punchy and to the point. In the historical episodes, it has some of the style and entertainment value of a breezier series on basic cable. A section on J. Edgar Hoover and the rise of the F.B.I. includes a priceless image of shirtless agents on the firing range, taking target practice while doing headstands and back bends. The interview subjects include Weiner and a number of retired F.B.I. agents, and each chapter is recounted through the prism of the bureau’s involvement. This can be disconcerting — it’s a new and not entirely convincing experience to see Watergate recounted with little or no reference to The Washington Post, the federal judge John Sirica or the Senate Watergate Committee. The F.B.I. played an important role in each of the series’s stories, but it wasn’t always central to an overall understanding of them. [Read our review of Charles Ferguson’s “Watergate.”] The larger story Gibney and his colleagues are telling is about the misuse of presidential power and the lies that are characteristically told to cover it up. Initially it’s the story of how those lies are uncovered, with the bureau’s help. In the present, the issue becomes whether anyone has the willpower and a sufficient sense of honor to fight against lies that are already out in the open. The supersized final episode (the preview cut is 97 minutes) looks back to the days after the 9/11 attacks, when a separation between the White House and the Justice Department that had existed since Watergate began to break down. Comey, then the deputy attorney general, and Mueller, then the director of the F.B.I., pushed back against the Bush administration’s domestic surveillance program. The series’s most engrossing sequence recounts the infamous 2004 encounter in the hospital room of the attorney general John Ashcroft, when administration members tried unsuccessfully to get Ashcroft to renew the surveillance program. Ashcroft, the Bush chief of staff Andrew Card and the Justice Department lawyer Jack Goldsmith, who were all in the room, give their accounts, alongside extracts from Comey’s memoir. (Comey declined to be interviewed for the series.) Emotions are still raw, and memories are conflicting. The one thing that seems clear is that the real hero, if there was one, was Ashcroft’s wife, Janet. The series is firmly on the side of limiting presidential power and holding presidents accountable when they break the law, though it gives screen time to figures whose views on the subject are ambiguous or openly contrarian, like the Reagan-era attorney general Edwin Meese and the Nixon and Trump ally Roger Stone. In the course of the final episode, while Comey’s motives and missteps are being dissected, the gloves fully come off with regard to Trump. As it stands, Weiner closes the series declaring that political institutions and the rule of law “are under attack by the president of the United States.” You’ll have to check back in four weeks to see if that’s still the last word. An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of an ally of President Trump’s. He is Roger Stone, not Robert.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Eve’s Song,’ the Ghosts Are Not the Scariest Part","Several sharp and funny reasons are offered in “Eve’s Song,” Patricia Ione Lloyd’s disconnected, macabre comedy at the Public Theater, as to why horror movies are nothing to be scared of if you’re African-American, at least not after the first five minutes. By that time, the only black character will surely have been killed off. As to the dangerous behavior pursued by the survivors — like setting up a bed-and-breakfast in an obviously haunted house, or hanging out in a graveyard — no sensible black person would do that. Or so says the 19-year-old Lauren (Kadijah Raquel) to her younger brother, Mark (Karl Green), after proposing a family fun night with a slasher video. Their mother, Deborah (De’Adre Aziza), provides further reassurance. “Our home is our safe place,” she says, like someone reciting a mantra. “Nothing bad can happen to us within these four walls.” But then why does that mysterious crack in their dining room wall, the one beneath the copy of Ellis Wilson’s “Funeral Procession,” keep growing larger? Why do the lights go out for no apparent reason? And what about those three spectral women who keep wandering through the room? In “Eve’s Song,” which opened on Wednesday night under the direction of Jo Bonney, it soon becomes clear that everyday reality holds terrors for Deborah and her children that Gothic Hollywood fare could never top. Why? Because they are black citizens of these United States. This savvy premise was deployed as the basis for “Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s inspired hit horror movie of last year. And in interviews, Ms. Lloyd, a Tow Foundation playwright in residence at the Public, has described “Eve’s Song” as a sort of “queer female version” of that film. Those three restless specters I mentioned earlier? They are “spirit women,” phantoms of people who died violently and arbitrarily. One was a lesbian (Rachel Watson-Jih), one a transgender woman (Tamara M. Williams) and one an old lady (Vernice Miller) whose apartment was invaded by police who mistakenly thought it was a drug den. Why and how they have wound up in Deborah’s home for other than symbolic purposes is never explained. They don’t interact with the family members, and deliver their short, angry monologues directly to the audience. Rather than participating in and propelling the plot, they function as annotations or exhibits of its principal themes, a set of illustrative ectoplasm. That gap between story and symbol is typical of “Eve’s Song,” which remains a smart, vivid concept still in search of full dramatic development. What it has to say about black lives in peril is genuinely terrifying, but mostly in the way that sobering statistics or news analyses are. The production — which features a mutable haunted house set by Riccardo Hernandez with lighting by Lap Chi Chu and projections by Hana S. Kim — begins in a promisingly satirical vein, as the family gathers around the dinner table. Deborah, a business executive, has recently been left by her husband, and she’s doing her best to hold on to the illusion of a stable, wholesome middle-class life. Little things — like the ceremonial unfolding of napkins and pushing one’s chair neatly under the table — mean a lot to Deborah, played with a witty, fast-fading sitcom brightness by Ms. Aziza. She also insists on maintaining a flow of polite conversation about how everybody’s day was. What this family says and what it thinks, though, are entirely different. And each member is given a spotlighted moment to tell us what’s really on her or his mind. For Deborah, it’s the increasing racial insensitivity and sexual harassment she experiences at work, incidents she chooses to ignore as much as possible. “No one gets ahead by reporting things,” she says. Her policy of denial is challenged by Lauren’s new (and first) girlfriend, the self-named, radiantly confident Upendo (Ashley D. Kelley), an opinionated community organizer who is a figure of both parodied pretentiousness and life-altering wisdom. (It is Upendo who explains the play’s title, which refers to how black women find their own inner, eternal music as they die.) That’s a tough double burden for any performer to pull off. Ms. Kelley (who appealingly played the title character in Kirsten Childs’s “Bella: An American Tall Tale” last season) doesn’t manage to reconcile the ambivalence with which her character has been written. But she’s a convincing object of desire for Lauren, who is still trying to figure out the specifics of her sexuality. It is as a lesbian identity story that “Eve’s Song” works best. The show is never more winning or convincing than when we’re allowed to spend time in Lauren’s head as she sorts out just who she wants to be. Ms. Raquel, a recent graduate of the State University of New York at Purchase, gives such a likably direct performance that you root for her throughout, even when her character makes some unlikely emotional U-turns. A soliloquy in which Lauren, who has joined Upendo in a protest “lie-in” on the streets, imagines herself dead is chilling in ways that the supernatural elements here never are. And it’s far more upsetting than even the climactic tragedy that ends this show. Her delivery is neither hysterical nor melodramatic as she envisions her own corpse in physically graphic terms. She’s pragmatically contemplating a possibility, of dying at the hands of the police, that seems all too plausible in this country, at this moment. That Lauren’s fears are realistic is a whole lot scarier than any cavalcade of ghosts. This information was last updated on Oct. 9, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Natural Shocks,’ a Storm Is Coming","Clattering down the wooden steps into her basement, a woman named Angela is fleeing a storm. It’s a tornado, she says, talking to … herself? Nope, she’s talking to the audience. Are we meant to be in the basement with her? From our auditorium seats, it doesn’t feel remotely like we are. Lauren Gunderson’s “Natural Shocks,” a monologue starring Pascale Armand in its world-premiere production for WP Theater, is an issue play that wants to be socially meaningful, with a would-be shocking ending that shatters the metaphor of the storm. I won’t give away that twist, though that also means I can’t say what the issue is, except that it is feminist. If its storytelling worked, “Natural Shocks” would land potently on multiple levels. Yet this show, directed by May Adrales at the McGinn/Cazale Theater, contains vast stretches of tedium — the standard beige variety, not the provocative experimental kind. And its construction is awfully rickety. “Did I mention this is a tornado?” Angela asks, shortly after telling us the first time. “Sorry,” she says. “I do that. I rush ahead. You’re like: ‘You said disaster but didn’t specify.’” It’s a head-scratching repetition in the play’s opening minutes, and it made me wonder if Ms. Armand, a Tony Award nominee for “Eclipsed,” had messed up her earlier line. She hadn’t. Ms. Gunderson is the most produced playwright in the United States in the 2017-18 season, according to American Theater magazine, which always takes Shakespeare out of the running so that someone else can win. “Natural Shocks,” unfortunately, won’t help to explain her popularity. The storm is not the only thing here that’s heavy-handedly symbolic. Angela is an insurance agent who used to be a croupier. Risk is her métier. She collects dice, knows at least several deeply lame insurance jokes and blathers casually to us about her work. It’s less than scintillating, and not terribly credible when a dangerous storm — or whatever has really driven Angela into the basement — is bearing down. Little wonder that Ms. Armand, who was shaky on some dialogue at the performance I saw, only occasionally finds ways to connect with the script. The set designer, Lee Savage, has given Angela a neatly cluttered basement whose single cramped window glows with a thin, eerie yellow light (by Amith Chandrashaker) that is the precise color I have thought of since my Midwestern childhood as tornado sky. If only the text were as spot on in its execution of metaphor. Very close to the end of this 75-minute play, Ms. Gunderson does a switcheroo that makes clear what’s really happening and who Angela’s listeners are meant to be. But that doesn’t erase the hour-plus that “Natural Shocks” spends flailing. The sudden, audible presence of a violent threat doesn’t automatically lend tension to the plot, or stakes to the life of a character we don’t believe. The perverse narrative function of the menace stalking Angela is to swoop in like a deus ex machina, attempting in vain to rescue the play.

2018,"Review: In ‘Relations,’ 3 Choreographers Improvise Like Family","CHICAGO — Ralph Lemon, Bebe Miller and Ishmael Houston-Jones have been friends for a long time, since at least the early 1980s. But until a few days ago, these celebrated choreographers had never danced with one another in front of an audience. How had this not happened before? And will it happen again? To wish for more is perhaps to miss out on the full beauty of “Relations,” a program lasting just two nights, Friday and Saturday, in which the artists came together to improvise at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Like any improvisational work, this one was about being there then, both for the performers and the audience — about making choices in the moment and watching that process unfold, as unpredictable and unrepeatable as life. The program grew out of a conversation between the curator Tara Willis and Mr. Houston-Jones, a longtime improviser in New York’s experimental dance scene. In 1982 Mr. Houston-Jones organized Parallels, a groundbreaking series featuring black choreographers who, like him, were working outside of the modern-dance mainstream. Among those colleagues were Ms. Miller and Mr. Lemon. Now in their 60s, the three are like family, or so it seemed on Saturday as they supported, teased, challenged, embraced, evaded and grappled with one another. (I didn’t see Friday’s show, but Mr. Lemon described it as the more “kumbaya” of the two.) Like most familial relationships, theirs were complicated, at least as they played out onstage, capable of holding affection and aggression, intimacy and distance, compassion and conflict, all at once. And just as their shared histories were colliding, so were their varied sensibilities: Mr. Lemon’s careful stealth; Ms. Miller’s luxuriant abandon; Mr. Houston-Jones’s recklessness and dry humor. As Mr. Lemon noted during Saturday’s lively post-show discussion, “We’re being grouped because that’s racially what has happened, but we’re all really different body-minds.” (Of the three, he said, he was the least comfortable with improvising, reluctant to perform without a plan.) Spending an hour with these artists felt at once ordinary and momentous. As the audience filed in, Mr. Houston-Jones sat alone in a corner, looking at his phone. His companions arrived with just as little fanfare. Also onstage: a record player and records; three wooden chairs; two plywood boards; and a standing microphone. The performers could engage with these, or not, just as they could engage with one another, or not. Someone might put on a song (Grace Jones, Roland Hayes) and shake up the mood. When Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” came on, the first line rang comically true: “There’s something happening here.” There were moments of tenderness: Mr. Lemon crawling as Ms. Miller leaned on him, releasing her weight into his back; Ms. Miller and Mr. Houston-Jones strolling side by side, as he bit into an apple and wryly observed, “This is biblical.” At times darker energies took over. As the end neared, Mr. Houston-Jones worked himself into a violent frenzy. Ms. Miller came to his side, as if not to leave him stranded in pain, but he had already gone somewhere on his own. When, coming to, he noticed his shoe was untied, Mr. Lemon knelt to tie it, then reinforced the other. Through tension and turbulence, a basic care for one another never faltered. Ms. Miller, Mr. Lemon and Mr. Houston-Jones have all been mentors to younger artists, many of whom were in the audience on Saturday. Even as “Relations” ended, it didn’t really, remaining alive in the bodies and minds of those who were there.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Brutes,’ the Actor Who Would Be an Assassin","On the late November night in 1864 when a band of Southern rebels lighted blazes all over Manhattan, trying to burn the city down, the Booth brothers were onstage in Greenwich Village, doing a benefit performance of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar.” The great actor Edwin Booth, who for a few more months would be the most famous of the siblings, calmed the audience of thousands when the fire alarm rang out. He was starring as Brutus that evening, while his brother John Wilkes Booth — not yet President Lincoln’s assassin, not until April — played Marc Antony, with their older brother Junius Brutus Booth Jr. as Cassius. In retrospect, it’s an irresistibly dramatic scenario: siblings who split between the Union and Confederate sides in a violently divided country, enacting a tragedy about political conspiracy as a real-life plot bursts into flames around them. This is the tale that Casey Wimpee’s “The Brutes” tells, in a Spit & Vigor production at the New Ohio Theater in the West Village. Directed by Sara Fellini, it would seem potentially well matched to both this time of year and our foully antagonistic national mood. But even when the Booths sit down together for Thanksgiving dinner, and Wilkes, as they call him, provokes a fight about the war, this labored, fragmented play remains frustratingly inert, weighed down by a surfeit of story. Hamlet was one of Edwin Booth’s greatest roles, and in “The Brutes” Edwin (Adam Belvo) keeps encountering the drunken ghost of his famous actor father (Eamon Murphy) backstage, stalking around like Hamlet’s dead dad. These bits and the plentiful excerpts from “Julius Caesar” feel, even if you know both plays, like an enervating amount of Shakespeare out of context. And when Wilkes (Colt W. Keeney), as Antony, stands over the body of Caesar (JD Martin) and speaks a version of a famous speech, Mr. Wimpee’s tweaking of the text is unnecessarily heavy-handed: “the Southern spirit, ranging for revenge, with Stonewall by its side come hot from hell, shall in these confines with a rebel yell, cry ‘havoc!’ and let slip the dogs of war.” The paradox of this production, performed in the round on an almost bare stage, is that despite the closeness of the action, the play itself feels remote. With a cast of 12, including Ms. Fellini as the Booth sister Asia and a chorus of four who double as scheming Confederates, it’s too crowded with people we don’t know well enough to care about. We also don’t particularly gain understanding of the most inherently intriguing characters — Edwin, Wilkes and Asia, who is fondly devoted to Wilkes — or the relationships between them. Before the show begins, Ms. Fellini warns the audience that the performance will include flashing lights and caps fired. There’s something else, though, that could be legitimately upsetting: when fire breaks out during the benefit, and we are urged variously to exit (“Get out of your seats! Go! Go!”) and to remain calm. Why even toy with that? Of all the valuable sensations this show might evoke, panic in the crowd is not among them.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Grief of Others,’ Mourning Becomes Eclectic","The different ways we mourn, or are unable to do so, lie at the heart of Patrick Wang’s “The Grief of Others,” a family drama that opens with a mysterious image of death: The camera looks up silently at two women gently saying goodbye to an unseen patient. We do not know yet who the patient is; the answer to that question will turn out to be heartbreaking. “The Grief of Others” had its festival premiere in 2015, but is only receiving a domestic theatrical release now, perhaps in an effort to piggyback on potential buzz around Wang’s most recent film, the ambitious “A Bread Factory.” And as anybody who has seen that picture can attest, the director doesn’t go for low-hanging emotional fruit. Here, working from a novel by Leah Hager Cohen, he is not interested in melodrama so much as in the curious absence of it, as he explores the unlikely ways that grief manifests itself in a family that is coming apart at the seams. Ricky Ryrie (Wendy Moniz) and her husband John (Trevor St. John) barely seem to talk to one another, while their young daughter Biscuit (Oona Laurence) appears to be indulging in self-destructive behavior and their adolescent son Paul (Jeremy Shinder) has closed himself off. Into this low boiling chaos walks Jess (Sonya Harum), John’s pregnant teenage daughter from a previous relationship, who seems to have a complicated history with the Ryries but is invited to stay with them during her pregnancy. Early on, Jess befriends Gordie (Mike Faist), a young man who is also dealing with loss; his home is still filled with piles of his recently deceased father’s stuff, including a series of handmade dioramas built out of assorted junk. Those eclectic dioramas serve as a playful aesthetic reference point for Wang’s film, which mixes styles and modes. Though we are watching what often appear to be unnervingly even-keeled characters, sometimes we’ll glimpse a painful flashback, or hear a person’s true thoughts. In one marvelous instance, the family gathers in their kitchen, and then, as they leave the room, a part of the frame opens up to reveal the scene’s touching conclusion elsewhere. As with the director’s other works, there’s a self-conscious, constructed quality to “The Grief of Others,” but it rarely veers into the precious or the phony. It’s an artful portrait of a world that refuses the order we try to impose on it when we close ourselves off to heartache, doubt and pain.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Little Drummer Girl,’ Spycraft Is Seduction","The Korean art-house director Park Chan-wook — best known for his baroquely violent revenge sagas (“Oldboy,” “Lady Vengeance”) and an outré erotic thriller (“The Handmaiden”), all punctuated by spasms of the darkest possible humor — might seem like an odd match for a John le Carré spy novel about an Israeli team chasing Palestinian terrorists in 1979. But “The Little Drummer Girl,” published in 1983, is not just any spy story, and you can see what may have drawn Park to adapt it for television, in a six-hour, three-night mini-series beginning Monday on AMC. While it’s as suspenseful as any Le Carré plot, it’s structured less around spycraft than around a series of seductions, overlapping and conflicting, that allow Park to indulge his fondness for moments of heightened melodrama. More crucially, it’s a story about the intersection of espionage and theater — the ways in which spies are actors and actors are spies, both trained to investigate, deceive and live false lives. Le Carré makes this idea literal, with an Israeli counterterrorism team recruiting a young actress, through their own elaborate process of deception and staging, and persuading her to infiltrate a Palestinian network planning attacks in Europe. That premise, with both sides participating in what the Israeli spymaster, Kurtz (Michael Shannon), calls “the theater of the real,” meshes with Park’s predispositions toward theatricality and artifice. The result is a superior entertainment, beautifully made and engrossing throughout (and an improvement in nearly every way on the 1984 film directed by George Roy Hill). [Read Park Chan-wook’s take on his first TV show.] It won’t please every Le Carré fan, and it doesn’t do justice — doesn’t try to do justice, really — to one important aspect of his story, regarding the emotional fallout for the civilian once she’s gone all the way into the spies’ world. Somewhat perversely, given its subject, it’s not an acting showcase — it’s bound together by Park’s style and technique, and no performer stands out like Diane Keaton did in Hill’s film (she was the only thing worth watching). But on its own terms, this “Little Drummer Girl” is a success. The fulcrum of the story is Charlie (Florence Pugh), a young British actress with leftist leanings, who comes on the radar of the Israeli team when she attends a lecture given by a disguised Palestinian. She’s exactly what Kurtz is looking for: talented, attractive and passionate, with a free-floating anger at the world that can, with the necessary work, be pointed in the direction he needs. The work, once Charlie has been lured in, falls to Gadi (Alexander Skarsgard), another Israeli agent. Charlie will need to pose as the lover of a terrorist she hasn’t met, and Gadi prepares her by playing the part of the Palestinian, teaching her what she needs to know and priming her emotionally to play her role. It’s a performance and, like any good performance, a seduction, and the degree to which it’s real is a question whose consequences keep playing out after Charlie has moved into the terrorists’ world. A large part of the work of “The Little Drummer Girl” is stage management — coherently and entertainingly navigating a complicated narrative that involves Charlie and her handlers; the Israeli, German and British intelligence services that help and hinder them; and the Palestinians, who gain prominence in the later episodes when Charlie becomes fully embedded, training at a camp in Lebanon and inching closer to the terrorist leader Kurtz and Gadi are pursuing. Park does right by the suspense components. We always know where we are and (to the extent we’re supposed to) what’s happening, and in his first episodic TV project (working with the writers Michael Lesslie and Claire Wilson, and Mr. Le Carré’s sons Simon and Stephen Cornwell as executive producers), he shapes the material well over the six hours, avoiding dead spots. But Park does it his own way, and the story and the themes, while meticulously rendered, are never entirely the focus. You also notice the slightly dreamy, dissociated atmosphere he conjures, even in familiar scenes of surveillance and investigation or military training, and his occasionally eccentric choices, like a chaotic capture filmed from a great distance, or a sudden shot in which Charlie’s eye stares out from inside the gasping mouth of a man she’s having sex with. While he dives into the theme of theatricality, Park doesn’t seem as interested in the particularities of acting. Pugh is fine as a stubborn, opinionated young woman pulled into an unexpected adventure, but we’re not really given evidence of Charlie’s performing skills, and Le Carré’s notions about the toll on her — the likely consequences of bringing the passions of performance into the high-stakes, real-life world of terrorism — are mostly unexamined. Park has fashioned an ending, presumably with Le Carré’s approval, that’s quite different in tone from the original, but moving and effective in its own right. Like everything else about “The Little Drummer Girl,” it’s entirely his.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Price of Free,’ Saving Children Who Are Factory Slaves","Even an extraordinary person doesn’t necessarily make for a dynamic movie subject. That appears to the case with Kailash Satyarthi, an activist in India who was one of two Nobel Peace Prize winners in 2014 and has devoted his career to rescuing children working as factory slaves. He is the focus of “The Price of Free,” a routine awareness documentary. It is difficult to argue with the premises that child labor is wrong; that everyone deserves an education; and that persons who risk their lives to rescue trafficked children — as we see Satyarthi and others in his organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, doing in the film — are selfless and worthy of the world’s attention. But because of this, watching “The Price of Free” is largely a process of nodding in agreement. The director, Derek Doneen, adds a bit of striking animation for flashbacks, and there are a few strands that generate tension. A village head arrives at Satyarthi’s ashram to retrieve rescued children, ostensibly to return them to their homes; Satyarthi is duly skeptical. And the film focuses with particular intensity — with the help of clandestinely shot footage — on the search for one boy named Sonu. Mostly, however, “The Price of Free” is interested in spreading the word about Satyarthi’s work, both in India and globally, and in getting consumers to approach what they buy with a critical eye, so as not to support child labor. That’s an important message, and it’s not essential to watch the movie to receive it.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Thanksgiving Play,’ Who Gets Roasted?","Just because a target’s too easy doesn’t mean it won’t make a satisfying meal. Take turkeys, or the holiday they stand for. In Larissa FastHorse’s “The Thanksgiving Play,” which opened on Monday at Playwrights Horizons, the familiar, whitewashed story of Pilgrims and Native Americans chowing down together gets a delicious roasting from expert farceurs. But Thanksgiving is not the only object of the satire, and to the extent the play sometimes seems to miss its mark, it’s because the mark keeps moving. Clearly, Ms. FastHorse, a member of the Sicangu Lakota nation of South Dakota, is aiming for a takedown of American mythology — white American mythology, that is. The national narcissism, bordering on sociopathy, that could turn theft and genocide into a feel-good feast is her play’s point of entry. Also in her sights: cursory diversity initiatives that despite their good intentions impede real progress, particularly in the theater. Of course, theater artists have long been treasured as juicy quarry for satire, with or without the politics. And the four who are gathered in “The Thanksgiving Play” are woeful even in the annals of backstage comedies like “The Producers,” “Noises Off” and “Stage Kiss.” Logan (Jennifer Bareilles) is a drama teacher hoping to “devise” the best and most culturally sensitive elementary school Thanksgiving pageant ever, one that will honor Native American Heritage Month as well. She’s also trying to restore her reputation after a recent production of “The Iceman Cometh” led 300 parents to sign a petition calling for her firing. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Assisting her is her boyfriend, Jaxton (Greg Keller), an actor, yoga dude and “vegan ally” whose gift to Logan on the first day of rehearsal is a Mason jar “made with recycled glass from broken windows in housing projects.” Also contributing is Caden (Jeffrey Bean), a third-grade teacher and frustrated playwright who suggests they open with a scene set 4,000 years ago. Noting that all three of them are white — and mindful of the terms of her Go! Girls! Scholastic Leadership Mentorship grant — Logan has hired a genuine Los Angeles actor, Alicia, to “lift up” the Native American point of view. But Alicia (Margo Seibert) is more of a multipurpose “super-flexible” ethnic type than an actual indigenous person. Still, having been the third Jasmine understudy in “Aladdin” at Disneyland, she doesn’t see what all the fuss is about. “Is Lumière a real candlestick?” she asks. While processing that — and trying to deal with the effect the bubble-headed Alicia has on the men — Logan has to figure out whether it’s possible to create a Thanksgiving pageant sensitive to Native American concerns with no Native Americans in the room. After a series of tortured mental exercises, including improv sessions in a “world of yes,” she ends up reaching the illogical logical conclusion that the only way to honor the erasure of indigenous peoples is by erasing them again. That isn’t as much of an exaggeration as it seems. The renowned Quebec theater director Robert Lepage was recently criticized for “Kanata,” a work about Indigenous Canadians that somehow neglected to include any. And Ms. FastHorse says that the main obstacle she faces in having her plays about Native Americans produced is that companies find them “uncastable.” “The Thanksgiving Play” is a clever workaround, written to be performed by an all-white cast and thus to make hay of an absence that would otherwise be a liability. Or perhaps what it means to make is mincemeat: The ridiculous agonizing of the four “teaching artists” produces brutal laughs at the expense of well-meaning liberals who conceal ordinary prejudice under the mask of “performative wokeness.” They want to help but in their fear of offending are the least helpful of all. That this aspect of the satire works as well as it does is a credit to the swift pacing of Moritz von Stuelpnagel’s production and the acuity of his casting. Mr. Keller, whose résumé is filled with slackers, bros and skeeves, concocts in Jaxton an artisanal blend of all three: sincere insincerity served in a Mason jar. Ms. Bareilles and Mr. Bean are both expert in letting their characters’ inner turmoil — exactly what they most hide — leak out. But oddly it is Ms. Seibert as the dim Alicia, content to be pretty and confident in her shallow ambition, who delivers the deepest characterization. She may not really understand why a Native American is different from a candlestick, but she’s ready to act any scene put before her, especially if she gets to cry. The problem for “The Thanksgiving Play” is that, in splitting its satirical attention, it shortchanges the nominal subject. Though the one-note wrangling of the teaching artists is amusing, the absence of characters who could meaningfully oppose their dead-end liberal agenda leaves a hole at the heart of the story. I sometimes had the sour feeling I get when watching hidden-camera videos of people behaving badly; a little goes a long way. Here, a lot goes too far. That was Ms. FastHorse’s dramaturgical trade-off. And, by the way, there’s a lot of inside-theater comedy here, including jokes about dramaturges that may sail past civilians. It’s only when the play, in a series of skits between scenes, takes off its gloves and aims squarely at its real subject — racism — that the comedy becomes something more salient, if unfunny. These skits are selections from actual lesson plans and Pinterest boards posted by teachers to share ideas for classroom Thanksgiving activities. They include potted history and offensive ditties and, in one case, a suggestion to split the pupils into Pilgrims and Indians “so the Indians can practice sharing.” Satire doesn’t get much richer than that.

2018,"Review: In ‘XENOS,’ a Dancer Turns Troubled Warrior","Akram Khan’s “XENOS” begins pleasantly, with a concert of Indian classical music in progress as the audience walks in. The sound and the colors are warm, enveloping; the vocalist Aditya Prakas and percussionist BC Manjunath sit on the floor of what looks like a lavish living room. But periodically lightning seems to strike the stage, and static drowns out their music, foretelling the struggle and isolation to come. “Xenos” is Greek for stranger or foreigner, and in this affecting but at times overbearing work, which had its United States premiere on Wednesday at the White Light Festival at Lincoln Center, Mr. Khan embodies a lost, tortured soul. Billed as his final full-length solo — he is 44 and, understandably, ready to give his body a rest — the show draws from stories of the more than one million Indian soldiers enlisted by the British in World War I. In an interview in the program, Mr. Khan, who grew up in London with Bangladeshi parents, said he was shocked to learn of these soldiers only a few years ago, that he hadn’t known this part of history. “The untold stories need to be told,” he said. His character appears to be a dancer forced into war. In the opening scene, Mr. Khan dances alongside the musicians, juxtaposing elements of Kathak, North India’s classical dance form, with less elegant stumbles and falls. From Kathak’s swift spins and rhythmic footwork, joyous in other contexts, he wrests confusion, rage. When he unwraps his ankle bells, holding a strand in each hand, they resemble chains. This intensity rarely lets up over the 65-minute production. In a literal tearing apart of his world, the living room set is pulled up a slope at the back of the stage at Frederick P. Rose Hall, until nothing remains but a barren, soil-strewn trench. (Mirella Weingarten designed the elaborate, evocative scenery, which also allows for five musicians, at times, to appear hovering like ghosts above the action.) This desolate landscape is where most of the work unfolds, a portrait of entrapment and endlessness. Is there any escape? Any return to what came before? When Mr. Khan mimes cradling a child, or whirls in breathtakingly rapid circles, he seems to be cycling through memories of a bygone life. In Vincenzo Lamagna’s ominous score, drumbeats blur with gunfire. A voice-over heard earlier lingers in the mind: “Do not think that this is war. It is not war. It is the ending of the world.” At its best, “XENOS” transmits a sense of relentless uncertainty, raising the question of whether death, under certain circumstances, might be better than living. Yet the work’s melodrama, as Mr. Khan staggers, shell shocked, through this hostile space, undercuts its power, particularly in the final scene. A more poetic potential end comes just before: The stage has emptied, Mr. Khan has disappeared, and a gramophone — doubling as a searchlight — scans the darkened theater, shining into the unknown.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Joan Didion’s ‘The White Album,’ Now in Living Color","Artists like to wrestle with strong texts; it’s good exercise for them. But what does it do for the audience? What value is added, for instance, to Joan Didion’s classic essay “The White Album” by turning it into a piece of theater? After all, you can read the original easily enough on your own. Or, right now, as part of a trial offer from Audible, you can hear it recited, if somewhat dryly, by the actress Susan Varon for free. Neither of those experiences will be especially visual, so one enhancement provided by the elaborate production of “The White Album” that opened on Wednesday night as part of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music is something spectacular to keep your eyes busy. To begin with, at center stage, there is a kind of glass house — the kind whose inhabitants shouldn’t throw stones. Over the course of the 90-minute work, this structure, designed by the P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S architectural firm, will represent several locales, including the Los Angeles home Ms. Didion lived in during the period covered by her essay. But it also represents the essay’s central theme: The attempt to corral chaotic experience within the architecture of storytelling. For Ms. Didion, that was not just a literary but a spiritual exercise, conducted in opposition to what she calls the “accidie” — the moral torpor — of the late 1960s. Her essay, a triumph of New Journalism, crosscuts scenes involving Huey Newton, the Doors, campus protests and the Tate-LaBianca murders with descriptions of her own physical ailments and moral confusion. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] But as staged by Lars Jan for his Early Morning Opera company, the connective tissue is missing. He does give us, as Ms. Didion, the actress Mia Barron, reciting (from memory) the essay in its entirety. Though this figure occasionally enters the action or, at one astonishing moment stands atop it, she for the most part exists in her own world, well apart from the house in which Mr. Jan creates illustrations of her words. The glass panels give those illustrations the boxed appearance of a comic strip, as does the often buffoonish action within them. Jim Morrison flies through a Doors recording session like a child playing a superhero; campus radicals write empty watchcries on a whiteboard. When the essay reaches its climax in the Charles Manson material, Mr. Jan counters with a grotesque cartoon shootout between a police officer and a protester, complete with Tarantino-style spatterings of blood. But it’s the text that is killed, by literal upstaging. That’s a shame, because Ms. Barron, dressed like Ms. Didion in a sweater and long skirt, recites it beautifully, with just the right ratio of reserve and terror you might have imagined when reading it in print. And no one could say that Ms. Barron, who is credited along with Mr. Jan as a creator of the piece, hogs the spotlight. (In fact, the lighting design, by Andrew Schneider and Chu-hsuan Chang, often leaves her in the dark.) Perhaps it is a relief to her when snippets of the original text that represent dialogue — what a doctor tells her, what Huey Newton says at a news conference — are ladled out to four performers who portray many of the ancillary characters. It’s not a relief for us, though. The fragmentation of the storytelling seems to undermine Ms. Didion’s authority, not to mention her coherence. This unfortunate effect is enhanced by another of Mr. Jan’s notions: the addition of a second (or “inner”) audience of volunteers who participate in the show. At first they do so merely by watching it picturesquely while sitting on the floor of the stage, but later they are herded into the box to serve as extras in party scenes and as student protesters at San Francisco State College. I suppose this inner audience is meant to connect our time to that one. But like many once avant-garde notions — the Next Wave Festival has become a museum of them — the idea is more satisfying than the reality. I found my mind wandering from questions of apathy and political engagement to questions of stage management. How do those 20 or so volunteers know when to rise, when to shout, when to do a little dance? In any case, Mr. Jan’s use of them cuts against Ms. Didion’s premise. As written, “The White Album” suggests that the root of the anomie and paranoia of the 1960s was conformism: the stories Americans had for decades been told to tell themselves. By the time the era ended for most people — Ms. Didion pinpoints the day as Aug. 9, 1969, when the Manson murders occurred — that mandate was just beginning to lose its grip. We now live in the aftermath of that seismic change: no less of a hell, perhaps, but a fresh one. The avant-garde, at least as purveyed here, is way too old hat to capture it.

2019,"Review: Lenny Bruce’s Shifting Legacy, in ‘I’m Not a Comedian’","Ronnie Marmo’s new solo show opens cold with its punch line. And a tragic one it is: Mr. Marmo is sitting on a toilet, naked and motionless. It is an arresting still life of Lenny Bruce’s death, by morphine overdose, in 1966. What follows is essentially a 90-minute setup. This bioplay, “I’m Not a Comedian … I’m Lenny Bruce,” which Mr. Marmo also wrote, tries to retrace the life and art of that prototypical shock humorist and de facto free-speech crusader. But despite a structural conceit that establishes the action as an exercise in deterministic tragedy, the show, directed by Joe Mantegna and marred by a mawkish underscore, lacks propulsive energy. It isn’t very funny, either, which may have something to do with Bruce’s material: It’s simultaneously ahead of its time and dated. The people defending Bruce from accusations of obscenity and provocation in the 1960s would now be likely to attack his right to use racial epithets. Mr. Marmo alternates between narrating — using news accounts, legal transcripts and the comedian’s own words as much as possible — and performing excerpts from Bruce’s act. Appropriately, perhaps, the show runs not at a traditional theater but at the clublike Cutting Room, complete with drinks and a pu pu platter on the menu. The Bruce we first meet — well, after he’s gotten up from that toilet and put on some clothes — is a suave hep cat. Wearing a crisp white shirt, skinny black tie and tailored black suit, he speaks with the languid, affected delivery of a practiced lounge lizard. Recalling his mother, Sally Marr, a comic herself, he notes that she would go on to discover “well-known cats like Sam Kinison, Pat Morita, Cheech and Chong.” (Marr was a bit of a legend in comedy circles, so much so that in 1994 Joan Rivers played her in the Broadway show “Sally Marr … and Her Escorts.”) There is ominous foreshadowing, too, as when Bruce describes earning his first laugh: “It’s like that flash I’ve heard morphine addicts describe,” he says. That will do for insight. When Mr. Marmo turns to his mike stand, we know he’s switching to stand-up mode, again sticking to the Bruce script. Some of the excerpts, like the infamous monologue about using epithets to strip them of their power, still deliver a surprise jab: At last Thursday’s performance, the first racial slur elicited audible gasps, which disappeared once the audience got used to the onslaught of insults. The words don’t get much laughter, though. The routine feels more editorial than comic now, a mirthless salvo about the power of language that, paradoxically, may make some modern pundits wonder whether speech should always be free. Bruce’s deification as a boundary-defying iconoclast began not long after his death — Bob Fosse directed a biopic starring Dustin Hoffman in 1974 — and continued unabated into the 2000s. A dozen years ago, Jason Fisher brought back some of his best riffs in the Off Broadway show “Lenny Bruce: In His Own Words.” Steve Cuiffo recreated, verbatim, Bruce’s 1961 Carnegie Hall performance on its 50-year anniversary. Much of the standup in “I’m Not a Comedian … I’m Lenny Bruce” is fairly familiar, and the show does not shed any new light on its subject’s all-too-familiar demons. But it does make you mull Bruce’s legacy. He was a man of his time. Ours has moved on in a direction he could not have imagined in his wildest dreams — or nightmares.

2019,Review: Lessons in Love From a Drama Queen in ‘Torch Song’,"Critic’s Pick In life, drama queens, those extravagantly emotional beings who suck up all the oxygen in a room, are fatiguing souls, to be avoided at all costs when one is tired. But, ah, in fiction — in books and film, and especially on the stage — these same creatures can be an energizing joy, as stimulating as four shots of espresso. That’s why I am advising you to make the acquaintance of a grade-A specimen of this spectacular genus, whose presence is overflowing the Helen Hayes Theater. His undramatic name is Arnold Beckoff, though he also goes by the more promising moniker of Virginia Ham. And, as embodied by Michael Urie in the happy revival of Harvey Fierstein’s “Torch Song,” which opened on Thursday night, Arnold is just the guy and gal to pull you out of your election-season weariness. He may also cause you to shed a few sentimental tears, but isn’t that what you expect of a drama queen? And wait until you meet Arnold’s mother, who is played, if you please, by Mercedes Ruehl. Though a slender fellow, Mr. Urie reads so exultantly big in this production that you almost forget the man who indelibly created Arnold. That’s Mr. Fierstein, the author and original star of “Torch Song Trilogy,” as it was known when it shook up Broadway in the early 1980s, copping Tony Awards for best play and best leading actor in a play. A portrait of a lovelorn, nice Jewish boy who works as a gender illusionist, that original production took mainstream theatergoers to places few had visited before, including (hilariously) a bar back room for the purposes of sweaty, anonymous sex. Yet Mr. Fierstein’s Arnold clearly belonged to a breed that Broadway has always celebrated. I mean those natural-born stage stars who are both inescapably odd and embraceably accessible, like Carol Channing and Zero Mostel, who make eccentricities more commanding than beauty. The strapping Mr. Fierstein, with his foghorn voice and borscht belt timing, gave the world a drag queen that every mother could love, and a script with the zing of an R-rated Neil Simon comedy. Mr. Fierstein went on to become nearly as much a staple of the mainstream theatrical landscape as Mr. Simon, both as a performer (“Hairspray”) and as a book-writer for musicals (“La Cage aux Folles”). Because of his singular status, there was some skepticism when it was announced that “Torch Song” would be part of Second Stage Theater’s Off Broadway season last year. Yet that revival, directed by Moisés Kaufman, became such a hit that it was decided to move it for a limited run to Second Stage’s new Broadway digs, the Helen Hayes. I admired its unexpected intimacy and intensity last year, especially in the scenes between Mr. Urie and Ms. Ruehl. Mr. Kaufman’s staging — still designed to please the eye without overwhelming it, with 1970s shorthand sets by David Zinn, costumes to match by Clint Ramos and lighting by David Lander — now feels smoother and quicker on its feet. It also feels, well, bigger. I’m referring particularly to Mr. Urie’s performance. This nimble actor has already demonstrated canny comic chops in Off Broadway plays (Jonathan Tolins’s “Buyer & Cellar,” Gogol’s “The Government Inspector.”) But in filling Mr. Fierstein’s dauntingly big shoes on a Broadway stage, Mr. Urie stretches to color in the outsize outlines of his part. This might have led to a strained, shrill performance. Instead, it has inspired a seriously entertaining interpretation of living large as a proactive defense against feeling small. “A model is,” Arnold explains to a young man of that profession. “A drag queen aspires.” And as we follow the chapters of Arnold’s rocky relationship with a closeted schoolteacher, Ed (Ward Horton, pitch perfect as an almost-straight man), Mr. Urie finds a physical grandeur in such aspiration. Even without the wigs and tarantula eyelashes of his performing alter ego, Arnold is a preternaturally heightened figure, only rarely without the battle gear of exaggeration and melodrama. His approach to life seems to be that to inflate — problems, pain, indecision — is to deflate. Hyperbole, after all, makes targets more hittable. This means that Arnold never walks when he can bound or caper; never mists up when he can bawl; never simply says “mmm-hmm” in conversation when he can trump whatever’s been said with a top-spun joke, even at his own expense. This is evident in his tortured relationships with Ed; with the woman Ed marries, Laurel (Roxanna Hope Radja, who winningly brings out the character’s wry masochism); and with the handsome, much younger Alan, the model (a likable Michael Hsu Rosen). Those are the dramatis personae of the play’s first half, which on Broadway has acquired a new breeziness. The pain these people inflict on one another in the name of love (and the denial of it) always hums beneath the surface. The second half introduces us to David (Jack DiFalco, convincingly sassy if a shade too old for the part), a gay 15-year-old whom Arnold is hoping to adopt and, best of all, Mrs. Beckoff, the woman Arnold calls Ma, who arrives from Florida on a visit. That’s Ms. Ruehl’s part, which she walks, not runs, with and nearly steals the show in an expertly coiled performance. From the moment she arrives, toting all manner of baggage, it’s clear that Ma and Arnold are of the same flesh. Even when they’re quarreling, which is much of the time, they have the synchronized rhythms of a vaudeville team. You could even say that Ma, the homemaker with a will of iron, is ultimately what Arnold aspires to be. This makes her rejection of him, as a gay man with Good Housekeeping dreams, all the more lacerating. Not that Arnold can’t stand up to her, and not that she can’t stand up to him standing up to her — which turns their climactic face-off into a shattering battle royal. “Torch Song” has its moments of pure sitcom — there’s a protracted scene about the awfulness of Ed’s cooking — which you can only grin and bear. But it also incorporates shadows of tragedy, including a plot turn involving a brutal hate crime, that feel sadly topical. And there are moments when Mr. Urie’s Arnold lets us see the bona fide, bottomless fear and uncertainty beneath the larger-than-life facade. It’s there as a sudden, unexpected flicker in his eyes when he says that, at 13, “I knew everything.” In his opening monologue, Arnold tells us: “A drag queen is like an oil painting. You gotta stand back to get the full effect.” Mr. Urie gives us that full effect, for sure. But as you come to know this dizzying, sobering and surprisingly instructive drama queen, standing back is hardly an option. This information was last updated on Dec. 5, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Like Life, ‘Catch as Catch Can’ Throws Curveballs","American theater is grounded in the family play. Maybe the family is grounded in a kind of theater, too. In a family, everyone performs a role, sometimes multiple roles. The dialogue is subpar, and in most cases (in mine, anyway) so are the costumes. But, like it or not, around every dinner table, the show goes on. A pleasure of Mia Chung’s “Catch as Catch Can,” presented at the New Ohio Theater by Page 73, is the way it lays bare the theatricality of family life. Well, the two ways. One of them is structural. The play, set in a working-class New England town that runs on Dunkin’, is written for three actors — here, Jeff Biehl, Michael Esper and Jeanine Serralles. Each plays two parts: a mother and a son for Mr. Biehl and Mr. Esper, a father and a daughter for Ms. Serralles. Seeing these actors cross genders, ages and accents makes each familial role visible and deliberate. The second maneuver is thematic. The older characters don’t change much during the play, but the younger ones behave in ways that complicate, even defy, their roles. Best case, that behavior is mildly unsettling; worst case, it’s terrifying. It’s the terror of realizing that the people you presumably know best — your mother, your child — are the people you might not know at all. Here’s the setup: The Phelans and the Lavecchias are longtime neighbors, and as the play begins, Theresa Phelan (Mr. Esper) and Roberta Lavecchia (Mr. Biehl) are sharing a plate of rainbow cookies and piles of family gossip. Theresa’s son Tim (Mr. Esper again), the family golden boy, is back in town and newly engaged to a Korean-American woman. Roberta’s son, Robbie (also Mr. Biehl), lives at home and is smarting from a divorce. Her daughter, Daniela (Ms. Serralles, who also plays Daniela’s father, Lon), is waiting for her boyfriend to propose. This is what the mothers believe, because these are roles and tropes they recognize. They are almost entirely wrong Arnulfo Maldonado’s set is embellished with several sliding panels — some wood-grained, some wallpapered — that slip across the stage noiselessly. The actors move between their roles almost as fluidly. Mr. Biehl, Mr. Esper, Ms. Serralles: Individually, these names brighten a cast list. To have them onstage together is a kindness and a gift. Under Ken Rus Schmoll’s direction, typically cool and precise, they differentiate their roles but also twin them, showing how parents are echoed in their children. Does all that structural sophistication serve the play? The doubling, though often masterly (I’d swear Ms. Serralles’s pants fit her differently as Daniela than as Lon), makes it harder to pin down any one character. In a drama — especially one concerned with the mystery and haze of individual identity — that’s probably the point. But it makes some scenes harder to parse, which dulls the play’s horror. And Ms. Chung’s play is, in its tender way, a horror story: a dark parable about what happens if we try to swap roles or refuse to play along or reveal ourselves to our nearest without makeup or stage lights. Ms. Serralles’s Daniela has witnessed a revelation like this. She describes it to her mother. “I go into that room,” she says. “And in there, I can’t stop screaming.” This information was last updated on Oct. 22, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Marie Colvin Fights ‘A Private War’,"In the press notes for his first narrative feature, “A Private War,” the nonfiction filmmaker Matthew Heineman states that he didn’t want to make this gently fictionalized portrait of the war correspondent Marie Colvin into a biopic. And he hasn’t: what he has made is a deeply distressing, authentically moving psychological study of unswerving obsession. Anchored by Rosamund Pike’s powerhouse lead performance, this restive, raw movie slowly accumulates the heft to render its flaws irrelevant. Covering 2001 until Colvin’s death in Syria in 2012, Arash Amel’s occasionally bumpy storytelling (based on a 2012 Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner) jumps uneasily from one war zone to another. Facts are fuzzy, the rubble and bodies and wailing women blurring together until you realize that’s the point: locations change, but armed conflict is always the same in the innocents it claims and the suffering it causes. To Colvin — whether half-blinded by shrapnel in Sri Lanka or uncovering a mass grave in Iraq — that suffering was always the story. Brief hiatuses in London, where she worked for The Sunday Times, reveal the detritus of her personal life and the mental and physical toll of her work. Sucking on cigarettes and bedeviled by panic attacks, she’s more comfortable sporting blackened fingernails on the battlefield than pearls at her own award ceremony. Yet this is no neutered paragon, but a healthily sexual woman who wears designer bras beneath her androgynous work shirts. Afraid both of dying young and of growing old, Colvin addictively courts a chaos that the cinematographer, Robert Richardson, renders so vividly he seems keen to give us all a little of her PTSD. The real Colvin would have probably approved.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Michael C. Hall Probes the Despair of ‘Thom Pain’,"The dark and sulfurous chamber of Thom Pain’s mind has been unsealed for public inspection again. Audiences already familiar with Will Eno’s “Thom Pain (based on nothing),” which has been revived by the Signature Theater, may find this Stygian space roomier and less oppressive than they remembered. Oliver Butler’s new production, which opened on Sunday night, lets some fresh air and even a sliver of sunlight into the nocturnal depths of its title (and only) character’s imagination. And with a handsome, self-assured Michael C. Hall in the role of Pain (a last name that shrieks volumes), he appears as less of a lost cause than he once did. But while I’m usually grateful for glints of optimism in these cynical times, I can’t honestly say that this transformation is for the good. When I first saw “Thom Pain” at the tiny Soho Theater in London in 2004, its masochistic bleakness lingered on my skin afterward like a toxic slime. I may have wanted to take a shower immediately, but I was also electrified by the original, full-frontal attack on the audience that Mr. Eno had engineered. It helped that Thom’s despairing monologue was delivered by an angular, snarly James Urbaniak, whose utterances felt as dangerous as a double-edged razor blade in the hands of child. When Mr. Urbaniak’s Thom crossed the Atlantic the following year for a long Off Broadway run, Mr. Eno (who was born in 1965) was hailed as the theater’s new young messiah of existential despair. In a wonder-struck review in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood called him “a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation.” If, in its latest incarnation, “Thom Pain” seems to have shed its ability to shock, that’s partly because we have had a chance to become accustomed to the skewed perspective of Mr. Eno, whose later, fuller works include “The Realistic Joneses” and “The Open House.” But this relative tameness is also a matter of Mr. Butler and Mr. Hall’s interpretation. To begin with, Thom — who spends the play’s 70 uninterrupted minutes wallowing in bitter self-consciousness — has been given more room to roam. Amy Rubin’s set has transformed the Diamond Stage at the Pershing Square Signature Center into what feels like a limitless construction site, with ladders, tarps and a gaping hole cordoned off with yellow tape. The show still begins in total darkness, interrupted by the startling flame of someone trying — “trying” being the operative word — to light a cigarette. “How wonderful to see you all,” says a voice. That’s our Thom, a man who lives to tease with prickly paradoxes and to undermine expectations — his and ours. “Do you like magic?” he asks, once the lights have come up to reveal Mr. Hall in a trim black suit, looking like a department-store mannequin. “I don’t. But enough about me.” It is not enough, of course. The show proceeds as a sustained, cryptic, circular apologia pro vita sua, in which childhood tragedies and grown-up losses in love are anatomized like corpses in a forensic lab. That confession is sometimes told in the third person, sometimes in the first. But there’s no question that it’s always all about Thom — unless you believe, as he likes to insist teasingly, it’s all about us, too, and our bewildered, desperate and ever-shrinking time on this planet. Mr. Hall has established himself an accomplished and adventurous actor, both on screen (“Six Feet Under,” “Dexter”) and stage (brilliant as David Bowie’s alien alter-ego in “Lazarus,” and on Broadway in “The Realistic Joneses.”). Yet his Thom is self-conscious in the wrong ways. His narrative of self-catechism and self-laceration has the carefully modulated quality of a classically trained actor doing an intense audition piece. Mr. Hall is best in relaxed moments of semi-improvised interaction with the audience. But this Thom is seldom lovably loathsome enough to make us squirm. Thus delivered, the script now registers as the product of a restless and very talented young dramatist, showing off and playing with the influences he has absorbed. The ghost of Beckett still hovers, but so do, just as visibly, the specters of T. S. Eliot, Edward Albee and Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man. It’s Mr. Eno’s love for and grasp of rhythmic language that most impress here. Listen, for instance, to Thom’s trying to remember what might have inspired a young boy’s wet dream: “Some fuzzy uneducated image of a girl, saying a word he liked. ‘Voucher.’ Or, ‘Ankles.’” Thom’s angst may feel a trifle sophomoric now, like something he might grow out of. But his way with words, and that of the man who created him, is already deliciously ripe. This information was last updated on Nov. 13, 2018",The New York Times
2019,Review: Mike Birbiglia Is a Very Nervous Dad in ‘The New One’,"Critic’s Pick If Mike Birbiglia were a piece of furniture, he would surely be a well-worn, deeply stained, slightly squishy couch, much like the one he describes at the beginning of “The New One,” his winning Broadway debut at the Cort Theater. That may not sound like a flattering comparison. But Mr. Birbiglia has great respect and affection for this kind of sofa, and so should you. As he explains in this one-man show, which opened on Sunday night under the seamless direction of Seth Barrish, a couch is “a deceptively simple piece of technology.” It is, to be precise, “a bed that hugs you.” And in delivering that deceptively simple classification, Mr. Birbiglia’s voice becomes a low, wraparound, pleasure-drenched caress. This somnolent sound makes you feel both relaxed and attentive, drowsy and giddy. And somehow an expensive night with a lone comedian starts to feel like a better bargain than bingeing and chilling at home. [Read two Mike Birbiglia essays from The Times.] In an age in which starry stand-up is instantly accessible to anyone with a Netflix subscription, dropping big bucks to see a low-key, self-effacing comedian in person might seem like a waste. Such an attitude doesn’t account, though, for the paradoxically lazy energy that Mr. Birbilgia emanates — a seductive force of physics that can be felt only partly when he’s onscreen. Mr. Birbiglia — who came to national attention with the stage and film versions of “Sleepwalk With Me,” an autobiographical account of his dangerous nights with a sleep disorder — seems not only to occupy but also to absorb and transmute every inch of the Cort’s naked stage. (Appropriately, there’s more to Beowulf Boritt’s bare set than first meets the eye.) He achieves this partly by pacing, pacing as he talks, in ever-widening circles and diagonals and loop-de-loops. As he does so, he kicks at and stumbles over invisible obstacles. Mr. Birbiglia is retracing the road map of his life, which has always been cluttered with his neuroses and physical ailments. In the months he describes in “The New One,” that life has become even more congested, almost to the point of paralysis. That’s because of the before and after events surrounding the arrival of the play’s title character, a baby named Oona. Yes, she’s his child. Except she’s not quite. Mr. Birbiglia has the disadvantages — not shared by his beloved wife, the poet Jennifer Hope Stein — of being: a) a man, b) an itinerant comedian and c) a raging solipsist. Connecting with a needy creature who has disrupted the delicate balance of an anxious existence does not come easily to him. Dad as the odd man out in baby-makes-three scenarios has long been a basis for domestic comedy. Reduced to synopses, much of the territory Mr. Birbiglia covers here sounds as wearily familiar as the “I Love Lucy” episodes that concerned the birth of Little Ricky. This means (as my colleague Alexis Soloski pointed out when she reviewed this show Off Broadway) that Mr. Birbiglia is not a thoroughly modern dad, fully sharing the duties of parenthood. Mr. Birbiglia is quick to admit this dereliction and to praise his wife — and women in general — as belonging to a superior order of beings. Men, he contends, are born jerks, a universal truth that he believes accounts for the state of the world today. (“The men we used to think were great were priests, politicians and gymnastic doctors. It hasn’t ended well for great.”) He supports this contention with humiliating stories of his own bad behavior, including a graphically detailed account of sex with a prostitute in Amsterdam. His status as male is only one of the reasons he once thought that he and his wife shouldn’t have children. In the show’s opening section, he lists seven arguments against his becoming a father. They range from assorted physical ailments (an early experience of cancer, diabetes and his tendency to act out his dreams while asleep) to his suspicion that “consciousness is only a hallucination.” The list in and of itself is not funny (although I did love the self-explanatory brevity of “No. 4: I have a cat”). The conversational detours the list inspires can be sublime. That caveat about consciousness and hallucinations? It somehow segues into a description of the role of Roman Catholicism in Mr. Birbiglia’s childhood as “this weird three-way with God” and his mom. Unlikely similes and metaphors become a means of both addressing and (temporarily) defusing terrors and tensions. Presumably, verbal felicity is part of what brought Mr. Birbiglia and Ms. Stein together originally. He quotes her poem about their daughter at eight months: “An infant reaches for something (I don’t know what), pushes it farther away and cries in frustration each time she reaches without realizing she is crawling for the first time. She is just like her father.” That’s also a pretty good description of Mr. Birbiglia’s style as a performer here. As he restlessly circumambulates, verbally and physically, he’s always reaching for explanations that seem to explode on him. Yet, in the end, a symmetry emerges from the chaos he describes and embodies. Such is the gentle genius of one man’s comfortingly haphazard approach to comedy.

2018,Review: New Works Designed With a Daring Trumpeter in Mind,"The composer and trumpeter Nate Wooley’s taste in experimental music is wide-ranging. He likes brash fields of finely textured noise, as well as contemplative pieces generously dotted with silence. He has played jazz. He has played classical. And he particularly relishes the zone where no one is sorting music into any categories at all. He’s also a devoted citizen of the artistic ecosystem, organizing a database of recorded American music, running a record label, editing an online journal about avant-garde sounds — and conceiving For/With, a mini-festival that had its second annual run at Issue Project Room in Brooklyn on Wednesday and Thursday. There’s consistency in Mr. Wooley’s commitments: The inaugural festival last year included works by Christian Wolff, Michael Pisaro, Ashley Fure and Annea Lockwood; this year, there were more pieces by Ms. Fure and Ms. Lockwood, designed with Mr. Wooley in mind. Anyone who attended the New York Philharmonic’s opening this season could have identified elements from “Filament,” which Jaap van Zweden conducted on that program, in “A Library on Lightning” at Issue Project Room. Mr. Wooley was a guest soloist in the Philharmonic’s Fure performances, along with the bassoonist Rebekah Heller and the bassist Brandon Lopez. That was the same trio for “A Library on Lightning” on Thursday. (Ms. Heller also performed Felipe Lara’s vivid “Metafagote” that evening, playing through its lead part over six prerecorded tracks.) “A Library” is no simple reduction of “Filament,” as the trio actually had its premiere first, in April this year. At Issue Project Room, without the orchestra or the whispery, roving chorus heard at David Geffen Hall, it was easier to appreciate some of Mr. Lopez’s delicate, near-the-bridge playing. The intimacy of the Brooklyn space didn’t sap any of Ms. Fure’s intensity, either: The final buzzing chords hit with extraordinary force. Ms. Lockwood’s music was heard on both evenings. Her 1998 piece “Immersion” was performed on Wednesday by the percussion duo of Frank Cassara and Dominic Donato. The work’s most compelling stretches were achieved by Ms. Lockwood’s use of a cylindrical container placed atop a marimba. One musician drew a mallet around the cylinder’s circumference, while the other gently thrummed the edges of the bars underneath, producing slight, dreamy dissonances. On Thursday, Ms. Lockwood’s recent piece “Becoming Air” was played by Mr. Wooley, using his extended technique on trumpet to create, as in “Immersion,” a mood of elegant energy. While using circular breathing to produce long tones on his instrument, he also manipulated a small microphone inside the bell, as well as an effect pedal at his feet. As the microphone moved farther inside the trumpet, the amplified overtones shifted incrementally, producing some dramatic howls of distortion. Ms. Lockwood also made full use of Mr. Wooley’s quieter strategies, like the mouthpiece-free blowings he sometimes uses, blasts of frenzy that remain soft. (The sound is suggestive of a sprinkler system that’s gained consciousness.) Mr. Wooley’s interpretive powers were brought into even clearer focus by “Red Autumn Gold,” a work written by the trumpet virtuoso (and 2013 Pulitzer Prize finalist) Wadada Leo Smith and played twice during For/With. Mr. Wooley’s solo rendition opened the festival on Wednesday. Using polyphonic extended techniques, he made multiple droning lines drift apart and then return to states of equilibrium. Pauses in the music brought shifts toward brief flurries of notes that sounded like descendants of bebop phrasing. At the end of the festival, Mr. Smith appeared with Mr. Wooley for another take on the piece, in which Mr. Wooley often ceded the foreground. (A startling opening note from Mr. Smith showed that his clarion ferocity is still in enviable shape.) Yet it was still very much a duet. Over a quarter-hour, a fine balance emerged between Mr. Smith’s brightly pealing sound and the mellower roughness of Mr. Wooley.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: On Netflix, Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin Are Aging Bros","You can understand why Chuck Lorre would want to go dark with his new series, “The Kominsky Method,” for Netflix. The serious half-hour is where the cool kids are hanging out these days: “Homecoming” and “Transparent” on Amazon, “Atlanta” and “Better Things” on FX, “The Girlfriend Experience” on Starz. And as the most successful sitcom creator around, with an almost unbroken 25-year string of hits that includes huge moneymakers like “The Big Bang Theory” and “Two and a Half Men,” Lorre has some leeway. A track record like that has to come in handy when you’re pitching a show whose punch lines mostly deal with death, loneliness and incontinence. It also helps when you can get Alan Arkin and Michael Douglas — 16 and 41 years removed from their last regular television work — to play the aging frenemies at the heart of your story. Inevitability isn’t a good argument for a TV show’s existence, however. “The Kominsky Method” (eight episodes arrive Friday) isn’t a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don’t mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre’s precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either. Douglas stars as Sandy Kominsky, an acting coach of minor renown whose promising career as a performer never quite panned out. Thrice divorced, he runs his studio with the help of his long-suffering daughter, Mindy (Sarah Baker), dates his 20-something students and hangs out with his agent and apparently only friend, Norman Newlander (Arkin). [Read the Times profile about Michael Douglas and his return to television at age 74.] Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage — given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances. The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in “Wonder Boys” (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it’s not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn’t done anything to raise Douglas’s game. What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an “age-appropriate” woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness. But those observations aren’t insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom — he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings. The show’s sensibility is also decidedly retrograde and fueled by Hollywood nostalgia, which can be appealing when Sandy and Norman are meeting for lunch at Musso & Frank Grill but unappetizing in the scenes at Sandy’s studio, where nearly every scene mocks the naïveté and political correctness of the young students. And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you’re a man who hasn’t heard of retrograde ejaculation, you’ll Google to see if it’s a real thing, after which you’ll feel a little sick to your stomach. Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman’s daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab. Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about “The Kominsky Method,” even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching “Curb Your Enthusiasm” territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (“Skype — what a stupid word”), it might as well be him.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Plácido Domingo Reaches 50 Years at the Met Opera,"Critic’s Pick The review in The New York Times said that the young tenor “again and again lifted the performance out of the depths of fatuity into which it relentlessly lapsed.” It was the fall of 1968, and Plácido Domingo had arrived for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera House, bringing the sincerity and sense of purpose that would become his trademarks. Fifty years later, thumbing his nose at the many who said he would and should have retired by now, he is still there. Having reinvented himself as a baritone, Mr. Domingo seems not at all done with a second act that has extended his career as a leading man probably beyond any in operatic history. And he was honored for a half-century of Met stardom on Friday, when he appeared for the first time this season in the title role of “Gianni Schicchi,” the comic butt of Puccini’s three-opera “Il Trittico.” [Read about another Domingo landmark: his 150th role.] Doubtless the Met would have given him a gala evening all his own if he’d wanted it. But this was a characteristically unshowy, unsaccharine tribute for a singer who has always given the sense of wanting, above all, to get on with the work. Held onstage during the intermission between Puccini’s first two acts and prefaced by a short assemblage of filmed performance clips, the ceremony was simple. The company’s general manager, Peter Gelb, presented Mr. Domingo with a piece of the Met’s stage (very classy) and a gilded version of his “Otello” costume (less so). Some distinguished colleagues — Martina Arroyo, Sherrill Milnes, James Morris, Teresa Stratas — were pointed out in the audience. Mr. Domingo thanked the public; the Met’s leaders; its orchestra, chorus and stagehands; and his family. That was that. As the reel of clips played, it occurred to me that none of Mr. Domingo’s recordings would be among my desert island discs; other voices and presences have been more urgent and essential. Yet I will always treasure having seen one of his final Met Otellos, in 1999; his last outpouring that evening was the very sound of grand, wounded dignity. And the sheer life force he now embodies — nearly 80 and still adding new roles to a roster of 150 — is a wonder of the world. He was delightful on Friday, even without having to rescue the rest of the performance from any depths of fatuity. Celebrating the centennial of the work’s world premiere, at the Met on Dec. 14, 1918, this was a very fine “Trittico,” particularly the disconsolate “Il Tabarro,” inflamed by Amber Wagner’s big, creamy soprano, Marcelo Álvarez’s effusive tenor, and George Gagnidze’s grim, moody baritone. From the conductor Bertrand de Billy and the orchestra, I kept hearing more of the score’s conjunction of soaring lyricism and aqueous modernism. [Read about the “Trittico” world premiere and Puccini’s time in New York.] In the title role of “Suor Angelica,” the second of the three operas, Kristine Opolais was haunted and focused, her soprano less brittle than it’s been over the past few years. Especially heard opposite the easy richness of the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, Ms. Opolais’s tone tended pale when low in her range, and thin up high, but her suffering and transcendence were chillingly real. In “Gianni Schicchi,” the soprano Kristina Mkhitaryan, making her Met debut, delivered a gentle “O mio babbino caro.” MaryAnn McCormick and Maurizio Muraro enlivened some small but crucial roles over the triptych, in a revival of Jack O’Brien’s handsome staging. But it was Mr. Domingo’s night. I was most moved to see him lumber to his knee and touch the stage during his curtain call after “Gianni Schicchi.” The ovation he received was a reward for five decades, yes, but also for his wry, confidently sung Schicchi, a rare funny part for him and one he approached with easygoing charm. That 1968 Times review described him as “a strapping fellow with a plangent and sizable voice, as well as considerable stage magnetism.” Fifty years later, I second that.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Rage and Ritual in ‘What to Send Up When It Goes Down’,"Critic’s Pick “An anger spittoon.” The phrase crackles with both a deep visceral charge and an elegant precision. These words are only three among many used by the playwright Aleshea Harris to characterize her truly sui generis, truly remarkable new work, “What to Send Up When It Goes Down,” which opened on Monday at A.R.T./New York Theaters. In writing about this Movement Theater Company production, which has been created to honor the black lives lost to “racialized violence,” Ms. Harris has also described it as a ritual, a dance party and, above all, “a space in the theater that is unrepentantly for and about black people.” But it is “anger spittoon” that best captures the paradoxical plainness and poetry, utility and sophistication of what Ms. Harris has created here. If “What to Send Up” is a receptacle for the rage that is part and parcel of life for many African-Americans, a piece that encourages its audience to respond with cathartic yells and tears, it is also shaped by a rarefied theatrical intelligence. You may not be entirely aware of its artistry until after it’s over, or realize that the show you’ve seen is also a very good play. The experience begins in the brightly lighted lobby of the Jeffrey and Paula Gural Theater, which has been transformed into a portrait gallery. More than 200 photographs adorn the walls, close-ups of faces with those bright, hopeful smiles with which most people consciously address a camera. At least some of the names will be familiar to you. They include Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Trayvon Martin. Most of them are obscenely young. They are all dead, many of them at the hands of American law enforcement officers. We are soon reminded that the list embodied by this display keeps growing. We enter the theater, an open space (designed by Yu-Hsuan Chen and lighted by Cha See) and are instructed to assemble in a circle. On the night I attended, a stately master of ceremonies (the actor Kambi Gathesha) asked us to repeat the name Jemel Roberson — a security guard shot and killed earlier that week by a police officer in suburban Chicago — one time for each of the 26 years he was alive. That’s one of several exercises in which the audience members are asked, though not required, to participate. We are led in exercises of synchronized breathing, singing and screaming. We are asked to write, if we choose, “kind words” we might want to share “with a black person living in an anti-black society.” Though I have been writing “we,” and participated in all of the above, I am not properly part of the collective being addressed, celebrated, stirred and consoled here. I am a white man. In his prefatory remarks, Mr. Gathesha makes it clear that while people who are not black are welcome here, this evening is not for them. At the same time, “What to Send Up,” which features a protean cast of eight expertly directed by Whitney White, is inevitably, in part, about white people. In what follows the opening “workshop” section, the relationships between white and black Americans are acted out in a series of songs, soliloquies and dialogues. Some are devastatingly funny satires; others are soul-shredding lamentations. Each is performed as a fugue, with strategic variations in tone and tempo. In one vignette, a woman (Denise Manning) tells a friend (Naomi Lorrain) about a white co-worker who told her that he “doesn’t see color.” The friend hoots in riotous incredulity and asks Ms. Manning’s character how she responded. Her answer: “I politely leaned forward in my chair … and took his mouth. Off his face. I removed his mouth.” What did it look like? “A little fish flopping around.” As she demonstrated in her play “Is God Is,” an electric riff on the classic western revenge flick seen at Soho Rep this year, Ms. Harris has a gift for pushing the familiar to surreally logical extremes. Another running sketch, which borrows from and then explodes Jean Genet’s “The Maids,” finds a white woman, Miss (played by a male actor, Ugo Chukwu, in lace gloves and pearls), dealing with her servants. One of them is an ingratiating man, “afraid of being sucked into the margins,” played by Beau Thom. He is obedient, sycophantic and scared. The other is a woman identified as Made (a priceless Rachel Christopher), a homonym that suits “a woman of her own devising.” As Miss asks patronizing questions (“in a Southern dialect not unlike Paula Deen’s,” we are told), Made occupies herself with tasks like sharpening a machete. She is especially riled by Miss’s insistently asking her about her children. She doesn’t have any, Made keeps telling her employer. Only toward the show’s end, in a harrowing monologue in which Ms. Christopher strips the skin off the melodrama-style posing, do we understand why Miss’s question torments her. A young man (Javon Q. Minter) wanders among and between these plays-within-a-play, wearing a stricken gaze and a fear of attracting attention. That his fate is predetermined doesn’t lessen the impact when he falls to the ground, looking like a corpse in a crime scene photo. Then there’s the evolving monologue, delivered with exquisite sorrow and contempt by Alana Raquel Bowers, that begins, “Remember when I tried to love you?” The attempt she describes is futile, “like riding a bike without a chain.” The “you” in this case is white people. If you belong to that race, and the idea of listening to such a declaration makes you squirm, you may want to skip “What to Send Up.” It wasn’t written with you in mind. But if you’re a lover of theater, looking for signs of fresh and original and in-the-moment life on the American stage, you need to see “What to Send Up.” That’s regardless of skin color.

2018,Review: Raúl Esparza Becomes a Very Familiar Fascist in ‘Arturo Ui’,"Watching Raúl Esparza learn to walk the walk is as much fun as bingeing on runway struts from “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Mr. Esparza is portraying the title thug in John Doyle’s limber revival of Bertolt Brecht’s abidingly stiff “The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,” which opened on Wednesday at Classic Stage Company. At this point, the uncivilized Ui (rhymes with “phooey”) is still a low-grade Chicago hoodlum — and former housepainter — who has decided he needs to buy some poise if he’s going to take over the city. So he and his favorite henchman, Roma (Eddie Cooper), visit a Shakespearean actor (Elizabeth A. Davis) for lessons in the art of walking, sitting and speechmaking. Ui is a fast study. Soon he’s stepping sprightly, hands cupped over his genitals as a center of gravity, and finding his powerful podium voice as he reads Mark Antony’s funeral oration from “Julius Caesar.” What a makeover. Mr. Esparza has morphed from schlub to spellbinder, the kind of guy who could command stadiums with a wave of an outstretched arm. Sieg heil, Herr Ui! Mr. Doyle’s production of Brecht’s 1941 satire about the ascension of Adolf Hitler, written when the German playwright was in exile in Finland, is full of such enlivening moments of actorly glee. The eight ensemble members here are delightfully resourceful as they become an entire population of corrupt thugs and government officials, with little more than a change of headgear. You could even imagine this version of “Arturo Ui” winning the flinty heart of its author, for its imaginative interpretation of the Brechtian dictates of style and sensibility. Mr. Doyle — a master of minimalist takes on big shows (including the Sondheim musicals “Sweeney Todd” and “Company” on Broadway) — has steered his cast into sharp, naturally unnatural performances. As Ui puts it, when questioned about his new artificial style, “No human being behaves natural these days.” The production is also designed by Mr. Doyle to reflect visually Brecht’s working-class sympathies. With its use of chain-link fencing and old-fashioned work lights, the open set suggests an industrial environment, perhaps a construction site, and Ann Hould-Ward’s costumes include hard hats as well as fedoras. (Jane Cox and Tess James did the noirish lighting.) As the performers move in and out of their various scenes, the effect is of a group of enterprising union members putting on a show against Fascism. Because every one of them is a pleasure to watch, let me list those I haven’t already mentioned: George Abud, Christopher Gurr, Omozé Idehenre (who deserves a special prize for versatility), Mahira Kakkar and Thom Sesma. Yet all the cast’s resourcefulness isn’t enough to keep confusion and tedium at bay as this labored allegory unfolds in a painstaking parade of equivalencies. Though it was first staged in Stuttgart, West Germany, in 1958, Brecht wrote “Arturo Ui” with an American audience in mind. Each major phase of Hitler’s political career between 1929 and the late 1930s is rendered — in Elizabethan-style verse, translated by George Tabori — as a chapter in the story of how a Chicago mob, led by Ui, took over the cauliflower business. All the major characters are modeled on real people, including the beleaguered Weimar Republic president, Paul von Hindenburg, and such infamous Hitler henchmen as Göring, Goebbels and Röhm. The Reichstag fire becomes a dockside warehouse destroyed by arson, while the Anschluss is translated into the annexation of the vegetable market of Cicero, Ill. And the legal labyrinth of the Eastern Aid Scandal, in which Hindenburg was implicated, is presented, in a long maze of trials and meetings, as the Dock Aid Scandal. This means that “Arturo Ui” is, among other things, a partisan treatise on economics, as the rot within a failed capitalist order is revealed. While Brecht felt theater should always be didactic, he took his professorial duties very much to heart in “Arturo Ui,” and theatergoers without a solid knowledge in Hitler-era German history may often feel at sea. That may be why American productions of the play have seldom been successful. (Its 1963 Broadway debut received yawning reviews and lasted for eight performances.) Yet Brecht’s portrait of a resistible rise of a tyrant has proved irresistible to directors in recent years, as a new spirit of nationalism spreads through the Western world. Besides what actor worth his hambone wouldn’t want to have a chance to become a comic-book Hitler? The part has been embodied by the likes of Christopher Plummer (its Broadway originator), John Turturro (for the Classic Stage in 1991), Al Pacino (Off Broadway in 2002) and Lenny Henry (for London’s Donmar Warehouse last year). Mr. Esparza, a performer of wit and fire, doesn’t fail to amuse in the role and — when his character roams the audience with the dead eyes of a shark — to chill. He’s especially entertaining when Arturo slips into faux-Shakespeare mode, evoking not only Richard III (the obvious parallel), but also Hamlet (for the early, surly Ui) and Macbeth (“Is this a luger I see before me?”). Unlike most English-language productions of Brecht, this one makes sure that all the cast members stay on the same stylistic page. But few people are likely to leave “Arturo Ui” thinking how scary it is in its topicality. Now’s the time to mention the elephant in the theater. I mean the specter of the current president of the United States, whose incendiary style we are meant to see in Ui’s underhanded politics and populist demagogy. Lest we miss the point, Matt Stine’s sound design segues at the end from crowds chanting “Sieg Heil!” to a few choruses of “Lock her up!” (The Donmar production was accented with “Make America Great” signs.) But while Donald J. Trump is always on my mind these days, I didn’t see a whole lot of him on the stage here. What I was most conscious of was the hard-working ingenuity of a director and his creative team trying to elicit sparks from a cumbersome, ice-cold allegory.

2018,Review: Reaching Across Korean Borders in ‘Wild Goose Dreams’,"Though they more or less speak the same language, Guk Minsung and Yoo Nanhee often don’t understand each other, especially in moments of attempted levity. “Is that a joke?” one will ask the other, sometimes with a postscript: “A South Korean joke?” or “A North Korean joke?” Even the language of physical attraction seems to be less universal than they might have expected. “Is it sexy to apologize during sex in North Korea?” Minsung (Peter Kim) asks Nanhee (Michelle Krusiec) after a coital encounter in Hansol Jung’s “Wild Goose Dreams,” which opened on Wednesday at the Public Theater. Such are the difficulties of conducting an affair when its participants come from opposite parts of a divided peninsula. And differences of geographical origin are just the start of the complexities that besiege Minsung and Nanhee in this overwhelming play about being overwhelmed in a very confusing century. Our leading lovers (though they might question being so described) are also both citizens of a vast global nation in which instant communication has never seemed easier or more impossible. They belong to the all-embracing culture of the internet, which for them turns out to be a confounding Tower of Babel. Directed by Leigh Silverman (“Well,” “Chinglish”), with the cheery patience of a kindly traffic cop at rush hour, “Wild Goose Dreams” seeks to reflect the fragmented worldview that comes from living in a digital age. The play is annotated by a chorus of six performers who speak in the exasperating language of computerese. Or do I mean internetese? You’ll recognize it when you hear it, that staccato succession of phrases such as “like!” and “love this!,” and “delete!” and “reboot!,” and random voices delivering teasing phrases like “Why ‘Footloose’ was the ‘Frozen’ of the 80s!” and “Loneliness: the true cause of addiction!” It is in such a tangled forest of information bites, on a site called Love Genie, that Nanhee and Minsung have their first virtual meeting, under the screen names of Miner’s Daughter and Gooseman. Those appellations refer to the sources of their loneliness. Nanhee is indeed the daughter of a North Korean miner, whom she has left behind in defecting to the South and whose spirit (embodied by Francis Jue) haunts her daily life. The South Korean-born Minsung has sent his wife and daughter to the United States, while working in Seoul to support them, which makes him, in local parlance, “a goose father.” But wait. There’s more flight-oriented imagery to process. The play begins with Mr. Jue, as Nanhee’s father, relating a bedtime folk tale about an angel who loses her ability to fly and falls in love with a mortal man, and who must later choose between staying on earth or ascending to the skies once again. The conflicting demands of freedom and family turn out to dominate both Nanhee and Minsung’s lives. Penguins will later play a part in their story, including one cunning puppet version who pokes its head out of a toilet to taunt Nanhee, who is spending her first night in Minsung’s tiny apartment in a barrackslike building for students. And then there’s the battalion of North Korean troops that shows up accessorizedwith penguin heads in one of Nanhee’s guilty fantasies. As Nanhee deals with her conflicted feelings about fleeing her homeland, Minsung keeps trying to connect with his wife (Jaygee Macapugay) and daughter (Kendyl Ito), sometimes by phone, sometimes on Facebook. And the gaps — generational, cultural, technological — just keep widening. Minsung finally finds himself reaching out to Nanhee with a pop song he wrote about suicide in a YouTube video that goes viral. The diverse and untethered world of “Wild Goose Dreams” has been given remarkably coherent life by a design team that includes Clint Ramos (the neon and anime-inflected set), Linda Cho (costumes) and Lillis Meeh (special effects). It is to the credit of everyone involved that it is possible to follow the script’s leaps among its assorted realities and fantasies. That’s partly because Ms. Jung, a writer of industrious imagination, has a poet’s gift for sustaining and interlinking motifs and metaphor. Still, the piling up of incidents and images and subplots has a congestive effect here, blurring our focus and blunting our emotional responses. Is this overstuffed rendering of an overstimulated culture what they call the fallacy of imitative form? (I pulled that one out of my dusty memories of comp-lit classes; now if only I can find a use for “objective correlative.”) In any case, the text could benefit from pruning and weeding. Holding fast as the play’s still but agitated center, Mr. Kim and Ms. Krusiec bring a lovely, low-key air of bewilderment to the proceedings that honors their characters’ humility and ambivalent hopefulness. And their dialogue has a piquancy that will surely sound original to most American ears. In what other play in New York can you find a character earnestly contemplating her fear that her life is “as meaningful as the tip of a toenail that is clipped off during a pedicure”? Or the pricelessly self-revealing line, “It is shameful, but my penis is interested in devastated women”? This information was last updated on Nov. 14, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Robotic Precision, Uncommonly Well Done","Critic’s Pick “Blak Whyte Gray,” by the London hip-hop company Boy Blue, is a dance with the force of an uprising. It comes in three parts, each corresponding to a word in the title, but not in that order. The actual progression is from white to black, which may sound like a fadeout but feels like a prison break. The work, which had its United States premiere at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater on Friday as part of the White Light Festival, begins with three dancers dressed in white coats that recall both samurai armor and straightjackets. They move impassively, with the jerky precision of robots, an effect that at once dehumanizes them and attracts the sympathy that puppets can. Some of the popping seems impelled by electric shock, a response to pain. These robots raise their arms in supplication. This expressive use of classic hip-hop technique has itself become a commonplace of hip-hop theater. But Boy Blue does it uncommonly well. The company, founded in 2001, is jointly led by Michael Asante, who is responsible for the music and creative direction, and Kenrick Sandy, who handles the choreography. And the connection between sound and motion is exceptionally tight. Where in “Whyte” the dancers appear to suffer from the jolting sound, in “Gray” they turn its impact outward. A gang of eight now, they sometimes aim invisible rifles, but less literal and more powerful is the way their bodies are weaponized. Each whacking move is a blow, a bang, seeming to strike rather than respond to the gunshot or hammer beats in the soundtrack. This is krump, the aggressive battle style of redirected rage developed in Los Angeles. Boy Blue doesn’t just borrow it. At one point, dancers scaling the stage floor by scooting on their backs are mirrored, at a 90-degree angle, by upright dancers. Even more impressive than the compositional sophistication is how it heightens rather than dampens the street style’s energy. “Blak” is centered on one dancer, the amazing Dickson Mbi. At first, he’s more raw material than man, collapsing unless others prop him up. Gradually, though, through evocative ritual gestures, the tribe makes a hero out of him, draping him in red so that he looks like a buff Roman emperor. Now sappy strings rise in the score, one of several signs that “Blak Whyte Gray” remains trapped in some of the clichés it strives to escape. The restraint of “Whyte” is snapped by silent screams. “Gray” too much resembles a video game. Why must “Blak” be postapocalyptic? Isn’t the work’s search for “the truth” (voiced in a sample by Vincent Price) urgent enough in the present? A powerful piece of hip-hop theater, “Blak Whyte Gray” is sometimes diminished by theatrical effects, but never fatally. Late in “Blak,” as African drums rise in the score and giant masks descend on strings, ultraviolet lights reveal tribal markings on the dancers’ faces, garishly underlining the emergence of African movements in the choreography. Those African steps have been present all along, even in the oppressed robots of “Whyte.” You don’t need ultraviolet lights to see them or to share the joy of release as the dancers form a corridor and travel it in pairs, busting their best moves. The “Soul Train” line has always been a spiritual form.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Boston Symphony Joins a Crowded Field of Mahler,"It’s hard to imagine a time when Mahler’s music was obscure. His Fifth Symphony alone keeps popping up. Jaap van Zweden chose it to make a statement last season, when he was the New York Philharmonic’s music director designate. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has played it twice this year. And on Monday evening it showed up at Carnegie Hall, in a concert by the visiting Boston Symphony Orchestra. In a crowded field of Mahler, what do the Bostonians and their music director, Andris Nelsons, have to offer? The answer, at Carnegie at least: nothing more than the most by-the-book reading possible. To some degree, this should be expected of the Boston Symphony, an orchestra that is skilled but not showy. Throughout the Mahler, the brasses were in excellent form, and the strings never gave into hysteria. But Mr. Nelsons’s measured account of this frenzied work — which typically runs about 70 minutes but approached 80 on Monday — often came off as timid, even ponderous. This respectable inoffensiveness might have been more satisfying had I not heard Susanna Malkki lead a mind-opening performance of Mahler’s Fifth with the Los Angeles Philharmonic earlier this month. The symphony is episodic; hearing it is like binge-watching an entire season of a TV melodrama. But under Ms. Malkki’s baton it had the cohesion of a novel. The Philharmonic musicians followed her faithfully, adding insight after insight to an overplayed work. And she brought out inner voices that retreated back into anonymity in Mr. Nelsons’s interpretation. The Boston Symphony once again excelled in its programming. (Something to look forward to: its spring engagement at Carnegie, which will include the New York premiere of a piano concerto by Thomas Adès.) It prefaced the Mahler with HK Gruber’s 1999 trumpet concerto “Aerial,” a piece that ends much as the symphony begins and shares its stylistic diversity, unwieldy spirit and, ultimately, Viennese character. The soloist was Hakan Hardenberger, for whom the concerto was written. He was red-faced as he bravely juggled the piece’s multiple solo instruments — a standard trumpet in C, a piccolo one in B flat and a cow’s horn, resting next to him on a Steinway piano bench — and its comically extreme dynamic marking of “ffff” (fortissississimo). “Aerial” suggests a vantage point, and the texture of this evocative concerto delivers on that: The first movement, “Done with the compass — Done with the chart!,” named after an Emily Dickinson poem, conjures a chilly Arctic landscape. The soloist is asked to create multiphonic sound by playing one note, vocalizing another and, through the magic of acoustics, summoning a third; the effect is like wind sneaking through the cracks of poorly insulated windows in winter. Like many works by Mr. Gruber, “Aerial” also dabbles in popular idioms. The trumpet’s mute adds a touch of Lynchian noir. And in the second movement, “Gone Dancing,” the orchestra breaks into a raucous party. Mr. Nelsons and the Bostonians maintained precision while relishing this finale’s inconstant rhythms — dances that capriciously recalled golden-age Hollywood and the Middle East. Where was this adventurous energy during the Mahler?",The New York Times
2018,Review: The First Opera by a Woman Dances Out of Obscurity,"Critic’s Pick During the recent election season, pundit-friendly phrases like “year of the woman” and “pink wave” were understandably rejected by those who said female candidates should be treated not as a trend, but as contenders every bit as normal as their male counterparts. [Read a history of classical music — the women-only version.] The world of opera isn’t quite there yet; productions of works by female composers are so rare they’re still treated as major events. The latest case is Francesca Caccini’s 1625 seldom-seen “La Liberazione di Ruggiero Dall’Isola d’Alcina” (“The Liberation of Ruggiero From the Island of Alcina”), which received a humble but enlightening and lively staging this week by the Boston Early Music Festival at the Morgan Library & Museum’s Gilder Lehrman Hall. “Alcina” is believed to be the first opera written by a woman, and the first Italian opera to be performed outside Italy — milestones that could still make it more of a historical footnote than a living work of art. But there’s no reason it doesn’t deserve to be programmed alongside Caccini’s contemporaries, like Jacopo Peri and Claudio Monteverdi. Led at the Morgan by the musical directors Paul O’Dette and Stephen Stubbs, and the concertmaster Robert Mealy, the opera’s score is stylistically diverse and forward-looking, with surprising psychological depth and melodic beauty. Caccini wrote it during a brief but glorious moment for women in music. Florence was under the control of the Grand Duchess Maria Magdalena and Christine of Lorraine, who in the works they commissioned pushed for confident, righteous female protagonists. “Alcina” fittingly featured two strong women as its lead characters. The opera — like Handel’s famous version a century later — takes its plot from a slice of the Italian epic “Orlando Furioso.” The benevolent sorceress Melissa (sung on Tuesday with warmth and heroism by the mezzo-soprano Kelsey Lauritano) goes to the island of the evil Alcina to retrieve the knight Ruggiero (the tenor Colin Balzer) and return him to his love, the princess Bradamante. On her enchanted island, Alcina — the soprano Shannon Mercer, who expertly navigated her character’s transformation from beguiling to crazed — seduces knights and, once bored with them, turns them (and those who attempt to rescue them) into plants, convincingly conjured in Gilbert Blin’s production with leafy masks that make the characters, in stately period costumes, seem as if they’re at a ball. What follows is a witch-against-witch battle for Ruggiero’s soul — with a memorable, all too quick appearance by Margot Rood, as Alcina’s damsel Oreste — that seems to prefigure opera history. In Alcina’s thrall, Ruggiero struggles with sensuality and desire like Tannhäuser will in the 19th century; once spurned, Alcina delivers a lengthy lament that anticipates bel canto mad scenes, complete with orchestral accompaniment that reflects the state of her pain, then her terrifying anger as she vows vengeance. The original production of “Alcina” ended with a lavish horse ballet to impress the Polish crown prince Wladyslaw during a state visit to Tuscany. At the Morgan, it ended with a dance that fit awkwardly into the small hall, which was already crowded with the chorus and the Boston Early Music Festival Chamber Ensemble. If Caccini warrants a place alongside the greats of her time — and she does — then her “Alcina” deserves a production to match.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Footwear Follies of ‘Zapatografía/Shoegraphy’,"Few dancers can sustain a career in New York without a second — or third or fourth or fifth — job. For more than a decade, the performer and choreographer Larissa Velez-Jackson has made a living teaching fitness classes to older adults. But in the past few years, she has begun letting her worlds mingle, bringing her students and members of local senior centers into her playful and strange works for the stage. In her latest, “Zapatografía/Shoegraphy,” which opened at Abrons Arts Center on Thursday, she has assembled a small but unforgettable cast from the Henry Street Settlement Senior Center (Abrons is part of Henry Street, a social service agency on the Lower East Side) and the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Center in Brooklyn. How often do a neighborhood’s longtime working-class residents and its experimental arts hubs meet? Ms. Velez-Jackson gets us thinking about that relationship, while keeping any concrete resolutions out of reach. For most of this curious, charming, and category-defying hourlong show, her older-adult participants simply watch, seated at a long table onstage, like amused judges. Aided by an expressive masked assistant named White Shadow (Talya Epstein), Ms. Velez-Jackson pulls more than a dozen pairs of shoes out of a suitcase, distributes them around the stage and proceeds to try them all on, her gait and character morphing with each style of footwear. There are prim flats, extravagant heels, ballet slippers, work boots. An adroit physical comedian, she makes her onlookers laugh as she mimics, in her off-kilter way, an athlete, a pop diva, a bird. Through this all, Ms. Velez-Jackson seems to be questioning entrenched conventions of contemporary performance, in particular the convention of performing for an audience of insiders: an audience made up mostly of other artists, as opposed to, say, members of nearby senior centers. “Who am I talking to?” she says in a slow, fragmented opening monologue, echoed by a voice-over that translates each line into Spanish. It sounds like she’s genuinely wondering. “The audience is the real space,” she adds. To bring these worlds together may not be entirely natural for Ms. Velez-Jackson, and admirably, she doesn’t hide the awkwardness of this endeavor. Gradually and a little clumsily, “Zapatografía” transforms into a dance party, with the cast grooving to salsa beneath a disco ball, then leading a Soul Train line for everyone. (There are advantages to a dance audience full of other dancers; people were eager to join in.) “You made it through our minimalist formalist community experiment!” Ms. Velez-Jackson exclaimed as the evening drew to a close, offering as good a description as any of what had just happened.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Unraveling Fantasy of John Heginbotham’s ‘Fantasque’,"The word “fantasque,” originally French, is both noun (meaning fancy, fantasy) and adjective (meaning fanciful, fantastic). For many dance-goers, it immediately conjures the titles of two ballets: the 1919 surreal comedy “La Boutique Fantasque” and the 1949 (also comic) pure-dance creation “Bourrée Fantasque,” each of which employs irresistible 19th-century music. Now “Fantasque” has become the title of a new work by the choreographer John Heginbotham at N.Y.U. Skirball; it’s linked to the first of those earlier ballets. It features multiple items from the enchantingly inventive, ebullient, whimsical and sometimes poignant “Sins of Old Age”” (“Péchés de Vieillesse”), composed by Rossini, with some Rossini-pastiche additions by Ottorino Respighi, all played here by the pianist George Shevtsov. Respighi arranged his Rossini compilation for “La Boutique Fantasque,” which Leonide Massine choreographed for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, with designs by André Derain. Mr. Heginbotham, who danced for several years in the Mark Morris Dance Group, has been a choreographer of note for several years now. His company, Dance Heginbotham, began life in 2011; he also made the dream ballet in Daniel Fish’s much-discussed revisionist production of “Oklahoma!,” seen this autumn at St Ann’s Warehouse, Brooklyn. He doesn’t use anything like Massine’s story (in which dancing dolls take over their toyshop and throw out the tourists who bought them), but he gives his own work something of the same subversive craziness. (His story has the sun, the moon, the devil, people in love and a baby.) He also packs it with a comparable selection of winning ingredients: notably, outsize puppets and designs by Amy Trompetter, six excellent dancers, and five charming puppeteers. Lighting designed by Nicole Pearce has the marvelous effect of transforming the geometrically patterned backdrop from sunny yellow to nocturnal blue, and back again. Maile Okamura dresses the dancers in attractively silky loose pajamas. The spirit onstage is always free, eccentric, uninhibited. Parts of the audience respond exultantly. As far as Ms Trompetter’s designs — very “fantasque” — go, I respond the same way. I don’t understand them, but she makes me enjoy their mystery. Apart from the sun, moon, devil, and baby, there are the isolated parts of a human body — feet, legs, belly, breasts, head — which get variously arranged, often suspended horizontally across the back of the stage. Then there are sunflowers and a giant rat — no, I don’t understand any of this, but I rejoice to be in their brightly imaginative company. Yet they don’t prove enough to make a stage world sufficiently strong to hold me throughout this piece. Principally, “Fantasque” suffers from Mr. Heginbotham’s lack of rhythmic structure. It also fails to tells its sun-moon-devil-baby story even remotely well, but to me that’s secondary: I’ve watched many dances that didn’t make their full narratives clear but which nonetheless pulled me into their mysteries. (I didn’t understand half of what the dream ballet in the Fish-Heginbotham “Oklahoma!” was about, but, even when most baffled or irked, I was riveted.) Here the start is happy: dancers introducing themselves with footwork and brio. But are they telling a story or merely parading it? Before it’s halfway through, “Fantasque” loses course when Mr. Shevtsov leaves his piano to dance flamenco with the baby. (Don’t ask.) I don’t mind that “Fantasque” only gets crazier from then on. It seems to want to pursue large poetic ideas. As you watch, however, it grows less dancy and less organic; its efforts to open up the story in various directions feel unrelated to one another. Mallarmé observed that poetry is written not with ideas but with words; and the same is true with dance: it’s made in not with ideas but with movement. Damnation, love, redemption, joy: Dance can express aspects of these, but here seems peripheral, a footnote. “Fantasque” looks less than half-baked. Despite the charm of the performers, the movement seems to unravel before your eyes.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Tim and Tyne Daly Are Dysfunctional Siblings in ‘Downstairs’,"There is no rewind button in live performance, and it might be that my ears deceived me. But I could almost swear that, as Tyne Daly made her entrance in Theresa Rebeck’s chilling new domestic thriller “Downstairs” the other night at the Cherry Lane Theater, she called her brother Tim’s character Timmy. He’s Teddy, actually, but she addressed him as Timmy once later in the show, too — a charming slip in a fine performance, and an easy one to make, given that the Dalys are playing siblings. Ms. Rebeck wrote “Downstairs” with them in mind, and for the first half it comes across as a comfortably uncomfortable dysfunctional-family drama about the psychologically fragile Teddy and his protective older sister, Irene, who is letting him stay on the couch in her unfinished basement. From the play’s wordless opening scene in this Primary Stages production, Teddy is comically, endearingly O.K. with his subterranean surroundings, rooting around amid rusty tools for a bowl for his cereal. (The grimy set is by Narelle Sissons.) Irene, who pops down to visit, likes having him there. It gives her someone to talk with, to cook and bake for, even if he rants sometimes in ways she finds upsetting — about the guy at his office who he’s sure has been poisoning him or the money their mother left to Irene, which she and her controlling husband, Gerry (John Procaccino), used to buy their house. “You want to act this crazy, go act this crazy somewhere else,” she tells her rumpled brother. “I am not going to allow you to act this crazy in my basement.” Teddy does have trouble staying tethered to reality, but he’s a smart and curious guy who loves Irene even as he uses her, and to his credit he’s too ingenuous to be a decent liar. Interspersed with his apparent delusions are observations of the sharpest lucidity: about his isolated sister, how the world really works and the dangers that she has elected not to see. Gerry’s malevolence, for instance. Ms. Daly’s Irene is a timid, beaten-down woman with a nervous smile and a Judy Garland flutter to her voice. So obedient to Gerry that she doesn’t work because he doesn’t want her to, she is the sort of person whose kindness and eagerness to please make her credulous, and far too tolerant of her husband’s cruelty. “So you’ve been living with a demon for, what, 30 years or something?” Teddy says, and it’s both disquieting and funny that he means demon literally. Directed with striking clarity and command by Adrienne Campbell-Holt, “Downstairs” is a well-constructed play of whipsaw moods that have much to do with Teddy’s instability — a restless volatility that Mr. Daly struggles to embody in a performance that is the production’s most amusing yet least convincing. But this is ultimately a kind of horror story, and in its second half we understand that the danger has been lurking in the house all along. What Ms. Rebeck is exploring here is the struggle between good and evil, and the tendency of decent people with honorable intentions to doubt their own perceptions when what they perceive is too sinister to seem plausible. “Downstairs” is about the realization that horrific actions that might have seemed solely the province of scary movies, or paranoid delusions, can be perpetrated by people in your life — perhaps against you and the ones you love. So it goes for Irene, anyway. Ms. Rebeck and Ms. Campbell-Holt are politically minded artists, and there is a larger social point in all this. It’s not just about domestic abuse (though it is about that) or looking after the most vulnerable among us (though it’s about that, too). It’s about shaking off willful naïveté and confronting menace instead of allowing it to determine how we live. If that sounds heavy-handed, it’s actually quite entertaining, all the more so when Gerry makes his entrance halfway through the intermissionless performance. A gray-haired suburban thug, he descends into the basement, and the play instantly thrums with tension, becoming the kind of show where it seemed perfectly natural that the young woman next to me started whispering urgent instructions to the characters, as if she were watching them on T.V. Mr. Procaccino’s Gerry is a magnificent villain — belligerent, dangerous and so habitually, casually vicious that he chews on a nail as he gives Irene a devastating, off-the-cuff list of reasons he married her. When one of them is “You’re pretty,” it’s a little bit heartbreaking to see her blatant need as she asks, “You think I’m pretty?” “Pretty enough,” he says. But by then she has already realized something crucial about the ties that bind us to one another. Some deserve strengthening. Others must be severed for dear life.

2019,Review: Tom Stoppard’s ‘The Hard Problem’ Is a Mind-Body Gabfest,"Just what is it that makes everybody fall in love with Hilary, the irresistible young academic at the center of Tom Stoppard’s “The Hard Problem,” the ontological gabfest that opened on Monday in a Lincoln Center Theater production? Yes, she has the usual desirable traits of being smart and good-looking and friendly. But what really makes Hilary such a magnet is something more elusive, a quality that has normally hard-minded people giving her a coveted job she’s probably not qualified for and violating all sorts of professional ethics on her behalf. Not that Hilary encourages such behavior. Because what gives Hilary that extra It factor is her desire to be Good — not as in good at work, or good in bed, but Good in its most capital-G, philosophically celebrated sense. A woman prone to antic behavior like praying in the middle of a one-night stand and putting a wastebasket over her head when she cries, Hilary is the Moral Pixie Dream Girl for an age of cynicism. Played by a likable Adelaide Clemens in Jack O’Brien’s production at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Hilary arrives in New York with excellent timing. When this noble character first appeared in London in 2015, in the premiere of “The Hard Problem,” Mr. Stoppard’s first full-length play in nine years, the Western world felt like a slightly more hopeful place. Since then, an epochal referendum in Britain and an American presidential election have divided the populations of the United Kingdom and the United States into seething partisan tribes. The idea that people are innately good — which is what Hilary hopes to prove — certainly has an enhanced quixotic luster. And who better to deal with the agony and ecstasy of such a quest than Mr. Stoppard? For more than half a century, this most vividly cerebral of dramatists has regularly found the passionate pulse in the pursuit of ideals in works like “Jumpers,” “Rock ‘n’ Roll” and his multipart “The Coast of Utopia” (dazzlingly staged by Mr. O’Brien at Lincoln Center in 2006 and 2007). Yet as the characters in “The Hard Problem” argue and argue and argue — at work, at parties, during Pilates sessions, in bed — about the essence of human behavior, the stakes seldom feel compellingly high. Abstractly, this play may be taking on the biggest concepts imaginable, yet on stage it feels disappointingly small. Mr. Stoppard, always a tireless self-editor, has tweaked and massaged “The Hard Problem” since I first saw it at the National Theater in London. And Mr. O’Brien’s staging feels lighter on its feet than Nicholas Hytner’s original version. Yet it is hard to avoid the impression that “The Hard Problem” — which often feels like the work of a precocious young neophyte rather than an old master — has yet to solve itself. The problem of the title is that eternal conundrum, the mind-body dichotomy. Is what we think of as altruism only another example of Darwinian self-preservation? Is that most idealized of human bonds, mother love, not a matter of virtue but utility? That’s certainly the belief of Spike (Chris O’Shea), an aggressively bright young man who felicitously retitles a Raphael portrait of Madonna and child “Woman Maximizing Gene Survival.” Spike is Hilary’s university tutor when we meet him, at her flat in the first scene, and they’re already going at it, breaking down the classic game theory puzzle known as the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Such talk evidently stimulates erotic appetites, because Hilary and Spike are in bed by the next scene, even as she continues to demand that he “explain consciousness.” It seems that Hilary is always looking for forgiveness, not just for being human and fallible, but for having given up for adoption the baby she had at 15. Her search for answers takes her to the mighty Krohl Institute for Brain Science, a behavioral think tank founded by a hedge fund king, Jerry Krohl (Jon Tenney). Against expectations, Hilary is offered a job there, beating out a brilliant fellow candidate, Amal (Eshan Bajpay). Under the supervision of her boss, Leo (Robert Petkoff), and assisted by the mathematically accomplished Bo (Karoline Xu), Hilary devises an experiment to demonstrate that children are by nature altruistic. But there are problems in the proving that will change the course of several lives. It’s a story that in itself offers some ingenious arguments and counterarguments for the play’s central debate. But watching the show, all you’re really conscious of is the repetitive thrust and parry of formal arguments, dressed up with winningly Stoppardesque turns of phrase. Mr. O’Brien tries to disarm potential objections by emphasizing the idea of theater itself as a problem-solving space. We begin with the young ensemble roaming David Rockwell’s airy, mutable set (lighted by Japhy Weideman) with hopeful smiles and what look like bound copies of the script, while blithe piano music percolates through the air. The cast — which also includes Nina Grollman, Tara Summers and Katie Beth Hall (as a little girl who looks a lot like Hilary) — exudes an easygoing smoothness even when plowing through the stoniest fields of metaphysics. But moments that should induce shivers, including an easily predicted revelation described as both “a coincidence” and “a miracle,” tend to land with a plunk. Being goodness incarnate is no easy task. Ms. Clemens, in a part that recalls the embattled and idealistic heroines of David Hare, lends Hilary an appealing humility spiked with just enough ego to keep her this side of unmodulated piety. Still, Mr. Stoppard makes it difficult for us to feel the depths of Hilary’s pain, which is essential if this play is to have emotional impact. I kept thinking of the character of Eleanor, in Mr. Stoppard’s “Rock ‘n’ Roll,” a woman with cancer who refuses to be defined by her disease. “I am not my body,” she roars at her husband, a Marxist materialist professor. “My body is nothing without me.” It’s an assertion far more moving — and convincing — than all the restless chatter of “The Hard Problem.” This information was last updated on Nov. 19, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Tyler Perry Turns Tiffany Haddish Loose in ‘Nobody’s Fool’,"Tyler Perry’s instincts as an entertainer are always sharp. Letting the comedic dynamo Tiffany Haddish have her way with his new romantic comedy-drama “Nobody’s Fool” is a typically savvy move. Haddish worked with Perry on his television series “If Loving You Is Wrong.” Here, in this R-rated movie (a rarity for Perry), Haddish riffs and mugs with much less inhibition. As Tanya, the ex-con sister of Tika Sumpter’s successful, love-starved ad executive Danica, Haddish motormouths sentiments unsparingly and hilariously profane, garnished with deliberately squirmy sexual metaphors. But even allowing for Haddish’s hilarious digressions, “Nobody’s Fool” is a baggy movie. In the first 50 minutes, it saunters through about 30 minutes’ worth of plot. Danica is in an online relationship that Tanya finds so suspicious that she ropes in the real-life creators of the series “Catfish: The TV Show.” In the meantime, a sweet, sensitive coffee shop owner named Frank (Omari Hardwick) pines for Danica, while helping Tanya with employment and addiction recovery. Frank, alas, doesn’t have the qualities on Danica’s list for an ideal man; once she finds out he is an ex-con, she’s even less interested. Until their first kiss. If the movie’s looseness lets in an excess of dead air, “Nobody’s Fool” is still dotted with pleasures besides those Haddish brings. Chris Rock has a funny cameo in which he goes near-full Redd Foxx, while Mehcad Brooks enlivens the last quarter as a dream guy who turns out to be very much less than that. Whoopi Goldberg, as the sisters’ pot-growing mom, contributes some funny stoner humor. Nonjudgmental stoner humor, at that. This is the first Perry movie I’ve seen to eschew strident moralizing, and it is all the better for that.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: With ‘Dirty John,’ a Podcast Is Worth 480 Minutes of TV","Near the end of the hit podcast “Dirty John,” a super-creepy true story about a predatory Southern California con man and one of the women he targeted, the reporter Christopher Goffard poses a question that’s been hanging for six episodes: What made John Meehan, a handsome, athletic nurse anesthesiologist, Dirty John? What goes on in the mind of a man who exploits and brutalizes one woman after another while claiming to be their victim? Goffard concludes that there’s no answer, that the expectation of one is “basically an illusion fostered by the movies we love and our need for comprehensible narratives.” Which is fine for a podcast. The audio series, based on reporting Goffard did for The Los Angeles Times, doesn’t entirely work as drama, but it’s mesmerizing — it’s like being in the middle of a multicar pileup that spins around you in slow motion, all the wreckage floating through the air for your examination. Television dramas need their comprehensibility, though, and “Dirty John” is now a scripted TV series, beginning Sunday on Bravo. Only three of eight episodes were made available, so we don’t know if it will provide the sort of answers Goffard was willing to forgo. But it’s already clear that “Dirty John” has been turned into a different, lesser, more digestible beast for TV. Recounting the story of Debra Newell, a successful Newport Beach businesswoman who fell hard for Meehan despite copious warning signs and the vociferous opposition of two of her daughters, the podcast imposes a sense of inexorable menace from the start. It also refuses to go soft on any of its characters, many of whom are interviewed by Goffard and readily describe their own blindness, cowardice and seemingly inexplicable actions. A TV show could have taken a similar approach, but this one doesn’t. Relatability is one goal of the series, which was created and written by Alexandra Cunningham (whose credits include “Desperate Housewives” and “Chance”) and directed by Jeffrey Reiner (“Friday Night Lights,” “The Affair”). Another, it seems, is resemblance to a standard woman-in-peril thriller, like a Lifetime movie stretched to four times the length. Toward those ends, there’s an attractive and talented cast: Connie Britton as Newell, Eric Bana as Meehan, Jean Smart as Newell’s mother, Juno Temple and Julia Garner as her daughters. Britton, who effortlessly manifests intelligence and capability, and Bana, who’s good with bland insincerity, might be solid choices for the roles, but they’re stranded because Cunningham’s script (in these episodes) doesn’t do its one job, which is to show us why this particular smart woman fell victim to this particular evil man. You could respect that as a desire to play fair with the real-life characters, or to replicate the podcast’s open-endedness. But the overall effect of the series — its lack of any visual or narrative originality, its embrace of movie-of-the-week formulas — makes it seem more likely that the goal is to keep as many viewers as possible happy. Bana’s Meehan is a sociopath lite, threatening but not especially disturbing. (If that changes later, it’ll be an abrupt shift.) Britton’s Newell appears to fall under Meehan’s spell simply because her previous bad experiences with men make her susceptible to his act. Those experiences are relayed in a generic bad-date montage that’s indicative of what the series comes up with when it “adds” to the material in the podcast. There are larger inventions, conveniences of plot or characterization like a five-figure theft of cash and the discovery of a long-term affair, that will aggravate people who have read or listened to the original story. If you’re one of those people, there’s really no reason to watch the Bravo series. (It’s being called an anthology, leaving open the possibility of future seasons based on different cases.) It’s not nearly as compelling, and its continual efforts to make the characters and situations more palatable grow wearying. One small but telling example: At a chilling moment when, in the podcast, we’re told that Newell laughed off a frightening remark made by Meehan, “not taking it seriously,” Britton plays Newell as clearly upset and unamused. Onscreen, letting us be put off or confused by the main character isn’t an option. And if you haven’t already experienced “Dirty John”? There’s still no reason to watch the series. The podcast is available free through iTunes or apps including Spotify, Stitcher and TuneIn.

2018,"Review: ‘9 Fingers,’ a Gangster Tale, Is Missing More Than a Digit","Back in the early aughts, the term “execution-dependent” was favored by big-money Hollywood executives who were calculating a movie’s chances of making a profit. A screenplay pitch might outline an ostensibly unstoppable concept, or, the thinking went, one that was execution-dependent: It would yield big returns only in a well-made film. This is a risible notion because pretty much all art is execution-dependent, despite the exceptional returns that some of the shoddiest pictures can yield. The phrase sprang to my mind while I was watching “9 Fingers” because this French movie kept checking off a lot of my personal-taste boxes while never quite satisfying me. Shot in black and white (and even on genuine celluloid film), “9 Fingers,” written and directed by F. J. Ossang, relates its narrative without much back story or conventional connective tissue. The film begins with a man on the run, dashing through a tunnel as car headlights pursue him. He jumps over a railing and into wet sand, then finds a dying man who hands him a package. The people behind those headlights catch up, capture him, drive him to a grand but ramshackle manor and make him part of their gang. The man, Magloire (Paul Hamy) gets to know his semi-captors, and particularly one of the women of the house, the enigmatic Drella (Lisa Hartmann). He hears of the fearsome criminal boss 9 Fingers, and is left behind as the fellows go on a daring caper. The heist goes wrong, and all of them take refuge on a cargo ship. “Welcome to hell,” its captain says as they board. The claustrophobia and the seeming inability of the ship to go anywhere bear out those words. All of this, and the various literary references that pepper the script (Raymond Roussel and “Les Chants de Maldoror” get shout-outs), suggest that “9 Fingers” ought to be a nifty fever dream of a noir pastiche. But some striking scenes notwithstanding, this movie doesn’t achieve the delirium it aspires to. It’s often flat and tame, and obvious in the wrong ways: An addled gang member, Kurtz, charts a course to “Nowhereland,” for instance. But “9 Fingers” did hold my attention throughout because I was always hoping to like it more.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘A Chorus Line,’ Still High-Stepping but Showing Its Age","When “A Chorus Line” opened on Broadway in 1975 — having step-ball-changed its way uptown from the New York Shakespeare Festival — it was the livingest thing in a dead zone. Over its 15-year run, its youthful vigor helped resuscitate the moribund theater district, and musical theater in general. Now “A Chorus Line” is 43, well past the age at which the anonymous ensemble dancers it honors would have retired, their bodies or bank accounts unable to hack it anymore. Still, if the show’s 11 o’clock anthem is correct, they are looking back on what they did for love — all those years spent on the line — without regret. No regrets here, either. I’m always excited to see “A Chorus Line.” (Well, maybe not the movie.) In any reasonably faithful production, like the one that opened on Wednesday night as part of City Center’s 75th anniversary gala, what’s thrilling about the show invariably remains so. But I wonder if the rest is beginning to get creaky. And make no mistake, this “Chorus Line,” which runs through Sunday evening, is religiously faithful. Like the 2006 Broadway revival, which Ben Brantley called an “anatomically correct reproduction” in his Times review, this one is directed by Bob Avian and choreographed by Baayork Lee to simulate the original. (Mr. Avian choreographed that production with Michael Bennett; Ms. Lee played Connie in it.) The now classic designs (sets by Robin Wagner, costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge, lighting by Tharon Musser) appear to have been retrieved from storage; you can almost smell the naphthalene wafting from the ultra-’70s woolens. The advantages of this fidelity go beyond historical interest. It’s an immense pleasure but also a profound education to see how Bennett and Mr. Avian — working with the composer Marvin Hamlisch, the lyricist Edward Kleban and the book writers James Kirkwood and Nicholas Dante — put the puzzle together. Has one number ever so efficiently established, as “I Hope I Get It” does, what a show is about, setting up its theme (the desperate need to perform), suggesting its conflicts, introducing its many characters and establishing its style? The perfectly organic sequence — you can’t tell where the collaborators’ individual contributions begin and end — demonstrates everything that’s best about “A Chorus Line.” It’s not the steps themselves; it’s the architecture. Assembling bodies into masses of light and dark, wiping the stage picture, irising in on an individual or panning the entire ensemble, Bennett creates a rhythm of revelation more akin to film than theater. At the same time, his visual minimalism, his use of blackness to set off its opposite, allows for effects that are distinctly theatrical, as when the dancers periodically return to their original positions to recreate the line, or when the line becomes a gaptoothed smile after someone gets injured. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] In these large-scale elements, “A Chorus Line” remains unimpeachable, even in a production that is necessarily a bit shaggy. (The City Center cast had only three weeks of rehearsal.) But just as the individual steps have always felt less important than the big picture, the individual stories of the dancers are beginning to feel less important than their group characteristics. That’s an irony, of course, for a musical whose foundational purpose was to reward the contributions and sacrifices of ensemble dancers by making them the stars. Those dancers, after all, are auditioning for a show whose actual star we never meet. As Zach, the director-choreographer pulls them one by one from the line to learn more about them, we are meant to engage in the specifics of their stories. How did they start dancing? Who got in their way? Why did they keep going? But these stories are sounding a little trite in 2018. Even when sharply performed — I especially enjoyed Jay Armstrong Johnson’s catty Bobby, Melanie Moore’s oddball Judy and Anthony Wayne’s overenthusiastic Richie — their tales of woe are both long-winded and unsurprising. The underlying commonalities among them (everyone’s sensitivity was mercilessly trampled in youth) are no less repetitive for being believable and touching. Even when treated more lightly, as in “Sing!” and “Dance: Ten; Looks: Three,” the punch lines seem pro forma, as if Bennett and his collaborators were looking to fill out a program with the requisite number of comedy bits. Only the first such number — “I Can Do That,” performed with immense charm here by Tommy Bracco as Mike — seems to hold its own. In compensation for the attention splitting that the original concept necessitated, “A Chorus Line” gradually reveals its focus on a central dancer, Cassie. Having made it off the line into featured roles, Cassie found her further rise blocked by a case of self-diagnosed bad acting. Now she wants to return to the ensemble, a fate that Zach — her former lover, it turns out — resists on her behalf as if it were death. It’s here, in the story of the relationship between Zach (Tony Yazbeck) and Cassie (Robyn Hurder), that “A Chorus Line” most shows its age and its underlying confusions. It’s not just that the dialogue now sounds like soap opera psychobabble. But Zach’s argument — not helped by his spending most of the show as a disembodied voice booming orders over the so-called “god mic” — seems to undermine the idea that the rest of the show is promoting: That the true stars are the non-stars. “A Chorus Line” has never really been able to solve the Zach problem, perhaps because he is so clearly based on Bennett himself. It helps that Mr. Yazbeck, even playing a brute, has tremendous stage warmth. But the only time this story really makes sense is when Cassie dances it — not so much in her big solo, “The Music and the Mirror,” as in her audition sequences. Her desperation to stop being exceptional so she can get the job (watch Ms. Hurder struggle to tone down her extensions) is heartbreaking. That’s the “Chorus Line” compromise. It will never say in words what it demonstrates so eloquently in movement. Even in the best productions, and this one’s good enough, it will always be a Cassie.

2019,Review: ‘American Son’ Puts Kerry Washington in a Maternal Nightmare,"Critic’s Pick Some great performances come with elaborate costumes or prosthetic noses attached. Some involve crackerjack timing or floods of tears. But the great performance Kerry Washington is giving in “American Son,” which opened on Sunday at the Booth Theater on Broadway, features no such decoration. The only thing Ms. Washington has to do as Kendra Ellis-Connor is bulldoze her way through 85 minutes of mounting agony as a mother whose son may be in desperate trouble. Let’s add “black” to that sentence, because it changes everything: “as a black mother whose son may be in desperate trouble.” “American Son,” by Christopher Demos-Brown, is part of a wave of new plays that consider the vulnerability of young black men in their dealings with the police. But unlike “Pass Over,” “Until the Flood,” “Kill Move Paradise” and “Scraps,” the style here is neither surreal nor poetic; it’s ticktock realism, deployed in real time. And the focus is not on the young men or the police but on the parents caught in between. Offering a reverse angle on the standard procedural, “American Son” takes place entirely in the waiting room of a South Florida police station, where in the middle of a stormy night Kendra and her estranged husband, Scott, await news of their missing 18-year-old son, Jamal. Scott (Steven Pasquale) is an F.B.I. agent. Is that why he is so much more effective at dislodging information from Officer Paul Larkin, the policeman on duty? Or is it because of his lack of apparent hostility? Or because both men are white? In any case, Scott quickly learns things that Kendra, who sees racism wherever she looks, cannot. The thing is, Kendra is right. The play’s schematic setup allows Mr. Demos-Brown to demonstrate how the tendrils of prejudice creep everywhere, even into the cracks of a marriage. Scott, though he loves Kendra, simply isn’t very troubled when the clueless Larkin (Jeremy Jordan) describes her with phrases like “the natives are restless” or says that she goes “from zero to ghetto in, like, nothing flat.” No matter that Kendra is a professor of psychology who corrects her husband’s “white trash” diction. In the mind of the officer, she is still the mother of a thug. Would he have asked a white woman, as he asks Kendra, whether her son, despite acing A.P. physics at an elite private school, has gold teeth? Though comments like this put the audience strongly on Kendra’s side, she does not make it easy to stay there. She is needling, sarcastic, suspicious, inflexible. It is not a pretty role, and properly so; why should Kendra have to be ingratiating to be sympathetic? [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] In jeans and tennis shoes, with her hair pulled back to highlight her weary, worried face, Ms. Washington trails no glamour from her seven seasons as the political fixer Olivia Pope on “Scandal.” Nor does she have any of Olivia’s finesse and power. All she has is a torrent of words, barely containing her rage at everything: at her son for slapping a provocative bumper sticker on his car, at her husband for leaving them, at the police for stonewalling her and at history itself. For even as she speaks through Kendra’s specific experience in lines like “Everything’s coming apart,” Ms. Washington evokes a larger and longer disaster. No matter how you build your life to avoid it, her performance suggests, the day will come when your black son is in danger. Perhaps all of your decoys, all of your success, will make that day come more surely. This is a despairing message in a despairing play, and it renders the actual plot almost secondary. Indeed, after the first few minutes we don’t learn much more about what’s happened to Jamal until the final curtain. In between, the dispensing of calibrated micro-doses of information can seem manipulative; much of it could as easily be revealed earlier. But Mr. Demos-Brown, who is white, is interested in the procedural details only as a tensioning device. His real aim, evidently, is to shift the narrative about police and young black men from individual cases to universal feelings. It would be hard for any parent not to be harrowed by the terror both Kendra and Scott express, in their own ways, about the disappearance of their child. The play’s title clearly expresses that generalizing intention. This puts enormous pressure on the production to keep the personal material in focus, lest the whole thing tip into polemics. Though I could quibble with some of the staging, which sometimes seems to get stuck behind furniture, this is the director Kenny Leon’s best work to date: incisive and breakneck. If the police station set by Derek McLane is a bit grand in scale, it fills the Booth nicely and emphasizes Kendra’s powerlessness. And for the first time I can recall, a thunderstorm recreated onstage actually seems like a thunderstorm instead of a comment. The cast manages a similar feat of naturalism: These are big but nuanced performances. Mr. Pasquale, for once ideally cast, fully inhabits Scott’s contraption of a personality, easygoing for about an inch and chaotic underneath. (Listen, if you can, for his devastating last lines.) Mr. Jordan, naturally ingratiating onstage, smartly uses that ingratiation to suggest a character who has never had to dig any deeper. And as a police lieutenant who arrives near the end, Eugene Lee makes a powerful figure of a plot device. “American Son” is not a subtle play; it barely feels like a play at all. With its unrelentingly high tension on every level — maternal, marital, societal — it’s more like a slice of a nightmare, with few contours despite its surprises. Its abrupt ending doesn’t even offer a chance for catharsis; it just spits you out. But why should the audience be let off the hook? Why, when everything’s coming apart, should any of us?

2018,Review: ‘Bernie and Mikey’s Trip to the Moon’ Is Old-School Drama,"At first glance it’s hard to tell when “Bernie and Mikey’s Trip to the Moon” takes place. The set’s tired kitchen and living room could have been lifted from any of the past six decades. The characters’ clothing is unburdened by fashion trends. Elvis Presley is playing. We could be watching “The Honeymooners” or “Roseanne.” Scott Aiello’s play, which just opened at 59E59 Theaters in Manhattan, passingly establishes that we are in the 1990s — the clunky corded phone helps — but avoids references to the news, technology or pop culture. The focus stays tight on the working-class Vincolo family as they negotiate life with an intellectually disabled daughter in a Chicago suburb: Bernie, now in her 20s and still playing in a sandbox. Bernie (Stephanie Gould), alternately docile and demanding, rude and sweet, stubborn and accommodating, sets the pace of the Vincolos’ existence. Her perpetually harried mother, Gladys (Margo Singaliese), is the very picture of long-suffering grit, busying herself making what we suspect is a bottomless supply of pasta and gravy — this is an Italian-American brood, after all — while her father, Mike Sr. (Jordan Lage), finds an escape tending his bar, the Scorpio Lounge. As for the kind, soft-spoken Mike Jr. (Forrest Malloy), he is accepting of a future caring for his sister when their parents are gone, and resigned to his dead-end job at a chain restaurant. What he is not resigned to anymore, however, is being considered a friend by Laura (Ismenia Mendes), the pretty co-worker he loves. When she flees after his romantic declaration, Mikey, as he is known, is crushed but also spurred into action. Things can’t continue as they always have. Mr. Aiello, an actor making his playwriting debut, works in a vein we don’t see much on our stages nowadays, which could be described as no-nonsense American realism — an antecedent would be the teleplays Paddy Chayefsky wrote in the 1950s, like “Marty.” Claire Karpen’s production for the Strangemen Theater Company — the troupe behind the 2015 Off Broadway hit “The Woodsman” — stays true to the play’s traditional approach. The cast eschews actorly fireworks, starting with Ms. Gould, who herself has a mild form of cerebral palsy and does not shy from Bernie’s difficult side. The restrained Mr. Malloy is also very good at suggesting the inner life of a decent man who could easily have skidded into sad-sackdom. (The set is by James Ortiz.) This delicate approach has its limits, though. The writing is unshowy at best, but can veer into awkwardness, especially in the scenes with the clichéd, underwritten Laura — there is a thin line between classic and passé. More of a problem is that the show is content to flit from setback to crisis without dwelling on any of them. Mr. Aiello suggests caring for Bernie has not had an entirely positive impact on her parents’ relationship, but does not explore that subplot. The young woman also has a suitor, Jeff Goldblum (Benjamin Rosloff), who is on the autism spectrum. This raises the issue of their agency, particularly when it comes to sex, but Mr. Aiello mostly uses the situation for levity. Still, “Bernie and Mikey’s Trip to the Moon” does elicit good will, if nothing else for its stubborn refusal to follow theatrical fashion.

2018,"Review: ‘Bodied,’ a Shockingly Funny Battle Rap Satire","With visuals as kinetic as its language, Joseph Kahn’s “Bodied” is an outrageously smart, shockingly funny satire of P.C. culture whose words gush so quickly you’ll want to see it twice. Set in the world of battle rap where combatants square off to exchange what amounts to exquisitely tuned insult poetry, the story (by Alex Larsen, a.k.a. Kid Twist, a 10-year veteran of the battle rap scene) follows Adam (Calum Worthy), a gawky grad student and a paperwhite audience surrogate. Researching rap’s use of the N-word, Adam is entranced by the vim and creativity of the performers and their utter lack of linguistic inhibition. But when he discovers his own talent for the form, his enthusiasm and naïveté threaten not just his relationship with his uptight girlfriend and culturally sensitive cohort, but his academic future to boot. Sweaty and swift, “Bodied” is the third feature from the South Korean director Joseph Kahn, who understands that a movie about words also has to gladden the eyes. To that end, Matt Wise’s camera ricochets among the actors — including the magnificent Shoniqua Shandai as a mouthy force of nature who owns every man she battles — and slams from one scene to another with unruly energy. Quieter moments, especially in the sensitively drawn connection between Adam and his rap mentor (a terrific Jackie Long), allow the movie to explore the complexity of cultural interaction with more subtlety than we’ve come to expect from our modern comedies. Though losing some momentum in the middle, “Bodied” mostly maintains an irresistible, deliriously offensive roll, jabbing sharply at racism and misogyny with rhymes that spark and fizz. The very opposite of a niche movie, it insists that only when we retreat to tribes do we risk belonging nowhere at all.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Calling Glenn’ Puts a Humorous Spin on Gaga Dancing,"Since 2013, when the Israeli-born choreographer Danielle Agami moved to Los Angeles, she has been making a name for herself there, winning awards with and without her company, Ate9. New Yorkers don’t have many chances to check out her work, but one came on Saturday, when her troupe performed at the Schimmel Center. And the piece, “Calling Glenn,” alludes in its title to an additional attraction: Glenn Kotche, the drummer for the rock band Wilco. The curtain rises on him, about to strike a vibraphone, and he stays visible throughout the 70-minute work. Yet apart from an interlude during which he comes forward to drum the stage, Mr. Kotche keeps to the dim rear, usually behind his heavily accessorized drum kit or another instrument, receding from focus even when he’s whirling a bullroarer overhead. We’re aware of his rumpled presence (the tousled hair, the hoodie) but also that he isn’t the show. The dancing is, and it commands attention. Ms. Agami’s hyper-flexible dancers can bend every which way, unpredictably. They can strut and pose like catwalk models and leap like frogs, but most often they crouch and collapse and press their faces to the floor. This style is immediately recognizable. It’s unmistakably derived from that of Ohad Naharin, the longtime artistic director of Batsheva Dance Company. Ms. Agami is an alumna of that troupe and a noted teacher of Gaga, the globally popular movement language Mr. Naharin invented. Not every good choreographer develops a language, and Ms. Agami speaks her borrowed tongue with considerable skill. She arranges her dancers with variety, gathering them in audience-assaulting unison or contrapuntal patterns to Mr. Kotche’s serviceable beat (which is more pounding than polyphonic). She combines her dancers into a coherent ensemble while giving each member individualized moments. If you like Gaga, you’ll probably like what she does with it. For me, her choreography gets stuck where much Gaga-derived dancing does. Intended to direct a dancer’s focus toward inward sensation and liberate a dancer from visual conventions (no mirrors allowed in Gaga studios), it tends to produce an ostentatious eccentricity, a new convention that’s artificial and distancing. Maybe Ms. Agami is aware of the problem, and is trying to address it in “Calling Glenn” with knockabout humor. While trying to watch Mr. Kotche play a glockenspiel, the dancers block one another’s sightlines (that old gag). Later, men in dresses knock one another away from microphones, each going full diva as Mr. Kotche provides sound effects in place of song. This bit gets a gender-politics punch line, as women take the mics away and one stuffs the phallic object into her pants. Is this ordinary comedy meant to be humanizing? The closest the dance comes to tenderness is in a chain of male-female duets. Fitting foot to face, slotting chin into shoulder, poking, slapping, wrestling, the dancers act out shifts of power that are inventive within a familiar mode. When one jumps through hoops made by the other’s body, it’s sweet. And at the end of that sequence, when two of the pairs turn away from their partners and start kissing members of the same gender, the twist feels almost fresh.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Digital Renaissance’ Argues Consumers of Media Never Had It So Good. Is That the Case?,"Book Entry Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ The maxim “never let a good crisis go to waste” is usually applied to opportunistic politicians seeking to further an agenda. But it could be equally applied to businesspeople, who have often used economic challenges to elicit benefits from the government. Digitization has provided many such “crises.” It has shaken industries and led business to turn to the government for help: Retailers have asked for protection from Amazon, taxi firms from Uber and hoteliers from Airbnb. But the resulting debates often ignore the relevant data and focus on the wrong questions. Joel Waldfogel’s new book, “Digital Renaissance: What Data and Economics Tell Us About the Future of Popular Culture,” seeks to address that, with its examination of the tremendous disruption that the internet has wrought on the creative industries — music, book publishing, television and movies. And in his view, we should simply “sit back, relax and enjoy the renaissance,” rather than accede to any cries for help from media businesses. Professor Waldfogel’s thesis is disarmingly simple: What matters for culture, he says, is the well-being of media consumers, not media producers. So he exhaustively examines the quantity and quality of media produced since digital technologies became widespread and concludes that both are at an all-time high. End of story. That might have made for a short book, but “Digital Renaissance” analyzes a lot of data and research. Increases in content quality, of course, are highly subjective. To solve for this problem, Professor Waldfogel, an economist at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, looks at the views of both the masses and the “experts.” For instance, when it comes to books, he cross-correlated millions of reviews on Goodreads with lists of “notable” books from experts over time. Much of this data is kind of interesting. Who knew that when the Modern Library compiled a list of the hundred best English-language novels of the 20th century by a board of intellectual heavyweights (including Gore Vidal, William Styron and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.) and compared it with a list developed from an online poll of 400,000 avid readers, none of the readers’ top five choices (including “To Kill a Mockingbird”) even made it on the experts’ list? It is hard to argue with Professor Waldfogel’s core conclusion from that kind of painstaking study: that the internet has greatly increased the quantity and overall quality of books, records, movies and TV shows. What is not clear, though, is that his broader conclusions regarding the health of our popular culture, in general, are justified. Although “Digital Renaissance” bills itself as a study of the “creative industries” writ large, it concerns itself almost exclusively with hit-driven sectors. But not all creative businesses are hit driven in the same way. It is not evident why long-form journalism published as nonfiction books is covered but not newspapers and magazines, given the high cultural relevance and significantly different economics of the latter. An examination of the news industries undoubtedly would have also shown that there is more journalism being produced than ever because of the lower production costs. But it would also have shown an increase in the polarization in how news is consumed and a reduction of certain categories of culturally critical news — such as local investigative reporting — where costs have not fallen as fast. Even in the hit-driven sectors examined by “Digital Renaissance,” important digitally inspired changes are still afoot that require further examination before declaring cultural victory. Movie studios now overwhelmingly produce sequels, reboots and spinoffs; lists of the top 10 TV shows are dominated by sporting events. Professor Waldfogel spends no time exploring changes in how our time is spent within these industries or the role they play in a cultural life that now includes categories of media that did not exist before the digital revolution. One cannot fault Professor Waldfogel for the quality of his work regarding the narrow question he has chosen to analyze. In particular, his “Digital Renaissance” should be consulted by any regulator or legislator being solicited by a forlorn media mogul looking to protect a traditional business from disruptive market forces. While economic analysis can contribute to our understanding of the world, however, it alone cannot answer what we think is important to our culture. A full assessment of whether we are experiencing a true digital renaissance needs to consider that issue, too.",The New York Times
2019,Review: ‘King Kong’ Is the Mess That Roared,"How to take on a one-ton gorilla? We sent both of our chief critics to “King Kong,” the $35 million, Australian-born musical that opened Thursday night at the Broadway Theater. Far from Skull Island and the wrath of Kong, they huddled to talk it out. BEN BRANTLEY Hello, Jesse. Though I’m not in a playful mood this morning — having just seen the spirit-crushing “King Kong” — what if we begin this dialogue with a game? Imagine you are on the street, having just left the theater, and are asked by a television interviewer to describe your response in one word. Well? JESSE GREEN It can’t be printed here, and I’m not even sure it’s one word. (It starts with “ape.”) So I guess I’ll go with “ugh.” BRANTLEY I understand what you’re saying. Since screaming is such a big part of the show, mine would be “aaaaaaaaargh.” GREEN We were hoping in reviewing this together that one of us might have something nicer to say than the other one does. But it looks like our opinions rhyme at least as well as most of the lyrics in the show. BRANTLEY You mean like, “But this is not the end of me / ’Cause this beast is clemency”? GREEN When I see a musical drawn from a work in another genre — in this case the 1933 movie and its novelization — one thing I look for is the added value. What is gained in bringing “King Kong” to the stage? Certainly not provocative or insightful songwriting. The score is a hodgepodge of soundtrack-style murk by Marius de Vries and a clutch of no-profile songs by Eddie Perfect, whose score for “Beetlejuice” is heading toward Broadway even as we speak. Did you think the music added anything? BRANTLEY No, but I think you’re missing the point. The only reason for this “King Kong” to exist is its title character. So before we eviscerate the show, directed and choreographed by Drew McOnie, shall we briefly praise the animatronic ape (designed by Sonny Tilders)? GREEN Sadly, I have mixed feelings about Kong himself. Certainly he is the most expressive performer onstage, what with the platoon of puppeteers and voice artists bringing him to life. Only they don’t quite get there. Even aside from his long-waisted baby body, there is something logy and jowly about him; he seems like Khrushchev on Thorazine. BRANTLEY Yeah, I thought of a (barely) animated gargoyle from the Notre Dame cathedral. Disney casting agents, are you listening? [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] GREEN The adapters of this “King Kong” seem to have two stories they wanted to tell. One is a morality tale about the evil of trapping a living being in a cheap entertainment scheme. To judge from my own misery in the audience, I’d say this is a theme they mastered. BRANTLEY And the other theme, would that be the equation of ape in captivity with the oppression of women? GREEN Yes. A feminist angle is attempted, not very convincingly. When the plucky farm girl Ann Darrow (Christiani Pitts) arrives in Manhattan intent on making it big in showbiz, it’s with an explicit streak of post-liberation consciousness. “At least I’m not some man’s property,” she sings in a song called “Queen of New York.” BRANTLEY And when Kong — dragged from his native Skull Island to Depression-era New York by the cynical, selfish and typically male showman Carl Denham (Eric William Morris) — has escaped from the theater where he’s been put on exploitative display, she sings a battle hymn of sympathy to him. (“From birth we’ve both been playing a game we cannot win / We’ll never break the lock or ever leave the box the world has put us in.”) GREEN A car wreck of clichés like that simply can’t put a feminist story across meaningfully. Or any story, really — and that’s a bigger problem than the bad score and sluggish 20-foot marionette. I find it hard to believe that the book is by Jack Thorne, who won a Tony Award last season for writing “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” BRANTLEY Yes, but as far as I can tell, the story — and the music and the gymnastic dancing — are basically just filler until Kong shows up again and looks noble and sorrowful and, occasionally (when Peter Mumford’s lighting is really low), menacing. Didn’t you sense the live performers knew they weren’t the main attraction? GREEN Mr. McOnie certainly had them working frantically. During the musical numbers, which feel relentless, the ensemble comes off as a troupe of overstimulated mimes playing charades. But here’s my question for you: Was there anything, aside from Kong’s two or three expressions, you actually enjoyed? BRANTLEY Not really. I kept hoping a higher camp factor might kick in. When poor Ann is taken to Kong’s lair, and makes quips about his housekeeping and bachelor ways, I longed for the reincarnation of Madeline Kahn, who made such blissful hay out of similar material in “Young Frankenstein.” GREEN The camp here is all accidental. The Skull Island jungle looks like green spaghetti with phlegm balls. (The scenic and projection designer is Peter England.) But the oppressiveness of the music and the over-intensity of the staging never allow you to laugh at, and therefore enjoy, the ludicrousness of the story. BRANTLEY Agreed. By the way, if you look at accounts of the Australian incarnation of five years ago, which had a book by Craig Lucas, it featured several more characters, including a love interest for Ann. In this version, there are effectively three central human characters: the agency-seeking Ann; the chauvinist, bad-mogul Carl; and (oh, dear) his put-upon, slow-witted, golden-hearted assistant, Lumpy (Erik Lochtefeld). GREEN The bevy of previous authors discarded in the course of the musical’s development dodged a bullet here. But Mr. Lochtefeld actually manages to give a sincere and human-scale performance, even if most of what he has to say is maudlin hogwash. BRANTLEY Yes, even the screams lacked eloquence. Fay Wray, the star of the original, is best remembered for her earsplitting howls of terror when she’s in the big guy’s clutches. But our intrepid Ann is incapable of screaming in fear. Instead, she roars, and that’s what attracts her soul mate Kong to her. Unfortunately, I didn’t hear a lot of Katy Perry power in Ms. Pitts’s scream. GREEN Perhaps we are mistaken in applying arty standards to the cynical product of an ambitious entertainment company that made its name on animatronic arena shows. Character logic may not matter here as much as the intermission sales of the Kongopolitan (vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice and a splash of lime). I looked in vain for the Kong-branded Thorazine. BRANTLEY Gee, Jesse, it’s enough to make even you long for a margarita, with Jimmy Buffett melodies on the side. GREEN You are referring to “Escape to Margaritaville,” which until now was my musical theater low point of 2018. Jimmy, I take it all back.

2018,Review: ‘Kreatur’ Wraps Its Dancers in a Succession of Skins,"Bodies break. So can societies. Here’s one thing we can pretty much all agree on: The world is in a state of disruption, one that feels more extreme with each passing day. The German choreographer Sasha Waltz, in the United States premiere of her work “Kreatur,” reveals the unraveling of a society as its individuals perish in isolation and find their collective power as a group. But first, the body needs protection. The most striking part of this production is not Ms. Waltz’s choreography, which has her dancers, time and again, torquing their spines in self-conscious agitation, or its electronic score, by the experimental music trio Soundwalk Collective, that features recordings from the inside of factories and buildings, like a former Stasi prison. It’s the costumes and the way in which Urs Schönebaum’s lighting continually transforms them from soft to hard, from protection to a weapon. For “Kreatur,” performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Howard Gilman Opera House on Friday, the Dutch designer Iris van Herpen has produced an array of sculptural designs that encase the body, beginning with the opening look: Dancers, emerging out of darkness, don fantastical creations constructed from laser-cut steel. Semitransparent, they surround the flesh like the downy white threads that sprout on a dandelion after its yellow petals fall away. These dancer-phantoms gradually shed their costumes, or skin, in favor of the real thing: Wearing only briefs, they inch across the stage slowly and methodically, melting from one contorted pose to the other. It becomes tiresome fast. They let us see how hard they are working, and that’s a distraction even as translucent sheets of mylar are wrapped around the nearly nude dancers, and their magnetized flesh shines through. For a time, there is a prickly quality to the choreography, in which fingers splay and chests contract to lend the sensation that the performers are no longer exactly humans, but — and this is a word I like to avoid in describing dancers, yet since it is the name of the show — creatures. A montage of scenes come and go. At one point, the dancers climb a white staircase and squeeze together on its platform. Writhing and twisting, they struggle to maintain their footing, but it’s inevitable that a couple slip off. “Stop crying!” one dancer tells another, and when she finally does, she follows it up with, “Stop breathing!” When an ominous porcupine figure appears — its needles shimmer dangerously — the group reacts with fear and then overpowers it. The surprise is that after they remove its prickly head, it is revealed to be a woman and not a man. Eventually this 90-minute work, which has many parts but never becomes whole, winds down as an ode to love. As birds chirp faintly in the distance and the lighting shifts to daybreak, a voice-over announces, “My heart is empty but the songs I sing are filled with love for you.” The song “Je t’aime … moi non plus” plays, and select dancers lip-sync the lyrics, as sung by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. It gets more physical as two men kiss passionately, while other couples slap their bodies into each other — chest to chest, hand to thigh. “Kreatur” may begin with covered flesh; by the end, we not only see it, we hear it. The final image, of the dancer Claudia de Serpa Soares wrapped in plastic, leaves behind a message: We all have skin, and we don’t need armor to protect us if we rely on one another.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Marfa Girl 2,’ Larry Clark’s Sequel to One of His Least-Known Films","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s been some years since Larry Clark’s days as one of American cinema’s foremost provocateurs, a pioneering photographer who took his fascination with dead-end lives, drug use, and adolescent sexuality and channeled it into controversial, acclaimed films such as “Kids” (1995) and “Bully” (2001). And although it’s loaded with sex, the most brazen thing about “Marfa Girl 2” might be that it presupposes some knowledge of “Marfa Girl,” which played the Rome Film Festival in 2012, received limited theatrical distribution in 2015 and made little impact with critics or audiences. Even stranger: Clark actually includes scenes from the earlier film in this one, though they only add minimal context. Like the previous movie, “Marfa Girl 2” follows the lives of some young, down-and-out characters in the dusty town of Marfa, Texas. Chief among them is the skater Adam (Adam Mediano), who has two children from two different women, and Marfa Girl (Drake Burnette), who herself is now saddled with an infant, the result of a brutal rape that occurred in the earlier movie. Clark’s characters ease into intimacy and sex, and there’s an unhurried, improvisatory simplicity to their interactions. But they wrestle with the responsibilities of parenting: Adam can’t be bothered, and Marfa Girl suffers from trauma and postpartum depression. There’s no judgment here. Clark likes to linger on close-ups of intertwined naked bodies, and he seems to admire these characters’ freedom. But ultimately, it all feels whisper thin: The film, already quite short, doesn’t offer enough about any of these people for us to care genuinely about what happens to them.

2018,Review: ‘Mefistofele’ at the Met Opera Is a Devil That Dances,"Critic’s Pick The best that can be said for some recent Metropolitan Opera productions — “Samson et Dalila” and “Tosca,” I’m looking at you — is that they don’t actively hinder the works being performed. But Robert Carsen’s staging hardly ever stops helping Boito’s “Mefistofele,” which opened on Thursday in its first Met revival in almost 20 years. Here is a lavishly flawed opera — a lush, static, lengthy musical layer cake — that achieves levity, and even demonic delight, through Mr. Carsen’s interventions. He turns Boito’s sequence of episodes from Goethe’s “Faust” into a louche, lively cross-chronological carnival: part Italian street theater, part bordello, part Baroque theater, part Catholic Mass. If this all doesn’t make “Mefistofele” quite succeed, it does make it dance. Mr. Carsen’s visual coups — the sets and costumes of the staging, which dates back to a 1988 run in Geneva, are by Michael Levine — match Boito’s soaring music; they’re stunning in their simplicity. A rich red stage curtain rises to reveal a cloud-dotted blue sky. As the chorus chants that poetry must ascend to the heavens, flats depicting an ancient Greek landscape float upward. The devil, violin in hand, climbs to the stage from the orchestra pit on a blood-colored ladder. That devil, the opera’s title character, is the reason to do the piece, which owes many of its performances over the past few decades to Samuel Ramey, a commanding and sly Mefistofele for whom the Carsen production was mounted. Christian Van Horn’s pectoral muscles are as prominent as Mr. Ramey’s, and his arms maybe even bigger, which goes a long way in a staging with a sexy, frequently shirtless Satan. Rising — or, should I say, descending — to his first leading role at the Met, Mr. Van Horn is a bass-baritone, not a bass. Like Mr. Ramey, his smooth, powerful, flexible voice has its greatest impact in the baritonal region, rather than the sepulchral depths; his voice doesn’t bloom as it moves downward. And with both Boito and Mr. Carsen placing a premium on sarcasm and sensuality, Mr. Van Horn wants, perhaps, an extra dash of devil-may-care relish. But that may come: This was, it should be said, his first-ever performance of the role. Long may he reign in hell. Michael Fabiano’s Faust was, as usual with this tenor, tensely forceful — sometimes exciting, sometimes strained. As Margherita, whom he seduces and abandons, the soprano Angela Meade checked the boxes of dramatic involvement: probing high notes, earthy low ones. But her voice, while penetrating, is not broad — it’s a kind of fine-tipped pen of sound — so she gives the impression of being more poised than impassioned. As they often do in “Mefistofele,” the choral episodes — the ethereal Prologue and Epilogue and the raucous Witches’ Sabbath — made the strongest impressions, even if those set pieces could have been built more inexorably by Carlo Rizzi, the conductor, who could also drive the sumptuous-sounding orchestra with even more focus.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘My Brilliant Friend’ Is an Intimate Epic,"Critic’s Pick In 2011, HBO began a series based on a set of books whose legion of fans had exacting expectations. “Game of Thrones” required condensing a vast narrative, visualizing wonders like dragons’ flight and creating a world that spanned continents. HBO’s new series “My Brilliant Friend,” based on the wildly popular Neapolitan novels of Elena Ferrante, is a different but no smaller challenge. The story of a febrile and rivalrous friendship between two girls in a working-class Italian neighborhood in the 1950s, it is as intimate as “Game of Thrones” is sweeping. The first season, which begins Sunday, is set largely in a single cluster of apartments. Its drama, though punctuated by violence, is interior and inwardly focused. It enfolds warring families and shifting alliances, but in a setting where everyone is packed close and prying eyes and whispers are inescapable. It is a game of courtyards, stairwells and balconies. But as earthbound as it is, “My Brilliant Friend” is no less transporting. For readers of the books, it is probably enough to know that the first season, which corresponds to the first of the four novels, sticks close to the source material. For newcomers, that is the story of Elena Greco, called Lenù, and Rafaella Cerullo, called Lila. They form an ardent bond their first year of school, in a dusty, low-rise neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. Lenù (played by Elisa Del Genio as a girl, Margherita Mazzucco as a teenager) is studious and reserved, a people pleaser. Lila (Ludovica Nasti and Gaia Girace) is prodigiously smart, with a fierce charisma and a prophet’s coal-eyed intensity. They’re two bright girls in a community that doesn’t know what to do with bright girls. [Want to read more about “My Brilliant Friend”? Here’s our roundup of what’s being written.] As they get older, their lives diverge. Lenù’s parents keep her in school (an expense her mother resents). Lila, a shoe repairman’s daughter, drops out to work but devours books and teaches herself Latin and Greek, mastering effortlessly what Lenù strains to achieve. “My Brilliant Friend” is constantly conscious of how money and small gradations of privilege change lives. When you’re poor, aspiration can become a burden, something that makes your parents angry. If you have a gift, like Lila does, you must use it as a tool, to free yourself. “To escape this neighborhood,” she announces, “you need money.” An international coproduction directed by the Italian filmmaker Saverio Costanzo, “My Brilliant Friend” is scripted in Italian, which makes its cloistered world all the more immersive. The grimy neighborhood — part of a vast complex of original sets — reproduces physically what Ferrante’s prose communicated, the claustrophobia of the setting and the relationships. (The adjective “close” can mean either “dear” or “suffocating.” In “My Brilliant Friend,” it always means both.) Just beyond the four-story apartments, trains pass and cars speed on the highway, but no one here is going anywhere. Sunlight and air are things to be found elsewhere, or inside books. When Lenù spends a few weeks on a nearby resort island, or the girls and their friends take a disastrous outing to a wealthy part of Naples, they may as well have stepped onto another planet. The poverty left behind by the war still looms, as does resentment toward the few families who got wealthy off the fascist-era black market and now rule like tiny royal houses. The girls know Don Achille (Antonio Pennarella), the town’s thuggish kingpin, as a real-life boogeyman; later, Marcello and Michele Solara (Elvis Esposito and Alessio Gallo), arrogant rich bros who cruise girls, sharklike, in their shiny car, become a more familiar menace. Ferrante is credited as a writer on the series, and like her novels, the adaptation has a sharp sense of time and place without nostalgia or sentimentality. Costanzo’s attention to period detail helps; it can feel as if you’re watching a lost postwar Italian film about postwar Italy. You see the world expand through the eyes of two girls — days of dullness, punctuated by men beating each other in the street and women raging out windows. A scene imagines the town’s quiet anger, in Lenù’s fantasy, as a swarm of insects that teem from the sewers at night, “making our mothers as angry as starving dogs.” All four actresses in the pivotal roles are astounding. Nasti and Girace convey Lila’s spooky genius maturing into volatility. Del Genio and Mazzucco have the less showy but equally complex role: Lenù is insightful, yet her emotions are enigmatic even to herself. In the few places “My Brilliant Friend” stumbles, it is from an excess of faithfulness to the source. The series keeps the framing device — an older Lenù sets out to write the story after getting a call that Lila has gone missing — and therefore the narration, which in the novel helped sketch the complicated inner life of the reserved Lenù. But it would often be better to let the direction and the remarkable performances show us what we’re being told. The voice-over can end up competing with them, as when the teenage Lenù goes to Naples with her father and sees the sea for the first time. We can see the awe and sense of possibility on her face; we don’t need to hear it as well. Overall, though, it’s no small thing how well and how often “My Brilliant Friend” finds TV correlatives for the luminous art of Ferrante, the series’s unseen star. Ferrante is not listed as the creator (there is no creator credit on the series), but “My Brilliant Friend” still stands out in an HBO drama-series lineup that has been dominated by turbulent men. As the story of “My Brilliant Friend” expands, it takes on elements of more testosterone-driven cable dramas: men raging against their circumstances, family rivalries coming to bloodshed, boys courting girls passionately and menacingly. But this time it’s from the fully inhabited perspective of two young women who, in past versions of these tales, would be supporting players, or objects, or victims. That feels quietly revolutionary. And it’s a counterpoint to cable-drama history as “The Sopranos” creeps up on its 20th anniversary in January. Lenù and Lila, as it happens, are growing up not far from the part of the boot where Tony’s people came from. But their terrifying and wondrous Naples is far, far removed from his New Jersey, in ways you can’t measure on a map.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Narcissister Organ Player’ (Partly) Unveils an Artist,"The Brooklyn performance artist Narcissister is known for wearing a mask — and sometimes even two, on the front and back of her head — despite often wearing little else. The combination of nudity and anonymity has a jarring effect. That cognitive dissonance, along with Narcissister’s grab bag of props, prosthetics and costumes, which she layers on as if she were a Russian doll, lends her dance pieces a sinister air. Journalists have generally respected Narcissister’s desire to remain incognito, but her identity isn’t a Banksy-level secret. From watching “Narcissister Organ Player,” a documentary and performance film that she directed herself, for instance, it is easy to glean her real first and last names. At the core of the movie are two paradoxes: How does an artist whose work relies at least partly on self-erasure direct a self-baring autobiography? And how does a performer who deals in the inexplicable go about making a documentary whose purpose, ostensibly, is to explain things? The contradictory goals of the film seem fitting, given the nature of Narcissister’s art, and she reconciles them well. Narcissister, who never appears on camera without a mask, addresses viewers primarily in a singsong voice-over. When showing us photographs of her earlier years, she puts a finger over one of her eyes. The idea that her younger self is visible, but never completely, also speaks to her eclectic heritage as the daughter of an African-American physicist and a Jewish emigrant from Morocco. Narcissister attributes her fixation on biological and sexual imagery — a 2013 profile in The New York Times cited a “reverse striptease” in which she pulled her clothes out of her orifices — to her mother, who suffered heart valve scarring as a result of rheumatic fever. (In one of the performances shown, Narcissister, dressed as a giant heart organ, bursts out of scenery that resembles a giant pair of breasts.) Her mother’s body was always very close to her consciousness, Narcisisster explains; therefore, she puts strives not to put physical limits on her own body. The performance pieces volley between hypnotic and kitschy (there’s footage of her in 2011 on “America’s Got Talent”), and interest in them is a prerequisite for a movie that, by design, pushes the boundaries of T.M.I. (although the home movie footage is quite tender). All the same, Narcissister’s background in stagecraft, movement and rhythm serves her well as a filmmaker: Far from a conventional autobiography, “Narcissister Organ Player” always offers something to catch your eye or ear.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Sally4Ever’ Sends a Black-Hearted Valentine,"There is comedy, and then there is dark comedy, and then there is Julia Davis’s comedy. The British actress creates and stars in series in which people are either predator or prey. Her shows are essentially social-comedy horror stories, and Davis likes to play the monsters: emotional parasites who worm into other people’s lives and devour them from the inside out. In the laceratingly funny “Nighty Night,” she played a beautician seeking a replacement for her cancer-stricken husband while he was still alive. In “Hunderby,” a Gothic melodrama parody, she was a housekeeper out to undermine the marriage of the minister she worked for. In “Camping” — whose American adaptation is now on HBO — she was the libidinous outsider who upended an outdoorsy group vacation. It’s not pretty, but in Davisworld, that’s life. It’s awful, in the best way. In “Sally4Ever,” a British coproduction beginning Sunday on HBO (and paired with “Camping”), Davis does not have the title role. That unfortunate is Sally (Catherine Shepherd) a marketing executive living a life of quiet dissatisfaction with David (Alex Macqueen), her boyfriend of 10 years and a simpering milquetoast, heavy on the milque. Sally’s life is like a picture-dictionary definition of “settling.” She sleepwalks through her days at her stultifying office, busy with a campaign to “put the sexy back in eggs.” She has dull meals and boring sex with David. She seems quietly horrified by her life, as if she’s just resigned herself to get from here to the grave with a minimum of fuss. Yet she agrees to marry David, whom she’s put off for years, after a wretched proposal in which he breaks down in tears. “I’m so ill, please!” he wails. “You’re not getting any younger! You’re not going to meet anyone else!” There he’s wrong. She meets and falls madly — well, in lust, at least — with Emma (Davis), a magnetic singer and would-be actress. Sally has the best sex of her life (possibly the only good sex of her life) in a scene, directed by Davis, that intercuts their anatomically thorough lovemaking with images of David vigorously flossing his teeth. (All of it is scored, perfectly, to the ’80s power ballad “China in Your Hand,” by T’Pau.) “Sally4Ever” is not a comedy you’ll want to watch for a nuanced, empathetic drawing of its characters. Everyone around Sally is a grotesque: her co-workers, her parents and David, who’s less a person than a collection of warning signs. Emma quickly progresses from sexy and exciting to smothering, selfish and scheming — the sort of walking appetite that Davis has made an art form of portraying. The exception is Sally, who’s as close to a rounded person as exists in Davis’s brand of comedy. In some ways, she’s a passive doormat, whom Emma is able to prod into asking David to sign over his house to them over an epically uncomfortable dinner. (“Just to ask you, really, if it’s O.K. we have it,” she finally blurts out.) But she’s not stupid. It starts to dawn on her what bad news Emma is. (For instance, when Emma brazenly flirts with a married director, in front of Sally, to entice him to cast her in his next movie.) Bad news, however, is sometimes better than no news. Shepherd’s measured performance makes an absurd situation understandable; Emma is the hot stove that Sally needs to touch to remind herself that she’s alive. The true stars here, though, are the failings of human nature. “Sally4Ever” is the kind of comedy so dark it pushes straight through bleakness to a morality-play clarity: It’s an unflattering, fluorescent light on the manifestations of human self-interest and weakness. This works better than HBO’s translation of “Camping,” which nudges the story toward sympathy for the characters but stalls unsatisfyingly in between. It can be a lot to take, though, and even after three episodes (of seven altogether), the relentless cynicism can start to feel cruel, or at least repetitive. But it’s impressive how committed Davis is to her character, powered by blinkered confidence and an utter lack of self-awareness. When Sally arrives for their first rendezvous, Emma says she knew that Sally would show up, declaring, with a worldly air, “I’ve just got a fifth sense for these things.” What “Sally4Ever” has a sense for, instinctually, is the comedic power of human shamelessness. There’s no shame in that.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Searching for Ingmar Bergman,’ a Misunderstood Artist","This year marks the centennial of Ingmar Bergman’s birth. The Swedish playwright, theater director and filmmaker, who died in 2007, remains one of the most praised and, to a certain extent, most misunderstood 20th-century artists. The praise stems from his cinematic mastery and treatment of profound themes; the misunderstanding, from the conventional wisdom that because Bergman treated profound themes, his work must be a slog. But Bergman was a gripping storyteller. You could even call him an entertainer. The German director Margarethe Von Trotta makes that clear in the opening of her new documentary, “Searching for Ingmar Bergman,” in which she breaks down the opening scene of Bergman’s 1957 classic “The Seventh Seal.” This picture, she says, both engrossed her as a viewer and made her want to be a filmmaker. Her analysis reveals the formal elements that make the oft-parodied “Seal” so potent. Von Trotta’s search takes her all over Europe, where she interviews collaborators, critics, admirers and members of Bergman’s family, including his son Daniel Bergman (himself a film director). Upending the notion of his father as a snob, he notes that the American prime-time soaps were a key influence on Bergman’s own made-for-television drama “Scenes From a Marriage.” Because Bergman’s auteur status is frequently coded as patriarchal, seeing him and his work though the lens of a female filmmaker is salutary. Many of Von Trotta’s interviewees, including Liv Ullmann, who acted in many Bergman films and had a child with him, wax rhapsodic over Bergman’s way with actresses and female characters. Enthusing over an effect Bergman used in his great 1983 “Fanny and Alexander,” the director Olivier Assayas concludes, “Art defines truth.” Just about every minute of this movie shows how that’s true. video",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘The Good Swimmer’ Stays Out of the Deep End,"One exquisite song in Heidi Rodewald and Donna Di Novelli’s pop requiem, “The Good Swimmer,” repeats a list of rescue maneuvers: The Tired Swimmer Carry, the Saddleback Carry, the Cross Chest Carry, the Head Carry, the Hair Carry, the Fireman’s Carry. Each is a hold a lifeguard can use to save a victim from drowning. But this song cycle, seen in an earlier version in the 2016 Prototype Festival and now playing at BAM Fisher in the Next Wave Festival, is too opaque to pull most of us under. No hair carries required. Several hanging scrims divide the Fisher stage. In front of them sit — and stand — nine musicians, including Ms. Rodewald, the composer and bass player, looking endlessly chic in a trim blue suit. Behind the scrims are a chorus of lifeguards, six men and one woman. About two-thirds of the way through the show, the men in the chorus exchange their swimsuits for dog tags and military khaki. Then a lifeguard chair is lowered. Under Kevin Newbury’s direction, that’s pretty much it in terms of action. Ms. Di Novelli’s lyrics, pointedly abstract and occasionally resonant, are pulled from lifesaving manuals. There is also a recipe for a daiquiri and a report from a sonar expert. Because I’d read the show description a few times, I knew that it was about a lifeguard who couldn’t save her brother, a casualty of Vietnam. I never would have guessed this from the performance. The lifeguards are hidden behind Greg Emetaz’s video design — mostly waves, book covers and ephemera. (Raja Feather Kelly’s choreography is similarly occluded.) The woman in the red one-piece (Sophia Byrd) is easy enough to pick out, but which man played her brother? No idea. The choral voices, too, are often lost in the splendid clamor of the instruments. If you have seen “Passing Strange” or “The Total Bent,” Ms. Rodewald’s collaborations with her sometimes bandmate Stew, you’ll guess that the music she supplies is rich and rousing. The style is symphonic rock or chamber pop — strings, drums, keyboard, woodwinds and more that twine together in a sound that is undulating and lush. David Driver, nimble-voiced, is the lead vocalist. The orchestrations, which have a saxophone sound a note like a foghorn and a drummer trade his brushes for mallets, are cool and clever. (The people in the first two rows were offered ear plugs, but from the middle of the audience it never sounded too loud.) Even while enjoying the music I began to hunger for some sense of character or plot. I felt a little ashamed of this — it seems childish to want to be told a story. But without a story, I couldn’t make the songs connect or accrete. Still it worked on some people. During a song that began “A typeface called Optima” — the font (I guessed, correctly as it turned out) used on the Vietnam War Memorial — I heard someone in an upper row crying quietly. Mostly I felt stranded on the surface, happy to float along, never in any danger of drowning. This information was last updated on Nov. 29, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘The Nutcracker and the Four Realms’ Is Fine and Forgettable,"As with “A Christmas Carol” and the Grinch, every generation gets its own version of “The Nutcracker,” it seems. The latest incarnation of the E.T.A. Hoffmann story is Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston’s “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,” a hokey oddity that glissades along with a few charms and a pleasant score by James Newton Howard heavily incorporating themes from Tchaikovsky’s ballet (though there’s little dancing). Children who are 10 and under may be enchanted by the abundantly whimsical holiday-themed visuals; accompanying adults might chuckle at the movie’s leaden attempt at a girl-empowering message. Anyone squeamish about rodents — even ones that have been rendered sort of cute by CGI — might consider steering clear. On Christmas Eve in Victorian-era London, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), a budding inventor, receives a special, egg-shaped box left for her by her recently deceased mother. With it is a note that reads in part: “Everything you need is inside.” But lo! The key to unlock the egg is nowhere to be found, and thus her journey to discover what lies inside it (and, of course, herself) unfolds. At his annual holiday celebration, Clara’s artisan godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman, with an eye patch) leads her, “Alice in Wonderland”-like, to a new fantastical world — except instead of chasing a white rabbit, Clara chases a gray mouse that possesses the key she seeks. Once there, she meets the unfailingly loyal nutcracker Captain Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight) and the regents of three realms: Snow (Richard E. Grant), Flowers (Eugenio Derbez) and Sweets (Keira Knightley, as the Sugar Plum Fairy). Clara also encounters the eerie, circus-y fourth realm and its leader, Mother Ginger (a typically game Helen Mirren); also, many more mice. Knightley has quite a bit of fun with her role as the sprightly Sugar Plum, adopting a high-pitched, whack-a-doodle characterization that is Reese Witherspoon in “A Wrinkle in Time” meets Helena Bonham Carter in everything. Foy is fine as Clara — a “clever girl” as the movie likes to remind us — though Ashleigh Powell’s script gives the actress some of the film’s corniest moments. The ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who makes a brief appearance during the film and in the closing credits, is the highlight, gracefully unhindered by silly dialogue in two dance sequences. But ultimately, “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” is a family holiday movie that will do well enough for now; it probably won’t linger in your memory long enough to make it until the next inevitable adaptation comes around.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘The Other Side of the Wind’ Is Orson Welles’s Haunted Hall of Mirrors,"Orson Welles once described his final film this way: “‘The Other Side of the Wind’ is divided into two sections. There is the film, which is made by documentary cameramen, which is the story of the last day of the director’s life. And there is the film, which is made by the director, which has just broken down for lack of funds.” That’s a fair summation of what transpires, the kind of elevator pitch you can imagine Welles perfected while he was filming and trying to complete this opus over 15 difficult, often turbulent years in multiple locations on two continents. An opening crawl offers some of the baroque back story. Welles began shooting “The Other Side” in 1970, but for financial, legal and political reasons it remained unfinished when he died in 1985. He was already a god of cinema or a fallen idol (depending on who’s telling the tale) when he started it in Los Angeles with a crew that included the cinematographer Gary Graver, who stuck with Welles throughout. According to Josh Karp’s engaging book “Orson Welles’s Last Movie,” Welles wanted to begin the shoot in Tijuana, Mexico, but instead commenced production in his own house, a fitting liftoff for a film that is a checkered masterwork. “The Other Side” opens with a brief sequence consisting largely of black-and-white still and moving images — an overturned car, a young man on a motorcycle going nowhere, various familiar and less-so figures — while a sober-sounding, offscreen Peter Bogdanovich speaks about a filmmaker named J.J. Hannaford, called Jake. “He died many summers ago,” Bogdanovich says in a voice that sounds like a sigh. He is nominally referring to the leading character, memorably played by the director John Huston, Welles’s old friend. But it’s obvious that Bogdanovich is also speaking about Welles and already blurring the line — between fiction and nonfiction, the director and his protagonist — that will only grow more indistinguishable as the story unfolds. [Read our review of the documentary “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead,” about the making of this film.] As Bogdanovich continues, a shot of Hannaford fades out, supplanted by an image of the young Bogdanovich in a transition that puts one of the themes into visual terms. Welles takes on a lot in “The Other Side” — men, women, the decline of Hollywood, the persistence of vision, and the charms, torments and betrayals of close male friendships. “For years, I personally didn’t want this document shown,” Bogdanovich continues, as a lonely horn wails, “frankly, I didn’t like the way I came off in the piece. But I’m old enough now not to care anymore how my role in Jake’s life is interpreted.” That this seems unlikely is presumably the point. Then again, maybe not; it’s hard to know, exactly, because of the film’s sly ambiguity, which is part of its pleasure, and because Welles did not actually finish it. A handful of others did, including Bogdanovich and the producers Frank Marshall and Filip Jan Rymsza, who relied on memories, script notes and a postproduction team that included the editor Bob Murawski to put Welles’s presumed intentions into commercially acceptable shape. It’s an admirable undertaking, though what relation it bears to the project that Welles carried around in his head — and that he shot and edited for years, massaging it like sculptor’s clay — is a question that only a séance could answer. What we have is something of a seductive tease, a haunted film that at times entrances and delights and at times offends and embarrasses. Its most successful section takes place over a single day that ends in death. Shot in different film formats, it centers on Hannaford, a gruffly appealing macho director based partly on Hemingway. Hannaford, who enters dressed in safari-style clothing that suggests that filmmaking, perhaps life, is an exotic adventure or maybe a blood sport, has recently returned from Europe, where he’s been making a film, also titled “The Other Side of the Wind.” As yet unfinished, this highly stylized movie within a movie is seen in fragments throughout — at a screening for a wary studio executive (Geoffrey Land as a Robert Evans type), at a birthday party for Hannaford and at a run-down drive-in. Dialogue-free and filled with strikingly derelict locations, Hannaford’s film follows a motorcycle guy (Bob Random) who chases — and is pursued — by a woman known as the Actress (Oja Kodar), a regal beauty with enviable posture and a derrière that, to judge from its prominence, Welles cherished. Kodar was his companion in his later years, and shares script credit on this film. Welles apparently wanted the movie within the movie to be a take on, or perhaps parody of, an art film; he intensely disliked Antonioni, for one. It’s unclear, though, if the vividly staged and shot results — with their chases, poses, negative space and sexploitation vibe (we’re a long way from Antonioni) — were supposed to be this silly and emptily decoratively. Welles may have thought Kodar a fascinating screen subject, but here she’s a stilted fetish object. For much of the movie within the movie, she prowls around in diaphanous caftans or little or nothing, only occasionally dropping her mask to reveal something beguiling and human. Beguiling and human describe the rest of “The Other Side,” which is often as visually expressive and narratively engrossing as the faux art film is visually florid yet stultifying. Stuffed with old Welles friends and colleagues — including Mercedes McCambridge, Edmond O’Brien and Paul Stewart — this part of the story takes off with Hannaford on a set where he’s been filming some kind of comical-looking cine-smut with toys and naked women. He then makes his way to a party that is being given by a famous actress (Lilli Palmer in place of Marlene Dietrich), amid a scrum of sycophants, auteurs, cinephiles and whirring cameras. In time, a vision of a film artist worn down by life — or fame or disappointment — emerges, though it would be a mistake to assume that Welles was making a self-portrait. His traces are scattered throughout, inviting you to chase bread crumbs here or there. But nothing is obvious in “The Other Side of the Wind,” including how Welles places people in the frame, his brilliant use of dialogue — which overlaps but also suggests that people are incapable of speaking to one another — or the delicacy with which he directs his actors, his friends and his loves. If there’s a self-portrait, it’s the one reflected in all those beautiful, ragged, immortal faces.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead’ Documents Orson Welles’s Last Film,"Fast, funny and rather too eager to please, the documentary “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead” tells the story of the making and near-unmaking of Orson Welles’s final film, “The Other Side of the Wind.” As a stand-alone, the documentary has obvious attractions, most notably its glimpses of Welles at work and at play amid his eternal hustling for money. But mostly it serves as a warm-up for “The Other Side of the Wind,” which Welles started shooting in 1970 but is just now being released — 33 years after his death. “The Other Side of the Wind” has often served either to burnish Welles’s legendary status or to further establish what dreary minds like to call his unfulfilled promise. By the time he began production on it, he had long ago written himself into history, having triumphed in theater, radio and film. His movie output was relatively modest compared with some of his peers, including those who worked in a Hollywood system and culture that remained hostile to him to the end. But the number of great films with his name on them is estimable, with “Citizen Kane” just the start of a run that includes “Touch of Evil” and “Chimes at Midnight.” Directed by Morgan Neville, “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead” takes its title from a line that Peter Bogdanovich said Welles delivered a few years before he died. Bogdanovich — an admirer turned friend, supplicant and apparent rival — has for decades been among the most ardent keepers of the Wellesian flame. He’s one of the documentary’s more complex participants. He’s also been instrumental in the release of “The Other Side of the Wind.” His prominence here is understandable, although it complicates a movie that can seem less interested in Welles as an artist than in ideas about him (genius, failure, father, god, monster) that formed in the minds of others, among them some who worked on “The Other Side.” [Read our review of “The Other Side of the Wind.”] The story of the making of “The Other Side” has been told before, including by the film historian Joseph McBride, who’s in that movie and the documentary. Like some of the documentary’s other participants, McBride isn’t immediately identified. Perhaps because of the large number of contributors or in an effort to make the film more commercially palatable, Neville uses onscreen identifiers fairly sparingly. This approach works best with the likes of Dennis Hopper, who first pops up unnamed during a bit on New Hollywood. Only later, do you learn that the clip of him is for a scene that Welles shot for “The Other Side,” which is, in part, the story of New and Old Hollywood and of two very different directors who represent each. Neville was inspired by Josh Karp’s engrossing book “Orson Welles’s Last Movie,” which goes into greater detail than Neville can in 98 minutes. Karp also pays closer attention to Welles’s artistic process, which in the documentary can seem little more than pure chaos. Yet one of the most engrossing interludes shows Welles guiding Norman Foster through a scene in “The Other Side.” “Relax your face,” Welles says. “Sad. Empty. Empty. Now say ‘Many happy returns’ so I hardly hear you.” Foster does, and Welles says, “You pronounced it too carefully.” So Foster, who’s playing an alcoholic, repeats the line, this time with a slight, perfect slur. It’s a wonderful peek at Welles at work, though it is soon submerged in the flood of images and voices that are neatly arranged to deliver the same idea over and over again. Basically: Welles was a genius, nobody knew what was going on in “The Other Side” except Welles (maybe!), but, then again, he was a genius. Instead of exploring or deconstructing said genius, Neville seems interested in putting it into tidy boxes. After the scene of Welles directing Foster, Neville cuts to a 1976 headline (“Will Welles Finish His Film?”) for an article by Charles Higham, an antagonistic Welles chronicler whom the director apparently despised. Higham’s article joins a persistent refrain in the documentary that suggests Welles, his radical independence and the very idea of film as art remain contested, confusing terrain. “Was it some sort of endless odyssey, we’ll never know,” one man shrugs. “It was this circus of scattered souls,” says someone else. “He seemed to be doing everything he could to alienate as many people as possible,” says another. Throughout, Neville seems intent on trying to read the man through his films, an approach that Bogdanovich says Welles would have hated. For his part, Welles, whose image flickers throughout — as the beautiful young man he was and as characters like Kane, Othello, Hank Quinlan and Falstaff — remains both elusive and indelibly present.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Velocity’ Has Fast Feet and Some Lingering Irish Dance Clichés,"“What even is Irish dance — is it just, like, ‘Riverdance’?” a smart colleague asked me on Saturday at the New Victory Theater, before a matinee of David Geaney and James Devine’s new family-friendly Irish dance-and-music show, “Velocity.” Irish dance, of course, is much more than “Riverdance.” But in bringing worldwide attention to a previously provincial dance form, that commercially successful extravaganza (which is still around after more than 20 years) became synonymous with Irish dance for many new to the upright, fleet-footed style. It also spawned innumerable spinoffs, supplying formulas with which Irish dancers and choreographers continue to reckon, whether they know it or not. At first, the energetic “Velocity,” more intimate history lesson than sequined spectacular, appears to buck cliché. The small cast — just four dancers — limits the well-worn use of Rockettes-inspired unison; Mr. Geaney, a five-time world Irish dance champion, and Mr. Devine, who is said to hold the world record for fastest feet (38 taps per second), are joined by AnneMarie Keaney and Gabriella Wood. The terrific music, played live onstage, leans toward the traditional, with the notable exceptions of some percussive experimentation (by the ecstatic Moisés Mas García) and the turntable scratching of Jack McMahon. A swift opening duet for Mr. Geaney and Mr. Devine establishes their technical prowess and desire to engage the audience. Within minutes, Saturday’s crowd — largely made up of parents and children — was clapping along to their rhythms. The next few sections offer a cursory overview of Irish dance’s past. Photo and video projections, paired with choreographed skits, touch upon the older, looser Irish style of sean nós dancing; the tradition of traveling dancing masters skilled in performing on small surfaces; the introduction of strict rules into Irish dance competition; and the proliferation of Irish dance in theaters. Historical accuracy seems less important to the creators than crowd-pleasing tricks, like rising up on the tips of the leather footwear known as hard shoes, a relatively modern move. A multimedia show for all ages, earnestly tracing the evolution of Irish dance while toying with tradition, would be welcome. And this seems to be where “Velocity” is heading, until it takes a misguided turn into something like an advertisement for its lead dancers — the two men, that is. Their names and accolades blast across the backdrop like a movie trailer, ushering in a solo for each. (Don’t they know we’re already there to see them?) At one point, Mr. Geaney, center-stage, leads a chorus of digital replicas — of himself — projected onto the screen behind him. There’s no doubting the pair’s excellence as technicians and charm as performers. But this self-celebration rehashes one of the most tired parts of the original “Riverdance” formula: male ego as engine. (Remember Michael Flatley?) In a show that seeks to upend conventions, why not start with that one?",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Rewriting the Old Disability Script,"disability We changed queer literature, and the world, by writing our own stories. With disability, we can do it again. Dr. Griffith is a novelist who has multiple sclerosis. Story creates culture. It teaches us to feel, think and behave in ways generally approved of by those around us. Story conditions us. This conditioning, or bias, is not always visible to us, but it constrains and guides our behavior. Implicit bias can’t be changed until we learn to see the old, embedded story and then find a new and better story to overwrite it. I am a queer, disabled writer who grew up Catholic in the north of England at the fulcrum of two competing stories. In Yorkshire, even more than 400 years after the reign of Henry VIII, Catholics were a small, feared and embattled minority — as a 9-year-old I was spat upon in the street for raising money for a Catholic charity. It was confusing because to me, my family, friends and teachers (mostly nuns), Catholics were Good, the norm. Out on the street, and to our neighbors, Catholics were Bad, other. So I was aware of dueling cultural narratives, and this, perhaps, is what inoculated me against other cultural stories — though only partially. When I was very young — 4 or 5, before I was fully sexual — I knew I was a girl who liked other girls. I didn’t really think about it — it just was, utterly obvious. It seemed perfectly natural to me because no one thought to talk about sexuality to a 4-year-old, and queer people — and their treatment by society — was invisible to me. So I was free to tell my own story: that I was amazing, and that if I fancied girls, then fancying girls must be amazing, too. It wasn’t until I was 9 or 10 that I found out that the dominant story of queerness — as told by family, church, school, neighbors and books like the tortured 1928 lesbian novel “The Well of Loneliness” — was that it was Bad. But by then I also had experience of the cultural story of Catholicism being not entirely true, so it wasn’t too hard to counterprogram anti-lesbian bias with my own, better story. As a result, I did not develop internalized homophobia — or thought I hadn’t. Then, when I was 15, I went with my first girlfriend to a gay club where, for the first time, I saw two men kissing and felt instant and visceral revulsion. I was appalled. This was ridiculous: a homophobic lesbian! I had spent the past 10 years counterprogramming anti-lesbian hate but hadn’t thought to do the same for gay men. I was determined to change that, and I could because I now had access to a countervailing story. I went back to the club night after night for a month until a new story — This is just what some men do; it’s fine — overwrote the old. I write novels, and the fiction I create comes from who and where I am emotionally and physically. My main characters are queer women, and because I’ve never associated being queer with emotional struggle, my characters’ bodies are sites not of difficulty but of delight. The protagonists are queer but the story isn’t about being queer because to me, queerness isn’t interesting; it’s an old story. But disability was different. I did not grow up disabled. I did not develop an awareness of this culture’s bias against, horror at and disdain for physical and intellectual difference. No one explicitly told me that disability was Bad; they didn’t have to. The bias was pervasive and implicit. I did not learn to defend against or counterprogram that ableist story. Instead, I absorbed and internalized it. I learned I had multiple sclerosis 25 years ago. Perhaps because my physical impairments gained on me slowly, it took me years to feel the sting of nondisabled people’s dismissal. It took me years to begin to understand that I had been dismissing my disabled self — years to recognize the ableist narrative I’d absorbed — because I had nothing to contradict it. As a child, I saw no disabled women — queer or otherwise — in real life or on page or screen. When disabled characters finally began to appear in books and on screen, they were caricatures: tragic cripples, angry cripples, helpless cripples, one-dimensional characters whose bodies were portrayed as sources of disgust and despair. These stories were written by nondisabled authors; they reinforced the ableist narrative because that’s all they knew, it’s all they could imagine: How terrible it would be to be disabled! Disability fiction today is in roughly the same place queer fiction was 70 years ago or more. Imagine if all queer fiction today were as depressing as “The Well of Loneliness.” Then imagine that most disability fiction is worse. Actually, you don’t have to imagine. Last year, the writer and disability activist Kenny Fries formulated a test for disability in fiction. It’s based on the Bechdel Test (which asks whether a work of fiction or drama features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man). The Fries Test asks: “Does a work have more than one disabled character? Do the disabled characters have their own narrative purpose other than the education and profit of a nondisabled character? Is the character’s disability not eradicated either by curing or killing?” To pass the Fries Test, a novel’s disabled characters do not have to have names or talk to each other at all — never mind about something other than disability. It is a very low bar. Nonetheless, in late 2017 I put out a call on social media for book-length fiction for adults that might pass the test. After many months, and input from hundreds of readers, I have a list of 55 titles. Of these 55, some are old, some out of print, and a handful not in English. So let’s call it an even 50. This is a shocking result. According to the Stanford Literary Lab, there are about five million novels extant in English. And according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four people in the United States are disabled. For stories that pass the Fries Test — to offer at least a reasonable chance of not being ableist narratives — to proportionally represent the experience and reality of the American population, the number of novels on my list should be 1,250,000. One and a quarter million. And we have 50. Think about all those stories that are missing. Stories that we need to overwrite the corrosive narrative of ableism. Without those stories, the implicit bias will continue and the cycle will renew itself endlessly. We changed queer literature, and the world, with story. We can do it again. We can write those stories in our own voices, our strong, beautiful, ordinary, disabled voices.

2018,Rewriting the Rules (and Attitudes) for College Football Transfers,"MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — As a high school quarterback, Will Grier “fell in love” with Will Muschamp, then the coach at Florida. “He was a player’s coach, is what some people called it,” Grier said recently. Grier spurned other attractive offers — from Auburn, Arkansas and Tennessee — to commit to the Gators, and he enrolled early, in January 2014. He redshirted his first season. Then Muschamp was fired near the end of a 7-5 campaign. Grier persisted, and the next season he beat out Treon Harris for the starting job after the first game of the season. But in October 2015, Florida announced that Grier had tested positive for a banned substance; Grier, who said it had been in an over-the-counter supplement, was suspended for a year. The new Florida coach, Jim McElwain, told Grier that a change of scenery might benefit him. Grier agreed — particularly since the suggestion came from the new head coach. Three years later, Grier seems to have found a happy ending on the banks of the Monongahela River. He transferred to West Virginia, where he is in his second season as starting quarterback. The No. 12 Mountaineers (6-1) are College Football Playoff contenders, with a crucial Big 12 matchup at No. 15 Texas (6-2) on Saturday. And Grier, in his final year of college eligibility, could well be a first-round N.F.L. draft pick next spring. In college football’s highest tier, there are more and more transfers among quarterbacks, who — unlike offensive linemen, wide receivers or cornerbacks — have little opportunity to improve and virtually no hope of showing off their talents if they are not the starter. “People found an element in the system where they can kind of restart their careers,” said Yogi Roth, a Pac-12 Networks analyst and a former quarterbacks coach at Southern California. More than a dozen starting quarterbacks in the five power conferences have transferred. They include the Heisman Trophy contender Kyler Murray at Oklahoma and Joe Burrow, who will lead No. 4 Louisiana State (7-1) against No. 1 Alabama (8-0) on Saturday night. Four teams in the top 10 of the Associated Press poll, and seven of the top 25, are led by quarterbacks who transferred to those teams. In recent years, transfer quarterbacks have won the Heisman (Cam Newton, Baker Mayfield) and the national championship (Jake Coker). They have been No. 1 overall draft picks (Newton and Mayfield) and gone on to win a Super Bowl (Russell Wilson). Some have transferred as graduate students, exploiting a loophole that enables them to play immediately; others have sat out a year — N.C.A.A. rules require it for most football players who have not graduated — and still made productive use of their college careers. Other trends, such as early enrollment and year-round classes, mean that a quarterback can redshirt his first year, graduate in three years and then transfer and play immediately with two more seasons of eligibility. “It’s kind of like a free-agent market at this point,” said Ryan Willis, who transferred from Kansas to Virginia Tech, where he is now the starter. These transferred signal-callers have poked even more holes in the pretense that, for top players, college football is more than just pre-professional training. Grier, 23, is married, with a young daughter. He does not spend much time doing typical college-student activities or exploring Morgantown, he said. When he is not being a husband and father, he is working on football. “I treat this like my job,” he said. “I think it’s preparing me for the next day.” Coaches have largely embraced the trend — not that they have much choice. “I think it’s good when I get the good player,” said L.S.U. Coach Ed Orgeron, whose quarterback came from Ohio State. “When I lose the good player, I don’t like it.” Two rule changes in effect this season are likely to lead to more transfers, particularly at quarterback. Previously, transfers had to request a release from their team and were barred from direct contact with other coaches until they received it, creating a murky system of back-channel communication and uncertainty. Starting Oct. 15, they merely had to notify their team of their intention to transfer, after which their name would be put into a database and other coaches could reach out to them. Another new rule permits players to compete in up to four games and still redshirt that season. Clemson’s Kelly Bryant announced that he would transfer after this season’s fourth game — and after Coach Dabo Swinney announced that the freshman Trevor Lawrence would be the starter. Bryant, a senior, will be able to count 2018 as his redshirt year, even though he played substantial numbers of snaps in the Tigers’ first four games, and to play all of 2019. “This model of amateurism forces kids to take any means necessary to get noticed for the next level, because that’s the only way you can monetize that skill,” said Joel Klatt, a Fox Sports analyst and former college quarterback who outspokenly defended Bryant’s decision. Take Shea Patterson. He was recruited to Mississippi before the 2016 season, but his coach, Hugh Freeze, resigned amid scandal the following year, and the N.C.A.A. imposed sanctions on the Rebels near the end of 2017. “Some things were promised that didn’t happen,” Patterson said. As a result of the sanctions, the N.C.A.A. allowed players to transfer without having to sit out a season. After a visit from Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh in Oxford, Patterson now starts for the No. 5 Wolverines (7-1). Or take Grier. After Muschamp was fired, Grier seemed tied to McElwain, who had not recruited him and who generally uses run-first offenses. Instead, Grier was re-recruited by West Virginia Coach Dana Holgorsen, an offensive guru. Holgorsen and Jake Spavital, the offensive coordinator, have between them coached the future pro quarterbacks Case Keenum, Geno Smith and Johnny Manziel. They run a pass-happy Air Raid-style offense similar to those that produced the current N.F.L. starters Jared Goff, Patrick Mahomes and Mayfield. “I wanted to play in an offense where I could throw the ball a little bit and highlight my skills,” said Grier, who is among the leaders in completion percentage, touchdowns and quarterback rating this season. Transferring can be a touchy subject, because it appears to run counter to football’s ingrained team-first mentality and college athletics’ facade of sport mingled with, and subservient to, education. But more than one quarterback transfer noted that head and assistant coaches move between programs constantly, willingly and unwillingly, and without having to sit out a year. “The fact that coaches can come and go as they please and you get a whole new staff that you weren’t expecting and is trying to go in a different direction — you should have the ability to transfer,” Grier said. McElwain, for instance, was fired before the end of last season, meaning that if Grier had stayed put, he would have had three head coaches at one university. Bailey Hockman was recruited to play at Florida State under Jimbo Fisher, who had tutored Jameis Winston into winning a Heisman and being drafted with the No. 1 overall pick. But last off-season Fisher signed a $75 million contract with Texas A&M, and Hockman elected to transfer to a junior college with reported plans to play at North Carolina State. “Whether it’s college or the N.F.L., you have to make the right decision for yourself,” Patterson said. “Sometimes, you have to be selfish.”",The New York Times
2018,"Rich, Ancient City Is Unearthed in Greece","Archaeologists exploring Tenea, which is thought to have been founded by the Trojans, have discovered tombs, coins and urns, among other items, in and around the site. LONDON — First, the archaeologist and her team uncovered a sarcophagus from a village in southern Greece in 1984. Thirty-four years later, an ancient road in the same village led to a Roman mausoleum. Then, in October, a lost city called Tenea was found. “After I uncovered the sarcophagus, I knew I had to go back for more,” the archaeologist, Elena Korka, said in a telephone interview on Friday. Dr. Korka, the director of the Office for Supervision of Antiquaries and Private Archaeological Collections in Greece’s Ministry of Culture, started the current project in 2013. But excavations in Chiliomodi, the small village where her team found the sarcophagus in the Peloponnese Peninsula south of Athens, did not begin until early September this year. Before the discovery, no evidence of the ancient city of Tenea existed; it was found only in historical texts and myths. “Tenea was built by the Trojans after the end of the Trojan War, according to the myth,” Dr. Korka said. Across an area stretching more than 670 meters, or 733 yards, the team uncovered a dense, organized residential space consisting of marble, stone and clay floors in good condition. Inside, it found architraves, or beams; little columns; a storage space with amphoras (tall jugs); and the tombs of two babies. According to Dr. Korka, the discovery was an indication that this was indeed, a city, as babies were only buried in the residential area and not in graveyards outside the city. The variety of the findings — which included part of a clay pipeline — indicated that the city had been populated for centuries, possibly from late Mycenaean times, and by wealthy residents. Among the other items found was a collection of more than 200 coins that dated from the early Hellenistic years, a historical period that started after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C., and to the Roman Empire. “During the Roman years, Tenea cut coins,” Dr. Korka said, adding, “This shows full independence.” The tombs showed that the area’s population had been a wealthy one. Dr. Korka’s team found a Roman mausoleum outside the city, as well as seven Roman and Hellenistic tombs, all of which had been adorned with ancient urns and gold and silver coins, among other things. The discoveries in the large graveyard and in the residential area are rare, according to Dr. Korka, and indicate that the city had relations with the East and the West. “We found urns that we haven’t seen before,” she said. “They were in touch with the West because of Syracuse,” she noted, referring to an ancient city in Sicily, which the citizens of Tenea had colonized along with the citizens of Corinth, one of the most affluent cities of the Peloponnese. But the tombs in Tenea were even more affluent than the ones in Corinth, Dr. Korka said. She and her team found the graveyard after uncovering an ancient road. They had a vague idea of where to look because of past investigations, local information, and field and drone research, she said. “Every excavation is important, as it brings something new to light,” she said, adding that the team hoped that examining the findings would give them a complete idea of the city and its history. Who knows what else they might discover. “You know,” Dr. Korka said, “there are rumors that even Oedipus was raised there.” Follow Iliana Magra on Twitter: @magraki.",The New York Times
2018,"Richard Prince’s New, Late Style Is One of His Best","Critic’s Pick An exhibition of over 30 new paintings and several other works is among this artist’s most fun to look at, and uncharacteristically generous and self-revealing. Richard Prince is losing his cool — or at least some of it. And that’s a good thing. His new paintings — in a show titled “Richard Prince: High Times,” at Gagosian in Chelsea — radiate an unusual heat. Mr. Prince, after all, is the artist who started photographing existing photographs in the late 1970s, which set the stage for appropriation art and the suave, aloof style of the 1980s Pictures Generation. This show is uncharacteristically generous and self-revealing, with numerous moving parts. All told, it forms a rabbit hole of cross references, a hall of mirrors that irregularly reflect some of the life, times and inner thoughts of an artist given to mixing fact and fiction, one who is a devotee of American rock, an erudite collector of postwar literature and a writer of some distinction. In addition to over 30 paintings, “High Times” includes a large group of Mr. Prince’s 1997-2000 “Hippie Drawings”; a hilariously fictive, fetishized private library; and 16 copies of the catalog for a recent Willem de Kooning retrospective, each Oedipally vandalized and appended onto a Richard Prince artwork. The catalog is virtually an artist’s book, laden with pertinent essays and treats, including three seemingly autobiographical posts from Mr. Prince’s blog, Bird Talk. The initial reaction (mine included) to the paintings has often been “Basquiat meets Dubuffet.” Indeed, they are so distant from the Pictures Generation’s photo-based ethic that they all but join forces with its ’80s adversary, Neo-Expressionist painting. Their flat, dark surfaces are covered with cartoonish, robustly painted figures. Some of these creatures loom; others are tiny, and many flaunt bright colors and bristling masks. Still others are so simply outlined that they might be wearing onesies. Big, mitt-like hands are the norm. These figures conjure jubilant trick-or-treaters, comically armored avatars or rock fans leaving a concert. Mr. Prince has never made anything quite so much fun to look at as the new Princes. They communicate an inclusive camaraderie, and a world that comprises markedly different beings. It’s hard to know exactly if they are with us or against us, which creates some existential frisson. (Some of his earlier efforts could be sexist or classist, as when he focused on biker chicks and demolition derby pickup trucks that seemed to place artist and audience in a position of superiority.) As never before, the paintings reveal Mr. Prince’s chops as a painter and colorist, but the “fun” they provide actually challenges more than entertains. With a little scrutiny, it becomes clear that the artist has not abandoned appropriation or the camera as much as taken them into much messier territory. And now he’s appropriating from himself: Most of the figures in the paintings can be traced to the nearby “Hippie Drawings.” This is a smart move, given the frequency with which he has been sued for using other people’s photographs. The paintings are collages. Every character appears on a separate piece of canvas that has been cut out and glued to the large one. Also, most figures begin as printed (inkjet) “Hippie images” on canvas and are then sometimes — but not always — supplemented with real brush strokes and drawn lines. You may move toward what looks like some lush bit of brushwork, and suddenly see pixels pop into focus. But no worries: Look to other paintings, and you may find the same figure as an original painted-on print, or other copies of it, but in a different size. Sometimes you’ll see large and small versions of the same figure in one painting. You’ll never get to the bottom of the alluring confusion of photography, rephotography and hands-on painting and drawing here. But you may come away appreciating Mr. Prince’s provocative fusion of the twain of the Pictures Generation and Neo-Expressionism. And he affirms two of the Pictures Generation’s founding principles: Photographs lie, and a copy is as good as an original. At 69, Mr. Prince is beginning what must be called his late work. A gallery handout that he may or may not have written traces the development of the “High Times” paintings, stating that as a young artist, Mr. Prince put aside some drawings of heads when he came to New York because “they were the real thing, and he didn’t want the real thing.” Now, apparently, a greater realness appeals, and he’s even glued his old drawings of heads into the de Kooning catalogs. Richard Prince: High Times Through Dec. 15 at the Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 212-741-1717, gagosian.com. An earlier version of this review misstated the number of works in this show. There are 33 works, not over 50.",The New York Times
2018,"Rick Scott Claims Rampant Fraud in Florida, as Senate and Governor Races Tighten","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Looming recounts in top Florida election contests, including the bitterly fought races for Senate and governor, erupted late Thursday into a fiery feud as Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee for Senate who claimed victory on Tuesday, sued local elections officials in two of the state’s largest counties and accused them of “rampant fraud.” Standing on the steps of the Governor’s Mansion, Mr. Scott announced on Thursday night that his Senate campaign had sued the Democratic elections supervisors of Broward and Palm Beach Counties. He then asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which he helps oversee as governor, to investigate them. “The people of Florida deserve fairness and transparency, and the supervisors are failing to give it to us,” Mr. Scott said. “Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties.” “We’ve all seen the incompetence and irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years,” he added, “but here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.” The lawsuits escalated tensions in the nasty and historically close political fight that has engulfed the leaders of the nation’s largest presidential battleground state in the 48 hours since the polls closed on Tuesday. The turmoil threatens to stretch out over weeks as recounts take place and, inevitably, more legal challenges wind up in court. Mr. Scott celebrated his apparent win on Tuesday against Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent. But the vote gap between them has only narrowed since, as the state’s largest counties have continued to tally ballots that were mailed in or cast on a provisional basis on Election Day. Mr. Scott questioned why Broward County in particular continued to increase its vote totals over two days, suggesting the origin of the ballots being tallied was suspicious. The local elections supervisor has said mail-in and provisional ballots were being counted as quickly as possible. The gap has also closed in the governor’s race, which is now in recount territory as well. Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, conceded to Ron DeSantis, a Republican, late Tuesday night, shortly before The Associated Press called the race for Mr. DeSantis. But Mr. DeSantis’s victory margin has since shrunk to 0.44 percentage points — six-hundredths of a point below the recount threshold. Mr. DeSantis leads by more than 36,000 votes. Florida’s 67 counties have until noon on Saturday to submit their unofficial vote totals to the state’s Division of Elections. Four more contests — for state agriculture commissioner, one State Senate seat and two State House seats — are also likely to be headed for recounts. The lead in the agriculture commissioner race flipped on Thursday afternoon: Nikki Fried, a Democrat, moved ahead of Matt Caldwell, a Republican, by 2,884 votes. The highest-profile recount possibility so far, however, is in the United States Senate race. As of Thursday night, 15,127 votes separated Mr. Scott and Mr. Nelson, a difference of 0.18 percentage points. Under Florida law, a margin smaller than 0.5 points prompts a machine recount, and a margin of 0.25 points or less requires a more thorough manual recount. “From where I sit, it is a virtual certainty,” said Marc Elias, Mr. Nelson’s elections lawyer and a veteran of prominent recounts around the country. “I think that it is fair to say right now that the results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown.” Mr. Elias went even further, predicting that outstanding ballots would ultimately put Mr. Nelson over the top, though that possibility continued to seem unlikely. “At the end of this process, we believe Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner,” Mr. Elias said. Mr. Scott’s campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to court records, asked for emergency hearings to force Brenda C. Snipes, the elections supervisor of Broward County, to publicly release vote totals, and to require Susan Bucher, the elections supervisor of Palm Beach County, to allow campaign representatives to witness the review of potentially defective ballots. Dr. Snipes, who like Ms. Bucher is an elected official, had told reporters on Thursday afternoon that she could not say how many votes were left to count. “I think we had over 58 percent of our voters voted, and each voter received a ballot package of either five or six pages,” she said when asked about why counting was taking so long. “It’s volume that causes this.” Her performance is of particular concern to Republicans because a court ruled in May that her office had illegally destroyed some ballots from a 2016 congressional race. As a result, the office has been under state monitoring. Broward and Palm Beach, the state’s second- and third-largest counties, both lean heavily Democratic and have a history of slow ballot counting. Miami-Dade, the state’s largest county, counted faster than Broward and Palm Beach, in part because its officials worked through the night after Election Day. Mr. Nelson’s campaign criticized Mr. Scott’s legal action as unnecessary. “The goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately,” Dan McLaughlin, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “Rick Scott’s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.” Results from Broward so far indicate that nearly 25,000 people cast votes for governor but not for senator, even though the Senate race came first on the ballot. Enthusiasm for Mr. Gillum’s candidacy may account for some of the difference, since he excited many voters who cared chiefly about electing him. But some Democrats believe that the design of the Broward ballot used in the county played a role: The Senate contest appeared in the bottom left-hand corner of the first page, beneath the instructions to voters, where it may have been easily overlooked. Mr. Elias said the difference between the votes for senator and governor in the county was significant, but he refrained from criticizing the ballot layout, at least for now. Once counties report their unofficial totals to the state on Saturday, Secretary of State Ken Detzner, an appointee of Mr. Scott, will be able to order any of the legally mandated recounts. A statewide machine recount would have to be completed by 3 p.m. on Nov. 15, Mr. Elias said. If that process yields a margin of less than 0.25 percentage points in any federal or state races, then Mr. Detzner would order manual recounts in those races of what are known as undervotes and overvotes; the recounts would have to be completed by Nov. 18. In the Senate race, undervotes are ballots on which optical-scanning machines detected a vote for another race down the ballot, like governor or attorney general, but no selection for Senate. Overvotes are ballots on which scanners detected that the voter had marked more than one choice in the race. Florida voters fill in paper ballots by hand using a pen, and no longer cast the punch-card ballots that produced the infamous “hanging chads” in the 2000 presidential election. Candidates cannot request recounts, but those with fewer votes in a race can refuse them.",The New York Times
2018,Rick Scott Wins Florida Senate Recount as Bill Nelson Concedes,"MIAMI — Gov. Rick Scott became Florida’s next senator on Sunday, a feat delayed by a grueling 12-day recount that arrived at the same inexorable truth that emerged deep into election night: Mr. Scott, a Republican who entered the public arena only eight years ago, has become a formidable political force. After all the vote-tallying, accusation-trading and lawsuit-filing, Mr. Scott’s Democratic opponent, Senator Bill Nelson, accepted defeat once a manual recount showed him still trailing, by 10,033 votes out of more than 8.1 million cast. Mr. Nelson’s concession brought Florida’s turbulent midterm election to its long-awaited close after a statewide recount did nothing to alter the race’s outcome, other than narrow the margin between candidates in the profoundly divided state. “Now the campaign truly is behind us, and that’s where we need to leave it,” Mr. Scott, who attended orientation on Capitol Hill last week, said in a statement on Sunday. “We must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country.” His Senate victory was a relief not only to Mr. Scott but also to national Republican leaders who had feared that their supporters’ morale would plummet if, on the heels of a fairly dismal Election Day for the party, an apparent victory turned into one more loss. President Trump has declared the midterms a great Republican success, but strategists within the party view the cycle as something of a disappointment, after hopes of gaining as many as four Senate seats dissipated with late victories by Democrats in Montana and Arizona. The win in Florida gives Republicans a 52-to-47 margin in the Senate. If the party also retains the Senate seat in Mississippi after a Nov. 27 runoff, it will have a 53-to-47 edge, a two-seat pickup for the 2018 cycle. Much like the infamous recount in Florida in the presidential election of 2000, this year’s recount, a process intended to reaffirm the will of the voters, exposed myriad flaws in the state’s election system, a concern for politicians and campaigns already looking ahead to the next election in 2020. A final certification of Florida’s vote tally is scheduled for Tuesday. For now, Republicans will savor another victory by Mr. Scott, who has mastered the ability to eke out wins. No politician in the state’s recent history has as enviable a record: Mr. Scott is unbeaten in three consecutive statewide contests, two for governor and one for senator. His margin has shrunk with each victory — he beat Alex Sink by 1.2 percentage points in 2010, Charlie Crist by 1 point in 2014, and Mr. Nelson by 0.1 of a point. But this year, for the first time, he obtained a majority of the vote, 50.1 percent. Behind Mr. Scott’s victories lies his vast personal wealth. He and his wife, Ann, put more than $70 million into his first campaign for governor and nearly $13 million into his second; this year, Mr. Scott spent more than $50 million on the Senate race. But as a candidate, Mr. Scott, who is not known for his charisma, did more than just open his checkbook: He campaigned incessantly and stayed relentlessly on message, casting Mr. Nelson as a do-nothing has-been who had to be retired. Mr. Nelson admitted in a concession statement that “things worked out a little differently” than he had hoped. “I by no measure feel defeated, and that’s because I’ve had the privilege of serving the people of Florida and our country for most of my life,” he said. “To all Floridians, whether you voted for me, or for my opponent, or you didn’t vote at all, I ask you to never give up this fight.” He did not mention Mr. Scott by name. Though Mr. Nelson, 76, was a three-term incumbent from Orlando, he had less name recognition than Mr. Scott, 65, a multimillionaire former hospital executive from Naples. Mr. Scott made much of his wealth leading the Columbia/HCA hospital chain, which during his tenure was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud, an issue that forced him out of his job. Mr. Nelson, a centrist who was first elected to the State House in 1972, was not particularly exciting to the increasingly young, progressive Democratic base, and he never quite seemed comfortable seizing the spotlight. With the denouement of Mr. Nelson’s political career comes the end of the era of Democratic moderates who knew how to win in Florida, a state now as polarized as the rest of the country. Even his Republican counterpart in the Senate, Marco Rubio, bid Mr. Nelson farewell with glowing praise. Mr. Rubio backed Mr. Scott, though the men have never been especially close. “No two senators from the same state had a better working relationship than the one Senator Nelson and I had,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement. “I will miss working with him very much.” During the campaign, Mr. Scott carefully distanced himself from Mr. Trump in an election that turned heavily on voters’ dislike for the president’s administration. Over the course of his eight years as governor, he also tempered his Tea Party conservatism somewhat, shifting to support more moderate measures on guns and immigration. But he embraced Mr. Trump’s bombastic style after Election Day, when it came to claiming rampant fraud nobody could prove. Among Florida’s disputed elections was also the governor’s race between Ron DeSantis, a Republican, and Andrew Gillum, a Democrat who conceded on Saturday, two days after a machine recount confirmed that Mr. DeSantis had won. Under Florida law, three statewide races required machine recounts, but only the senator and agriculture commissioner races were close enough after that to also require a manual recount. Sunday’s results in the agriculture commissioner contest showed Nikki Fried, a Democrat, ahead of Matt Caldwell, a Republican, by 6,753 votes, or 0.08 of a percentage point. In a statement, Ms. Fried, who would be the only Democrat elected to statewide office in Florida this year, thanked Mr. Caldwell, who has yet to concede. “It’s now time for us to come together and work in union to govern for the people of Florida,” said Ms. Fried, who campaigned on making medical marijuana more accessible and tightening procedures to obtain concealed weapons permits. On Sunday, troubled Broward County met the noon deadline for its manual recount tally, after having missed the machine recount deadline on Thursday by two minutes. The relative success prompted a round of applause inside the county elections office. Broward’s machine recount came up more than 2,000 votes short of initial tallies, which left the canvassing board in the position of having to decide which set of results to use. Brenda C. Snipes, the elections supervisor, said the missing ballots were probably misfiled with another stack of ballots. Officials decided to submit the original tally, completed on Nov. 10, in addition to whatever overseas and military ballots had been received since then. Dr. Snipes, a Democrat who has faced calls for her ouster over her handling of the election, submitted her resignation on Sunday, according to The Sun-Sentinel of South Florida, though it was not clear when she might step down. In neighboring Palm Beach County, which has not upgraded its vote-counting machines in 11 years, the elections supervisor, Susan Bucher, acknowledged last week that she would be unable to meet the Sunday deadline for all races. Instead, her office completed the manual recount in the Senate race and, as ordered by a federal judge, spent Sunday reviewing ballots in a State House race in which the candidates were separated by 37 votes. Mike Caruso, the Republican in that race, found himself in the lead by 32 votes after the review, and said he was heading home to pack for Tallahassee, where he expects to be sworn in on Tuesday. Jim Bonfiglio, his Democratic opponent, noted he has 10 days to consider any further legal action. Under state law, Palm Beach County will have to eventually complete the manual recounts in the races for governor and agriculture commissioner, even if the results will come after Tuesday’s certification deadline. Based on how long it took to recount the Senate race — more than five days’ worth of work — Ms. Bucher, a Democrat, said the process could continue well into December. But that work would begin on Monday. On Sunday, Ms. Bucher said: “I’m tired, and I’m going home to sleep.”",The New York Times
2018,"Ricky Jay, Gifted Magician, Actor and Author, Is Dead at 72","Ricky Jay, the master-showman magician, actor, scholar, special effects consultant and author who was called “the most gifted sleight-of-hand artist alive” by writers for the most prestigious publications of his time, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 72. Winston Simone, his manager, confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. Mr. Jay could hit a target with a single playing card at 190 feet and could aim multiple cards at a fresh watermelon, piercing its flesh time after time. But even moviegoers and television viewers who had little interest in magic had opportunities to see Mr. Jay in his 40 or so film and TV roles. They included “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), the James Bond film (starring Pierce Brosnan) in which he played a cyberterrorist, and “Boogie Nights” (1997), in which he was a porn-film camera operator. He also narrated the 1999 anthology film “Magnolia,” whose ensemble cast included Jason Robards, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman. And he played a cardsharp, Eddie Sawyer, on the first season (2004) of HBO’s notably dark Wild West series “Deadwood.” In his first film, David Mamet’s thriller “House of Games” (1987), Mr. Jay portrayed the obviously superior poker player who stuns Joe Mantegna’s cocky character by beating his three aces. “Club flush,” Mr. Jay’s character announces calmly. “You owe me $6,000. Thank you very much. Next case.” He had roles in other Mamet films as well, including “The Spanish Prisoner,” “Redbelt” and “State and Main.” From the beginning of his show-business career, Mr. Jay was a colorful character, with chest-length dark hair in his youth and a bushy matching beard. A large man, he could have been mistaken for a roadie in the years he was opening for rock groups. In later years he cut his hair but kept the beard; eventually, both were tinged with gray. Over the decades he was a regular on talk shows hosted by Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, Dinah Shore, Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Conan O’Brien and on various incarnations of “The Tonight Show,” beginning in the Carson era. He and a business partner, Michael Weber, founded Deceptive Practices, a consulting firm, in the 1990s. Their film-industry projects included a wheelchair that made Gary Sinise’s Vietnam War-veteran character in “Forrest Gump” appear to be a double amputee. A 2012 documentary about Mr. Jay’s life and career was titled “Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay.” As an author of 11 books, Mr. Jay earned enthusiastic reviews. His last book, titled (in part) “Matthias Buchinger: ‘The Greatest German Living’” (2016), was pronounced awe-inspiring by The Los Angeles Times, beguiling by The New York Review of Books and tantalizing by Bookforum. Writing in The New York Times, Charles McGrath described Mr. Jay as the “master of a prose style that qualifies him as perhaps the last of the great 19th-century authors.” Richard Jay Potash was born on June 26, 1946, in Brooklyn, the older of two children of Samuel Potash and Shirley (Katz) Potash and the grandson of Max Katz, a Hungarian-born accountant who was also an accomplished amateur magician. The family soon moved to Elizabeth, N.J. Ricky first performed magic in public at a magicians’ association picnic in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, at the age of 4. At 7, he appeared on a television show called “Time for Pets,” plopping a guinea pig into a top hat and appearing to turn it into a chicken. The sign behind him said “world’s youngest magician.” “It’s safe to say that my parents just didn’t get it or didn’t get me, and we had no rapport,” he recalled in the film documentary and similarly in a 1993 profile in The New Yorker, explaining why he deliberately refused to talk about them or his childhood in any detail. His one warm memory of his mother and father, he said, was their agreeing to hire Al Flosso, a magician who was a hit on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” to perform at his bar mitzvah. And then, thanks to “the audacity of youth,” he said in the documentary, he was gone. “I left home very early and basically never returned,” he said. As a teenager, Mr. Jay ran away to work in Lake George, the upstate New York resort area. He was later booked at the Electric Circus, the East Village hippie-era temple, doing his act between Ike and Tina Turner’s music and Timothy Leary’s lectures on LSD. Eventually he enrolled in five different colleges but by his account never advanced past freshman status at any of them. “Early on, I knew I didn’t want to do the kind of magic other people were doing,” he said in the New Yorker profile. “So I started buying old books” to research the history of the form. He built his fame with what The New Yorker called an “out-of-left-field brand of gonzo-hip comedy magic, a combination of chops and artistic irreverence.” His Off Broadway productions included “Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants,” directed by Mr. Mamet. Mr. Jay’s other books include “Cards as Weapons” (1977), “Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women” (1986) and “Celebrations of Curious Characters” (2011). In 2002 Mr. Jay married Chrisann Verges, an Emmy-winning producer, and she survives him. He was often asked to reveal at least some of the secrets of his magic acts, but he considered that sort of thing grossly counterproductive. “Most people realize that magical powers are not being invoked and that it’s someone who’s created a way to mystify and entertain you,” Mr. Jay told The Times in 2002. “The key to that is surprise. If you’re giving away the method, you’re denying someone the surprise.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated part of the name of the first movie in which Mr. Jay appeared. It is “House of Games,” not “House of Cards.” An earlier version of a headline with this obituary misstated Mr. Jay’s age. He was 72, not 70. The obituary originally said that Mr. Jay was believed to be 70 but that some sources say he was 72; it has been updated to reflect information learned from birth records after it was published. The earlier version also referred incorrectly in part to Mr. Jay’s wife, Chrisann Verges. While she is a producer, she was never a location manager,",The New York Times
2018,Right and Left React to the Midterm Results,"The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you may not have seen. Has this series exposed you to new ideas? Tell us how. Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. The Editorial Board of The Washington Examiner: “We got a normal midterm election, in a year and with a president we were told was anything but normal.” Democrats fell far short of the “blue wave” they had expected, the editors say, and even underperformed historically. Indeed, Republicans lost fewer House seats in this midterm election (28) than Democrats did under President Barack Obama in 2010 (63) and President Bill Clinton in 1994 (54). This wasn’t a rebuke of President Trump, The Examiner argues, so much as a “modest disagreement.” Read more » James P. Pinkerton in The American Conservative: “On Tuesday, the voters showed that they prefer divided government; that is, they simply don’t trust either party to have all the marbles in Washington, D.C.” It’s no surprise that voters put one party in charge of the House and another in charge of the Senate, Mr. Pinkerton writes: Americans don’t like power to be too concentrated, despite the gridlock that can bring. But the results of this election don’t necessarily predict what will happen in the next one. Divided government also gives both President Trump and House Democrats someone to blame the next time they run. Read more » Megan McArdle in The Washington Post: “Partisans seemed focused on the bright side: Democrats happily anticipating their House investigations, Republicans savoring their future judicial appointments. But eventually, these joys are likely to pall in the sight of the opposition’s ongoing victories, and partisans’ attentions will turn to what might have been, if they’d been a little more focused on practical politics and a little less focused on instant, evanescent victories in the culture war.” This election was one of missed opportunities, Ms. McArdle writes. While it’s normal for the president’s party to lose seats in the midterms, Republicans shouldn’t have lost nearly so many given the strength of the economy. They weren’t helped by Mr. Trump’s inflammatory style, which turned off voters and drove many Republican lawmakers to retire. The Democrats, she argues, would have done better if they hadn’t been so insistent that Brett M. Kavanaugh was guilty of sexual assault. Read more » Michael Warren in The Weekly Standard: “There’s little chance Trump will be able to pass much meaningful legislation unless he embraces some more Democratic positions and convinces House Democrats that he won’t sell them down the river ... And that’s assuming it’s even politically palatable for House Democrats to work with Trump, who is toxic to their party’s base.” The situation for Republicans isn’t as rosy as Mr. Trump says it is, Mr. Warren argues. Democrats gained House seats across the country with support from suburban, educated, upper-middle-class voters who opted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Perhaps the G.O.P. can win without them in 2020, Mr. Warren says, “or perhaps the Republican coalition is weaker than Trump or anyone else realizes.” Read more » John Cassidy in The New Yorker: “Tuesday’s elections represented a significant rebuke to Trump. Not a killer blow, to be sure, but one that will have immediate consequences for him and his presidency.” The Democrats had some remarkable wins, Mr. Cassidy writes, pointing to the governor’s races in Kansas and Wisconsin, congressional upsets in Virginia and Illinois and a seven-percentage-point margin in the popular vote. These results show that Republicans need to court women and young people, he argues, if they want to hold on to power well into the future. Read more » Damon Young in The Root: “I just can’t feel the optimism that I’ve been told I should feel about the Democrats winning back the House ... Because what happened in Pittsburgh and in Kentucky and with the mail bombs should have torpedoed the entire Republican Party. It should have crashed Donald Trump’s entire foundation. It should have been a disaster for them, for Americans to be killed so close to an election by men merely following their leader, but it wasn’t.” Mr. Young notes that the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, the wave of mail bombs last month and the killing of two black people at a Kentucky grocery store were all carried out by white men with politics reflective of Mr. Trump’s commentary and policies. If that didn’t lead Americans to at least reconsider voting Republican, “knowing that a red vote is a vote for terror and hate,” he despairs, then maybe nothing would. Read more » Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor in Jacobin: “These are important repudiations of the white supremacy emanating from the White House. It was also a confirmation of the audience that exists for actual left politics, not watered-down centrism.” Progressive victories in the midterms show that the answer to white nationalism is not “middle-of-the-road appeals to civility and good governance,” Ms. Taylor writes, but a “radical political agenda” that inspires voters to show up. She says progressive candidates who lost, like Beto O’Rourke in Texas and Andrew Gillum in Florida, were hampered by voter suppression and outright racism. Read more » Virginia Heffernan in The Los Angeles Times: “Nothing should distract us from the fundamental and urgent work for the Republic: rebuilding a nation founded on shared truth, on facts in common.” The Trump presidency has been characterized by a hostility to truth, or even the idea of agreed-upon facts, Ms. Heffernan writes, with limited ability to push back on behalf of reality. But with a Democratic majority in the House, she says, “lies have some competition now.” Read more » Peter Beinart in The Atlantic: “The harsh truth is this: Racism often works. Cross-racial coalitions for economic justice are the exception in American history. Mobilizing white people to protect their racial dominance is the norm.” While Democrats campaigned on protecting the Affordable Care Act, Republicans used anti-immigration scare tactics to animate their base, Mr. Beinart writes. In this sense, the approach of Mr. Trump and his allies represents politics as usual. (Mr. Beinart’s colleague David Frum makes a similar argument.)

2018,Opinion | Riled Up and Ready to Vote,"Young voters discuss the issues motivating them this year. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Young people historically vote at lower rates, typically, than other age groups, and that has been especially true of the midterms. But this year, registration for younger voters is up substantially, with some studies anticipating the highest youth turnout in decades. We wanted to know what issues are motivating young people at such impressive rates this year, so we asked. In just a few days we had more than 800 passionate, sharp and often surprising responses. The respondents frequently mentioned climate change, no matter their party affiliation, and health care, as well as a fear of the country’s growing political divide. Many who said they were either too naïve or unconcerned to participate in past elections seemed doubly eager to exercise their right this time around. For Lea Klock, 22, of Michigan, her youth had everything to do with her reason for voting. “I am tired of older Americans deciding everything in this country,” she wrote. “A deficit is something that I will have to pay off; climate change will be the problem of my generation; and discrimination will be the ugly legacy that I will have to explain to my children.” I am a registered Republican and voted early in the midterms, but in 2016 I didn’t vote for Donald J. Trump or for Hillary Clinton. And, like just about everyone else, I’m not a huge fan of the current Republicans in Congress. But the actions of the Democrats lately have been, to my mind, damaging to this country’s foundational ideas and values. Neither party is blameless, but to me, the Democrats deserve the bulk of the blame. When elections are called fraudulent, rights established by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights treated as optional and the basic functioning of government routinely interrupted by a heckler, I have to wonder who’s done more to foster distrust in our institutions. The sloganeering tactics Democrats have used in the past few years are identical to those of the radical left-wing students I see on campus every day. I didn’t vote in the 2014 midterms. I was going to college out of state and didn’t care to figure out how to vote absentee. But what is happening now is so deeply illiberal and wrong that I needed to speak, no matter how small my voice might be. As a Parkland resident, I am still plagued by the thoughts and sights that I witnessed on and after the Feb. 14 shooting. As an American Jew, I am horrified and shocked about the anti-Semitic violence at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last month. In St. Louis, where I attend college, I have noticed how deeply gun violence affects the community around my university. Just two blocks away, a single road separates the safety I feel in my dorm room from rampant gun violence in an impoverished neighborhood. Each and every one of my communities — home, synagogue and school — are threatened by lax gun laws. I am fed up with the inaction on climate change. I don’t care if I have to pay more for electricity or if my tax rate goes up. I am fortunate enough that I can handle it and take on some of the burden for those who can’t. I’ll give up some comforts now if that means I will have a future into which I feel comfortable bringing children. It’s going to take money, hard work, sacrifice and pain. But the sooner we start, the better we can control our destiny. Medicaid expansion is on the ballot in Nebraska, which would make life easier for thousands of people in this state. Kara Eastman, the Democratic candidate in Nebraska’s second district, is running for Congress and I love that she doesn’t accept corporate PAC money and that she supports affordable health care and education. I’m fortunate because I can afford my health insurance and I’m pretty healthy, but I know plenty of people who simply can’t make insurance work. If I had to pick one issue that has always motivated me to vote, it would be entitlement reform. As someone with forty working years ahead of me, I don’t want Social Security when I retire. Every year we sink an increasing portion of all federal spending into mandatory entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. This may sound a little Paul Ryan-ish of me, but it’s a real problem and it’s bad that both parties run away from this “third rail” of American politics. Today’s Republican Party has essentially abandoned the principle altogether. The sooner we get young people saving for their own retirements, the better off we’ll all be in the long run. Georgia’s Hope Scholarship is the only reason I am in college and I work hard to keep the grades to maintain it. I would like to see an expansion of the scholarship so that more students have access, as well as more funds. Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s Democratic candidate for governor, wants to expand access to Hope as well as add a need-based funding component to further help underprivileged students. I like that she is standing her ground as a progressive in a state that has been historically conservative. She pushes on even though the odds and the system are stacked against her. To me, that is the perfect representation of what it means to be a Georgian. We need individuals in office that recognize student debt as a top priority. I fear living a life where I cannot climb the economic ladder because of my student loan debt. My parents were able to save and become homeowners but I fear I won’t be able to do the same. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running for re-election in New York, is the best fit for my beliefs. He has said that ignoring climate change is a gross negligence by the government and he has shown interest in rebuilding education in the state and making public college tuition free for many. As the son of a Cuban political exile I cannot sit back and watch the slander and defamation of immigrants continue. The rhetoric coming from the Trump administration is unacceptable. The most recent attacks on immigration — Trump’s proposed executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship and his deployment of troops to the border — have left me shocked. Because I vote in Indiana, I can’t support Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, but just hearing about his candidacy has excited me. He has promised to end the militarization of border control, to resolve DACA by passing a clean DREAM act and to modernize the visa process. These elections are simply a referendum on the Trump agenda. I’m happy with the current job the president is doing. I don’t agree with him on everything — his affinity for tariffs and trade wars, for instance, and his disregard of climate change and some social issues, like restrictions on abortion — but as a recent college graduate, I’m happy with what he’s done for the country’s economic performance, particularly tax cuts. And I’m in agreement about immigration issues. We need a secure border and to end chain migration and the lottery system. I want Trump’s positions on these issues to continue full throttle and I don’t want to see gridlock for the next two years if the Democrats regain power. I’m excited to help re-elect Texas Supreme Court Justices Jeff Brown, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine. The judiciary is my main reason for voting. I find that only those who view the law as it was originally written may call themselves fair judges and justices, all else are but judicial activists. I also want to reinforce our immigration courts and agents so that we may better enforce our laws and limit legal immigration and amnesty. There’s a joke in Alabama that we rank next to last in everything except football. I’d like that to change in my lifetime. I want candidates who espouse fundamental conservative values and have a record of bipartisanship. I’m missing the voices of certain conservatives of integrity and moral courage on the national level, like John McCain, and am now searching for that representation in local races. Lately, it seems every Republican is a “Christian conservative outsider” and their opponents are all “for open borders,” and that tells me nothing about what they will do for my state. I will not support Will Ainsworth for lieutenant governor. He campaigned on being a Christian conservative and then ran some nasty ads against his opponent, Twinkle Cavanaugh, in the primary runoff. That tells me you simply have nothing more intelligent to say. I plan to write in someone else. Defending the free market, promoting a growing economy in Texas, defunding Planned Parenthood — abortion is this country’s biggest black eye — and term limits for Congress are what’s important to me. Limited government and strict interpretation of the Constitution are in the best interest of our country. But this president is not truly conservative. There are some days where I see tax breaks, a growing economy and lowered unemployment rates and think “Hey, things are getting better.” Then the president tweets a porn star and calls her “horse face.” It is challenging to separate some of the conservative policy from the abrasive and offensive language coming from the Oval Office. I’m tired of people who don’t look like me or share my experiences constantly making decisions for me. I’m tired of old, rich white people, predominantly men, speaking for me and deciding what I do with my body and my life. It isn’t fair that they make the decisions but don’t have to live with the effects of those decisions. I will vote for candidates with the overarching values that I support: stricter gun control, reuniting undocumented families and keeping abortion legal. This election is so important because the real power lies with officials in Congress. They’re the ones that pass or block bills. They are what really needs fixing. Our country can and should do better. Gun reform, social services, health care and education are all issues that affect my life and those I love. I exercise my right to vote because it hasn’t always been a right for people who look like me. It allows my voice to be heard and is an opportunity to keep politicians accountable. I’m voting to protect the rights of women, the LGBTQ+, immigrants and refugees. On the state level, there’s an amendment on the ballot in West Virginia that would essentially eliminate abortion access for underprivileged women. This initiative, Amendment 1, would amend the state’s Constitution, cutting off Medicaid funding to women seeking an abortion, and opening the door to completely outlawing abortion in the state should Roe v. Wade be reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. It has disastrous implications for women’s autonomy. Joe Manchin, the incumbent Democratic Senator, hasn’t had much of a spine when it comes to standing up to the president, but I will vote for him because Patrick Morrisey, his conservative Republican challenger, would be even more devastating. I just want to have a say in what happens to my body. I want to know that if I am sexually assaulted again, and I choose to come forward this time, I’ll be treated fairly. The Supreme Court nomination process of Justice Kavanaugh left me panicked. Every single reason I had for not coming forward was validated during those hearings. I want to feel safe walking in my front door and not be worried that my little sister is going to be shot while at school. I want to be able to afford my student loans, and still have a few dollars left over. There have been days that I’ve gone without eating just so I had enough gas to get to work. I’m supporting any and all Democratic candidates. I need to have the tide turn blue so that I can keep living. I believe keeping taxes lower while cutting spending will help the economy grow. Treating drugs as a mental health issue and not a crime is necessary to keep nonviolent offenders from serving long sentences, which leads to broken homes. You can vote for people even if you don’t support 100 percent of their policies. We need more unity and working across the aisle. I’m supporting Kevin Stitt, a Republican, for governor of Oklahoma, and Mark Myles, a Democrat, for attorney general. Myles will stay tough on crime, but he will also be compassionate to those with addictions who need and want help. Stitt will help our economy. His business endeavors speak for him. I think of myself as a moderate caught in the middle. I lean right on fiscal policy, but left on social issues and have supported policies pushed by both major parties. I don’t believe most gun control policies have any logical merit, but I also don’t believe climate change is a myth. Universal health care and improving safety nets for the disenfranchised are fantastic ideas, but I have different feelings about how these things should be accomplished. I’ve voted in every major election since I became eligible in 2008. We get the world we deserve. Not voting, while certainly making a statement, does not move us forward, in most cases. But until a more moderate candidate emerges from either major party, I find it difficult to be inspired by either extreme.

2018,Ringleader of Democratic Rebels Softens Tone on Pelosi,"WASHINGTON — The ringleader of a group of rebellious Democrats pushing to deny Representative Nancy Pelosi the speaker’s gavel in the new Congress appeared to soften his opposition on Monday, calling for negotiations in the clearest signal to date that Ms. Pelosi’s detractors have failed to thwart her steady march to the top post. Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who helped spearhead a letter last week in which 16 Democrats said it was time for Ms. Pelosi to stand aside, said that his effort was “bigger than her,” as Democratic aides aligned with him said that some of the defectors were searching for a deal that would ultimately allow them to vote for her. “Leader Pelosi wants to boil this down to a personal argument, but this is so much bigger than her,” Mr. Moulton said in a statement. “It’s about the entire, stagnant, three-person leadership team and having a serious conversation about promoting leaders who reflect the future of our caucus.” His change in tone reflected the success of Ms. Pelosi’s efforts to grind down her opponents through a mix of deft deal-making and quiet campaigning, which has already prompted public reversals from two Democrats and led a third to suggest he might ultimately vote for her. It was also a stark acknowledgment, two days before Democrats meet behind closed doors to choose their leaders, that nobody in their ranks has been willing to directly challenge Ms. Pelosi, a 78-year-old Californian who has led her party for 15 years. The same is true for the other Democrats who are seeking to keep the No. 2 and No. 3 positions they have held for more than a decade, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 79, of Maryland, and Representative James E. Clyburn, 78, of South Carolina. Mr. Moulton’s call for negotiation with Ms. Pelosi left open the possibility that he and like-minded Democrats who have pushed for new leadership might be willing to back her in exchange for the promise of a fresh face in a lower-ranking leadership position, or a commitment from Ms. Pelosi to step aside in the next year or two to make way for a younger generation. She has called herself a “transitional figure,” a comment some have interpreted as a sign that she does not intend to stay in Congress beyond 2020, although she recently explained that she viewed all leaders as transitional. And such a compromise does not appear to be in the offing, at least not yet. Matt Corridoni, a spokesman for Mr. Moulton, said that Ms. Pelosi had not reached out to Mr. Moulton to discuss the coming leadership elections, and a senior Democratic aide said he had yet to request such a discussion. The apparent weakening of resolve among Ms. Pelosi’s foes came as a separate coalition of nine House Democrats, dismayed by partisan gridlock, threatened to withhold support for Ms. Pelosi unless she backed an overhaul of the rules. The demands of those Democrats, members of a bipartisan coalition calling itself the Problem Solvers Caucus, put another wrinkle in Ms. Pelosi’s effort to win the speakership, a painstaking campaign she has undertaken in the wake of Democrats’ midterm election victories that has involved trying to put down a mini-rebellion among her longtime foes and newcomers demanding change. The preliminary test will be when Democrats meet on Wednesday to cast secret ballots for their leaders. But the ultimate verdict will not come until January, when the new Congress must elect a speaker on the House floor. The threat of a leadership fight has given rank-and-file Democrats a tantalizing opportunity to air their grievances and make demands in the hopes of winning concessions from Ms. Pelosi, who has said she is certain she will have enough votes to reclaim the speaker’s gavel. “For us, our rules proposal isn’t about changing leadership; it’s about changing a system that stymies the will of the common-sense majority,” the group said in a statement on Monday, adding that its proposals would “help spur immediate action on health care, immigration and infrastructure.” The group is essentially asking Ms. Pelosi and the incoming Democratic leadership to fundamentally alter the procedures of the House, where the majority rules absolutely and its leaders have ultimate say on what legislative proposals are considered. It instead supports allowing bipartisan measures to have a chance of being debated and voted upon. Among the group’s proposals is mandating that any bill receiving 290 co-sponsors would go to the House floor for debate and a timely vote, an idea that a senior Democratic aide said Ms. Pelosi had already agreed to include in proposed rules she will present when the new Congress convenes in January. Another would guarantee that any amendment that has at least 20 Democratic and 20 Republican co-sponsors would get a debate and a vote. The third request, aimed at empowering rank-and-file lawmakers, is that each member be allowed to introduce one bill, co-sponsored by a member of the other party, to be debated and considered on a committee on which he or she serves. The effort has infuriated newly empowered liberals, who have accused the Problem Solvers Caucus of being “corporatist” Democrats beholden to the same political donors that Republicans rely on. They question why Democrats are always the ones to cede power when they attain it. The nine Democrats are in addition to the group that signed the letter last week vowing not to support Ms. Pelosi, a coalition initially numbering 17 that has shrunk since its leaders first sought to form it. There are also at least four newly elected Democrats who did not sign the letter, but have said they will keep their campaign pledge not to back Ms. Pelosi. Another new member who said during his campaign that he would not back Ms. Pelosi, Representative-elect Gil Cisneros of California, added his name to the letter on Monday. While she needs only a simple majority to be nominated for speaker this week by the Democratic caucus, Ms. Pelosi must win a majority to be formally elected on the House floor on Jan. 3, meaning she could afford to lose only 15 Democrats if all lawmakers were present and voting and no Republicans supported her. Ms. Pelosi has been working to dispatch with the obstacles in her path, holding a series of conversations in person and over the phone to win support from her detractors. She is scheduled to meet with the Problem Solvers on Tuesday. Last week, she struck a bargain with Representative Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio, who had weighed a run for speaker but endorsed Ms. Pelosi after she was promised she would be the chairwoman of an election protection subcommittee. Representative Brian Higgins of New York changed course and agreed to support Ms. Pelosi after a 72-hour pre-Thanksgiving effort she initiated to win him over. By the end, she had promised that his two top legislative priorities — a bill to allow people over 50 to buy in to Medicare and a $1 trillion infrastructure measure — would be top agenda items in the next Congress. It is the kind of quiet deal-making for which Ms. Pelosi is legendary on Capitol Hill, where such horse trading is behind virtually every major piece of legislation. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Higgins said he, like many lawmakers, recognized that Ms. Pelosi’s predicament gave him a unique opportunity to maximize his influence by making it clear precisely what he would need to throw his support to her. “I think that she’s going to get the votes for this, but understand that for members, it’s all about leverage — it’s all about what you do and when you do it,” Mr. Higgins said. “This is a process whereby you’ve got a vote, which provides you with some leverage, and you have a voice, and the best thing you can do is articulate in a convincing way what it is you want to do and why you want to do it.” And Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts told a local TV station on Sunday that if another Democrat did not step forward to challenge Ms. Pelosi, he would grudgingly vote for her over a Republican, even though he believed doing so would endanger his party’s majority in the next election and risk re-electing President Trump. An earlier version of this article misstated when Representative Nancy Pelosi will propose new rules governing how legislation is considered in Congress. She will propose those rules when the new Congress convenes in January, not on Wednesday, when she will unveil rules for the Democratic caucus.",The New York Times
2018,"Rio de Janeiro Elevator Attendants ‘Adore’ Their Dying, Chatty Trade","Rio de Janeiro Dispatch Roselia da Conceição at work in a 23-story building in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Maria Magdalena Arrellaga for The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO — The elevator attendants are under no illusion: Their days are numbered. Yet the few thousand operators in Rio de Janeiro who have clung on to their jobs well into the 21st century are hoping the forces of automation won’t entirely obliterate their trade, at least for a few more years. “You’re never bored,” said Roselia da Conceição, 53, as she ferried passengers up and down a 23-story building in downtown Rio de Janeiro one morning, commanding her bouncy elevator from a tall stool. “Because you’re always talking and interacting with people, you learn a lot and you create a type of intimacy,” she said. While Rio de Janeiro may be best known for its fantastic beaches and hillside favelas, the city, which was Brazil’s capital until 1960, remains one of the country’s major business centers, and its downtown is crowded with high-rises and corporate headquarters. In 1991, a state law made it mandatory for commercial buildings with five or more stories to employ elevator attendants, which is the main reason the city still has a small army of some 4,000 operators, said Sandro das Neves, one of the leaders of the elevator operator union. Board elevators in all sorts of buildings downtown, and you will be greeted, again and again, by attendants, some immaculately uniformed. It feels as if you are stepping back in time for a few seconds, in a pleasant, yet also bewildering, way. The ride between floors becomes a chance for a brief, but sociable encounter — the sort of small talk that used to happen all the time at the grocery checkout line, the bank and the airline check-in counter before artificial intelligence and touch screens phased out those human interactions (and those jobs). But the trade of elevator operator, which reached its global heyday in the age of telephone operators and has survived in Rio into the dawn of the driverless car era, may finally be fading away in this city. Despite the law protecting the jobs of elevator operators, many lost their jobs in recent years as building managers cut costs during an economic recession that hit this city particularly hard. Then came what will probably turn out to be the fatal blow. This year, a court struck down the 1991 law, siding with state lawyers who argued that the requirement posed unreasonable burdens on building owners. Since then, Mr. das Neves said, the union, which once fought for better working conditions, is now simply devoted to survival. “Our fight is not to raise wages,” he said, noting that elevators operators make about $290 a month. “It’s merely to keep attendants inside elevators.” Manuel Fernandes do Prado, who at 77 is well past retirement age, is in charge of the lift at a building on President Vargas Avenue, the main street that crosses downtown Rio de Janeiro. What does he think of his job? “I adore it!” he said. Mr. Fernandes, who has been in the business for more than 40 years, sometimes works back-to-back shifts in different buildings. He said he enjoyed tracking the lives of regulars as they aged. It’s easy to do when you see people daily, he said, often at predictable hours. He notices when they walk in feeling chipper, when they seem upset, when something is wrong. “Life is good when you work surrounded by people,” Mr. Fernandes said. Addressing a regular passenger, he asked, “Did you ever see me sad?” Ms. da Conceição said the job wasn’t quite as obsolete as it might seem. Many elevators in the city are several decades old and have been repaired using custom-made parts because the models are no longer sold. Keeping them operational requires someone who knows how to handle all the cranks, quirks and funny noises of the aging, fussy machines. And a steady hand when they malfunction, as they often do. “When an elevator breaks down, the only person who can’t panic is the operator,” she said. That speaks to a phenomenon Jacob Carlos Lima, a professor of sociology at the Federal University of São Carlos in São Paulo, has studied in several sectors of Brazil’s economy. While some factory jobs have been eliminated by technological advances, poor infrastructure has spared several occupations, he said. “Automation in Brazil will be limited by deficient infrastructure,” he said. “What good is a driverless car if we’re gridlocked on top of an overpass?” Ms. da Conceição said the job certainly had downsides. Being confined to the small, windowless cube for hours has taken a toll on her figure. “When I started, I was thin,” she said, laughing. “Look at me now: I’m older and voluminous.” But it’s a job she would love to continue doing for at least seven years, when she’ll be eligible to retire. “The profession is going to end,” she said, sighing. “And when you’re over 50, you can’t easily get another job.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Rise of the Armed Left,"Threats from the right inspire a new left-wing gun culture. Opinion Columnist ATLANTA — When I met Oso, a trash collector from rural Georgia in his late 30s, he was wearing dark shades and a black T-shirt with a silhouette of an assault rifle and the words “Piece Now.” A tall and burly white man, he had a sleeve of tattoos on one arm, stubble on his shaved head, and a bushy gray beard. He looked, at first glance, like the sort of intimidating figure who’d fit in at a far-right rally. In fact, you might see him at such a rally — among the counterprotesters. “There shouldn’t be any question in anybody’s mind in this country that fascism is here,” he said. “It’s alive and well and marching us all towards somewhere that we don’t want to be.” That’s part of the reason, he said, that he’s into guns: “I wear a pistol every day because I’m a Jewish person in the South.” It was the Sunday after the terror-filled week that culminated in the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue. Oso was sitting with a handful of other members of the North Georgia branch of the Socialist Rifle Association, a new, swiftly growing left-wing gun group, in the backyard of an Italian restaurant in a gentrifying Atlanta neighborhood. (None of them wanted their last names used; Oso, Spanish for “bear,” is a nickname.) [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The mission of the S.R.A. is “to arm and train the working class for self-defense.” It launched in its current form this spring — before that there was a Facebook group of the same name — and now has several hundred dues-paying members and over 30 chapters. This Monday, 28 new people joined, the group said. Brad, a 36-year-old math professor, is a founder of the S.R.A.’s North Georgia chapter and a member of the S.R.A.’s central committee. “Some people are scared with what’s going on in the country right now,” he told me. He only recently started carrying a gun, after getting death threats for the socialist organizing he was doing in his small town. “People want to be able to protect themselves,” he said. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, parts of the radical left fetishized firearms. Back then, some conservatives supported gun control as a way to disarm African-American militants; Ronald Reagan signed a bill banning open carry of loaded weapons when he was governor of California. “The Black Panthers and other extremists of the 1960s inspired some of the strictest gun control laws in American history,” the U.C.L.A. law professor Adam Winkler wrote in his book, “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” Since then, however, gun culture has become virtually synonymous with American conservatism. The National Rifle Association is now perhaps the most powerful Republican lobby in the country, and its rhetoric increasingly echoes that of the apocalyptic far right. Over the last 20 or 30 years, Winkler told me, “not only has the N.R.A. become more and more associated with the right, but there’s an increasingly militaristic, rebellious tone to the N.R.A. and the gun rights movement.” It’s become, he said, “all about arming up to fight the tyranny that’s coming.” Meanwhile, most of the left has embraced gun control, something that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. But it was probably inevitable that, as our politics have become more polarized and violent, a nascent left-wing gun culture would emerge. “These are some trying times, so I do believe more black men and women are arming up,” Maitreya Ahsekh, chairman of the Houston chapter of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, told me. His group, named after the co-founder of the Black Panther Party, started in 2014. In 2016, members faced off against armed anti-Muslim demonstrators outside a Nation of Islam mosque in South Dallas. (One of the group’s founders was later arrested in an F.B.I. campaign against “black identity extremists.” He was imprisoned for five months before the charges against him were dismissed.) In addition to Ahsekh’s group and the Socialist Rifle Association, there are the gun-toting anti-fascists of Redneck Revolt, an organization founded in Kansas in 2009 that now has chapters all over the country, and the queer and trans gun group Trigger Warning, started last year. Left-wing gun culture has already grown enough to produce defectors; in March The New Republic published an essay titled, “Confessions of a Former Left-Wing Gun Nut.” “Everybody’s afraid. Everybody’s scared. They don’t know what to do,” said Daryle Lamont Jenkins, founder of the One People’s Project, an antifa organization. “They’re looking at this crowd that brags about how they have all the guns and they’re going to start a second civil war and all this nonsense.” Jenkins carried a gun when he went to face off against white-nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Va., last year. He understands why most on the left still support gun restrictions, but said, “The bigger concern for me is not being protected when a threat comes your way.” As a squishy liberal, I generally find the idea of adding more guns to our febrile politics frightening and dangerous. But sometimes a small desperate part of me thinks that if our country is going to be awash in firearms, maybe it behooves the left to learn how to use them. If nothing else, an armed left might once again create a bipartisan impetus for gun control. The members of the S.R.A. I met were more sober and responsible than I might have inferred from the group’s bullet-strewn Twitter feed. Far from being cosplay revolutionaries, they’ve adopted bylaws banning members from advocating violence, and they have strict rules about carrying weapons at protests. As their bylaws say, they don’t want to be seen as a “militia or anti-fascist action group.” Brad said they try to screen the people who are invited to their monthly range days, weeding out those who seem like “adventurers.” “We don’t want the John Wayne of the left showing up to our range,” he said. Indeed, the S.R.A. comes off more like a wholesome civic organization than a revolutionary underground. It recently became a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, and its members spend a lot of time on mutual aid projects like collecting funds and supplies for hurricane relief. Part of the group’s mission is to simply provide a home for people who want to shoot, or to learn about shooting, but who recoil at the right-wing trappings of mainstream gun culture. “This seems to be the antithesis of what happens at most Georgia gun ranges,” said Steve, a 66-year-old paramedic and certified marksmanship instructor who recently joined the S.R.A. “Mine had a Brian Kemp day last Saturday,” he added, referring to Georgia’s right-wing gubernatorial candidate. “I go in there, shoot, and leave.” But even if the S.R.A. is surprisingly nonthreatening up close, much of its growth is still a response to a widespread sense of terror and vulnerability. This week, the group released a video interspersing clips of Donald Trump denouncing “globalists” with images of Nazism, anti-Semitic propaganda and anti-Semitic tweets. It ends with pictures of people firing guns, and the words, “We Keep Us Safe.” In this combustible moment, some have come to feel that no one else will.

2018,"Rob Mathes Show to Feature Appearances by Sting, Vanessa Williams","The Schimmel Center, the 655-seat theater in Lower Manhattan that is operated by Pace University, is known for its diverse programming, not as a venue for rock stars. But Sting is scheduled to make a special appearance there on Dec. 16 as he joins the annual holiday concert by Rob Mathes and his band. Mr. Mathes, a record producer, composer and performer, has been staging his funky holiday-themed concerts for 25 years and is old friends with Sting, with whom he previously collaborated on “The Last Ship,” Sting’s musical about the decline of the shipbuilding industry in northeastern England. The musical ran on Broadway from September 2014 to January 2015 and opens in February in Toronto, with Sting in the cast. Mr. Mathes was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for that show’s orchestrations. Vanessa Williams, the actress and singer, is also set to make a special appearance at Mr. Mathes’s show to perform a few songs in a program of original music and holiday classics. Mr. Mathes is scheduled to bring his holiday show to the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College on Dec. 14 and 15.",The New York Times
2018,Robert Bowers Indicted on 44 Counts After Synagogue Shooting in Pittsburgh,"A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted a man who the authorities say killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue while spewing anti-Semitic slurs on 44 counts, including hate crimes. He could face the death penalty. The indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in western Pennsylvania, charges Robert Bowers, 46, with 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious freedom resulting in death, and 11 counts of using a firearm during a crime of violence. Mr. Bowers pleaded not guilty in federal court on Thursday. The maximum penalty he could receive if convicted is death, or life without parole plus 535 additional years of imprisonment. “Every American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Wednesday. “The defendant in this case allegedly murdered 11 innocent people during religious services and injured four law enforcement officers. These alleged crimes are incomprehensibly evil and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation.” Scott W. Brady, United States attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said in a statement on Wednesday: “Today begins the process of seeking justice for the victims of these hateful acts, and healing for the victims’ families, the Jewish community and our city.” In a rampage that has been described as among the deadliest against the Jewish community in the United States, the suspect — armed with a Colt AR-15 rifle and at least three handguns — stormed into the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday and opened fire indiscriminately, the authorities said. Among the injured were several law enforcement officers. The assailant fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when law enforcement officers met him at the door. According to the police, Mr. Bowers exchanged gunfire with officers before going back inside and barricading himself in a room. He eventually surrendered. Wednesday’s indictment came as many were gathering together for funerals and shivas in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, home to many in Pittsburgh’s Jewish community as well as several synagogues, kosher restaurants and bakeries. Mr. Bowers also faces state charges including 11 counts of criminal homicide and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. In a statement on Tuesday, Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. suggested that he, too, would call for capital punishment but that the state charges would “remain in abeyance” while the federal case proceeds. The federal public defender for the Western District of Pennsylvania did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday evening. Mr. Bowers was a loner living in the Pittsburgh area who spewed murderous hatred and bigotry online. For months online before the shooting, Mr. Bowers unleashed a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Jewish invective and conspiracy theories on Gab, a social media network that has been embraced by white nationalists.",The New York Times
2018,Robert Indiana Estate to Sell Art Valued at Up to $4 Million,"Two major artworks from the collection of the artist Robert Indiana will be offered at auction in New York this month to help pay for his estate’s mounting legal fees and repairs to his former mansion in Maine. The executor of the estate, James W. Brannan, said that, while the probate proceedings over the artist’s will are far from over, he needs money now in light of the house’s leaking roof and the expense of contesting a lawsuit filed in United States District Court in Manhattan against the estate. “Litigation is expensive, especially in New York,” said Mr. Brannan, a lawyer in Rockland, Me. Speaking of New York lawyers, he added jokingly: “If any papers so much as cast a shadow on a desk, they bill for it.” The works by Ed Ruscha and Ellsworth Kelly could together bring in more than $4 million, according to estimates by Christie’s, which is offering them at its morning postwar and contemporary art sale on Nov. 16. The federal lawsuit filed just a day before Mr. Indiana died in May, by his business agent accuses Mr. Indiana’s caretaker and a New York publisher of isolating the artist in his last years so they could sell inauthentic artwork attributed to him. The caretaker and publisher deny the allegations. The estate is a defendant in the case. Mr. Brannan is also responsible for maintaining Mr. Indiana’s home, the Star of Hope, a landmark building on the island of Vinalhaven, which the artist’s will directed be converted into a museum to be run by a foundation. Last week, the nonprofit Maine Preservation listed the building as one of Maine’s “Most Endangered Historic Places.” “We really feel strongly that there needs to be some work done on the property just to secure it, to make sure there is no more water infiltration, to protect what is left of the interior, and stop the ongoing deterioration,” Sarah Hansen, the real estate manager of the preservation group said. Some former friends of the artist, such as Kathleen Rogers, his former publicist, and John Wilmerding, emeritus professor of American art at Princeton University, said they oppose the sale, suggesting that the Indiana legacy was being diminished by off-loading works that were crucial to the artist’s identity. Mr. Indiana’s relationship with Ellsworth Kelly was especially important, they said, as the two were once lovers. They were among a number of artists who lived on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan in the 1950s. The Kelly work, “Orange Blue,” was a gift to Indiana and carries the inscription on the reverse “EK 1957 FOR ROBERT AN ORANGE PEEL FROM PIER 7,” according to Christie’s catalog notes. “It’s tragic because those are major works,” Professor Wilmerding said. “Somehow the estate ought to be kept together. Not just his own works, but the works that he collected or was given.” He said the Ruscha piece, titled “Ruby” is also important to understanding Mr. Indiana because both artists worked in a verbal tradition. The auction house’s catalog information speculates that Mr. Indiana may have been drawn to the work because a woman called Ruby was accused of the murder of his stepgrandmother — an emotional ordeal that may have been a catalyst for his parents’ divorce. Professor Wilmerding said that, while it may be necessary to sell some works, no sale should occur until the members of the board of the foundation, called Star of Hope, have assessed the artistic importance of any works to be sold. Mr. Brannan said he had faced high costs in moving art out of the house and into safe storage. He had sought curatorial advice about which works to sell, he said, though he would not say who he had consulted. He said he wanted to avoid selling any of Mr. Indiana’s own art, which will be the primary focus of the museum to come. Michael Komanecky, chief curator at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, said he also thinks it is more important to keep Mr. Indiana’s own art intact. “By far the most important works of art in the house are by Robert Indiana, both in quality and quantity,” he said. In Maine, an executor has the power to sell assets as he administers the estate and there is no required judicial review. As part of the probate proceedings, Mr. Brannan is trying to clear up questions that have swirled about Mr. Indiana’s finances such as establishing whether any money is owed to the estate by various parties, and getting a comprehensive inventory of the whereabouts of all the artworks Mr. Indiana left behind. Mr. Brannan said his inventory of the pieces contained in Mr. Indiana’s estate had so far accounted for nearly 800 works but was not yet finished.",The New York Times
2018,"Robert Morris, 87, Dies; Founding Minimalist Sculptor With Manifold Passions","Robert Morris, one of the most controversial American sculptors of the post-World War II era as a founder of Minimalism, a style of radical simplification that emerged in the 1960s and influences artists to this day, died on Wednesday in Kingston, N.Y. He was 87. His wife, Lucile Michels Morris, said the cause was pneumonia. Mr. Morris was one of a generation of artists who embraced the Minimalist credo, along with Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and others. But while his peers continued to work within the genre’s austere limits, Mr. Morris went on to explore an astonishing variety of stylistic approaches, from scatter art, performance and earthworks to paintings and sculptures symbolizing nuclear holocaust. His detractors, noting his tendency to borrow ideas from other artists freely, questioned his originality and authenticity. His supporters saw in him a mind too restlessly alive to the possibilities of art to be confined to any one style. But nearly all agree that most of the major issues in art of the last half-century were highlighted in one phase or another of Mr. Morris’s prolific, mercurial career. If Mr. Morris’s work puzzled some viewers, he was reluctant to explain it. In an interview with The New York Times in 2017, he said, “I would rather short-circuit the question and hide behind Chekhov’s remark that art should ask questions rather than give answers.” Robert Eugene Morris was born on Feb. 9, 1931, in Kansas City, Mo., to Lora Pearl (Schrock) Morris and Robert Obed Morris. His father was in the livestock business, and his parents also briefly owned a dry-cleaning business. He first studied art — but not sculpture — at the Kansas City Art Institute and then, in the early 1950s, at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. After a stint in the Army Corps of Engineers, during which he served in Korea, Japan and elsewhere, he attended Reed College in Oregon from 1953 to 1955. Back in San Francisco, Mr. Morris made Abstract Expressionist paintings, which he showed in two solo exhibitions, and became involved in theater, dance and film. In 1956 he married Simone Forti, a dancer who would go on to become a leading choreographer and teacher of modern dance. They moved to New York City in 1959 and became part of a downtown scene made up of avant-garde painters, musicians, dancers and performance artists. There, Mr. Morris’s interests continued to lead in several directions. (His marriage to Ms. Forti ended in divorce, in 1962, as did his second marriage, to Priscilla Johnson.) Mr. Morris began producing sculpture: small neo-Dada works full of witty, self-referential effects, paradoxes and puns, all made under the influence of Marcel Duchamp and Jasper Johns. “I-Box,” for example, had a small door in the shape of a capital letter I, which opened to reveal a full-length photograph of the artist wearing a grin and nothing else. Mr. Morris exhibited these works in his first New York solo show, at the Green Gallery in 1963. He pursued a master’s degree in art history at Hunter College in Manhattan, writing his thesis on the sculpture of Constantin Brancusi. He began teaching at Hunter in 1964 and continued to do so into his later years. Interested in dance as well, he became involved in the Judson Dance Theater, a group committed to Minimalist dance styles. Ms. Forti was a leading member, and Mr. Morris himself choreographed and performed in several Judson productions. In one piece, “Site,” Mr. Morris, wearing a mask depicting his own face, moved sheets of plywood about like a workman and in doing so revealed a nude woman reproducing the reclining pose of Edouard Manet’s “Olympia.” Mr. Morris constructed sets and props for Judson performances as well. One of these, “Column,” a six-foot-tall monolith made of plywood, is considered by some his first Minimalist sculpture. He subsequently constructed a series of simple, medium-large geometric objects of plywood, painted pale gray, as works of pure sculpture. Exhibited at the Green Gallery in 1964, these extremely simple and plain structures — a long beam that lay on the floor, a suspended slab, a triangular form that filled a corner — perplexed and bored many critics. But they put Mr. Morris on the map of the art avant-garde. Why plywood? “Plywood was cheap, plentiful, standard and ubiquitous,” he told The Times in 2017. “It was unstressed as an art material, an ‘ordinary’ material in the industrial world. The tools required to work plywood were common and readily at hand; the skill required to manipulate them was relatively undemanding; carpentry was another ‘ordinary’ everyday skill in the urban late industrial milieu.” In 1966, Mr. Morris joined the Leo Castelli Gallery in Manhattan, where he exhibited his work throughout his career, as well as at the Sonnabend Gallery, also in New York. The importance of his Minimalist work was not just in its introducing a new style of abstraction. Rather, it set up a new kind of relationship between the viewer and the artwork. Because the sculptures lacked the complex internal relationships of traditional composition, the viewer would focus on the object’s relationship to the architecture of the room and its effect on his or her perceptual experience of space, light and shape. This reorientation paved the way for many different kinds of art to come, in which environmental — and, at times, flagrantly theatrical — experience would prevail over that of finely made objects. In 1966, in Artforum magazine, Mr. Morris began to publish a series of essays called “Notes on Sculpture” in which he analyzed the new sculpture that he and others were producing. These influential writings did almost as much to certify his importance as his actual sculpture did. Mr. Morris extended the possibilities of Minimalism and sculpture in general in a dizzying variety of ways from the early 1960s into the ′70s. He produced elementary structures in semitransparent materials like expanded steel mesh or translucent plastic, organized identical forms in serial groups, created optically confounding works using mirrors, built labyrinths, and began to explore less rigidly structured means of activating space, like scattering materials randomly about the gallery. He also created large wall hangings of thick felt — cut, folded or draped — and he produced a major Stonehenge-like outdoor earthwork, “Observatory,” in Holland. One of his most notorious acts was to appear in an exhibition poster in 1974 in which he was photographed naked from the waist up wearing a Nazi helmet, sunglasses and chains, suggestive of some kind of sadomasochistic sexual ritual. Mr. Morris’s reputation as an innovator working on all fronts was at its peak in the early 1970s. In a review in The Times in 1972, Peter Schjeldahl wrote, “Morris was, for a moment, a nearly transcendent art world presence, an artist who, it seemed, could do no wrong.” Later in the decade, however, contemporary art began to change in ways unfavorable to Mr. Morris’s formalist, coolly cerebral sensibility. From the neo-Expressionism of Julian Schnabel to the neo-Pop protest art of Barbara Kruger, art became more representational, more personal and more political, and Mr. Morris’s reputation for up-to-the-minute saliency was never again what it was in the ′60s. He did change with the tide, however, producing in the early 1980s darkly baroque meditations on the threat of nuclear destruction. In a series he titled “Firestorm,” he created heavy sculptural frames in which skulls, clawing hands, ropes, chains, phallic forms and other symbols of violence and conflict were cast; within, infernally glowing pastels evoking J. M. W. Turner abstractly envisioned the world’s fiery end. In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1984, Mr. Morris is survived by a daughter, Laura Morris, and a sister, Donna Caudle. Mr. Morris, who died in Kingston Hospital, lived in Gardiner, N.Y. Into the 1990s Mr. Morris continued to produce draped felt works; heavy lead reliefs that recall his early, Jasper Johns-influenced works; and autobiographical installations using text and sound. In 2017, he presented his latest felt pieces while revisiting his earlier work in a show at the Castelli Gallery’s Upper East Side branch. Since Oct. 30, the gallery has put new Morris works on view in “Banners and Curses,” a show that runs through Jan. 25. From start to finish, as a sprawling retrospective exhibition mounted by the Guggenheim Museum in 1994 showed, Mr. Morris defied the conventional rule of one style per artist. Looking back on his career, he wrote in his introduction to “Continuous Project Altered Daily,” a collection of his essays published in 1993: “I never set out to prove or demonstrate so much as to investigate. And I never set out to affirm so much as to negate.” Yet it is clear, too, that he was driven by an abiding belief in the importance and power of art. “In art’s irrational games and its depth of feelings,” he wrote in a late essay, “in its awe and cynicism, its mournings and derisions, its anger and grace, it bears witness to a dark century.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated part of Mr. Morris’s wife’s name. She is Lucile Michels Morris, not Michaels. Because of an editing error, the earlier version also misstated Mr. Morris’s middle name. It was Eugene, not Clarke.",The New York Times

SCHUMANN The Faces and the Masks By Judith Chernaik Illustrated. 349 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30. It won’t cure your problems, or the world’s, but it can’t hurt to immerse yourself in the music of Robert Schumann, a man who knew how to love. No less an authority than Sting agrees. I know this because Sting once put his hand supportively on my back while I practiced the postlude of Schumann’s song cycle “Dichterliebe,” and I haven’t washed that shirt since. Robert’s life story comes to a harrowing end — I won’t spoil all the grim details, even more tragic than the median Romantic artist’s. Nonetheless, if you take the time to read Judith Chernaik’s new biography, “Schumann: The Faces and the Masks,” your life outlook may improve. Without hitting you over the head, Chernaik allows you to feel the core of Schumann’s story: his love for his wife, Clara, a great concert pianist and formidable muse. Between this and the battle against his own demons to compose truthful music, Schumann’s spirit comes across as an antidote to all the hate and perverse self-love we are forced to swallow in public affairs, day after day. [Read about new biographies of the composers Claude Debussy and Frédéric Chopin that are also featured on the cover of The Times Book Review this Sunday] Depicting love through music may seem all too easy a job, especially for a composer born in 1810, when brilliant Romantics seemed to be bursting from wombs all over Europe. If you find a good love poem, and write a catchy melody, you might well be done in time for dinner. But as in real life, capturing and prolonging love in music is tricky. Sentiment cloys; melodies repeat; before you know it, instead of the complexity of love-as-felt, you get a greeting card. Schumann was not scientific by nature, but in this respect he was a master cultivator. He was able to distill in small bits of music — usually self-enclosed, like emotive petri dishes — these unbelievable concoctions of frustration, beauty, bitterness, burning need and radiant joy. One of Schumann’s great discoveries was the power of an underexploited area of the harmonic universe. Imagine a chord Y that “wants” to resolve to another chord, Z. Because music is cleverly recursive, you can always find a third chord (let’s say X) that wants to go to the first: a chord that wants to go to a chord that wants to go to a chord, or — if you will — a desire for a desire. Schumann placed a spotlight on this nook of musical language, back a couple of levels from the thing ultimately craved, deep into the interior of the way harmonies pull at our hearts. Another musical principle that haunts Schumann’s work, and makes it so ideal for exploration of the kinetic qualities of emotion, is — oddly — syncopation. He’s not after swingy, happy syncopation, the kind you find in ragtime, which lightens a simple tune and makes it feel less foursquare. Schumann’s does quite the opposite: It creates baggage under even his most soaring melodies. He writes pulsating accompaniments, moment after moment determined not to be with the main voice, supplying a kind of constant and urgent in-between-ness, anticipations of the next note or reflections of the last, charging each moment with intensity. But as thrilling as these palpitating accompaniments are — obviously sexual in their throbbing and striving — the most original and profound of Schumann’s syncopations occur when a ghost melody follows the main melody at some distance, an echo blurring the sense of time, making the music seem almost divorced from itself. This sense of being divorced from the self plays a starring role in Chernaik’s biography, as it must. Schumann’s problems at first are humdrum Romantic complaints: His mother wants him to study law; he has to decide whether to follow his musical heart. He contracts syphilis, alas, and worries about it. But when he is 21, almost as soon as he devotes himself to piano study, two names appear in his diary: Florestan and Eusebius, extrovert and introvert, mascots of Schumann’s internal divisions, the “masks” of the book’s subtitle. Chernaik, the author of “The Lyrics of Shelley,” writes that “Florestan and Eusebius were far more than Romantic doubles. They appeared to him, as real as his student friends.” Chernaik gets the incredible essence of this: how he offloaded his difficult emotional world onto an imaginary band of alternative identities, partly for survival, to fight the philistine world on better terms. I wish she had dug a bit further into the way he translated them into music. Florestan’s characteristic gesture, for instance, is a surge: a crescendo with no corresponding diminuendo. (Schumann’s music is full of these instructions, all in a row; if you took them literally, you would end up playing louder and louder until you or the piano fell apart.) Eusebius’ gesture is the circle: a phrase that bends back on itself or oscillates around a mysterious center. The difference is not just contrast. Some of Schumann’s most compelling music holds these two forces in tension — centrifugal and centripetal, reaching and enfolding. He’s therefore able to tap into two veins of tenderness, one overtly adult-sensual, the second magically on both ends of the child-parent bond — young wonder plus aged reverie. In other words, the masks allow Schumann to capture love as a spectrum: He gets more of it than his fellow Romantics, even Chopin, with whom love can sometimes feel like a performance. Chernaik, drawn to this supercharged story and the music, has backed up her affection with solid research. She describes the key family drama with relish: Robert’s initial infatuation with his piano teacher’s daughter Clara, the rage of the father once the romance is discovered, endless separation, legal wrangles and (at last) some reconciliation. (Once he is happily married, the real troubles begin: Schumann’s gifts waging war with the forces tearing him apart.) She narrates plainly, staying far from Schumann’s overeffusive style. It isn’t a gripping book for the person who already knows Schumann’s music and story, but it is perfect for the newcomer, a generous and tremendously useful resource. Schumann’s elusive genius has allowed for a lot of naysayers. In a recent Wall Street Journal review of this same biography, the writer gives credit to Chernaik’s narrative work but can barely find time to praise Schumann’s music. He refers to Schumann’s spirit as “exhausting,” poking fun at his ardor: “Today’s reader might confront such a person and ask him to calm down.” He lists standard concert works but omits almost all the essential ones: the joyous, meltingly beautiful Piano Quartet; the Violin Sonata in A minor; and the surge of early piano pieces, including “Carnaval,” “Kreisleriana,” the “Fantasie” and — for many pianists the holiest of holies — the “Davidsbündlertänze,” a piece that rewards each listening more than the last. Though I don’t understand them, Schumann doubters do have rational objections. Unabashed love and rational skepticism are natural companions, even symbiotic enemies. Schumann understood this as well as anyone. The final song of “Dichterliebe,” for instance, gives voice to the bitter, skeptical breakup phase of a relationship: “I’m done with it all.” The music is ironic, marching, strict, pitch perfect in its adopted pose of detachment. But after the singer goes silent, Schumann uses the pianist for an astounding catharsis. First, a hint of melody, syncopated against a hidden beat, ascending to some unknown goal. Then this melody gathers itself, trying to say something in the absence of words, reaching up once, twice, and a third time reaching the top of the arc of loss (while the singer remains mute, listening to his own sorrow). This phrase arrives without arriving, as life often does; when at last it recedes through various painful notes, you get something like comfort, but with all preceding heartbreak folded in. When you contemplate these great Schumann passages, humble, vulnerable and unflinching in the face of human emotions, it feels heartless to doubt.",The New York Times
2018,"Robyn, Pop’s Reluctant Pacesetter","In the eight years since Robyn released her last full-length album, she put out a few low-profile collaborative EPs, experienced turmoil in her personal life and underwent intensive psychoanalysis. And for the most part, she shunned the spotlight, a not unexpected turn from a performer whose relationship with fame has always been ambivalent at best. Last month, Robyn released “Honey,” which tells a different story than her gleaming “Body Talk” albums in 2010 — by turns patient and contemplative, with a chronological arc that ends with what feels like an earned exuberance. Her return will sate the Robyn faithful. But her influence has been present even when she hasn’t been, as heard in a generation of young dance-floor-oriented pop singers who — sincerely or cravenly — wear their reticence on their sleeve.

2018,Rock-Your-World Moments Fill New Music Memoirs From Tina Turner and a Disillusioned Hit Maker,"Nonfiction MY LOVE STORY By Tina Turner Illustrated. 272 pp. Atria. $28. ANYTHING FOR A HIT An A & R Woman’s Story of Surviving the Music Industry By Dorothy Carvello 240 pp. Chicago Review Press. $26.99. “When is the music industry going to have its #MeToo moment?” That’s a question I’ve seen asked repeatedly, in articles and Facebook groups. My answer: Our moment has been happening for decades, at least since Tina Turner and Ronnie Spector fled their famous spousal collaborators and published eye-opening memoirs documenting the violence they suffered. There has been a steady stream of accounts of assault, harassment and discrimination in recording studios, at record labels and at music magazines; pick up any autobiography of a female musician and you’ll find at least one anecdote that will turn your stomach. R. Kelly, the Runaways, Kesha — stories of abuse long preceded Harvey Weinstein, and continue to trigger news alerts. The real question should be, why haven’t these stories provoked more outrage against a form of oppression that is clearly systemic, along with a push for change? Part of the problem is that people have short memories. That may be why Turner has written a second memoir 32 years after the bombshell revelations of “I, Tina.” Ostensibly, “My Love Story” is occasioned by recent events in the rock ’n’ roll icon’s life: her 2013 marriage to her longtime partner Erwin Bach, and her subsequent health problems, including kidney failure and cancer. But more than a third of this book is about the first 27 years of her life, from the time Anna Mae Bullock was born in a hospital near her hometown, Nutbush, Tenn., through her transformation into the soul dynamo Tina Turner, to the day that she finally had the strength to leave her husband, Ike Turner. [ Will the Grammys Have a #MeToo Moment? ] The gist of the material in this part of “My Love Story” was included in “I, Tina” and has become an intrinsic part of the Tina Turner narrative: A teenage Bullock grabs the microphone at an Ike Turner show in St. Louis; he, eight years older than Anna Mae, recognizes her talent and makes her part of his band; they marry but their relationship is based on economic exploitation, not romance (“What’s Love Got to Do With It” would become one of Tina’s biggest hits as a solo artist and the name of a biopic about her); and he keeps her dependent on him through gross, violent tyranny. This is, of course, an iteration of a classic artistic myth, as old as the Svengali character in George du Maurier’s 1894 novel “Trilby” and as recent as the fourth version of “A Star Is Born.” That Turner’s story is an archetype doesn’t make it any less true, or harrowing. For their wedding reception, according to “Love Story,” Ike took his young bride to a sex show at a Mexican brothel. He blatantly had affairs, often bringing his mistresses on the road with him. And he repeatedly, viciously battered his wife. Unlike “I, Tina,” which was written with the journalist (and former MTV News anchor) Kurt Loder using a sort of Rashomon chorus of voices, “My Love Story” is told entirely from Turner’s point of view with the help of the co-authors Deborah Davis and Dominik Wichmann. Her years with Ike remain the most fascinating part of her story. She also takes advantage of the passage of time to reflect on her relationship with him, trying to understand his motives and her own: “Why, I wonder, didn’t Ike treat me better? That sounds just like one of Ike’s songs, but it was true. He couldn’t have been thinking rationally. If he had been kind to me, if he’d been caring and respectful, I would have wanted to stay.” She realizes that his violence against her was part of his own self-destruction. “Ike was always his own worst enemy. He destroyed anything that was good.” Turner, who has been a committed Buddhist for decades, comes off as neither sensationalistic nor self-serving. “My Love Story” doesn’t carry the literary value that Loder’s historic descriptions provided, but for a famous sex symbol who has turned a tragedy into a fairy tale, Turner is charmingly down to earth. After Tina’s emancipation, “My Love Story” chronicles her success as a solo singer in the 1980s (some of which was covered in “I, Tina”) and career highlights, including her Kennedy Center Honors award in 2005 and the recent play based on her life, “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical.” She also discusses the devastating loss of her son Craig to suicide, describing him as a “troubled soul” but without coming to terms with the effects that her constant absence and violent domestic life with Ike must have had on her children. Mostly the book is about her love affair with Bach, a German record producer 16 years her junior. They built an idyllic life in Europe, replete with French villas, Swiss chalets and an extravagantly romantic wedding. Then, three months after their nuptials, Turner suffered a stroke, the first of a string of serious ailments that almost killed her and that she has kept secret until now. In this second half of her life story, love has everything to do with it: Turner’s first husband beat her ruthlessly; her second husband gave her one of his kidneys. [ What’s the one book Tina Turner wishes someone would write? ] One question goes unanswered in both of Turner’s books. Many people must have known what was happening between Ike and Tina, who frequently had black eyes and visible bruises. Did no one intervene? Why did record labels, promoters and performers tolerate seeing a talent clearly and repeatedly abused? Were they all like the pinball wizard in “Tommy” — the rock opera in which Turner portrayed the Acid Queen — deaf, dumb and blind? “Anything for a Hit: An A&R Woman’s Story of Surviving the Music Industry” goes a long way toward explaining the culture of misogyny that, at best, looked the other way as women were mistreated and, at worst, cultivated abuse. Dorothy Carvello worked for pretty much all the major labels beginning with Atlantic in 1987, and her experiences range from sad to horrific. She got her start as a secretary for the Atlantic co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, an industry legend. It was a seemingly great opportunity that she basically never got over. In Carvello’s telling, Ertegun was a sex fiend and coke addict who tried to grope her on a couple of occasions and at one point fractured her arm. Of course, like any skilled predator, he could also be charming and hilarious. They remained friends until his death in 2006. Carvello is what we English professors like to call an unreliable narrator, and she would be the first to admit it. Over and over she put herself into dysfunctional relationships, trying to be one of the boys. She can be funny in her self-deprecation. Describing the first of many nights Ertegun took her to a strip club, she writes that one of the performers thrust her breasts into Carvello’s face: “What a way to make a living, I thought, and I didn’t mean the stripper.” Carvello doesn’t throw herself a pity party; instead, “Anything for a Hit” is an indictment of a sleazy and corrupt industry. It’s not news that sex and drugs went hand in hand with rock ’n’ roll, but what this book reveals is how damaging the power dynamics of that party atmosphere could be even for a woman who was willing to play along. Carvello names names fearlessly, taking aim at some of the biggest men in the business, showing us where the (naked) bodies are buried. One thing missing from this memoir, which could provide some light in all the darkness and strengthen our trust in the narrator, is music. Carvello never shows any sense of wonder at hearing a great song or discovering a beautiful voice. Her greatest claim to fame as a woman who has spent most of her career scouting talent is bringing the hair metal band Skid Row to Atlantic. O.K., that and her affair with the INXS singer Michael Hutchence. Having good ears is essential to A&R; Carvello’s book convinces me she has good eyes. Ahmet Ertegun is enshrined in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the house he helped build. So is Tina Turner — but only as half of the duo Ike and Tina Turner, not as an artist on her own. Yes, she had to receive this honor alongside the man who assaulted her for years, despite the fact her success far outpaced his. Come to think of it, maybe it is well past time for music’s #MeToo moment.",The New York Times
2018,Rocket Lab’s Modest Launch Is Giant Leap for Small Rocket Business,"The company’s Electron rocket carried a batch of small commercial satellites from a launchpad in New Zealand, a harbinger of a major transformation to the space business. A small rocket from a little-known company lifted off Sunday from the east coast of New Zealand, carrying a clutch of tiny satellites. That modest event — the first commercial launch by a U.S.-New Zealand company known as Rocket Lab — could mark the beginning of a new era in the space business, where countless small rockets pop off from spaceports around the world. This miniaturization of rockets and spacecraft places outer space within reach of a broader swath of the economy. The rocket, called the Electron, is a mere sliver compared to the giant rockets that Elon Musk, of SpaceX, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, of Blue Origin, envisage using to send people into the solar system. It is just 56 feet tall and can carry only 500 pounds into space. But Rocket Lab is aiming for markets closer to home. “We’re FedEx,” said Peter Beck, the New Zealand-born founder and chief executive of Rocket Lab. “We’re a little man that delivers a parcel to your door.” Behind Rocket Lab, a host of start-up companies are also jockeying to provide transportation to space for a growing number of small satellites. The payloads include constellations of telecommunications satellites that would provide the world with ubiquitous internet access. The payload of this mission, which Rocket Lab whimsically named “It’s Business Time,” offered a glimpse of this future: two ship-tracking satellites for Spire Global; a small climate- and environment-monitoring satellite for GeoOptics; a small probe built by high school students in Irvine, Calif., and a demonstration version of a drag sail that would pull defunct satellites out of orbit. Space Angels, a space-business investment firm, is tracking 150 small launch companies. Chad Anderson, Space Angel’s chief executive, said that although the vast majority of these companies will fail, a small group possess the financing and engineering wherewithal to get off the ground. Each company on Mr. Anderson’s list proffers its own twist in business plan or capability: Vector Launch Inc. aims for mass production; Virgin Orbit, a piece of Richard Branson’s business empire, will drop its rockets from the bottom of a 747 at 35,000 feet up; Relativity Space plans to 3-D print almost all pieces of its rockets; Firefly Aerospace will offer a slightly larger rocket in a bet that the small satellites will grow a bit in size and weight; Gilmour Space Technologies is a rare Australian aerospace company; And Astra Space Inc., which is operating in stealth mode like a Silicon Valley start-up, saying nothing about what is doing. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Rockets are shrinking, because satellites are shrinking. In the past, hulking telecommunications satellites hovered 22,000 miles above the Equator in what is known as a geosynchronous orbit, where a satellite continuously remains over the same spot on Earth. Because sending a satellite, there was so expensive, it made sense to pack as much as possible into each one. Advances in technology and computer chips have enabled smaller satellites to perform the same tasks as their predecessors. And constellations of hundreds or thousands of small satellites, orbiting at lower altitudes that are easier to reach, can mimic the capabilities once possible only from a fixed geosynchronous position. “It’s really a shift in the market,” Mr. Beck said. “What once took the size of a car is now the size of a microwave oven, and with exactly the same kind of capabilities.” Some companies already have launched swarms of satellites to make observations of Earth. Next up are the promised space-based internet systems such as OneWeb and SpaceX’s Starlink. Until now, such small spacecraft typically hitched a rocket ride alongside a larger satellite. That trip is cheaper but inconvenient, because the schedule is set by the main customer. If the big satellite is delayed, the smaller ones stay on the ground, too. “You just can’t go to business like that,” Mr. Beck said. The Electron, Mr. Beck said, is capable of lifting more than 60 percent of the spacecraft that headed to orbit last year. By contrast, space analysts wonder how much of a market exists for a behemoth like SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, which had its first spectacular launch in February. A Falcon Heavy can lift a payload 300 times heavier than a Rocket Lab Electron, but it costs $90 million compared to the Electron’s $5 million. Whereas SpaceX’s standard Falcon 9 rocket has no shortage of customers, the Heavy has only announced a half-dozen customers for the years to come. The United States military — a primary customer for large launch vehicles — is also rethinking its spy satellites. The system would be more resilient, some analysts think, if its capabilities were spread among many, smaller satellites. Smaller satellites would be easier and quicker to replace, and an enemy would have a harder time destroying all of them. SpaceX could have cornered this market a decade ago. Its first rocket, the Falcon 1, was designed to lift about 1,500 pounds. But after just two successful launches, SpaceX abandoned it, focusing on the much larger Falcon 9 to serve NASA’s needs to carry cargo and, eventually, astronauts to the International Space Station. Jim Cantrell, one of the first employees of SpaceX, did not understand that decision and left the company. In 2015, he started Vector Launch, Inc., with headquarters in Tucson. Its goal is to make the Model T of rockets — small, cheap, mass-produced. Vector claims that it can send its rockets into orbit from almost any place it can set up its mobile launch platform, which is basically a heavily modified trailer. That trailer was inspired by Mr. Cantrell’s hobby, auto racing, and many of the companies’ employees come from the racing world, too. The company is still aiming to meet its goal of getting the first of its Vector-R rockets to orbit this year, but Mr. Cantrell admitted that the schedule might slip again, into early 2019. The flight termination system — the piece of hardware that disables the rocket if anything goes wrong — is late in arriving. “There are a lot of little things,” Mr. Cantrell said. “It drives you crazy.” A prototype was planned for suborbital launch from Mojave, Calif., in September, but it encountered a glitch and the test was called off. The crew put the rocket in a racecar trailer and drove it to Vector’s testing site at Pinal Airpark, a small airport a half-hour outside of Tucson that is surrounded 350 acres of shrubby desert. Vector built test stands for firings of individual engines as well as completed rocket stages. During a recent visit to the site, engineers were troubleshooting the launch problems of both the prototype rocket and a developmental version of its upper-stage engine. Soon the team will head to the Pacific Spaceport Complex, on Alaska’s Kodiak Island, for its first orbital launch. Next year, Mr. Cantrell said, the company hopes to put a dozen rockets into space. Within a few years, he added, it could be launching 100 times a year, not just from Kodiak but also from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Wallops Island in Virginia, where Rocket Lab agreed in October to build its second launch complex. Vector is also looking for additional launch sites, including one by the Sea of Cortez in Mexico. Tom Markusic, another veteran of SpaceX’s early days, also sees an opportunity to help smaller satellites get to space. “I didn’t feel there was a properly sized launch company to address that market,” he said. Mr. Markusic said that the need for stronger antennas and cameras would ultimately prompt the construction of slightly bigger small satellites, and that it would be beneficial to be able to launch several at a time. He started Firefly in 2014, aiming to build Alpha, a rocket that would lift a 900-pound payload to orbit. The company grew to 150 employees and won a NASA contract. But in the uncertainty surrounding Britain’s exit from the European Union, a European investor backed out. An American investor also became skittish, Mr. Markusic said, after a SpaceX rocket exploded on the launchpad in 2016. Firefly shut down, and the employees lost their jobs. At an auction, a Ukraine-born entrepreneur, Max Polyakov, one of Firefly’s investors, resurrected the company. Mr. Markusic took the opportunity to rethink the Alpha rocket, which is now able to launch more than 2,000 pounds. “Alpha is basically Falcon 1 with some better technology,” he said. Mr. Markusic said his competition was not the smaller rockets of Rocket Lab, Vector or Virgin Orbit but foreign competitors such as a government-subsidized rocket from India and commercial endeavors in China. But he complimented Rocket Lab. “They’re ahead of everyone else,” he said. “I think they deserve a lot of credit.” Firefly plans to launch its first Alpha rocket in December of 2019. Not everyone is convinced that the market for small satellites will be as robust as predicted. “That equation has weaknesses at every step,” said Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm. Three-quarters of venture capital-financed companies fail, she said, and the same will likely happen to the companies aiming to put up the small satellites. She also is skeptical that space-based internet will win against ground-based alternatives. “Publicly, there’s no compelling business plans,” she said. That means that the market for small rockets could implode for lack of business. She said a key to survival would be to tap into the needs of the United States government, especially the military. Virgin Orbit, Vector and Rocket Lab were the current front-runners, she said. The small rocket companies also have to compete with Spaceflight Industries, a Seattle company that resells empty space on larger rockets that is not taken up by the main payload. In addition, Spaceflight is looking to purchasing entire rockets launched by other companies, including Rocket Lab, and selling the payload space to a range of companies heading to a similar orbit. The first such flight, using a SpaceX Falcon 9, is to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base this month carrying 70 satellites, in what the company compares to a bus ride into orbit. Curt Blake, president of Spaceflight, said that both approaches can work. Buses are cheaper but less convenient, and sometimes the timely lift from a taxi is worth the added cost. Mr. Anderson of Space Angels was also optimistic. “The difference today is how robust the sector is,” he said. “The sector today can handle failures.” While the sector is getting off the ground, Rocket Lab doesn’t intend to waste any more time: it is hoping to quickly follow “It’s Business Time” with a second commercial launch next month, and then a third the month after that. “We’re very focused on the next 100 rockets, not the next one rocket.” Mr. Beck said. “It’s one thing to go to orbit. It’s a whole another thing to go to orbit on a regular basis.” _____ Michael Roston contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2018,"Roger Federer Chases 100 Titles, Then Connors","On Tennis It is 99 down, 10 to go for Roger Federer, which is, of course, only one way of looking at things at this late stage in the Federer game. He has chased only a few tennis records with genuine intent, including the men’s mark for Grand Slam singles titles, which Pete Sampras once held with 14 and which Federer now owns with 20. But Jimmy Connors’s Open-era men’s record of 109 titles has hardly been Federer’s white whale, some career-long obsession that has kept him up nights or inspired him to do a round of extra sprints in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with the fitness coach Pierre Paganini. “Either it happens or it doesn’t,” he told Germany’s Tennis Magazin this year, referring to the 109. “If that was really my ultimate goal, I would play a lot more smaller tournaments and in extreme cases, skip all the Masters 1000s and play just 250s and 500s.” Early in his career, Federer already was sounding blasé about tennis math. “There are a lot of numbers,” Federer said in an interview after winning the United States Open in 2005 when presented with some of his already-flashy statistics. But that does not mean Connors’s 109 is not a worthy target. “It just shows you how good Connors was for so long and how much of a great competitor he was,” said Darren Cahill, the ESPN analyst who coached the former men’s No. 1 Andre Agassi and now coaches the women’s No. 1, Simona Halep. “The fact Connors managed to win 109 in that tough era with McEnroe, Borg and Lendl and the competition he had is remarkable. He might have played a lot more smaller tournaments in those days, where a lot of the Europeans didn’t come across to play in the U.S. But I think Connors’s record will stand up against any of the great records in tennis to be honest.” For now, with the ATP Finals about to begin in London on Sunday, Connors’s record is visible on the horizon, but hardly close enough to touch for Federer. Ten more titles is a big task at age 37 with a limited tournament schedule, and there are plenty of other obstacles beyond his direct control. Novak Djokovic is back at No. 1 and continues to have the upper hand as he showed by beating Federer for the fourth straight time by winning a taut, three-set semifinal at the Paris Masters on Saturday. Although the new generation of players has yet to win a major singles title, the youngsters are making inroads elsewhere with Alexander Zverev, 21, and Karen Khachanov, 22, winning Masters 1000 titles in 2018 and with Borna Coric, 21, beating Federer twice. It will only get harder for Federer to reach the finish lines, but he, like Connors, is an exceptional talent with exceptional footwork and staying power, and, for the moment, they have a strikingly similar gap between their first and last tour titles. Connors won his first in 1972 in Jacksonville, Fla., at age 19 and his last in 1989 at 37 in Tel Aviv. Federer won his first in Milan in 2001 at age 19 and his most recent in Basel at 37 at last month’s Swiss Indoors. “For me, if they’re chasing me and my accomplishments then what else could I ask for?” Connors said recently. “Would I like 109 to live forever? Sure, why wouldn’t I? I’d be crazy not to.” At this stage, Federer would be delighted simply to get to 100, which would make him the second man in the 50-year Open era to reach triple figures in singles titles. Three women have done it: Steffi Graf with 107, Chris Evert with 157 and Martina Navratilova with 167. Evert’s and Navratilova’s gargantuan totals are a reflection of just how long they dominated and how many tournaments they played each year in support of their tour. Federer is picking his spots, and if he is going to keep heavily prioritizing the most prestigious events — the Grand Slam tournaments and Masters 1000s — and add only his hometown tournament in Basel and a smattering of lower-level grass-court tournaments on the side, then the odds of reaching 109 lengthen. Federer won seven titles in his dreamy 2017 comeback season. He has won four this year, including the Australian Open, in what has been a less consistently transcendent campaign. To match Connors, Federer would need two more similarly productive seasons if he were to play through 2020: a reasonable assumption with the Olympics in Tokyo that year and the Olympic gold medal in singles the only major tennis prize Federer lacks (he also has a new megadeal with a Japanese sponsor: Uniqlo). “To start with it’s insane what Fed is still doing at 37,” said Brad Gilbert, an ESPN analyst and longtime coach. “To win nine or 10 titles in two years is going to be difficult, but I wouldn’t put it past him if he navigates the schedule and plays a few smaller events. If he stays healthy and plays three more years through 2021 and plays until age 40, then I honestly think he does it. What really helps him is that he’s able to take these long breaks and still play at such a high level. Over all, I would think it’s 50-50.” It has taken Federer longer to hit cruising speed in the second half of 2018, perhaps in part because of a hand injury that he said had affected his forehand during the summer. He went out in a puddle of sweat in the fourth round of the U.S. Open, losing to the unseeded John Millman. Federer made errors in bunches in his semifinal loss to Coric in Shanghai and looked shaky again early in the week in Basel. His most encouraging recent performance was in defeat against Djokovic in Paris, where he saved all 12 break points he faced before losing his way in the decisive third-set tiebreaker. Federer was quick off the mark throughout that duel, unquestionably one of the matches of the year. He was deft at the net and able to consistently produce clean backhand drives despite maintaining his position very tight to the baseline. It will take more of the same to win No. 100 against Djokovic and the rest of the elite eight in London, much more of the same to catch Connors with Federer’s biological clock ticking, ticking.",The New York Times
2018,Roger Stone Sold Himself to Trump’s Campaign as a WikiLeaks Pipeline. Was He?,"WASHINGTON — When the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, appeared on a video link from Europe a month before the 2016 presidential election and vaguely promised to release a flood of purloined documents related to the race, the head of Donald J. Trump’s campaign, Stephen K. Bannon, was interested. He emailed the political operative Roger J. Stone Jr., who had been trying to reach him for days about what Mr. Assange might have in store. “What was that this morning???” Mr. Bannon asked on Oct. 4. “A load every week going forward,” Mr. Stone replied, echoing Mr. Assange’s public vow to publish documents on a weekly basis until the Nov. 8 election. The email exchange, not previously reported, underscores how Mr. Stone presented himself to Trump campaign officials: as a conduit of inside information from WikiLeaks, Russia’s chosen repository for documents hacked from Democratic computers. Mr. Bannon and two other former senior campaign officials have detailed to prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, how Mr. Stone created that impression, according to people familiar with their accounts. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks’ actions, but that he also took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. [Read a breakdown of emails that show how Roger Stone peddled himself to Trump campaign officials as a conduit to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.] But at the same time, the top tier of Mr. Trump’s campaign was deeply skeptical of Mr. Stone, who has made a career of merging fact and fiction and seems to prize attention over credibility. Whether Mr. Stone was, in fact, a trusted intermediary to WikiLeaks — or simply a master of puffery that made him appear so — remains a paramount question for Mr. Mueller’s investigators, who are examining Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential race and whether any Trump associates conspired with Moscow’s effort. To tease out the truth, prosecutors have summoned Mr. Stone’s former employees and longtime political allies to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington or be interviewed at the special counsel’s office. Investigators asked them about a range of issues, including Mr. Stone’s relationship with WikiLeaks, his attempts during the presidential race to raise money for his political causes and whether he tried to persuade one associate not to cooperate with the inquiry. Mr. Stone has repeatedly said that he had access only to Mr. Assange’s public statements and to secondhand information from journalists or other sources. If he implied that he had more direct sources, he has said, he was simply engaging in political hyperbole. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Stone insisted he did nothing more than “posture, bluff, hype,” based on WikiLeaks’ Twitter feed and miscellaneous tips. “I didn’t need any inside knowledge to do that. They keep looking for some direct communication with WikiLeaks that doesn’t exist,” he said of journalists reporting on the Russia investigation. He added that he had paid for two polygraph tests that prove he is telling the truth. But some of his previous statements have proved false. Mr. Stone told The Washington Post this week that he never discussed WikiLeaks with Trump campaign officials. “There are no such communications and if Bannon says there are he would be dissembling,” he said. This article is based on interviews with people familiar with the Russia investigation and the inner workings of the Trump campaign, as well as a review of hundreds of text messages and emails that Mr. Stone exchanged over months with several associates, including Randy Credico, a New York comedian, former radio host and left-wing activist whom Mr. Stone has repeatedly identified as his source about WikiLeaks. Besides the confusion caused by Mr. Stone’s penchant for innuendo and outright lies, investigators are hampered by the fact that Mr. Assange remains out of reach, holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has lived for six years in fear of extradition to face possible criminal charges. Still, Mr. Bannon’s October 2016 email correspondence shows that the perception that Mr. Stone knew what WikiLeaks had in store for Mrs. Clinton spread to the highest levels of the Trump campaign. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump or his advisers alerted the authorities. As the month began, Mr. Stone peppered Twitter with predictions of an October surprise from Mr. Assange, whipping up speculation in the American news media and beyond. Mr. Assange, too, had been hinting at coming bombshells. Unable to reach Mr. Bannon, Mr. Stone communicated with Matthew Boyle, the Washington political editor of the far-right Breitbart News, which Mr. Bannon ran before joining Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Assange — what’s he got?” Mr. Boyle asked Mr. Stone on Oct. 3. “Hope it’s good.” “It is,” Mr. Stone replied. A half-hour later, Mr. Boyle emailed Mr. Bannon, urging him to call Mr. Stone. Mr. Bannon replied, “I’ve got important stuff to worry about.” Mr. Boyle continued to press: “Clearly he knows what Assange has.” A Breitbart spokesman said in a statement, “Matt Boyle acted in his role as a journalist to attempt to uncover the story behind Roger Stone’s public claims.” The next day, after Mr. Assange’s news conference via video link, Mr. Bannon followed up with his email to Mr. Stone. According to one person familiar with Mr. Bannon’s account to prosecutors, the exchange ended with Mr. Stone’s reply, in which he essentially repeated what Mr. Assange or his allies had already said publicly. Three days later, on Oct. 7, Mr. Stone’s prediction of an October surprise came true when WikiLeaks unleashed a trove of emails hacked from the computer of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. The disclosure came just a half-hour after the publication of a recording in which Mr. Trump boasted of grabbing women’s genitals and was an apparent attempt to divert attention from that explosive story, which threatened to derail Mr. Trump’s chances of capturing the White House. The kind of case prosecutors might be trying to build against Mr. Stone is difficult to determine. According to people familiar with the inquiry, they are focused in part on whether Mr. Stone testified truthfully when he told the House Intelligence Committee a year ago that he had no “advance knowledge of the source or actual content of the WikiLeaks disclosures.” Investigators are also examining whether Mr. Stone engaged in witness tampering or obstruction of justice stemming from his dealings with Mr. Credico, the people said. In a statement this week, Mr. Stone again labeled Mr. Credico his source about WikiLeaks. Mr. Stone said Mr. Credico “was emphatic over a 50-day period, insisting that this ‘bombshell’ was coming” from WikiLeaks that would undermine Mrs. Clinton before the election. Mr. Credico has vehemently denied Mr. Stone’s account. Though he interviewed Mr. Assange in August 2016 for a radio show and visited him in London after the election, he has said he never conveyed inside information from WikiLeaks to Mr. Stone. The two men, once friends, have fallen out over the dispute. In one text exchange in May obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Credico told Mr. Stone, “You are an inveterate liar everybody knows that,” to which Mr. Stone replied, “You ain’t exactly George Washington yourself.” Mr. Credico testified before the grand jury in September and has been interviewed in recent weeks by federal investigators. They are reviewing his communications with Mr. Stone, including emails and text messages, in which Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico not to talk to the F.B.I. and to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself before the grand jury, according to people familiar with the inquiry. Investigators have also questioned Bill Samuels, a wealthy progressive activist in New York and a friend of Mr. Credico’s, in what appears to be an attempt to corroborate portions of Mr. Credico’s account, people familiar with the investigation said. Mr. Samuels once accompanied Mr. Credico to a media interview in which Mr. Credico asserted that he was not Mr. Stone’s link to Julian Assange. Mr. Stone said he pressed Mr. Credico only to tell the truth. “I didn’t urge him to plead the Fifth, I didn’t urge him not to testify. He made those decisions on his own,” he said. He added that Mr. Credico was “furious” because he had identified him to the House committee as his WikiLeaks source rather than shielding him. At various points, Mr. Stone has also suggested that he gleaned information about WikiLeaks from Jerome Corsi, a conservative journalist who trades in conspiracy theories. A lawyer for Mr. Corsi, who was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury, did not respond to a message seeking comment. Andrew Miller, another former aide to Mr. Stone, was also ordered to testify and is fighting the subpoena. Mr. Mueller’s investigators have also delved into the operations of Mr. Stone’s political organizations. Mr. Stone has said investigators are examining a nonprofit educational fund called the Committee for American Sovereignty Education Fund, which he said produced a film alleging that former President Bill Clinton fathered an illegitimate child, a favorite theme of Mr. Stone’s. The organization bills itself as a nonprofit social welfare organization that has been designated by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(4) group. But there is no indication in I.R.S. records that it has that status. Mr. Stone’s Oct. 4, 2016, email to Mr. Bannon suggested another reason prosecutors might be interested in the fund. Asking the campaign to promote his theory of an illegitimate son of Mr. Clinton, he wrote: “I’ve raised $150K for the targeted black digital campaign through a C-4,” he wrote. “Tell Rebecca to send us some $$$,” Mr. Stone added, apparently referring to Rebekah Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor close to Mr. Bannon. There is no indication that Mr. Bannon replied to him or sought out Ms. Mercer, and it is unclear whether Mr. Stone’s solicitation, alone, violated federal election laws. Mr. Stone said he was referring to a campaign targeting African-American voters. Several advisers connected with another organization founded by Mr. Stone, the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness, have been questioned before the grand jury in Washington — both about donations to the PAC and how the group’s money was disbursed, according to people familiar with the interviews. The witnesses include Jason Sullivan, whom Mr. Stone hired as a social media specialist during the months before the election. Another is John Kakanis, an aide who carried out tasks for Mr. Stone as varied as driving him around and doing his accounting. Mr. Kakanis is listed as the president of a Florida firm called Citroen Associates, which received $137,000 of the $561,968 that the super PAC spent in the 2016 election cycle. He has spent hours under questioning by prosecutors as the special counsel’s team tries to decipher how Mr. Stone used the donations.",The New York Times
2018,"Roger Stone Sought WikiLeaks’ Plans Amid 2016 Campaign, Associate Says","WASHINGTON — An associate of the former Trump campaign adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. released documents on Tuesday showing that as the presidential campaign heated up in the summer of 2016, Mr. Stone tried to dispatch him to find out what information WikiLeaks had that could prove damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The associate, Jerome Corsi, said in an interview that he might be indicted on a charge of lying to federal investigators because he told them that he refused Mr. Stone’s request when in fact he passed it on to an intermediary. He said he had refused a plea deal offered by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, because he did not intentionally lie, but merely forgot events of more than two years ago. Mr. Corsi’s dealings with Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have caused alarm among the president’s legal team, who were informed of developments by Mr. Corsi’s lawyer. President Trump’s lawyers were especially troubled by a draft statement of offense against Mr. Corsi that was passed on to them, according to people familiar with the situation. In it, prosecutors claimed that Mr. Corsi understood that Mr. Stone was “in regular contact with senior members of the Trump campaign, including with then-candidate Donald J. Trump” when he asked Mr. Corsi in late July 2016 to “get to” Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. The reference to Mr. Trump coincided with other events that so disturbed the president’s lawyers that they delayed turning in his responses to written questions after negotiating over them with the special counsel for nearly a year. At roughly the same time, the Justice Department inadvertently released a secret criminal complaint against Mr. Assange and Mr. Trump’s legal team learned that prosecutors were accusing Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, of lying. Only after Mr. Mueller’s team reassured Mr. Trump’s lawyers that they were not trying to lure the president into a trap did they forward his answers on Nov. 20. A conservative best-selling author, Mr. Corsi, 72, has suddenly emerged as an intriguing figure in the special counsel’s investigation of Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone in the Trump campaign knew about or aided with Moscow’s covert operation. By speaking openly about his dealings with the special counsel, and giving reporters draft documents from prosecutors of a proposed plea deal, a criminal charge and a statement of offense, he has provided new information about the direction of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. He said prosecutors are especially interested in an email he sent to Mr. Stone on Aug. 2, 2016, saying “Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps,” he wrote. “Impact planned to be very damaging.” He said he was referring to Mr. Assange, who has lived in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for years, but that he was merely speculating about what WikiLeaks had planned and had no inside information. He said that prosecutors are wrongly accusing him of lying to them about that message and others when he is guilty of no more than a faulty memory. Asked if he expected to be indicted, he said in an interview Tuesday, “I don’t know.” After he refused to plead guilty to a felony, he said, the prosecutors told him, “We will take it from here.” Ironically, his interactions with prosecutors started out amicably, he said. They were pleased when he testified before a grand jury on Sept. 21 that he helped Mr. Stone devise a false story to explain a message he posted on Twitter on Aug. 21, 2016. Mr. Stone wrote: “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.” Mr. Stone’s prediction seemed remarkably prescient because about six weeks later WikiLeaks began releasing 50,000 emails that Russian agents had stolen from the computer of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. The emails threw the Clinton campaign off stride just as Mr. Trump’s own campaign was imperiled by the release of a recording in which he boasted of grabbing women’s genitals. Mr. Stone, who advised the Trump campaign in 2015 and remained in touch with campaign officials, has insisted that he was referring to business dealings of Mr. Podesta and his brother Tony, not to Mr. Podesta’s emails. Mr. Corsi had publicly backed Mr. Stone’s account, saying that he provided Mr. Stone with research that formed the basis for his Twitter message. But he now says that he and Mr. Stone came up with the explanation of the Podestas’ business dealings to deflect controversy. He said he was given a limited grant of immunity before he testified about the “cover story” for the Twitter message because otherwise he might have been charged with suborning perjury. Among other issues, prosecutors are examining whether Mr. Stone testified truthfully to the House Intelligence Committee a year ago that he had no “advance knowledge of the source or actual content of the WikiLeaks disclosure.” Mr. Stone said on his website that Mr. Corsi was confused about what took place. “Jerry is simply mistaken that what we discussed was a cover. Ask yourself, ‘a cover for what?’” he wrote. “In August 2016, there was no investigation, no special counsel, no congressional committees and no subpoenas, why would a story be necessary?” He was also quoted as saying that while he was curious about information WikiLeaks had in 2016 that could affect the presidential race, so too was “every politico and political reporter in America.” He said that nothing in the newly released documents showed that he had advance knowledge that Mr. Podesta’s emails had been stolen or what WikiLeaks possessed or planned to release.",The New York Times
2018,Rogue ‘M.T.A. Museum’ Celebrates Everything Dingy About the Subway,"Using mock placards, two art students playfully reframed New York’s subway stations as a gallery documenting the city’s anthropological history. Viewed in a certain light — usually fluorescent — many of New York City’s subway stations are aging underground crypts in need of serious renovation. White tiles have faded to a dingy beige; some bear the rust-colored scars left by water damage. Floors are so mottled one might have trouble discerning their original hue. And metal pillars are covered in layers of flaking paint that cannot conceal the corrosion underneath. These are not, traditionally, the qualities associated with an aesthetic masterpiece. But that did not stop two art students from playfully reframing New York’s subway system as an art museum that documents and preserves the city’s anthropological history. As part of a project they are calling the “M.T.A. Museum,” the duo has been placing small cardboard signs similar to museum labels at several subway stops in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The placards’ witty titles and captions cast the subway system’s floors, furniture and metal fixtures as works of art. Well-worn wooden benches were grouped into a collaborative work called “Untitled / Butt Pattern,” with the gentle depressions left by the rear ends of straphangers cheekily called “a political statement on transit and the concept of rest.” The tracks in front of those benches were declared a live installation titled “Of Mice and Men” that captured “the essence” of the daily New York rat race; rodents, insects, trash and urine are listed as key parts of the composition. The two students, who study advertising at an art college, have peppered a few art jokes into their labels as well. Splotches of old chewing gum speckling a dirty concrete floor became “an everyday creative masterpiece” that drew inspiration from the celebrated Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama and her polka dots. That piece, called “Concrete Jungle Dreams of Bubble Gum,” and many of the others appeared to be as ready for the Instagram generation as some of Ms. Kusama’s works are. Posts documenting the labels began surfacing on social media sites last week and have continued to pop up in the days since. (Unlike Ms. Kusama’s exhibitions, photographers didn’t need to wait in lines that stretched around the block.) The two students behind the project, a man and woman who asked to remain anonymous because they did not have approval from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in an interview Monday that they hoped their cards would help change commuters’ perception of structures that have long been called dirty and decrepit. “We’re shining a light on the M.T.A. stops by using them as an art form,” one said. “We wanted to change the negative perception.” The M.T.A. was “flattered by the parody,” Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the agency, said in an email. But he also said the agency would remove “unauthorized postings” at stations. The students, who described themselves as “foreigners,” said that when they first came to the city, they were impressed by the subway and its age. But after hearing complaints about the stations’ conditions, the students wanted to remind people that the subway’s wear and tear stemmed from its history. “As New Yorkers, we should be proud to use one of the oldest and most historical transit systems every day,” one said. The students said they plan to continue posting cards in stations in the coming days. Those who noticed the M.T.A. Museum cards Tuesday morning said they brought some joy to their day. “In a way, the M.T.A. has been a museum of public transport for a long time,” said Mathias Wilk, 36, a photographer who saw the signs displayed at the Bedford Avenue L train stop. “It feels about right that someone finally acknowledged this.” Alex Anez, 22, who stopped to read a sign affixed on the bench seat next to her, agreed. She said she appreciated the reminder to notice her surroundings. “New Yorkers don’t really pay attention to anything going on,” she said. Still, a survey of the stations where cards have been posted suggested that getting commuters to approach these transit points as if they are art galleries might take more work. At the Bedford station, where there were plenty of signs on display, commuters’ eyes were too glued to their phones for anyone to take notice. For about 30 minutes, person after person plopped down on benches without paying any mind to the cards pasted on them. Shortly before Ms. Anez took her seat on the bench, a young couple clad in denim jackets were occupying the same spot. The two chatted for a minute while they waited for their train to arrive. When it did, both of them stood, read the card against which one had been resting, and smiled. “Funny,” one said to the other. Then they hurried to catch their train before the doors slammed shut.",The New York Times
2018,"Rome Mayor Acquitted on Lying Charge, to Relief of Five Star Movement","ROME — Rome’s embattled mayor was acquitted on Saturday of charges of lying about a city hall appointment, a case that threatened her career as well as the credibility of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement she represents. A judge found that no crime had been committed when the mayor, Virginia Raggi, appointed the brother of her top aide to a prestigious tourism position at the beginning of her tenure in 2016. “This sentence wipes away two years of political mud,” Ms. Raggi told reporters outside Rome’s court. “I am going ahead with our heads high for Rome, my beloved city, and all residents.” Prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison term on charges that Ms. Raggi had lied to anti-corruption officials when they questioned her about the appointment. Ms. Raggi said that the choice was hers alone, while prosecutors argued that it had been orchestrated by her aide. Had Ms. Raggi been convicted, she would have faced the loss of her position as mayor. Under the Five Star Movement’s rules, no member convicted of a crime may stay in office, even pending appeal. The verdict was saluted as a victory by Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s vice prime minister and the political leader of the Five Star Movement, which governs in an increasingly tense coalition with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini. “Happy to always have defended you, and always believed in you,” Mr. Di Maio wrote in a blog post on the Movement’s website. “The real plague of this country is the vast majority of intellectually and morally corrupt media,” Mr. Di Maio added. Such journalists were trying to topple the government, he said, with the specific strategy of “glorifying the League and always butchering the Movement.” The comment betrayed Five Star’s difficulty in keeping up with its increasing popular coalition partner. A recent survey showed that Five Star is losing support even as it is rising for the League and Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister. Mr. Salvini’s tough immigration policies and his image of Italy’s strongman are appealing to Italian voters: 30 percent would now vote for the League. Political observers noted that, if Ms. Raggi had been made to quit, Mr. Salvini might have tried to take the high-profile position of running Italy’s capital for his own party. Regardless of the criminal case against her, Ms. Raggi is under constant pressure over a sense of decay in the city, where basic services like garbage collection are spotty in many neighborhoods and the transportation company is on the constant verge of financial collapse. In the past six months, a bus caught fire in the city center and a metro escalator packed with Russian soccer fans collapsed, wounding dozens. This weekend, Romans vote in a nonbinding referendum on whether they want the city’s transportation services to be privatized.",The New York Times
2018,"Ron DeSantis, a Trump Ally, Struggles in Florida as Racial Flare-Ups Come to Fore","MIAMI — President Trump delivered an urgent warning to his staunchest supporters in Florida Wednesday night at a pulsating political rally: Don’t let Ron DeSantis lose the governor’s race next week. Not with Mr. Trump’s 2020 re-election plans potentially hinging on the country’s biggest presidential battleground state. “This is my state also,” Mr. Trump reminded them, alluding to his golf properties and winter home in Palm Beach and his one-point victory in 2016. That Mr. DeSantis is the Republican nominee for governor is a testament to Mr. Trump’s strong endorsement and popularity with conservatives. That Mr. Trump’s support has not been enough to make Mr. DeSantis the favorite on Tuesday — in one of the most high-profile and symbolically important races in the country — is evidence not only of the president’s shaky footing with independents, but also of Mr. DeSantis’s shortcomings as a candidate, political strategists from both parties say. Mr. Trump has expended more political capital on Mr. DeSantis than on most other candidates this year, so the president would inevitably own a loss. Neither party is counting out Mr. DeSantis, but he is slightly trailing Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, in most public polls; the president has scheduled another rally on Saturday in Pensacola. What seemed a winnable race for Republicans against Mr. Gillum, an outspoken progressive who supports impeaching Mr. Trump, has instead become neck-and-neck, with the charismatic Democrat drawing far larger crowds than Mr. DeSantis, a telegenic Fox News regular who has proved uneven on the trail. In the closing weeks of the campaign, what has separated the two candidates most is how each has dealt with issues of race and identity. Mr. Gillum, who would become Florida’s first African-American governor, has talked about both matters at length; Mr. DeSantis, who is white, has struggled to address questions about his past political associations with racists and xenophobes. Mr. DeSantis and his team never prepared to run against Mr. Gillum; they thought they would face one of the more traditional, centrist Democrats running in the primary. The Republican fumbled early on with how to criticize his unexpected opponent and how to deal with a contender who, more than other Democrats who ran for governor, knew how to make moments go viral. One reason Mr. DeSantis may have stumbled is where he had come from: the conservative cocoon of the political right, where his rise to national prominence — lifted by stoking fears of terrorism — went little noticed because Mr. DeSantis was only a congressman in a reliably Republican seat. (He resigned after winning the August primary.) Over nearly three terms in office, Mr. DeSantis, a 40-year-old Yale and Harvard graduate and former Navy prosecutor, became a familiar face on Fox, doing hits from Capitol Hill and flying to New York to appear from the network’s flagship studio. He attended conferences billed as conservative gatherings where he made his name known in political circles that mattered. Thrust into a marquee race in a purple state, however, Mr. DeSantis floundered. In a Fox interview the day after the Aug. 28 primary, he said electing Mr. Gillum, 39, could “monkey this up,” which Democrats denounced as a racist dog whistle. (Mr. DeSantis denied that.) News reports exposed how far-right extremists were among the organizers and attendees of some of the conferences he frequented. A white supremacist group targeted Mr. Gillum with offensive robocalls. A campaign contributor apologized for referring to former President Barack Obama with a racist slur, but Mr. DeSantis declined to return his donation. Mr. DeSantis managed to regroup from that rough start. But the controversies have cast a shadow over his campaign. During the candidates’ last debate, Mr. DeSantis angrily rejected a question about his ties to a conservative author, David Horowitz, who has made incendiary statements. “Are you going to play the McCarthy-ite game?” Mr. DeSantis asked, suggesting he was being found guilty by association. “How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?” Mr. Gillum spied his opening and pounced. “I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist,” he said. A clip of the exchange posted to Twitter by Mr. Gillum’s campaign has been viewed more than seven million times. Mr. DeSantis has pounded Mr. Gillum over a continuing F.B.I. investigation into possible corruption in Tallahassee’s community redevelopment agency, and over inappropriate gifts Mr. Gillum appears to have accepted during several trips with a lobbyist friend. Mr. Trump has gone as far as to label Mr. Gillum, without evidence, a “thief.” On Thursday, the Gillum campaign was also dealing with criticism after the conservative undercover journalism operation, Project Veritas, released a video in which a Gillum volunteer calls Florida “a cracker” state. (The campaign has cut ties with the volunteer.) Mr. Gillum and his supporters have tried to turn those accusations of corruption — as well as claims by Mr. DeSantis that Mr. Gillum is anti-police — against Mr. DeSantis and Republicans, saying the attacks are fueled by racism against a successful black politician. Mr. DeSantis’s campaign has countered that resorting to accusations of racism is a way for Mr. Gillum to avoid scrutiny on his lobbyist dealings. The Democratic emphasis on racial politics could push more white voters, who make up a majority of Florida’s electorate and came out in droves for Mr. Trump in 2016, to the polls for Mr. DeSantis this year. More Republicans than Democrats have cast early ballots in Florida so far. But in an election that could come down to turning out his base, Mr. Gillum has embraced any risk posed in energizing minority voters at the expense of white ones. Lingering questions over Mr. DeSantis’s past associations to Mr. Horowitz and others have exasperated the former congressman and his backers, who prefer to focus on his message of economic stability and law and order in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1994. “I think he’s frustrated that the normal playbook is not running as smoothly as it has for a quarter century,” said Adam Goodman, a veteran Republican political consultant who said Florida’s changing demographics might no longer respond to traditional Republican orthodoxy. Mr. DeSantis first outlined his conservative ideology in a 2011 book that turned him into a popular speaker at Florida Tea Party and Republican gatherings. The book, “Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama,” borrowed from the title of Barack Obama’s 1995 memoir, “Dreams From My Father.” Mr. DeSantis dwelled on socialist and radical mentors in Mr. Obama’s life, arguing that, under their influence, the former president steered the country on a path divergent from what the founding fathers intended. His anti-Obama message appeared to resonate with some Fox viewers. By mid-2012, even before his first election, he was a guest on Sean Hannity’s show; by the time he got to Washington the next year, Mr. DeSantis had bypassed the obscurity of most rank-and-file freshman members of Congress. On the campaign trail, Mr. DeSantis emphasizes his work with the Trump administration to move the Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, referring to the West Bank by the biblical names Judea and Samaria that are commonly used by Jewish settlers. At Mo’s Bagels and Deli in Aventura, Fla., he recently quipped that Mr. Gillum would move the embassy to the Palestinian city of Ramallah. Much of Mr. DeSantis’s attention in Congress was on terrorism. From his perch as chairman of a national security subcommittee, he delivered attention-grabbing statements that stoked fear of Muslims. Following the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, for example, he speculated that there were “thousands” of potential terrorists on federal watch lists in Florida. “He’s willing to tolerate and even utilize prejudice to advance his agenda,” said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil-liberties organization. Some of Mr. DeSantis’s viewpoints parallel those of Mr. Horowitz — the apparent focus of the debate question that set off Mr. DeSantis’s angry eruption. A controversial author and speaker, Mr. Horowitz is known for espousing anti-Muslim opinions. He has claimed that the only serious race war in the United States is against whites, and he has compared Palestinians to Nazis. Mr. Horowitz denied allegations that he is a racist in an article published after the debate. Since 2013, Mr. DeSantis has appeared at four conferences sponsored by Mr. Horowitz — which was first reported by The Washington Post — and had praised his organization as one that “shoots straight, tells the American people the truth and is standing up for the right thing.” He has continued to defend his speeches there, noting that the keynote address at one of the gatherings was given by a Medal of Honor recipient. When Mr. Trump recently tweeted that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” had joined a large caravan of Central Americans heading to the United States, he was repeating an idea advanced on Capitol Hill in 2016 by Mr. DeSantis, who called a hearing to discuss the threat posed by Islamic terrorists crossing the Mexican border. Mr. Trump returned to the caravan during Wednesday’s rally, pitching his idea — widely discounted by legal experts — to end birthright citizenship by executive order. A proposal so alienating to immigrants, especially Latinos, would be unheard-of in a typical Florida election year. But Mr. DeSantis, who said this week he agrees with limiting birthright protections, smiled broadly standing next to the president and took aim at Mr. Gillum. “Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!” Mr. DeSantis said. “Lock him up!” the crowd chanted.",The New York Times
2018,"Ron Johnson, Record-Setting Giants Running Back, Dies at 71","Ron Johnson, the All-Pro running back who became the first player in Giants history to gain at least 1,000 rushing yards in a season, achieving the milestone twice in the 1970s, died on Saturday at an assisted living facility in Madison, N.J. He was 71. His wife, Karen, confirmed the death. Johnson was found to have Alzheimer’s disease in 2008. The Giants had only two winning seasons between 1964 and 1980. Both came when Johnson achieved rushing milestones for the franchise. “When I got to New York, the running backs were Tucker Frederickson and Ernie Koy,” he recalled in Ken Palmer’s “Game of My Life: Memorable Stories of Giants Football” (2007). “They were two white, big fullback-type guys. Everyone assumed that if you were black, you were fast. The Giants never really had anybody like that. So I was very, very well received when I got to New York.” Johnson, 6 feet 1 inches and 205 pounds in his playing days, ran for 1,027 yards and eight touchdowns in 1970, his first season as a Giant. He also had 487 receiving yards, giving him a league-leading 1,514 yards from scrimmage. The Giants went 9-5. and he was voted to the All-Pro first team and the Pro Bowl. “He’s the best halfback in football today — period,” the Giants’ star quarterback Fran Tarkenton told The Associated Press after Johnson caught a touchdown pass, ran for another score and rushed for more than 130 yards in a 23-20 comeback victory over the Dallas Cowboys in November 1970. “He catches the ball, he blocks, he runs inside and outside, he makes the big plays,” Tarkenton said. After missing most of the 1971 season with an injury, Johnson ran for 1,182 yards and nine touchdowns in 1972, when he was again chosen for the Pro Bowl. He set a Giants record for touchdowns in a game when he scored three times on passes from Tarkenton’s successor, Norm Snead, and once on a run in a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in October 1972. The Giants went 8-6 that season, then reverted to their losing ways. Johnson was an All-American halfback at Michigan, and he was the first black player to be named a football captain there. He scored 19 rushing touchdowns in the 1968 season, including a five-touchdown, 347-yard game against Wisconsin; all are still university records. As a rookie with the Cleveland Browns, who selected him in the first round of the 1969 draft, he scored seven touchdowns. The Browns traded him to the Giants in 1970 for receiver Homer Jones in a multiplayer deal. For all his achievements in six seasons with the Giants, Johnson was hampered by injuries, and the team did not win so much as a division title. “I’d like to go anywhere to play for a winner,” he told The Sarasota Herald Tribune in January 1975. The Giants did not trade him, and he retired following the 1975 season. Ronald Adolphus Johnson, the youngest of five children, was born on Oct. 17, 1947, in Detroit, where his father, Arthur, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Willie Mae, was a homemaker. He was a high school football star and idolized Jim Brown, the Browns’ star fullback. Johnson ran for 4,308 yards and 40 touchdowns as a pro and scored another 15 receiving touchdowns. His single-season Giants rushing record stood until 1985, when Joe Morris ran for 1,336 yards. He shares the club record of four touchdowns in a game with running back Rodney Hampton and receiver Earnest Gray. Johnson is survived by his wife; a sister, Jean; a son, Chris; a daughter, Allison; and three grandchildren. His brother Alex, a major league outfielder for 13 seasons, won the 1970 American League batting championship, hitting .329 for the California Angels. Johnson received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Michigan, worked as a financial analyst for Dean Witter, and then founded the Rackson Corporation, which is based in Totowa, N.J., and New York City and operates fast food outlets in several states. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992. Fourteen years later, he became the hall’s first member to be chairman of the National Football Foundation, which operates it. Johnson’s family told The New York Times in 2011 that he had never received a concussion diagnosis and that his mother and a brother also had Alzheimer’s disease. But the possible connection between football contact and long-term neurological disability has been a rising concern. Johnson received between $88,000 and $130,000 annually under the 88 Plan, a fund operated by the N.F.L. and its players’ union that helps retired players with dementia. He had sustained knee and thigh injuries while playing football and had neck surgery in 1988 to remove two vertebrae. In reflecting on her husband’s neurological illness and her fears for him after football, Karen Johnson told The Times in 2011 how “I was always worried about the appendages.” “I always thought it would be something physical, something with the knees, arthritis,” she said. “This came out of the dark.”",The New York Times
2018,Ronald K. Brown Choreographs a Love Letter to Alvin Ailey,"The choreographer Ronald K. Brown stepped into a big studio at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and greeted the dancers with warm hugs. Then, almost without a word, he began to move, his feet and shoulders swaying to the beat, his upper body undulating slightly. “The Love,” a Malian song with a slow, hypnotizing groove, was playing on the sound system. The dancers gathered in a semicircle around him, moving to the rhythm. Just like that, they were drawn into the spirit of the dance. Mr. Brown was putting the finishing touches on “The Call,” which is to have its premiere on Dec. 4 as part of the Ailey company’s 60th-anniversary season. The dance, which he describes as “a love letter to Ailey,” is his seventh for the troupe in 20 years. So it’s no wonder the vibe in the studio is a bit like a conversation picked up midstream. “His movement just feels good,” the Ailey dancer Jacqueline Green said of Mr. Brown’s choreographic style, which combines the flow and rhythm of West African movement with an urban drive that suggests club dance. (Mr. Brown also has his own ensemble, Evidence.) “It feels like I could do it at home,” Ms. Green continued. “I could do it when I’m out dancing. It’s almost like social dance. It’s like breathing, a little.” [Read about “Lazarus,” Rennie Harris’s tribute to Ailey for the 60th anniversary] With “The Call,” Mr. Brown, 52, said he wanted to pay tribute to the man who had brought him to dance four decades ago. “When I was 8,” he said in an interview, “I went on a school trip to see the Ailey company, and then I went home and made my first dance.” The work Mr. Brown saw was “Revelations,” Ailey’s 1960 masterpiece. It made him realize that he “could choreograph and tell stories,” he said. “I started making up dances using my cousins and putting on shows.” “The Call” is both intimate and spare; for just five dancers, it’s set to a surprisingly harmonious mix of Bach, jazz (by Mary Lou Williams) and Malian music, as performed by the Brooklyn-based Asase Yaa Entertainment Group. Despite the contrast in musical idioms, each section flows naturally into the next. It opens with a canon in which one dancer enters after another, each executing the same stately sequence: a jump from the wings; a series of sideways steps with arms extended (as if measuring the space); and, finally, a rising up on tiptoe and turning to gesture to the next dancer, until all five share the stage, their movements echoing across it. Both the music — the slow section of Bach’s Trio Sonata in G — and the movement have a formal, almost classical quality. This, too is a reference to Ailey, Mr. Brown said: “His sensibility could be very formal. And there was something about that clarity of vision and simplicity that I wanted to evoke here.” The call and response among the dancers eventually leads to an extended duet for a man and a woman, unusual for Mr. Brown. The two dance together again in the second section, set to Mary Lou Williams’s upbeat “Blues for Timme.” Jamar Roberts, who dances with Ms. Green in one of the casts, explained that during the creation process the choreographer had brought in photographs of Ailey dancing with Carmen de Lavallade, one of his earliest collaborators. (Ms. de Lavallade, now nearly 90, is still performing.) Ailey and Ms. de Lavallade met in high school in Los Angeles. She convinced him to attend classes led by the modern-dance choreographer Lester Horton, whose company they eventually joined together. A few years later, in 1954, they traveled to New York to perform on Broadway in the Truman Capote musical “House of Flowers.” “She brought him too us, in a way,” Mr. Brown said. Some of the moves captured in those photographs made it into “The Call,” including a pose from Horton’s 1953 dance “Dedication to José Clemente Orozco” in which the two lock elbows. So did a famous pose from a photograph of Ailey by Normand Maxon from the early ’60s — lunging while reaching up toward the heavens — that hangs in the Ailey studios. These are like talismanic elements woven into the fiber of the piece, much like the gestures that recur from one section to the next: pointing, placing a hand on the heart, lifting the forearms toward the body as if splashing water. “It’s like you’re baptizing yourself with the love for Mr. Ailey and the ancestors,” Mr. Brown explained, “with the intention of really asking Mr. Ailey to join us.” The meaning is what gives shape to the gesture, not the way it looks like or where it falls in the music. “There’s a physical narrative to what they do, which is important, and which they have to be invested in. Because of my long relationship with the dancers, they know that.” Sincerity of meaning and formal mastery — particularly in the way he moves dancers in and out of sync, on and off the stage — are two constants of Mr. Brown’s choreography. The grounded style challenges the Ailey dancers to tone down their usual onstage magnetism. “We get so used to projecting,” Ms. Green said, “but with him, it’s more personal. We really see each other when we dance his work.” This is particularly true in “The Call,” with its sense of history and small cast. Unlike most of his works for Ailey, it has no big finale, a detail the company’s director, Robert Battle, recently noted in a telephone interview. “It’s plaintively spoken,” he said, “with no raising of the voice at the end.” And yet, quietly, Mr. Brown accomplishes a kind of magical sleight of hand. Near the end of “The Call,” the dancers begin to move in sync, slowly gliding backward into a triangular formation. Then, on the final notes of “The Love,” they all raise their arms, at once. And there it is, the opening image from “Revelations.”",The New York Times
2018,Rosalía: The Pop Star Bringing Flamenco to a New Generation,"MADRID — Plaza de Colón is a significant place for flamenco fans. The square in Madrid is where the funeral procession for one of the genre’s most celebrated artists, Lola Flores, began in 1995, and it is where many of the city’s major flamenco events take place. It was also here, in late October, that Rosalía Vila Tobella, 26, showed how she is ripping up the flamenco rule book — or, rather, writing her own version. At an outdoor performance in front of an audience of 11,000 for the release of her album “El Mal Querer,” the singer appeared onstage wearing sneakers and a rose-red bodysuit embellished with an abundance of ruffles, not the long skirts and heeled shoes that have long been associated with Spain’s folkloric style of music and dance. She was flanked by a dance squad, members of which wheeled out a quad bike for the singer to straddle during one song. Later, the synthetic echo of Auto-Tune, software that adjusts voice pitch, could be heard as she delivered a charged solo: modernity pixelating tradition. “Everything is in flamenco,” said the singer, who goes by Rosalía, in an interview the next day. “Spirituality, loyalty, humility, valor.” It was “true and powerful,” she added. “I grew up inspired by all these emotions, all these expressive colors.” Rosalía’s take on flamenco is credited with refreshing the genre for a new generation. “She is bringing many young people to flamenco,” the journalist Silvia Cruz Lapeña said in a phone interview. Enric Palau, a director of Sónar, a music festival in Barcelona, Spain, said, “She could be the Rihanna of flamenco.” Rosalía said her new record mixed tradition and innovation in a way that had not been done before in flamenco. “The music is connected with my roots, with my culture, but it’s also connected with the rest of the world,” she said. Her music videos go heavy on remixed Spanish iconography: matadors flagging down motorbikes, pointy-hooded penitents skateboarding, dancers in streetwear, and shots that echo Goya. Musically, she interlinks flamenco’s complex, finger-clicking rhythms and intense style of singing with electronic styling and intricate layers of playful samples and slogans with attitude. The result is an original pop sound that has been called “millennial flamenco.” The success of reggaeton from Latin America has already burst open the door for Spanish-language pop music on a global scale, but Rosalía is still something of an anomaly. She is one of the rare contemporary artists in Spain who have made an impact outside of the country, cultivating a fan base on her own via social media. Until August, when she signed with Sony, she had achieved that without the support of a major label. On the day of its release this month,“El Mal Querer,” which translates roughly as “Bad Loving,” was streamed in Spain more than two million times on Spotify. Rosalía has since been nominated for five awards at the Latin Grammys, which will be announced on Thursday in Las Vegas. Pedro Almodóvar, the movie director who has cast Rosalía alongside Penélope Cruz in his coming film “Dolor y Gloria,” or “Pain and Glory,” wrote in an email that the flamenco singer had “breathtaking charisma” and praised her “versatility.” “Rosalía is the complete opposite of an artist designed by the industry,” he said. She is “authentic and original,” and, although she is now working with Sony, “It’s her who decides every single detail.” “And, up until now, she’s nailed everything,” he added. Speaking of nails, Rosalía’s are really something: jewel-encrusted and pierced with charms. A day after her album release, between rehearsals for another awards ceremony, she was dressed down in teal sweatpants and a corduroy bomber jacket, except for those sparkling talons. She took them off to play guitar, she said, but they made her feel “powerful” when performing. “My favorite flamenco singers, they’re not trying to look pretty,” Rosalía said. “They’re trying to put truth in what they do, in the way they express themselves. Sometimes that’s not beauty, but it’s beautiful.” Rosalía said she discovered flamenco as a teenager while hanging out in souped-up cars with her friends in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, near Barcelona, where she grew up. Back then, she said, flamenco was “a street thing, it wasn’t mainstream.” In particular, she admired the work of the 1970s flamenco musician Camarón de la Isla, she said. She started dance classes at age 13. Later, under the tuition of José Miguel Vizcaya, also known as El Chiqui, Rosalía enrolled at the Catalonia College of Music, which admits only one pupil per year to study flamenco. She graduated in 2017, the same year that her first album, “Los Ángeles,” or “The Angels,” was released. That record was a guitar-based vocal album about death, and it included a cover of the American folk musician Bonnie “Prince” Billy’s despairing ballad “I See a Darkness.” At the time, she said, she felt that she was never going to live up to flamenco’s greats. “I had to push myself to do something original,” she added. Some flamenco purists are none too thrilled with Rosalía’s taste for experimentation, said Cruz Lapeña, the journalist, who has written a book about the genre’s history. “Flamenco is a world where traditions are very respected,” she explained. “There is a part that wants to keep flamenco in the past. There are a lot of codes, some of them old-fashioned, and she’s breaking all of them.” Rosalía, however, said she believed that the only way to maintain the flamenco sound was by “making it change constantly.” On “El Mal Querer,” a concept album about a relationship turned toxic, she worked with the producer Pablo Díaz-Reixa, also known as El Guincho, to bring in R&B, hip-hop and minimal electronic sounds. One song even riffs on Justin Timberlake’s 2002 hit, “Cry Me a River.” Rosalía’s melding of influences has also prompted debate about cultural appropriation. In Spain, flamenco is associated with the Romany people of Andalusia, a region in the country’s south. Rosalía, from Catalonia in the northeast, has been accused of appropriating the Romany style and of faking an Andalusian accent. Cruz Lapeña said that some members of the Romany community in Spain felt “a lack of respect, because she only takes the aesthetic part of history — the earrings, the hair.” “She has a platform to talk about that painful history that is part of flamenco culture and music,” Cruz Lapeña added, “but she doesn’t.” Rosalía’s argument is that she doesn’t see flamenco as belonging only to Romany culture: It comes from other sources, too, she said. “Jewish culture, Spanish culture, African culture, Gypsy culture — this mix made flamenco what it is,” she said, adding that, in her eyes, “This music is not about race or territories.” Romany people were “very connected” to flamenco, she said, “but flamenco isn’t one thing.” In any case, Rosalía added, she doesn’t have time to be concerned with criticism anymore. “El Mal Querer” has earned worldwide acclaim and she has caught the eye of producers like Pharrell Williams, who she’s been working with. She said that even though she was daring with her music, that approach didn’t come from a desire to shock — she just wanted to push flamenco forward. “I know that I’m taking risks, but I have no other option,” she said. “I’m always loyal to how I understand music, how I want to present myself, how I understand my job. This is how I feel it.”",The New York Times
2018,Rose Byrne Searches for Joy in a Troubled System,"A Word With Late in 2017, as Rose Byrne blissfully cocooned with her newborn son, she was scarcely thinking about work. Then Sean Anders blindsided her with “Instant Family,” his semi-autobiographical comedy about foster-care adoption. “I read the script and was like, ‘Oh [expletive], oh no, ugh,’” Byrne said, re-enacting her mini-meltdown. She handed it to her partner, Bobby Cannavale, who pored over its pages and sighed, “Oh dear,” amid a flood of tears. Finally, she spoke with Anders, the film’s director and co-writer, and more salty utterances flowed. Perhaps it was the post-baby fog, but Byrne just couldn’t say no. In “Instant Family,” Byrne and Mark Wahlberg play Ellie and Pete, upper-middle-class house flippers who delayed having children and, now hovering around 40, decide foster parenting is the solution. But Lizzie (Isabela Moner), the Latina 15-year-old they invite into their home, comes attached to two younger siblings (Gustavo Quiroz and Julianna Gamiz). And the couple’s dreamy notion of familial contentment — just add love and stir — soon disintegrates. Sometimes humorously, sometimes not. A decade earlier, Byrne, an Australian, broke into American television as the idealistic protégée of Glenn Close’s Machiavellian litigator in the legal thriller “Damages.” Then came the comedies “Get Him to the Greek,” with Russell Brand, and “Bridesmaids,” with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy — and Byrne unfurled her freak flag. On Nov. 11, as fire raged through Southern California, the red-carpet premiere of “Instant Family” was canceled, and the movie screened instead for 350 evacuees at Pierce College. In a phone interview earlier that day from the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, where families and their pets were seeking refuge, Byrne, 39 — who lives in New York with Cannavale and their two toddler sons — spoke about finding joy amid a crisis, the perils of humor and the comeback of Louis C.K. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Last year nearly 443,000 American children were in foster care, a number rising in tandem with the opioid crisis. Did you wonder how such a serious matter could be made comedic? I was nervous, to be honest. Sean was striving to make a joyful film to try [to] destigmatize these kids, because there’s been so much about the system, and it’s heavy and dark. But he really wanted to make a film with a little more hope, and there were a lot of scenes where I was like: “Are we being too wacky? Is this too crazy? I don’t want to be disrespectful.” But I’d hooked up with a great group of foster moms who were really candid and answered all my nosy questions. And I just trusted Sean, knowing that it was his story. There were so many possibilities for being upstaged: the children, the dog, Tig Notaro and Octavia Spencer. They say, “Don’t work with kids and animals because you know they’re going to steal the show.” Nobody’s going to give a [expletive] about what me and Mark are doing. They’re just going to be like, “Oh my God, that girl’s heartbreaking.” And [Tig and Octavia were] hysterical. And also, so weird. Tig’s dry and straight, and Octavia has such a kind of explosive energy, and it was very authentic, their chemistry. Somewhere between “Damages” and “Bridesmaids,” you became a comedian to reckon with. When did you realize you were funny? I by no means knew. I think like any actor, I was just craving to do something to show different sides of myself. I’ve been so lucky because you’re only as good as the company you keep, no? And so being paired with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy [in “Bridesmaids”] and Seth Rogen [in “Neighbors”] and Tiffany Haddish, who I’m working with in “Limited Partners” — she’s fierce and she’s magical — I feel incredibly lucky. I’m just trying to keep up with them. That’s awfully self-deprecating. [Laughs] Yeah, it’s so boring to be so self-deprecating. It’s such an Australian quality. But I look at [them], and it’s effortless, and for me it doesn’t feel that effortless. Also, the catch with comedy is if you’re funny in real life it doesn’t mean you’re funny onscreen. Comedians are often very serious and dark but hysterical in their characters. The stakes are higher. You appeared in Louis C.K.’s “I Love You, Daddy,” which was shelved after the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced. Was that difficult? Of course. You go in with such great intentions, and Louis was very sweet with me, and I had a very respectful experience. But it’s obviously very complicated, and I stand with the women who came forward. But yeah, it is conflicting when you commit to something, just from my experience of, “Wow, this is a really weird, dark story — I’m intrigued by it.” And then it becomes a much bigger thing than what it is. I think it will be a while before that film can be seen, and I think that’s right. Is it soon for Louis to have a comeback? It’s too soon for him to have a surprise one, that’s for sure. I think if he’s going to show up, just let everybody know so then they can make a decision, like, “I don’t want to see this guy — I’m out.” It’s also the gatekeepers around these things who give people the chance to have a comeback. They’re actually really powerful. I would like to see them being held accountable a little bit more. Have you noticed a shift in the industry a year into the #MeToo and Time’s Up era? I think like in any movement, people get overly sensitive and overly “Can I do this or that?” And that will even out, but I feel like there’s a bit of a shift. It’s an ongoing conversation, and it still has so far to go. It’s such an entrenched and systemic thing. But it’s remarkable these women who come forward and risk so much by doing it. I still don’t think people really get it, how hard that would be.",The New York Times
2018,Rough Drafts of Richard Feynman’s Ideas Head to Auction,"The scribblings of a brilliant 20th-century physicist show that he did not get everything right on the first try, either. One of the titans of 20th-century physics, Richard Feynman deciphered the interplay of fundamental particles and forces. He wrote popular books in which he portrayed himself as a charming scientific rogue, and played a key role in the investigation of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger. While brilliant, he was not perfect. That becomes evident looking at some of his papers that go up for auction on Friday. Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for key insights in understanding the quantum version of electromagnetism, and the medal and citation that came with it is the centerpiece of the auction, conducted by Sotheby’s in New York. But the assorted writings that are also for sale by his family reveal clues into how he worked and thought. “We tend to have this idea of genius being someone who just sprung out of the womb and had these magical capabilities,” said Cassandra Hatton, the specialist at Sotheby’s in New York who is overseeing the auction. “And Feynman himself denied that fact. He always said, ‘Guys, there’s nothing. There’s no magic here. I’m just somebody who’s very interested and worked very hard and was very curious.’” During World War II, Feynman was part of the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. The physicists in Los Alamos, N.M., where the secret atomic research was conducted, were worried that workers producing plutonium in Oak Ridge, Tenn., were not heeding safety precautions. They wanted to explain the science of why the material was so dangerous. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Feynman, in his 20s, flew to Oak Ridge to give the talk. Some of these pages may have been notes from that talk. Others may be versions he revised later for other talks to other audiences. “He’ll come back to certain themes and work them over and over,” Ms. Hatton said, pointing to several versions of this atomic research paper. Feynman, who died in 1988, donated his archive of scientific papers to the California Institute of Technology, where he spent much of his career. The papers offered at auction by his family are the leftovers, the scraps, the rough drafts. But that doesn’t mean they’re not valuable, Ms. Hatton said. “I think they’re more important because they let us see how he got from A to Z,” she said. “They show us the steps. They show us the little mistakes and the things he crossed out and where he changed his mind and what he decided to refine.” While some people are very particular about a pen or type of paper, Feynman usually grabbed whatever was closest and started scribbling, usually without noting a title, date or place. That made it challenging to organize the papers as sometimes he continued his thought on a different colored piece of paper with a different pen. The written scribble on this sheet include the “Feynman diagrams” that he developed to quickly summarize a subatomic interaction with lines and squiggles. A few of Feynman’s sketches are interspersed among his notes. Included in the auction are books from Feynman’s library, including a textbook written by Paul Dirac, another giant of 20th-century physics. Feynman wrote comments in the margins. “Analyze this some day,” he wrote on one page. In recent years, Feynman’s reputation as a womanizer has led some critics to re-evaluate his academic legacy. Some of his behavior, like dating undergraduates, would likely be grounds for academic sanction today. Included in the random pieces of paper at auction is an example of some of this behavior: place mats from Gianonni’s, a strip club in Pasadena, Calif., not far from his home, where Feynman often went. While there, he would scribble on the backs of the place mats. For the mathematical notations on this particular place mat, “We couldn't tie it to any specific problem,” Ms. Hatton said. “It seems almost like he was just playing around.” In his book “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman,” he recalled, “I’d sit in one of the booths and work a little physics on the paper place mats with the scalloped edges, and sometimes I’d draw one of the dancing girls or one of the customers, just to practice.” One of Feynman’s most famous talks was “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” in 1959, which predicted the advent of nanotechnology, creating machines at the scale of molecules. This document, above, was found among the papers that the family had. It appears to have been prepared for a version of the talk given at El Camino College in California. Feynman was also well known as a lecturer, striving to find the clearest way to explain a difficult concept. On March 13, 1964, he gave a talk in a freshman physics class at Caltech about the motion of planets. An archivist found a transcript of the lecture, once believed lost, and it was turned into a book, “Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun.” In sifting through the papers that the family possessed, “What we found is a much more extensive version of that lost lecture,” Ms. Hatton said. Outside of physics, Feynman did magic and played bongo drums. This is a tambourine that Feynman bought in Brazil. He taught himself Portuguese and how to play the tambourine in a samba band. The Nobel medal is 23-karat gold. (Since 1980, they are now 18-karat gold plated with 24-karat gold.) Feynman was not happy about the 4 a.m. phone call that he had won a Nobel. He complained about being woken up and hung up. He later recounted in “Surely You’re Joking”: Then I began to think, ‘How can I turn this all off? I don’t want any of this!’ So the first thing was to take the telephone off the hook…. I went down to the study to think: What am I going to do? Maybe I won’t accept the Prize. What would happen then? Maybe that’s impossible….” Feynman did go to Stockholm to accept the prize. During the ceremony, he doodled in one of the booklets.",The New York Times
2018,Roy Clark Is Dead at 85; a Face of Country Music on ‘Hee Haw’,"Roy Clark, the country singer and multi-instrumentalist best known as a longtime host of “Hee Haw,” the television variety show that brought country music to millions of households each week, died on Thursday at his home in Tulsa, Okla. He was 85. A spokesman, Jeremy Westby, said the cause was complications of pneumonia. Mr. Clark was a genial banjo-wielding presence on “Hee Haw” for the show’s entire run of more than two decades, serving as an ambassador for country music and the culture that defined it. Most memorable, perhaps, was his role on the show’s weekly “pickin’ and grinnin’ ” segment with his co-host, the singer and guitarist Buck Owens. A variant of the old “Arkansas Traveler” routine — a vaudeville set piece that interspersed humor with music — the segment featured the two men trading winking rural-themed jokes, to the amusement of an audience that included many urban and suburban viewers living outside the South. (Mr. Owens died in 2006.) “You can go and get educated, but you can come to ‘Hee Haw’ and get another education,” Mr. Clark said in discussing the show’s far-reaching popularity in a 2016 NPR interview. “The critics all said that the only listeners that we had were country. And I said, ‘Wait a minute — I was just in New York City, and I was walking down the street and a guy yells across and says, “Hey, Roy, I’m a-pickin’.” ’ Well, I’m obligated to say, ‘Well, I’m a-grinnin’.’ ” Conceived as a down-home answer to “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In,” the NBC comedy hour that featured blackout sketches, fast-cutting edits and one-liners, “Hee Haw” aired for only two years on CBS, from 1969 to 1971, before being canceled. But it then became a hit in syndication, running from 1971 to 1992. At the peak of its popularity, in the ’70s, it reached 30 million viewers a week. Beyond “Hee Haw” and its fictional Kornfield Kounty, Mr. Clark brought country music to the living rooms and dens of the American public through his appearances as a regular guest and occasional guest host on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” He also appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and on sitcoms like “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “The Odd Couple,” and had a long-running stage act in Las Vegas. In August 1983 Mr. Clark played a pivotal role in establishing Branson, Mo., a small town in the Ozark Mountains, as a tourist destination when he became the first major country star to open a music venue there, the 1,500-seat Roy Clark Celebrity Theater. He was also among the first country acts to perform in concert with symphony orchestras. In 1976, more than a decade before the Berlin Wall came down, he embarked on a world tour that included 18 dates in the Soviet Union. The concert halls of Europe and North America were a far cry from the stages on which Mr. Clark got his start in the late 1940s, when he toured as a member of the band of Grandpa Jones, a banjo player and rustic comedian who would later become a regular on “Hee Haw.” On the road with Mr. Jones, Mr. Clark appeared for two weeks on a bill headed by Hank Williams. After performing in nightclubs, on radio and on television in and around Washington in the early 1950s, Mr. Clark was hired to play lead guitar in the house band on “Country Style,” a popular Washington TV show hosted by the singer Jimmy Dean. Dismissed for tardiness in 1957, he went on to appear on Arthur Godfrey’s “Talent Scouts” and, shortly after that, to land a job in the band of the country singer George Hamilton IV. He moved to the West Coast in 1960 to be the leader and lead guitarist of the Party Timers, the rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson’s band. Mr. Clark’s tenure with Ms. Jackson included appearances in her revue at the Golden Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas and on recordings for Capitol like her 1960 hit “Let’s Have a Party.” Mr. Clark’s affiliation with Ms. Jackson also helped him secure a contract of his own with Capitol, for which he released his debut album, the all-instrumental “The Lightning Fingers of Roy Clark,” in 1962. The next year he sang and played guitar on a remake of Bill Anderson’s 1960 hit, “The Tip of My Fingers” (the title of Mr. Clark’s version rendered “Tip” plural), which reached the country Top 10 and peaked just outside the pop Top 40. During the 1960s and ’70s Mr. Clark placed a total of 24 singles in the country Top 40, nine of them in the Top 10. Roy Linwood Clark, the oldest of five children, was born on April 15, 1933, in Meherrin, Va., an unincorporated community in the central part of the state. His father, Hester, was a laborer in sawmills and on the railroad and worked sporadically as a musician, playing guitar, fiddle and banjo — instruments his son would quickly master. His mother, Lillian, played piano; his brother Dick and sister Jean both played mandolin and guitar. Neither of his other two siblings, Dwight and Susan, showed any interest in playing music. Mr. Clark began accompanying his father at local square dances as an adolescent. By the time he was 14 he had won two national banjo championships, the second of which earned him an invitation to appear on the Grand Ole Opry. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 In his late teens, Mr. Clark, who was also a gifted athlete and an amateur airplane pilot, pursued a career in boxing. He enjoyed considerable success as a professional fighter before settling into life as a musician. After having his first hit with “The Tips of My Fingers,” Mr. Clark followed a stylistically expansive path, recording albums with artists ranging from the jazz guitarist Barney Kessel to the blues singer, fiddle player and guitarist Gatemouth Brown. Over the next two decades he would have country hits with versions of songs recorded by artists, including Louis Armstrong, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Durante and Charles Aznavour, whose “Yesterday When I Was Young” he placed in the country Top 10 and the pop Top 20 in 1969. (Mr. Aznavour died in October.) Mr. Clark was named entertainer of the year at the Country Music Association Awards in 1973 and musician of the year in 1977, 1978 and 1980. His recording of the country standard “Alabama Jubilee” won a Grammy Award for best country instrumental performance in 1983. Eleven years later he published his autobiography, “My Life — in Spite of Myself!” He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1987 and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009. Mr. Clark is survived by his wife of 61 years, Barbara Joyce (Rupard) Clark; three sons, Roy Clark II, Michael Meyer and Terry Lee Meyer; two daughters, Susan Mosier and Diane Stewart; four grandchildren; and his sister, Susan Coryell. A grandson, Elijah Clark, died in September. Although he became known as a natural comedian, Mr. Clark was initially uncomfortable in the role of funnyman. “All of my comedy started from the fact that I never had that much self-confidence,” he explained in 2016. “I would laugh and cut up so the audience wouldn’t think I was being too serious. But slowly but surely, I got more confidence.”",The New York Times
2018,"Roy Hargrove, Trumpeter Who Gave Jazz a Jolt of Youth, Dies at 49","Roy Hargrove, a virtuoso trumpeter who became a symbol of jazz’s youthful renewal in the early 1990s, and then established himself as one of the most respected musicians of his generation, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 49. His death, at Mount Sinai Hospital, was caused by cardiac arrest brought on by kidney disease, according to his manager, Larry Clothier. He said Mr. Hargrove had been on dialysis for 13 years. Beginning in his high school years Mr. Hargrove expressed a deep affinity for jazz’s classic lexicon and the creative flexibility to place it in a fresh context. He would take the stock phrases of blues and jazz and reinvigorate them while reminding listeners of the long tradition whence he came. “He rarely sounds as if he stepped out of a time machine,” the critic Nate Chinen wrote in 2008, reviewing Mr. Hargrove’s album “Earfood” for The New York Times. “At brisk tempos he summons a terrific clarity and tension, leaning against the current of his rhythm section. At a slower crawl, playing fluegelhorn, he gives each melody the equivalent of a spa treatment.” In the late 1990s, already established as a jazz star, Mr. Hargrove became affiliated with the Soulquarians, a loose confederation of musicians from the worlds of hip-hop and neo-soul that included Questlove, Erykah Badu, Common and D’Angelo. For several years the collective convened semi-regularly at Electric Lady Studios in Manhattan, recording albums now seen as classics. Mr. Hargrove’s sly horn overdubs can be heard, guttering like a low flame, on records like “Voodoo,” by D’Angelo, and “Mama’s Gun,” by Ms. Badu. “He is literally the one-man horn section I hear in my head when I think about music,” Questlove wrote on Instagram after Mr. Hargrove’s death. Even as he explored an ever-expanding musical terrain, Mr. Hargrove did not lose sight of jazz traditions. “To get a thorough knowledge of anything you have to go to its history,” he told the writer Tom Piazza in 1990 for an article about young jazz musicians in The New York Times Magazine. “I’m just trying to study the history, learn it, understand it, so that maybe I’ll be able to develop something that hasn’t been done yet.” In 1997 he recorded the album “Habana,” an electrified, rumba-inflected parley between American and Cuban musicians united under the band name Crisol. The album, featuring Hargrove originals and compositions by jazz musicians past and present, earned him his first of two Grammy Awards. His second was for the 2002 album “Directions in Music,” a live recording on which he was a co-leader with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker. That album became a favorite of jazz devotees and music students trying to envision a future for acoustic-jazz innovation. In the 2000s, Mr. Hargrove released three records with RH Factor, a large ensemble that built a style of its own out of cool, electrified hip-hop grooves and greasy funk from the 1970s. He held onto the spirit that guided those inquiries — one of creative fervor, tempered by cool poise — in the more traditionally formatted Roy Hargrove Quintet, a dependable group he maintained for most of his career. On “Earfood,” a late-career highlight, the quintet capers from savvy updates of jazz standards to original ballads and new tunes that mix Southern warmth and hip-hop swagger. By his mid-20s, Mr. Hargrove was already giving back to the New York jazz scene that had made him its crown prince. In 1995, with the vocalist Lezlie Harrison and the organizer Dale Fitzgerald, he founded the Jazz Gallery, a little downtown venue that today stands as New York’s most reliable home for cutting-edge presentations by young jazz musicians. Into his final days, dogged by failing health, Mr. Hargrove remained a fixture of the jam sessions at Smalls in Greenwich Village. When not on tour, he spent multiple nights each week in that low-ceilinged basement, his slight, nattily dressed frame emerging occasionally from a corner to blow a smoky, quietly arresting solo. Roy Anthony Hargrove was born on Oct. 16, 1969, in Waco, Tex., to Roy Allan and Jacklyn Hargrove, and raised primarily in Dallas, where his family moved when he was 9. His father served in the Air Force and then worked in a factory for Texas Instruments. His mother held clerical jobs, including as an administrator at the Dallas County Jail. Mr. Hargrove is survived by his mother; his wife, Aida; a daughter, Kamala; and his brother, Brian. Quiet and retiring by nature, Mr. Hargrove developed a close attachment to music. “My parents weren’t around that much; I was pretty much in solitude,” he told Mr. Piazza. “Originally I wanted to play the clarinet, but we didn’t have any money. My dad had a cornet that he’d bought from a pawn shop, so I just played that. I learned to love it.” Mentored by his high school band teacher, Mr. Hargrove showed his talents early. He played at jazz-education festivals and conferences with his high school band, and rumors of his virtuosity spread. When Mr. Hargrove was in 11th grade, the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis visited his high school during a tour stop in Fort Worth, asking to hear the young phenom. Mr. Marsalis was so impressed that he invited Mr. Hargrove to join him at a nearby club date. That led to a trip to Europe in the summer before his senior year to take part in the North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague as a member of an all-star band. After a year at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mr. Hargrove moved to New York City in 1990, at 20. He briefly attended the New School, but his home base was Bradley’s, the Greenwich Village club and jam-session hub peopled by many of jazz’s most esteemed elders. He usually stayed until closing each night. (Bradley’s closed in 1996.) For his first six months in New York, he slept on the couch at the home of Wendy Cunningham, the owner of Bradley’s. By the end of that time, he had recorded a well-regarded debut album, “Diamond in the Rough,” for RCA and become the talk of the town. “Among the newcomers, the one name everyone mentions is Roy Hargrove,” Mr. Piazza wrote in 1990. “His playing incorporates a wide, rich sound, something like that of the great Clifford Brown,” he added. “Barely out of his teens, Hargrove is a mixture of shyness and cockiness, boyish enthusiasm and high seriousness. Music is his whole life.” The New Orleans trumpeter Nicholas Payton, who rose to prominence alongside Mr. Hargrove in the early 1990s, reflected on his significance in a blog post on Saturday. “I often say two things changed the New York City straight-ahead music scene: Art Blakey passing and Bradley’s closing,” Mr. Payton wrote. “Now I have to add a third, the departure of Roy Hargrove. New York will not be the same without you.” An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the middle name of Roy Hargrove’s father. He was Roy Allan Hargrove, not Allen. Because of an editing error, the earlier version also misspelled the given name of Mr. Hargrove’s mother. She is Jacklyn Hargrove, not Jackyn.",The New York Times
2018,Roz Chast in Full View (Body Scan Included),"The New Yorker cartoonist, the subject of a new retrospective, talks about getting started as an artist, why she loves crafting and the thing she hates drawing the most. Roz Chast is the poet laureate of urban neurosis. Over nearly four decades, her cartoons in The New Yorker have captured a certain kind of anxious city dweller: sometimes roaming streets teeming with odd signs and portents, but just as often sitting on a lumpy couch in a nondescript living room, battling obsessive thoughts. “The Masters Series: Roz Chast,” a retrospective at the SVA Chelsea Gallery through Dec. 15, offers an immersion in all things Chast. There are hundreds of original cartoons and drawings for the magazine and her more than 20 books. But the show also includes less familiar work, including childhood drawings and student sketchbooks, which have not previously been exhibited, and examples of her hooked rugs, embroidery, Ukrainian-style Easter eggs and other crafts (not to mention a few walls covered with Chast-designed wallpaper). For a certain kind of devotee, however, the pièce de résistance may be “The M.R.I. of Love,” a life-size, Instagram-ready installation based on one of her cartoons, tucked away in the last of the show’s four rooms. Visitors are very much invited to lie down inside it. So is Ms. Chast going to try it out? “I’m not sure,” she said by telephone, before a visit to the gallery, where she at least perched at the edge of it. “I love that they did it, but — knock on wood — I’m terrified of medical things.” We talked to Ms. Chast, 64, about starting out as a cartoonist, why she loves crafting and the thing she hates drawing the most. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. The earliest drawings in the show were made when you were about 3. When did you get the idea that you might become a cartoonist? I always drew — always, always, always — from when I was really young. As far as thinking of myself as a cartoonist, that started when I was 12 or 13. I loved the underground stuff, and also MAD magazine, with the fake ads and everything else. Some of the sketchbooks in the show are things I did as a teenager to keep myself sane. I can still see things from back then that are very connected to what I do now. For better or worse, I had a style. One of the notebooks is shown open to a real New Yorker cover that you doctored, inserting a giant woman you drew into a Midtown streetscape, King Kong-style. So maybe that was your unofficial first cover? I just liked to take things and draw stuff in. I still do that. I was in Minnesota last weekend, and in the airport I saw a brochure for a Museum of Spam. I didn’t have a chance to go there, so I fooled around with it on the iPad and posted something on Instagram. The show includes some of the first cartoons you published, in a gay men’s magazine called Christopher Street, in 1977, right after you graduated from art school. How did you start publishing there? When I got out of RISD [Rhode Island School of Design], I never thought I’d be able to make a living as a cartoonist. I didn’t really know where I would fit in: What I did wasn’t really underground, and it wasn’t really New Yorker-like either. I was living with my parents in Brooklyn, and I would take around a portfolio of illustrations. I got a bit of work, but I just thought, ‘God, I hate this.’ I didn’t want to be an illustrator. It’s going to sound so corny, but I was looking for some kind of sign. And then one day I found a copy of Christopher Street on the subway. I saw they used cartoons, so I called them up, and started selling them cartoons, for 10 bucks each. In a video in the exhibition, you open up some huge filing cabinets in your home office filled with cartoons rejected by The New Yorker over the years. Yet you got your first cartoon, showing the imaginary objects described by nonsense words, accepted on the first try. Were you surprised? In April 1978, I thought, Why not? I sent them a huge batch of stuff. It must’ve been about 60 cartoons. The one they took was probably the most personal of the whole bunch, the kind of thing that I would do just to make myself laugh. I think the reaction [to that cartoon] from some of the older people wasn’t happy. Years later, Lee Lorenz [the magazine’s former cartoon editor] told me that an older cartoonist had asked if he owed my family money. You still submit to the magazine almost weekly. What is your routine like? The deadline is Monday. I’m always jotting down ideas on various pieces of paper throughout the week. But I like some adrenaline, so I draw them all on Monday, and work on books or other projects the rest of the week. The batch — that’s what we call it — is still in many ways the heart of everything else. Sometimes I’ll be working and then out of the blue, something will just happen. “Batch” makes it sound like baking cookies. It is a little like that! The show includes examples of your Ukrainian-style decorated eggs, stamped prints, hooked rugs and embroidery, some of which has popped up in your work in The New Yorker, like the “Motherboard” tapestry featured on the cover last year. Were you always a crafter? Periodically I get obsessed with a certain craft. Sometimes I try something and it doesn’t jibe with my style, so I have to lay it aside. I started the eggs about 10 years ago, and went on from that to the prints, then the rugs, then the embroidery. Right now I’m completely obsessed with the iPad, which is a whole different thing. I suspect at some point I’ll do some more embroidery. I have a ton of thread that’s making me very itchy in a good way. The first thing visitors to the exhibition will see is the streetscape mural inspired by your 2016 book, “Going Into Town,” which was based on a handmade guidebook to New York you made for one of your children. I’ve said before, what I love about New York is the visual density. It’s so pleasurable to look at so much stuff, smashed together, at different levels. You just look up and it’s like, ‘What is that? Some obscure furrier from 1938?’ People say New York has changed, but things like that still do exist, especially on the obscure side streets. You have said that your least favorite thing to draw is the woods, even though you live in the woods, in Connecticut. What’s so terrible about the woods? I like to draw out of my head, and I can draw interiors until the cows come home. I like coffee tables, I like toasters, I like shelves filled with knickknacks. I like drawing pillows and mugs and baskets with weird crap in them. I don’t even know what you put in a woods. There’s like five things: trees, branches, stones — What else? Maybe squirrels? I’ll have to leave that to people with more woods-imagination.

2018,"Rufus Wainwright and Ivo van Hove Talk Politics, Coming Out and Boarding School","Admiration Society Two creative people in two different fields in one wide-ranging conversation. This time: the singer and the director. What does the Belgian dramatist Ivo van Hove have in common with the American-Canadian singer Rufus Wainwright? For one, they’re both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the ’70s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 “Want” albums. Then he decided to write operas — the second, “Hadrian,” with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October — and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson’s 2009 staging of Shakespeare’s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose “The Crucible” and “A View From the Bridge” he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered “A Little Life,” adapted from the novel written by T’s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet’s prescient 1976 media satire, “Network” (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, “Sword of Damocles,” as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self — and the benefits of boarding school. RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: One of my husband Jörn [Weisbrodt]’s great heroes is Ivo. I think the first thing that I saw of his was “Angels in America” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2014, which was incredible, and then “A View From the Bridge” and “The Crucible.” We’ve wanted to do something together for years. It could take many forms: certainly an opera or a musical. Today, when I came to the photo shoot, it was in the basement of a church. And I said, “What is this, an A.A. meeting?” Then it dawned on me that this is where you’re rehearsing “Network.” I had the same thing with my last opera: I think it was an old cigar factory — a very sacred aura, but also unglamorous and badly lit. So, when are you getting out of that room? IVO VAN HOVE: In a week’s time. I’m happy. But making theater, when you’re the director, you have to constantly be the leader; a lot of people have to embrace your ideas. Rufus, you’re much more the god of your creation. Are you disciplined? RW: My mother loved to drink and enjoy life, but when it came to music, she was incredibly exacting, and there was always a need for quality and trueness, and that really translated when I started making my early records. I worked with producers who tried to fight that a little bit, and I wound up usually winning. I’m just at the early stages of my theatrical career, though I’m probably only going to write three operas. Everybody’s been telling me incessantly, “Come on, Rufus, you have to write a musical.” I’m continuing my education. T: Ivo mainly adapts the work of others. Rufus, you did a New York show in 2006 that reproduced Judy Garland’s landmark 1961 concert, “Judy at Carnegie Hall.” You both wear your influences on your sleeves. RW: Well, I didn’t reproduce every moment. I did that show recently again because it was the 10th anniversary, and whereas the first time I very much related to her — I was newly sober and still tied to this bright-eyed romanticism — this time, I started singing and I realized, “Oh my God, I feel like Frank Sinatra.” Tougher, more experienced, more masculine swagger. I am an older man and more of a survivor, less of this victim character that Judy was. IVH: I live from inspiration by other artists and authors. Shakespeare did not write one original story. I think you can only make something new if you know very well where you’re coming from. There are only a few geniuses in the world. Even Einstein, he found this fantastic thing, but not out of the blue. History builds up to that moment. RW: I think there’s a terrible problem with young artists today who really aren’t concerned about educating themselves enough about culture and reading great books and knowing great films — and really just caring about success and what they’re going to look like on Instagram. People like Kanye West who think that they know everything and they know absolutely nothing. David Bowie was probably the best example of someone who did his homework. One of my jobs is to maintain respect for the bastions of culture. IVH: I worked with Bowie on “Lazarus” [the van Hove-directed musical that opened in 2015, just before Bowie died]. But in my youth, he was defining because of the shows he did — like “Station to Station” (1976). It started with [Luis Buñuel’s 1929 Surrealist film] “Un Chien Andalou,” with the eye being cut. Bowie didn’t come on for many minutes; there was only white light. It was, for me, enormous: If this is possible, that’s my world. But Rufus, your songs, like “Dinner at Eight” (2003), are inspired directly from your life; I like the filter of somebody else’s text to talk about my life so I’m not visible. That, for me, is the difference. Your new song, “Sword of Damocles,” how did it start? RW: It started when I was hanging out with Carrie Fisher not long before her death. We’d had a very interesting few nights together in Hollywood, and there was this moment where she was on the phone with her attorney, screaming, “It’s like this sword of Damocles is over my head!” And I thought, “Oh, that’s strong.” It was also before the [2016 American presidential] election, so I think everybody had this foreboding, sickening fear. Something was going to fall. [The lyrics from “Sword of Damocles” include “Raise kindness / Above all else / Avoid the books of / Hatred behind the shelves.”] IVH: It became a metaphor for you personally? RW: Personally and for everything. And then the election happened. I also had some stuff I had to deal with — especially moving back to Los Angeles and becoming a father. [In 2011, Wainwright had a girl with Lorca Cohen, Leonard Cohen’s daughter; the child is co-raised by her biological parents and Weisbrodt.] And also, Carrie died. It wasn’t like, “Oh, I’m going to write this song about Donald Trump.” It was just: We all are in trouble. I was very adamant to release it before the midterms. I know it’s a cliché to say that in these dark times that’s when the theater flourishes, but I do hope it does. I’m looking at the story of Harvey Milk as a possible idea for a musical. IVH: I consider what I’m doing now, “Network,” very political. With “The Damned” [based on Luchino Visconti’s 1969 film about Nazi-era German aristocrats] in 2016, I avoided doing something [overt] about Hitler. It becomes a terrible cliché on stage, which is totally not dangerous anymore. There was a “Heil Hitler” in it, and I said to my sound designer that I wanted it to be the “Heil Hitler” you really are afraid of, where you get goose bumps. “The Crucible” (2016) was very political in that way. It was in the middle of the Republican debates, when Trump at the beginning was on the sidelines and came closer to the middle, and every candidate, even the most polite and civilized ones, started to scapegoat the other. “The Crucible” is full of people scapegoating each other. RW: I feel that Trump is like nothing the world has ever known. He’s a new sort of beast that we have to contend with as artists. IVH: Going back, Rufus, to how you were raised to become a musician. My father was a pharmacist. I was the oldest son, so I was also raised to take that over. I was trying to escape every second of my life in that world, that Belgian village. But he did these things that nobody does anymore: the powders. He had scales weighing out milligrams. I respected that a lot, that he could make something that was so delicate. RW: And you are a kind of pharmacist! There’s probably a lot you learned. My father and I have definitely been through the wars together. We’re in a good place right now. I’m not saying my father’s like Trump — there’s not an inkling of that — but I do feel like with that generation, they had everything. He suffered from depression, and I think in a lot of ways all of that expectation and opportunity was a curse. Whereas what happened to me was, when I hit puberty, AIDS was everywhere. It was certainly traumatic and difficult, but it gave me a sense of perspective: Life is short, enjoy things while you can. Ultimately, I was enriched by that catastrophe. IVH: I knew when I was 11 that I was gay. My luck was that I was in a boarding school. I lived one whole life in those six years. Jan [Versweyveld, van Hove’s partner and scenographer], whom I met when we were 20 — we were not welcome at my home together. What I did then, and I’m very proud of myself now, was hold my horses. I left my parents alone and I lived my life. Slowly, we grew nearer to each other; Jan was sitting at my father’s deathbed before I was there. You know, I’m not a full-time homosexual. I have a lot of other interests. But now that I’m older, I feel more and more responsibility. RW: I was about 11 or 12 and I started to have these dalliances. I’d sneak out of the house, and my mother found a magazine and was horrified and kicked me out. And what my father did at that point, and I’m very much indebted to him, is he then insisted that I go to boarding school. IVH: It’s a paradise! RW: It was the best move I ever made. I needed to get away from my parents, I needed to be in a safe environment, I needed to have other people really invest in me for who I was and not for who I was supposed to be. So I think that kids should be taken away from their parents! T: Rufus, you’re about to go on tour for the 20th anniversary of your first two albums (1998’s “Rufus Wainwright” and 2001’s “Poses”). Ivo’s also had a varied yet stable career. How have you both changed as artists? RW: I have adopted a Hindu kind of belief system in the sense that I don’t believe in the linear anymore. For me, it’s more like a tree, where that’s a branch and that’s a branch and they still exist. I’ve always believed that those two albums are two other Rufuses that are still there, that still haunt me, that I have to temper and also embrace. IVH: I totally connect to that. When we were making “The Damned,” Jan was saying, “Ivo, it feels as if we’re making ‘Rumors’ again” — our first production in 1981 [in Antwerp, about a young, increasingly schizophrenic man]. That roughness, and also that audacity. As I said, I’m not a full-time homosexual. I have much more to say. I am also the son of a pharmacist, and I am also the general manager of my company. I have much more, and everyone has much more than one identity. You don’t have to be Hindu to know that deeply. Perhaps artists are more aware of it.

2018,"Run a Marathon. Then, Quickly, Another. ","A growing number of runners have decided to take their marathoning to the next level by running multiple marathons within a short period of time. Marathon runners can be compulsive beasts by nature. So it should be no surprise that a rising number of runners have decided to take their marathoning to the next level. Not by running ultra marathons, races that exceed the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon, but by running multiple marathons within a short period of time. I should know. I’m one of them. This year I decided to dip my toe into the world of multiple marathoning by doing what I soon learned was a “classic double” — running two marathons back to back: the Chicago Marathon on Oct. 6 and the New York City Marathon on Nov. 4. To be clear, many marathon organizers, including those in Chicago and New York, do not encourage it. Run our marathons, they say, but if you want to do more? Well, be careful. My sister, an accomplished running coach, rolled her eyes when I told her my plans. “You’re an idiot,” she said. Siblings. Dr. Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, remembers trying to talk one of his patients out of running multiple marathons four or five years ago. “I didn’t even know what ‘doubling’ was. I thought it was crazy,” he said. “But he did it, and he was fine.” In his practice, he’s since seen an uptick in the number of runners attempting more than one marathon a season, which has led him to reconsider his views. “I used to say as a blanket statement that it was a terrible idea,” Dr. Metzl said. “Now I say most people can’t do it. But, some can.” Hal Higdon, a prominent online coach who offers various levels of training programs ranging from 5 kilometer races to marathons, added a multiple marathon plan to his site more than 10 years ago, when he recognized the “new demand.” “People like Thom Gilligan of Marathon Tours were promoting insane activities like seven marathons on seven continents and 50 marathons in 50 states, and I thought it might be fun to support those hearing that call,” Mr. Higdon said. He notes that demand for his multiple training plans has only increased, growing 34 percent from 2016 to 2017, then another 26 percent in 2018 so far, though far more people stick with his marathon and half-marathon plans. Mr. Higdon calls multiple marathons “acts of insanity,” but that hasn’t stopped him from following the call. Now 87, he ran six marathons in six weeks to celebrate his 60th birthday, then seven marathons in seven months to celebrate his 70th. In 2003, Chris Warren, Steven Yee and Tony Phillippi founded a club called the Marathon Maniacs, a competition to see who could run the most marathons in a set period of time. At the time, “running more than one or two marathons a year made you seem insane,” said Mr. Warren, who estimates he has run some “250-ish” marathons. “We wanted to break out of that mold. We were happy to have 10 members.” Today, Marathon Maniacs has more than 14,000 members, all of whom must qualify for membership by running a minimum of two marathons within 16 days or three marathons within 90 days. A few hundred people have reached the top-tier level, which requires completing at least 52 marathons within 365 days. Race organizers have likewise responded to the growing demand. Chuck Savage founded a series called the Savage Seven in 2010, challenging runners to run seven marathons back to back over the course of a week. Why? “To fill the void between Christmas and New Year’s,” said the race director, JC Santa Teresa. Obviously. In 2012, Mr. Savage started the New England Challenge, in which runners race six marathons in six days in six states. Similar challenges now exist across the United States, including Boston 2 Big Sur, two marathons in two weeks on opposite coasts, and the Mitten Challenge, back-to-back marathons in Wisconsin and Michigan. Part of the boom may be thanks to the rise of apps like Strava that let users see the training logs and stats of fellow athletes. “The beauty of social media is you find people who are just as crazy as you,” said Andrew Simmons, the head coach of Lifelong Endurance. “There’s an inherent competitiveness as humans to see what we’re capable of.” Coaches and fellow multi-marathoners generally offer the same advice for those considering multiple marathons. Rest and recovery between races is critical. And doing more than one marathon at full effort is probably not the best idea, nor completely feasible. Indeed, most people doing multiple marathons treat some as races and some as “fully supported long runs,” Mr. Warren said. “Most people are resigned to whatever happens, happens, for the second marathon,” Mr. Simmons said. “It’s a good learning experience for runners.” If running more than one marathon taught me one thing, it’s humility. The battle faced over 26.2 miles is an exhausting one, and continuing at a set pace requires overcoming the mind and body’s internal signals to stop. In Chicago, I faced stomach cramps for 18 miles but managed to hang on for a six-minute personal best. In New York, I was having too much fun and my mind was wandering, so when I got to mile 21 and my legs started screaming with lactic acid, the mental battle was a half-fought one. I was mentally and physically spent, and close to vomiting. Nevertheless I managed to cross the finish line, though six minutes slower than in Chicago. Perhaps that’s what running multiple marathons is all about. For many distance runners, the marathon used to be where you learned the most about yourself and your own limits. But the more races you enter and the longer distances you cover, the more you realize those preconceived limits may not really exist. If the 1970s were one running boom, Mr. Simmons suggested that at least for a select few, this may be another. “How many marathons can someone do?” he asked. “We’re in this really cool moment where we’re trying to figure out what our bodies can do.”",The New York Times
2018,Runners Practiced in Sports Bras. Rowan University Told Them to Go Elsewhere.,"It was 69 degrees when the Rowan cross-country teams arrived for practice at the Glassboro, N.J., university’s track on Oct. 30. During the workout, several of the male runners removed their shirts. Some members of the women’s team did the same, continuing the session in sports bras. On the field inside the track, the university’s football team was holding its own daily practice. There had been tensions between the teams for years, said Gina Capone, a student and a former Rowan cross-country runner. “The football coach had a problem with the women running on the track,” Capone said. “He said that it was distracting.” The issue boiled over that day, after a football coach approached the cross-country coach, Derick Adamson, to restate his concerns. Then in a private meeting three days later, according to a university spokesman, Rowan’s athletic department informed Adamson that the men’s and women’s cross-country teams would now hold their practices across the street from campus, on the track at Glassboro High School. To the female cross-country runners, who had sat silently outside the Nov. 2 meeting, the decision was infuriating but not surprising. “We were angry, but we knew it was coming; the football team gets what they want,” one senior member of the women’s cross-country and track teams said. The runner requested anonymity, fearing repercussions for herself and her teams, which share several members and often train together. The prioritization of football teams over other sports is not uncommon at N.C.A.A. institutions, and members of the cross-country team at Rowan, where athletes compete in the N.C.A.A.’s Division III, say their university is no exception. The runner who requested anonymity and several other team members said that they did not have locker rooms near the track where they train and that they sometimes had to provide their own transportation to meets. Rowan’s football coach, Jay Accorsi, did not respond to requests for comment, and the athletic department staff referred questions about the practice arrangement to the university’s communications department. An official there disputed the notion that the runners had been forced away from the track, saying the athletic department was merely enforcing a longstanding policy that only one team can use a facility at a time. According to Joe Cardona, the vice president for university relations at Rowan, that means the football team gets the field — and by extension the track that surrounds it inside Rowan’s stadium — when it holds practice. Cardona said the cross-country and track teams had declined an offer to use the track at a different time of the day. “In the fall,” he said, “the track and field folks don’t want to wait until after football practice in order to have their practice on the track.” Capone, the former Rowan runner, said the frustration her ex-teammates were feeling had prompted her to publish an article about the dispute Thursday on the self-publication platform Odyssey. In it, she quoted a current team member who said the issue was not one of scheduling, but of football coaches who did not want their players distracted by women training in sports bras nearby. “As girls, we could look at the football team and say that their tight pants showing off everything is asking for it, but we don’t,” Capone wrote, quoting a current member of the cross-country team. “When we are on the track, we are doing a hard workout that requires all our focus, so we aren’t looking at them and what they are doing. “If they are distracted by us, then their practices clearly don’t require their full attention, or they just aren’t as committed to the sport.” Adamson, the cross-country coach, did not respond to a request for comment Friday. But as Capone’s article drew attention to this dispute, Rowan distributed multiple statements related to the controversy through its social media channels, including one regarding the one-team-per-facility practice policy and another, signed by the university’s president, Ali A. Houshmand, in which he responded to Capone’s article directly, saying it raised “questions about the possibility of an inequitable protocol for women’s athletic apparel.” “Rowan’s Athletic Department has had a longstanding verbal protocol that all athletes must wear shirts, even during practices,” Houshmand’s statement said. “Having practiced all season in ‘sports bra’ tops,” he added, “many interpreted this as a new policy.” To be clear: Sports bras are perhaps one of the more important athletic inventions in the history of women’s sports. The first one was created in 1977, when three women sewed two jockstraps together to create a prototype. (They were granted a patent two years later.) In the years since, sports bras have been integral parts of some of the most memorable events in sports: Brandi Chastain tore off her shirt to reveal one after scoring the winning goal in the 1999 World Cup finals; Paula Radcliffe ran in one when she set a world record in the marathon in 2003; and Kerri Walsh Jennings played in them for more than a decade, winning three Olympic gold medals and becoming one of the most celebrated beach volleyball players in the world. Houshmand’s statement said confusion on whether sports bras were appropriate practice attire at Rowan would be codified in a new written policy that would explicitly allow female athletes to wear sports-bra tops without shirts during practice. “In the new formal policy, there will be no restriction of sports bras without shirts as practice apparel,” Houshmand said. Hannah Vendetta, a second-year transfer student and cross-country runner at Rowan, said she appreciated the statement, which was posted online less than 24 hours after Capone’s article was published. “But there’s still an issue at hand,” Vendetta said, “and it’s the fact that we aren’t able to practice on the track.”",The New York Times
2018,Rural America’s Own Private Flint: Polluted Water Too Dangerous to Drink,"ARMENIA, Wis. — The groundwater that once ran cool and clean from taps in this Midwestern farming town is now laced with contaminants and fear. People refuse to drink it. They won’t brush their teeth with it. They dread taking showers. Rural communities call it their own, private Flint — a diffuse, creeping water crisis tied to industrial farms and slack regulations that for years has tainted thousands of residential wells across the Midwest and beyond. Now, fears and frustration over water quality and contamination have become a potent election-year issue, burbling up in races from the fissured bedrock here in Wisconsin to chemical-tainted wells in New Hampshire to dwindling water reserves in Arizona. President Trump’s actions to loosen clean water rules have intensified a battle over regulations and environmental protections unfolding on the most intensely local level: in people’s own kitchen faucets. In Wisconsin and other Midwestern states where Republicans run the government, environmental groups say that politicians have cut budgets for environmental enforcement and inspections and weakened pollution rules. In Iowa, for example, the Republican-led Legislature dismissed a package of bills that would have blocked any new large-scale hog operations until the state cleaned up its nitrogen-laden rivers and streams. “The regulations favor agriculture,” said Gordon Gottbeheut, 77, whose nitrate-contaminated well near Armenia, Wis., sits next to a field that is injected with manure. “When they keep cutting enforcement and people, there’s nobody to keep track of what’s happening.” There are no precise water-quality surveys of the galaxy of private wells that serve 43 million people in the United States, but sampling by the United States Geological Survey has found contamination in about one of every five wells. Few water-quality rules regulate those wells, meaning there is no water company to call, no backup system to turn to, and often no simple way to cure the contamination. In Flint, lead-tainted water prompted a public health emergency that led to a criminal investigation. Homeowners say they are forced to choose between installing expensive filtration systems, spending thousands to dig deeper wells, ignoring the problem or moving. In Wisconsin, a state report recently found that as many as 42,000 of the state’s 676,000 private wells, or 6 percent, were likely to exceed the federal health standards for nitrates, which can come from fertilizer use and manure spreading. Nitrates have been linked to a dangerous blood condition in babies and may increase cancer risks in adults. One of those wells belongs to Carol Mount and Clark Elmore, whose home sits atop the sandy, permeable soil just down the road from a 3,000-cow dairy in the Armenia area. This spring, the nitrate levels in their well tested at 45 parts per million. The federal health limit is 10 parts. “Our water is screwed,” Ms. Mount said. Forty percent of her neighbors whose wells were tested this year also exceeded the federal standards for nitrates. MINN. MICH. 35 WISCONSIN Minneapolis 39 Green Bay 94 Armenia La Crosse 43 Madison Milwaukee IOWA Chicago ILL. 80 MILES By The New York Times Wisconsin’s water wars have raged with particular ferocity. Conservation groups say Gov. Scott Walker’s administration has diluted environmental oversight to drive a pro-business agenda. A 2016 legislative report found that the state agency responsible for big livestock operations only issued violations in 6 percent of the cases in which its own pollution rules had been broken. But now, as Mr. Walker runs for a third term, his Democratic challenger, Tony Evers, has turned polluted wetlands and unsafe water into campaign slogans. In Lodi, north of the state capital, Ann Groves Lloyd is campaigning for the State Assembly with a tongue-in-cheek ad in which she tries to water her cows with plastic bottles and irrigate her fields with a water cooler strapped to a John Deere tractor. Some voters who say they cannot drink from the taps or water their livestock without worrying about nitrates or E. coli bacteria say the state’s deregulatory spree has gone too far. “I blame the government,” Jose Rangel said one afternoon as he sat in the living room of his trailer home, reviewing a letter confirming that his 27-foot-deep well had tested at double the federal safety limits for nitrates. “We can’t do nothing about it. I’ll vote. I want clean water.” The fight is echoing in state legislative races in New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and Michigan, where candidates have put river contamination and chemical spills at the center of their campaigns. “They’re hearing more about water than Donald Trump,” said Daniel Squadron, executive director of Future Now, a group that supports liberal causes in statehouse races. The Walker administration has defended its environmental record, pointing to new restrictions on manure spreading in eastern Wisconsin, where contaminants can seep through the thin soil and into the cracked bedrock that supplies people’s water. “The governor is committed to working to ensure that all families in Wisconsin are safe, and will continue to work with those who can help us achieve our shared goals,” Austin Altenburg, a spokesman for Mr. Walker’s campaign, said in an email. Jim Dick, a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources, said its inspections of major livestock operations were higher than federal goals set by the Environmental Protection Agency for the past two years. Agriculture and dairy groups say that farmers drink the same water and also want it to be clean, and are trying to live up to state and federal environmental rules at a moment when low crop prices and President Trump’s trade policies have rattled farmers across the country. In corners of Wisconsin, for example, farmers have set up state-supported nonprofits focused on improving water, air and soil health. But Kriss Marion, an organic farmer campaigning for State Senate through southern Wisconsin, said the state’s wetlands, streams and groundwater were being stripped of protections as industrial farms were allowed to grow larger and larger. She said staff levels at the Department of Natural Resources had been “gutted” under Mr. Walker. “That’s why I am running,” she said. “This is the fight of the decade.” The Republican incumbent in her district, Howard Marklein, supported a $3 billion incentive package championed by Mr. Walker to draw a huge new electronics factory to Wisconsin that also allowed the factory to bypass environmental and water rules. He has been endorsed by trade groups representing dairy, pork, cattle, potato and corn farmers. Water utilities that serve poor, rural areas fall far short of federal standards for drinking water, compared with urban water systems. “If it’s your own private well, it’s your own private problem,” said Maureen Muldoon, a groundwater researcher and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. In Armenia, it is now everyone’s problem. Wells contaminated by bacteria or hazardous microorganisms can be blasted with chlorine and other disinfectants. But there is no easy fix for nitrates. The Armenia Growers Coalition, a group that represents three big farms in the area, including the 3,000-cow Central Sands Dairy, is delivering bottled water to people and has offered to pay for water-treatment systems. The group said it was working with homeowners, and blamed the contamination on “farming practices from decades ago.” The owners of the Central Sands Dairy declined to comment beyond sending a statement through the Growers Coalition. For some, the water problems have tarnished the natural allure of an out-of-the way town whose nonfarm economy consists of two bars, one of them a strip club. Away from the noise and smell of the thousands of cows, houses are tucked into the red pines and pinned to the banks above the Wisconsin River. “It’s so sad,” said Ms. Mount, whose well tested at four times the safety limits for nitrates. “It’s so beautiful here.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Russia Attacks Ukrainian Ships and International Law,"A provocation that could tighten Russia’s illegal hold on Crimea. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Russia’s attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea was a violation of international law and a dangerous escalation of the undeclared war the Kremlin has waged for more than four years against Ukraine in Crimea, in the breakaway provinces of eastern Ukraine, and now at sea. The Kremlin can shout all it wants about a provocation, about an attempt by the Ukrainian president to create a political diversion or about anything else, but none of that changes the fact that Russia had no legal justification for firing on three Ukrainian boats and seizing them. The vessels, two small armored boats and a tugboat, were headed for the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from Russia and is the only entrance to the Sea of Azov, where much of Ukraine’s coastline lies. Russia claimed they had crossed into Russian waters, but that is based on its illegal claim to Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Ukraine and most every other state in the world still regard Crimea and its coastal waters as Ukrainian territory. And under a treaty ratified by Ukraine and Russia in 2004 — a now hard-to-imagine time when they could still refer to each other as “historically brotherly nations” — the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait were defined as shared territorial waters. That treaty, signed by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, is still in force. Yet ever since Mr. Putin opened a new bridge over the Kerch Strait in May, Russia has moved steadily to impose its control over the strait and the Azov Sea. The Kremlin has moved several gunboats into the shallow sea and has begun stopping and inspecting cargo vessels headed for the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, creating long delays and causing large losses to shipping companies and the ports. Whatever reasons Ukraine might have had for sending three boats toward the strait, it was within its rights. Russia’s reaction — to ram the tugboat after an expletive-rich chase caught on video; to open fire on the boats and seize them, wounding several sailors and taking 23 captive; to scramble fighter jets and block passage under the Crimea Bridge with a freighter — was dangerous, arrogant, illegal aggression. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, declared at a Security Council meeting that Russia’s actions were an “outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory.” NATO, the European Union and European leaders all joined in denouncing Russia. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, said Secretary of State Pompeo told him that Ukraine could expect “full assistance, including military assistance” to protect Ukrainian sovereignty. In this chorus of condemnation, however, President Trump’s voice was muted, though Ambassador Haley indicated she was speaking also for him. “We do not like what’s happening either way,” Mr. Trump said on his way to a political rally in Mississippi. “We don’t like what’s happening, and hopefully it’ll get straightened out.” He added: “I know Europe is not, they are not thrilled. They’re working on it, too. We’re all working on it together.” The clash at sea had the unfortunate consequences of further muddling Ukraine’s already messy politics. Hours after the ships were seized, Mr. Poroshenko called a meeting of his security chiefs and declared martial law in southern and eastern provinces, which the Ukrainian Parliament approved, limited to 30 days. The prospect of martial law had raised considerable concerns, since it gives the government greater powers while restricting public gatherings, the media, free movement and other civil liberties. By limiting the period to one month, Mr. Poroshenko lifted the greatest worry, that he would postpone national elections in March, which he is almost certain to lose. But the notion of imposing controls on selective regions was more likely to exacerbate regional frictions while not doing much for Ukrainian defenses. It’s important that Mr. Poroshenko and his Western supporters ensure that the clampdown is not used to harass citizens who speak Russian and who are clustered in the affected regions, or give the impression that he is using the crisis for political advantage. Political turmoil is not a victory that Russia should be allowed to claim. Above all, Russia cannot be allowed to get away with this continued bullying of Ukraine. By steadily tightening its hold on Crimea, it is gambling that the West will not have the stomach or stamina to impose ever more punishment or provide more military support for Ukraine. But a direct attack on Ukrainian ships cannot go unpunished. Strong condemnations will not do. The United States and its Western allies can impose stronger economic sanctions, bar their ships from entering Russian ports in the Black or Azov Seas or increase military support for Ukraine. These actions all carry risk, but so does doing nothing. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,"Russia Locked Him Up. But He’s Directing an Opera 1,400 Miles Away.","ZURICH — “We have a message from Kirill!” On a recent Tuesday evening in one of the Zurich Opera’s rehearsal studios, the choreographer Evgeny Kulagin called out, and a dozen singers and backstage technicians came running. They bounded in to watch the latest video sent by their director, Kirill Serebrennikov, a man few of them have ever met. Mr. Serebrennikov, one of Russia’s leading stage and film directors, has been under house arrest in Moscow since August 2017 awaiting trial on corruption charges that are widely considered to be trumped up, a punishment for provocative work that stoked the ire of Russia’s ruling elite. He is accused of embezzling 133 million rubles, or about $2.3 million, in government funds allocated to a festival he ran. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Despite his imprisonment, made even more challenging by Russia’s opaque and sometimes arbitrary judicial system, Mr. Serebrennikov is directing a production of Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte” that is to open here Sunday. Through a relay process that can seem closer to international espionage than traditional theater-making — involving files swapped on USB sticks, a lawyer acting as a courier, and extraordinary patience — the Zurich Opera has found a way for the director to retain artistic control from captivity, 1,400 miles away. In the company’s offsite rehearsal space that recent Tuesday, a semicircle of chairs was arranged around an iPad hooked up to a sound system. The members of the cast and crew took their seats as Mr. Kulagin, who has worked extensively with Mr. Serebrennikov and is credited as the production’s co-director, pressed play on the tablet. A pixelated image of Mr. Serebrennikov, wearing a black T-shirt, a trim beard and black-rimmed glasses, came to life on the small screen. In the 40 minutes that followed, the director made observations both practical and philosophical, switching fluidly between Russian and English. “If your body says nothing, then your body kills your voice,” he instructed singers he’d never seen or heard in person. “The audience needs to understand everything they see onstage without needing to read the titles.” “Don’t lose the chance to show with what feeling you leave the stage,” he added, about an exit he was dissatisfied with. “Don’t be in a hurry.” Directing opera is complex even under normal circumstances, and those of this “Così” are far more cloak-and-dagger. Using an online server, Mr. Kulagin sends a video file of each rehearsal to Dmitri Kharitonov, Mr. Serebrennikov’s lawyer in Moscow and one of the few people allowed direct contact with him. Mr. Kharitonov then copies the file to a USB stick and delivers it to Mr. Serebrennikov, who watches it and films his response. (Mr. Serebrennikov is barred from using the internet but is allowed to have a computer.) Mr. Kharitonov returns later to retrieve the USB stick with the video message, uploads it and sends it to Mr. Kulagin in Zurich. “Kirill jokes I am his directorial assistant, but I am just the mail — although it is not mail,” Mr. Kharitonov said, emphasizing the point because mail is barred under the conditions of the house arrest. “Kirill lived with the hope every month that it would all be solved and he could go to Zurich and work on this opera,” he said. “Unfortunately this did not end.” Despite what the lawyer described as the “trauma” of not being able to participate in person, the work helped Mr. Serebrennikov “to endure these difficult months,” Mr. Kharitonov said. He said he’d lost track of how many times he delivered flash drives to Mr. Serebrennikov, estimating it has been several times a week since rehearsals began on Sept. 20. “This is a complicated production,” said Beate Breidenbach, the dramaturge for “Così,” “and it would have been even without the whole backstage drama.” Mozart’s 1790 work is opera’s most famous instance of partner swapping. Under the guidance of a cynical philosopher, two young men test their girlfriends’ fidelity. The two women, coached by a worldly maid, overcome their moral scruples and ultimately betray their fiancés. The Zurich production is contemporary-dress, with a two-level set that includes a weight room and yoga studio; the protagonists get chat notifications and take selfies. As Mr. Serebrennikov’s lengthy video message played, Rebeca Olvera, the soprano playing Despina, the maid, and Frédéric Antoun, the tenor singing one of the lovers, occasionally talked back to the screen in exasperation. Mr. Kulagin and Markus Wyler, a translator, often pressed pause to elaborate or explain. Michael Nagy, the baritone singing Don Alfonso, the philosopher, jotted notes. “Sorry I took up so much time,” said Mr. Serebrennikov, signing off. “But we needed to go through the entire second act.” Mr. Serebrennikov was contracted for “Così” after Andreas Homoki, the Zurich Opera’s artistic director, saw and admired his 2016 production of Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville” at the Komische Oper in Berlin. In May 2017, Mr. Serebrennikov, who also designs his sets and costumes, came to Zurich to present his concept for the Mozart work. A few months later, he was placed under house arrest, but the company stuck with his vision. “We chose this unusual path in order to support an artist in trouble,” Mr. Homoki said. It would be a stretch to call Mr. Serebrennikov a dissident artist, but his plays and films have touched on sensitive topics in Russian society, including anti-Semitism, religious fanaticism and sexism. But he has emphatically demonstrated that he will not be silenced. Over the course of his confinement, Mr. Serebrennikov has been unusually prolific: In the past 14 months, he directed a ballet about Rudolf Nureyev for the Bolshoi in Moscow, and a film, “Summer,” about rock ’n’ roll in the Soviet Union, that had its premiere in competition at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The Gogol Center, the avant-garde theater Mr. Serebrennikov leads, has also forged ahead. The evening after Mr. Serebrennikov’s recent message arrived, Mr. Kulagin presided over an orchestra rehearsal in the opera house’s auditorium with the zeal of a ringmaster, leaping onstage to correct a singer’s gesture and help move props. When the music stopped, the cast and crew talked in a babble of languages: English, Russian, German and Swiss-German. “It’s an extraordinary situation for us all,” said Cornelius Meister, the conductor. “But we all know that we have the opportunity to be part of something that people will talk about for years to come.” Whether Mr. Serebrennikov will be able to work in a more traditional fashion is now in the hands of a Moscow court. He is set to stand trial starting Nov. 7. For the time being, Mr. Kulagin said, invitations for future work keep pouring in. “He’s writing scenarios and doing sketches of models and sets,” he said. “But the most important thing right now is for him to be free.”",The New York Times
2018,Russia Set to Resume Astronaut Trips to the International Space Station,"The announcement signals that the Soyuz spacecraft has been deemed safe for crewed travel following two astronauts’ harrowing emergency return to Earth in October. The Russian space agency announced on Thursday that it was planning to launch three astronauts to the International Space Station on Dec. 3., signaling that it believes the country’s Soyuz spacecraft is safe for travel after an in-flight failure last month. The Soyuz is the only way for people to get to the space station. In October, two astronauts made a harrowing but safe emergency return after the Soyuz they were riding in suddenly lost control. Thursday’s announcement also heads off a situation that could have left the space station with no crew aboard as early as January. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Roscosmos, the Russian agency, said an investigation has figured out what went wrong during the October failure. A bent pin, part of the system that senses when the four side boosters fall away from the Soyuz’s central core, prevented one of the side boosters from falling away cleanly. The nose of the side booster then hit the central core. “It resulted in its decompression and, as consequence, the space rocket lost its attitude control,” the investigation committee reported. The report said the damage to the pin occurred when the side boosters were attached to the rocket at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the launch site. The emergency escape system was able propel the capsule with the astronauts away from the damaged rocket. A successful launch next month would avert a sequence of events that could have forced the space station to operate from the ground without any astronauts aboard early next year. Soyuz capsules are supposed to remain in orbit only about seven months. The one capsule docked now — which is the ride home for the three astronauts currently on the station — has been there since June. Although the station is well stocked, the seven-month limitation means the current crew would likely have to leave in early January. The Soyuz currently docked was also at the center of an earlier incident in August when a leak was discovered in the capsule. The still unexplained hole appeared to have been deliberately drilled, leading to wild speculation in Russian media that NASA astronauts committed sabotage. That investigation is continuing. The astronauts for the December launch are Oleg Kononenko of Russia, Anne McClain of NASA and David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency. Roscosmos also scheduled the launch of a crewless cargo ship, which uses an almost identical Soyuz rocket, for Nov. 16.",The New York Times
2018,Russia-Ukraine Fight Over Narrow Sea Passage Risks Wider War,"MOSCOW — Ukraine’s president put his nation on a war footing with Russia on Monday, as tensions over a shared waterway escalated into a crisis that dragged in NATO and the United Nations. Russia’s seizure a day earlier of three small Ukrainian naval vessels and 23 sailors — including at least three wounded in a shooting by the Russian side — was the first overt armed conflict between the two sides since the beginning days of the conflict in 2014, when Russian special forces occupied Crimea. The opening of an additional front at sea, even if Ukraine lacks a real navy, introduced an unstable element into what had been a shadowy war. The conflict pitting Ukrainian soldiers against Russian-backed separatists in the breakaway Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, has sputtered along for almost five years with more than 10,000 people killed. The Kremlin, along with some Ukrainian opposition figures, called the martial drumbeats echoing from Kiev a domestic political ploy by its embattled president, Petro O. Poroshenko. They accused him of fearmongering in order to delay or at least reconfigure the March 31 election that he had seemed certain to lose. Mr. Poroshenko delivered a speech to Ukraine’s Parliament asking it to approve the declaration of martial law starting on Wednesday, with the military already on full alert. The attack on the naval vessels near the shared waterway, the Kerch Strait, represented a new stage of aggression in what he called Russia’s “hybrid war” against Ukraine. “This is a bold and frank participation of the regular units of the Russian Federation, their demonstrative attack on the detachment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Mr. Poroshenko said. “This is a qualitatively different situation, a qualitatively different threat.” Members of 450-member Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament, who were present voted overwhelmingly to support the measure — 276 to 30 — after the president agreed to dilute its scope. Ukraine also received a boost from the international reaction, underscoring both the isolation of Russia from the West over the Ukraine conflict, and the desire to protect the international maritime convention that allows for unimpeded shipping through any strait. “What you saw yesterday was very serious, because you saw actually that Russia used military force in an open way,” said NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, during a news conference in Brussels following a meeting requested by Ukraine. “This is escalating the situation in the region and confirms a pattern of behavior which we have seen over several years.” NATO was increasing its military presence in the area, he said, calling on Russia to allow freedom of navigation for Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait. At the United Nations, Russia called a session of the Security Council in an attempt to force a discussion about what it called Ukrainian violations of Russian territorial waters. But Western nations quickly turned the session into a long criticism of Russia for its actions against Ukraine since 2014. “Impeding Ukraine’s lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept,” Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States told the council. “As President Trump said many times, the United States would welcome a normal relationship with Russia, but outlaw actions like this one continue to make that impossible,” she said. Mr. Trump offered his own criticism — without specifically blaming Russia — when asked by reporters in Washington about the naval confrontation. “Not good. We’re not happy about it at all,” he said. “We do not like what’s happening either way.” Various European capitals also criticized Russia, calling for it to release the seized vessels and their crews. There were scattered calls for new sanctions against Russia. The Russians seemed to try to tamp down the confrontation, moving an old cargo vessel anchored to block passage through the Kerch Strait, and allowing commercial traffic to resume. The Kremlin remained largely silent for much of the day. It was left to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov to address the issue, and his ministry accused Ukraine of creating threats to normal shipping traffic in the strait by violating international maritime law, and trying to foment a crisis for domestic political purposes. Russian political analysts suggested that the Kremlin had no need to ratchet up its confrontation with Ukraine — it had already achieved what it wanted by destabilizing the country through support for the separatists. While President Vladimir V. Putin’s flagging domestic support may benefit from a fight with Ukraine, that would be outweighed by the risk of greater Western sanctions. “I do not see any benefits for the Kremlin from this confrontation,” said Nikolai Petrov, an analyst and professor of political science. Asked about events during his daily briefing, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, framed the Russian actions against the Ukrainian boats as an interception, not an attack. “The question here is of incursion into the territorial waters of the Russian Federation by foreign military vessels,” Mr. Peskov said. “They entered the territorial waters of Russia without responding to any queries from our border guards, in no way responded to offers to make use of pilotage service, and so on and so forth.” The dispute over the waterway is fundamentally unresolvable because it hinges on different interpretations of who controls the territorial waters around the Crimean peninsula. Both sides tried to portray themselves as determined to protect the normal shipping that the other side was interfering with. Ukraine had previously sought and been granted permission for similar passages, according to official Russian accounts, but did not this time. But Ukraine wants to assert its continued sovereignty in areas which Russia considers its own, analysts said. Controlling passage from the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov is a key element in asserting Russia’s broader claim to Crimea. “Moscow clearly seeks to turn the Azov Sea into a Russian basin, and to use it to bring leverage to bear on Kiev,” wrote Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence services at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, on Twitter. “It wants to demonstrate its capacity to act without having to worry about external constraint.” The two sides signed an agreement in 2003 to guarantee free passage through the strait, but in recent months have been harassing each other’s ships. The port of Mariupol and a couple of others are important for the Ukrainian economy for exports of steel and grain, as well as for imports. Steven Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said that the Kremlin might be testing the level of support for Ukraine using the waterway. “They can very easily back off,” he said. “But if they sense the reaction is weak, I think that they will continue the blockade.” This year Mr. Putin inaugurated a $7.5 billion bridge across the strait, meant not least to assert its claim to Crimea with a physical link. One strategic aspect of the design shown by events on Sunday is that Russia could block the strait merely by anchoring a cargo ship in the one opening under the bridge — 185 meters wide and 35 meters high — large enough to allow the passage of ships. President Poroshenko sought to portray events as part of a larger assault by Russia. During his speech to Parliament, he waved a sheaf of papers that he said detailed Ukraine’s intelligence about Russian preparations for a ground offensive. That seemed unlikely, given the lack of any clear military objective, analysts said. There was, however, a widespread sense among opposition figures and analysts that Mr. Poroshenko aimed to put off the March election, noting that he had not called for martial law during previous points in the conflict when the fighting was far worse. Mr. Poroshenko tried to assuage that criticism by cutting the period of martial law from two months to one, so it would not interfere with the official start of the campaign season on Dec. 31. Other compromises mean that the martial law declaration will only affect the 10 provinces bordering Russia or Transnistria, a breakaway province of neighboring Moldova, also controlled by Russian-backed forces. The president also promised that martial law would not be used to curb civil liberties or to announce a general military mobilization, and that it would only be enforced in the case of new attacks. Still, the very prospect of martial law could help boost support for him as a wartime leader. Oleg Kashin, a Russian columnist and political analyst, wrote in the online publication Republic that the expansion of the shooting into the Sea of Azov seemed more like an extension of the endless skirmishing in eastern Ukraine than the start of any full-fledged war. “The Sea of Azov is the most convenient space for the most spectacular political wrestling,” he wrote, calling it a “tiny reservoir” that nobody had ever considered a real sea. He wrote that the sea belongs “only to Russia and Ukraine, and no third-party interests will be affected, even if tomorrow the entire surface of the Sea of Azov goes up in flames.”",The New York Times
2018,Russia-Ukraine Ties Sour Further as Moscow Imposes Sanctions,"MOSCOW — The bitter relations between Moscow and Kiev continued their downward spiral on Thursday, as the Russian government imposed economic sanctions against a broad cross-section of Ukraine’s political and business elite. The Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, issued a decree freezing the assets of 68 businesses and 322 individuals, with the list reading like a who’s who of the Ukrainian government. The decree specified that those sanctioned would not be able to repatriate any financial holdings in Russia to Ukraine. The decree said that the step was being taken now to “counter Ukraine’s unfriendly activities toward Russian citizens and entities,” a reference to similar sanctions that Kiev imposed on Russians earlier this summer. With economic and political relations between the countries crumbling, the impact of the sanctions was likely to be muted, analysts said. In an echo of the Nixon-era “enemies list,” the Ukrainians singled out, especially those running in next year’s elections, generally boasted about being sanctioned. President Petro O. Poroshenko, a chocolate tycoon, was not on the list, but his son Olexiy was, along with the interior minister, Arsen Avakov; the chief of the security services, Vasyl Hrytsak; the presidential contender and former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko; and the oligarch Viktor Pinchuk. Ties between Russia and Ukraine have frayed badly since Russia’s 2014 invasion and annexation of Crimea and its support for an anti-government uprising in the east. Despite those differences, however, trade had been improving, growing to $12.9 billion last year after hitting a low of $10.26 billion in 2016, the TASS news agency reported. But those numbers are far removed from the 2011 peak, when trade between the countries exceeded $50 billion, the agency said. Lately, relations have been strained by Ukraine’s effort to establish its own Orthodox Church, separate from the Russian Orthodox Church. Vadim Y. Karasyov, a political scientist who heads the Institute of Global Strategies in Kiev, said that the Russian president,Vladimir V. Putin, was under pressure from the security services at home to respond to recent Ukrainian moves. Outright hostility, however, could provoke further Western sanctions on Russia. “He still needs to demonstrate that his position on Ukraine is tough,” said Mr. Karasyov. The largest effect might be on those Ukrainians who kept their expensive dachas in Crimea, long a summer resort on the Black Sea, in hopes either that they could sell them or that the annexation would be reversed, he said. The sanctions did not target sectors critical to Moscow, noted Vladimir V. Fesenko, who heads the Penta Center in Kiev, a policy think tank, including the transit of Russian gas through Ukrainian pipelines and Russia’s supplies to Ukraine’s nuclear industry.",The New York Times
2018,"Russian Trolls Were at It Again Before Midterms, Facebook Says","SAN FRANCISCO — A Kremlin-backed group of internet trolls that meddled in the 2016 presidential election appeared to be trying to influence American voters using Facebook days ahead of the midterm elections, the social network said Tuesday night. Just hours after most of the polls had closed, Facebook said it had blocked more than 100 Facebook and Instagram accounts “due to concerns that they were linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a statement. In February, more than a dozen members of the group, also called the I.R.A., were indicted in connection with a far-reaching conspiracy to illegally influence the 2016 election through elaborate social media campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter. “This is a timely reminder that these bad actors won’t give up — and why it’s so important we work with the U.S. government and other technology companies to stay ahead,” Mr. Gleicher said. It is also a reminder that despite Facebook’s efforts to stem election meddling, the platform continues to be a battleground for mischief makers looking to spread disinformation to the widest possible audience. [Subscribe to “With Interest.” It’s a Sunday newsletter with essential business insights that’ll prep you for the week ahead.] The accounts recently removed by Facebook were identified following a tip from law enforcement agencies. It was the first time the company had publicly acknowledged acting on an influence campaign based on intelligence received from a government agency. The F.B.I. and Facebook issued statements in which they pledged to continue working to stop foreign interference in United States elections. “Americans should be aware that foreign actors — and Russia in particular — continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions,” the F.B.I. said in its statement, which was issue jointly with several other federal agencies. “The United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from Russia, China, Iran or other nations.” While Facebook linked the new influence network to the Internet Research Agency, the company stopped short of fully tying the Russian troll farm to the activity. In the statement, Mr. Gleicher said that a website that claimed to be affiliated with the group appeared to take responsibility for some of the accounts Facebook had removed. Facebook took down the accounts on Monday, a day before it provided more details. The Facebook accounts were largely communicating in French and Russian, while the Instagram accounts were aimed at an English-language audience, Mr. Gleicher said in a blog post. The company has spent the past 18 months grappling with the scope of its disinformation problem, and it has spent millions on additional resources and employees to deal with it. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has compared the effort to an “arms race” between company security teams and groups trying to spread disinformation. As far back as 2013, the Internet Research Agency has been linked to influence campaigns on social media. Based in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency served as a kind of professional online trolling network, carrying out information operations intended to sway public opinion among the groups it targets. The group, which has been linked to the Kremlin, specializes in pumping out legions of Twitter bots, YouTube videos and Facebook posts under the guise of activism, often posing as both far-right and left-wing groups. In 2014, the troll farm began targeting candidates in the United States presidential race, according to a February indictment naming 13 Russians linked to the agency. More than 126 million Americans were exposed to Russia-linked content through Facebook alone, the company said last year. The Internet Research Agency also uploaded more than 1,000 videos to YouTube and posted more than 131,000 Twitter messages. Last month, the Justice Department announced it had uncovered another attempt by Russian state-backed actors to meddle in the midterm elections. The criminal complaint charged Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, a Russian citizen, with managing a multimillion-dollar budget to “sow division and discord” in the United States ahead of Tuesday’s voting. Ms. Alekseevna’s budget allowed her to buy websites, as well as Facebook and Instagram ads aimed at spreading divisive content. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has hired 10,000 people to work on security, and created tools dedicated to spotting disinformation around major elections. Last month, it unveiled a “war room” at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, where employees would be monitoring the company’s networks for disinformation. Facebook has announced a series of actions in recent months to remove active influence campaigns by foreign states. In August, Facebook said it found an influence operation that originated in Iran and Russia. And in October, Facebook announced a second Iran-run network of Facebook and Instagram accounts that were followed by approximately one million people in the United States and Britain. An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a statement by the F.B.I. about fighting election interference. It was issued jointly with other federal agencies, not jointly with Facebook, which issued its own statement.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Russians Meddling in the Midterms? Here’s the Data,"They haven’t stopped trying to influence our elections. Indeed, they may be busier than ever. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Fox run a cybersecurity company. Since the 2016 United States presidential election, which Russian operatives influenced through a coordinated campaign of disinformation on social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to address the problem. Thousands of “sock puppet” personas with hundreds of thousands of followers have been taken down on Facebook, for example, and cannot easily be rebuilt. Twitter has reduced the risk that propaganda is spread through automated accounts, or bots. Such efforts may be helping. The consensus among researchers monitoring the 2018 midterm elections is that there has been less of the specific sort of interference the Russians engaged in two years ago, when they attempted to aggravate social tensions in the United States and foster distrust of our democratic institutions. But an analysis by Kris Shaffer, a senior analyst for our cybersecurity company, suggests that while these measures may have rendered some of the Russian tactics of 2016 less effective, they haven’t fully stopped Russian influence operations. In many instances, they seem to have merely caused Russia to shift or develop new tactics. Indeed, our company is currently detecting more overall activity in real time from continuing Russian online influence operations targeting the midterm elections than has been disclosed by social media platforms or detected by researchers during the same period before the election in 2016. In the past month, our researchers have collected more than 26 million social media posts concerning the 2018 midterms. This data set includes a large portion of all relevant content on Twitter as well as a smaller targeted sample of all relevant content on Facebook. We have also identified more than 400 websites that our analysis indicates are likely to be Russian propaganda outlets aimed at American audiences. More than 100 of these websites we have confirmed as under the direction of the Russian government or we believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence. In the month of October alone, we tracked 110,000 social media posts that referenced a United States midterm candidate, topic or hashtag and contained a link to one of these websites. More than 10,000 of these posts contained a link to one of the websites we have either confirmed as Russian-directed or believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence. The top three websites linked to these social media posts are the site of RT, Russia’s state-financed international cable network (5,275 links); The Duran, a right-wing news and opinion site (1,328 links); and Sputnik, a news and commentary site run by the Russian government (1,148 links). We have also identified 1,451 social media posts aimed specifically at midterm voters from social media accounts assessed with high confidence as belonging directly to Russian influence operations. These posts are largely focused on the geopolitics of the Middle East, the Saudi-assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh. Last month, the most-shared article of known Russian origin for the month on Twitter was an article from The Duran purporting to show how groups financed by the billionaire Democratic fund-raiser George Soros “plotted with Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to eliminate conservative ‘right wing propaganda.’” The Russia-linked social media accounts were active during the Kavanaugh hearings, drawing attention to sexual and domestic abuse allegations against various 2018 Democratic candidates and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. They have been amplifying anti-immigrant sentiment, including conspiracy theories about the caravan of migrants in Central America, and have promoted the idea that the mail-bomb campaign of the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc Jr. was a Democratic plot. Because of the numerous changes since 2016 in social media platforms and propaganda-detection practices, a straight “apple to apples” comparison of 2016 and the current election cycle is not possible. And no analysis of the social media landscape is ever complete because no one has access to all the data. But any significant detectable quantity of Americans who are unwittingly sharing Russian propaganda on their social networks is cause for concern. And based on activity that our analysis attributes to Russian government efforts, we estimate that at least hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of United States citizens have engaged with the content of Russian propaganda online. The consensus among academic researchers and Russia experts in the intelligence community is that Russia does not take a timeout from information battles. It considers itself to be in a constant state of information warfare. Its online influence operations are inexpensive and effective, and afford Russia an asymmetric advantage given the freedoms of expression afforded to Western democracies. We are heartened by the seriousness with which many social media platforms and government agencies are treating this situation. But while progress has been made since 2016, we must remain vigilant in the face of confirmed Russian efforts to undermine our democracy.

2018,"Ruth Gates, Who Made Saving Coral Reefs Her Mission, Is Dead at 56","Ruth Gates, a renowned marine biologist who made it her life’s work to save the world’s fragile coral reefs from the deadening effects of warming water temperatures, died on Oct. 25 in Kailua, Hawaii. She was 56. The Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Manoa, where Dr. Gates was director, announced her death, at Castle Hospital. Robin Burton-Gates, her wife, said that the cause was complications of surgery for diverticulitis. Dr. Gates also had cancer that had spread to her brain, she said. Dr. Gates had wanted to be a marine biologist since she was a child, having been entranced by coral reefs when she saw them on the televised exploits of the underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau. “I have the utmost respect for corals,” she said in the Netflix documentary “Chasing Coral,” which was released in 2017 and won an Emmy. “They’re really sophisticated animals.” A precious natural resource, coral reefs are often called the rain forests of the ocean because they provide a nurturing habitat for critical sources of food for millions of people, in addition to serving as a major source of tourism dollars. But over the last few decades, at least a third of the world’s reefs, which are highly sensitive to temperature changes, have died, the victims of a rise in global warming, ocean acidification, ecotourism, pollution and commercial overfishing. Scientists say warming trends suggest that much more could be destroyed in the next 30 years, with coral serving as the canary in the coal mine for the eventual collapse of the ocean ecosystem. Dr. Gates was one of the leading scientists trying to protect coral from such a fate. As director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, which is part of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, she was developing a “super coral” that could be bred to be more resilient to the heat and acidity assaulting the marine environment. “I always think of the planet as a jigsaw puzzle, and there are all these pieces that must fit together to create the picture,” she said this year in an episode of the HBO documentary series “Vice.” Losing pieces like coral reefs or the polar ice cap, she said, “will ultimately wipe us out as a species.” In addition to doing cutting-edge research, Dr. Gates brought a passion to her work that animated a larger-than-life personality and made her a sought-after public speaker and the subject of numerous videos. She was president of the International Society for Reef Studies; she spoke about her work at the United Nations and at the Aspen Ideas Festival; and she mentored a generation of graduate students. She was, many said, a Renaissance woman. “She could do everything well,” Ms. Burton-Gates said in a telephone interview. “She was good at computers, fantastic at business, she could remodel homes, she was a fantastic cook, she had a third-degree black belt in karate.” She was also, Ms. Burton-Gates said, “a great athlete in school.” And, it turned out, she could sing. At a karaoke night in Honolulu in 2015, she surprised everyone and stopped the show by belting out “Diamonds Are Forever.” Mostly, Dr. Gates, who was British, put her communications skills in the service of saving corals. And she used her command of the Queen’s English to great effect. “She used to laugh about the fact that you could say the most inane thing, but if you had a British accent people would believe you,” Dr. Margaret McFall-Ngai, director of the Pacific Biosciences Research Center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a very rare day that you have a scientist as charismatic as Ruth,” Dr. McFall-Ngai said. “She was the Carl Sagan of coral reefs.” Ruth Deborah Gates was born on March 28, 1962, in Akrotiri, Cyprus, where her father, John Amos Gates, was stationed while he worked in British military intelligence. Her mother, Muriel (Peel) Gates, was a physical therapist. With her parents constantly traveling, Ruth grew up chiefly in a boarding school in Kent, England. She received a bachelor’s degree in marine biology from Newcastle University in 1984 and a doctorate there in the same subject in 1990. She did much of her initial studying of corals in Jamaica, just as Caribbean corals were starting to die. She conducted additional research at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Hawaii. She met Ms. Burton-Gates, an illustrator, in 2014 through a mutual friend. They married on Sept. 28. A brother, Tim, also survives her. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 In 2013, the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation offered $10,000 for the most promising proposal to mitigate problems caused by an increasingly acidic ocean. Dr. Gates and Madeleine van Oppen, of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, won the challenge with their plan to develop highly resilient coral strains, much the way farmers breed stronger crops. The foundation subsequently awarded them a five-year, $4 million grant, with the longer-term goal of creating a stock of tough coral strains that could replace dying coral reefs around the world. The work has its skeptics. One major question is whether the development of these new coral strains is scalable for worldwide application. Another is whether a mechanism can be created by which the strains can be widely distributed. Yet another is whether the money can be found to pay for these very expensive undertakings. Beyond that, some people question whether this process will actually narrow the diversity of corals, which could lead to unintended consequences. Dr. Gates was generally unfazed by the criticism. “I hate to say it,” she said in an interview with Fast Company magazine this year, “but climate change is doing the most obscene genetic narrowing experiment that has ever been done.” Her laboratory remains dedicated to pursuing her work. “Instead of dwelling on the problems corals are facing, Ruth was focused on developing and testing actual solutions,” Kira Hughes, research project manager at the Gates Coral Lab, said by email. “She took action — to do something now — that would ensure coral reefs survive into the future.”",The New York Times
2018,Ryan Zinke Faces Increased Ethics Scrutiny ,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the Interior Department and a key figure in President Trump’s push to roll back environmental regulations and ramp up oil drilling, is facing increased scrutiny amid federal investigations into allegations that he abused travel spending and maintained close ties with industries he oversees. The criticism escalated sharply after reports this week that the Interior Department’s inspector general had referred one of the inquiries to the Justice Department, a potential prelude to a criminal investigation. T​he​​ investigations have raised questions about Mr. Zinke’s oversight of the Interior Department, where he is essentially the largest land manager in the United States. He has authority over the nation’s 300 million acres of public lands as well as vast waters off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Zinke faces at least a half-dozen ethics investigations. At least nine other inquiries into alleged ethics violations have been closed, in some cases because Mr. Zinke was cleared, in others because of a lack of cooperation with investigators. While it is not known which ​inquiry​ has been referred to the Justice Department, a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was most likely one examining a Montana land deal that involved an organization run by Mr. Zinke’s wife​ and a development group backed by the chairman of Halliburton, which is one of the nation’s largest companies involved in drilling for oil and gas on public lands. The inquiries, and the appearance of a financial relationship with a Halliburton executive, “raise the questions of whether you can trust the judgment of someone who appears to be looking to benefit from his public positions,” said Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. Several of the investigations have focused on allegations that Mr. Zinke took steps to assist his wife, Lolita Zinke, or spent inappropriately on her travel with him. Two weeks ago, a report by the Interior Department’s watchdog office concluded that Mr. Zinke violated agency policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles. That report also found that Mr. Zinke considered requesting that his wife become an Interior Department volunteer in order to legitimize her travel. “He goes everywhere with her,” said Thomas J. Pyle, a Trump campaign adviser who helped the administration develop its energy policy. Other investigations have delved into policy matters, such as Mr. Zinke’s decision to dramatically shrink the boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. The inspector general’s office is looking into whether the review was conducted in a way that improperly benefited a Republican state representative whose land was removed from the boundaries of the monument. Mr. Zinke, through his lawyer, has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Zinke has emerged as a favorite of Mr. Trump, who has praised his rugged “central casting” persona as well as his role in cutting federal regulations, a centerpiece of the Trump administration’s political agenda. Mr. Zinke has helped lead that charge, wiping out conservation measures, opening up millions of acres of land and water to energy exploration and in the process remaking the landscape of the American West. Mr. Zinke has promoted policies aimed at opening the east coast to offshore oil and gas drilling for the first time, loosening the standards of the Endangered Species Act, weakening safety regulations for offshore drilling equipment and shrinking the boundaries of national monuments to open the land to mining and drilling. Moves such as these have brought Mr. Zinke into Mr. Trump’s favor. In an administration noted for its policy swings and turnover — numerous campaign and administration officials have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes, while others have resigned amid allegations of ethics violations — Mr. Zinke has delivered a steady string of substantive policy accomplishments. Mr. Zinke was a one-term congressman from Montana when Mr. Trump tapped him to run the Interior Department. He was considered a surprise choice but had reportedly gained favor with Donald Trump Jr., because, like the president’s son, he is an avid game hunter. Over the past decade or so, Mr. Zinke has pursued dual careers as a politician and businessman. Some of his business dealings in that time formed relationships with individuals and industries that would become relevant in later years in his role as secretary of the interior. For instance, he was a director of a nonprofit group that pushed to develop Montana’s drone industry by using the state’s big open spaces as a testing ground. Under Mr. Zinke’s leadership, the Interior Department has planned to increase its use of drones, particularly for fighting wildfires. Mr. Zinke’s personal experience with the drone industry and ties to a number of stakeholders in the business come from having co-founded the Center for Remote Integration, the nonprofit organization that promoted their use. In August 2017, Mr. Zinke wrote to his chief of staff expressing interest in his agency’s plans for drone use. “I want to see the drone contract before the award,” he wrote, according to emails released in response to public records requests and highlighted by the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation organization. Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush who has been critical of the Trump administration, said it struck him as unusual that such a contract would be significant enough to reach Mr. Zinke. “It better be a really important contract to rise to the level of a cabinet secretary,” he said. From the partly redacted email, it is unclear which contract Mr. Zinke had sought. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said Mr. Zinke “asked to see the requirements of the request to ensure the description of services and capabilities met the highly-specialized needs of the Department.” She said that use of the technology “is supported by both parties in Congress” and that Mr. Zinke “had no role in awarding contracts.” In May 2018, Mr. Zinke announced a round of contracts for drone services to assist in fighting wildfires. One of the contracts was awarded to a company called Insitu, a Boeing subsidiary with past ties to Mr. Zinke’s efforts on behalf of the industry. Aaron Weiss, the spokesman for the Center for Western Priorities, the conservation organization, said Mr. Zinke’s interest in drones is an example where “he has not drawn a bright line with his career prior to Interior.” In an email, Monica Golden, a spokeswoman for Insitu, said the company had won hundreds of contracts since the early 2000s, and “anyone who has had significant interest in this space over that time period almost certainly would have found us through one avenue or another.” She said the company’s services had been used in two huge fires this year in Oregon and California. In April 2017, Mr. Zinke and several members of his staff at the Interior Department participated in a meeting that included executives from Proof Research, a Montana-based firearms company, according to Mr. Zinke’s calendars, a meeting reported by Huffington Post. About six years ago, Mr. Zinke reported income from the company, which used a different name at the time, a 2014 disclosure showed. He did not disclose in financial filings that he retained a small stake in it. Mr. Zinke, in his 2018 financial disclosure, noted his interest, valuing it at less than $1,000. Ms. Swift of the Interior Department said the amount fell “well under the threshold” for reporting, but Mr. Zinke added it to demonstrate “he has nothing to hide.” In another role, Mr. Zinke served as a board member for a Santa Barbara company called Save the World Air, now known as QS Energy, which develops technology for oil and fuel delivery systems. In 2012, Mr. Zinke traveled with the company’s president, where they worked to introduce the company’s oil pipeline efficiency technology to “various members of the North American energy industry,” according to a news release announcing his appointment. Ms. Swift said Mr. Zinke “has had no contact with anyone from the organization to his knowledge” in his current job. The episode that has garnered the most criticism was Mr. Zinke’s discussions about a land deal involving an organization run by his wife and the Halliburton chairman. In June, the Interior Department’s inspector general opened an investigation into whether conversations Mr. Zinke had with David J. Lesar, the chairman of Halliburton, about a Montana land deal constituted a conflict of interest. Politico first reported the deal, in Mr. Zinke’s hometown, Whitefish, Mont., which involved a development group backed by Mr. Lesar and a charitable foundation established by Mr. Zinke and headed by his wife. It included a hotel, retail shops and a microbrewery. The examination of “involvement in and use of taxpayer resources to advance land developments” focuses on whether taxpayer money was improperly spent on Mr. Zinke’s travel when he met with Halliburton representatives. Ms. Swift has said that the secretary did nothing improper and that he had resigned from his foundation’s board of directors before the deal was made.

2018,Opinion | Safe Topics to Discuss This Holiday Season,"Stick to the weather. What could possibly go wrong? Ms. Cella is a comedian. Family. Festivity. Fun! Meeting your significant other’s grandmother for the first time, while the wine is flowing. Holiday meals can be challenging, especially in these charged times, so here’s a cheat sheet of subjects that are safe to talk about with anyone, guaranteed. What could be safer than complimenting your hostess’s delicious cooking? Before you tell her she makes a great turkey, however, think about whether there are any vegans at the table. If there are, a simple compliment like “The bird is moist” could lead to a lecture from Cousin Emily about how factory farming is not only a form of slavery but also one of the greatest environmental hazards of our time. And as if hearing about animal torture as you douse your turkey in gravy weren’t enough, Uncle Dave will inevitably use this as a cue to share anecdotes from his recent big-game hunting trip. There’s certainly no harm in telling your partner’s niece you love her dress, right? Before you say she looks cute as a button, though, you may want to compliment her intelligence. That way you’re not reinforcing the patriarchal message that her value lies in her appearance. Little girls should know brains trump beauty, even in Trump’s America. Just make sure you’re discreet — otherwise, your boyfriend’s “freethinking” stepbrother will turn dinner into a real-life Reddit comment thread. When in doubt, stick to the smallest of small talk, like how you managed to get from your home to your boyfriend’s grandparents’ house. Be careful, though, because whether you drove, flew or took the train, the conversation could easily veer into a debate between cousins about whether the way cars function as a signifier of wealth is problematic. If you took the bus, keep your mouth shut, obviously. Everyone loves Great-Aunt Cindy’s dog, Muffin! Tell Cindy you’ve heard all about the old gal and ask how she’s doing. Just make sure you check with someone beforehand to ensure Muffin is indeed in good health. If she’s not, the mention of something like canine arthritis could be a slippery slope into a discussion about euthanasia. Before you know it, Cindy will be screaming that she’s taking Muffin to Oregon so that they can both die with dignity while her brother Gary calls her a damn hippie and offers to take her out with one of his 20 guns right here and now. The one thing human beings can always talk about, regardless of how well they know one another and how little they have in common, is entertainment. In lieu of any other connection, the monoculture unites us all! To be on the safe side, avoid talking about inherently political shows like “Succession,” “This Is Us,” “The Real Housewives of New York City,” “Sesame Street,” “Barefoot Contessa” or anything on the Home Shopping Network. Instead, talk about a piece of entertainment everyone can agree to hate, like cable news. Actually, there’s no way this won’t immediately lead to a screaming match about climate change so whatever you do, do not comment on the weather.

2018,Saints Defeat Falcons for Their 10th Straight Win,"Saints 31, Falcons 17 NEW ORLEANS — Drew Brees threw four touchdown passes to inexperienced receivers and the New Orleans Saints won their 10th straight game Thursday night, 31-17 over the Atlanta Falcons. The loss dropped the Falcons to 4-7, and eliminated them from contention in the N.F.C. South. Tommylee Lewis and Austin Carr each caught their second career touchdown pass, and the rookie tight end Dan Arnold grabbed his first, as did fellow rookie receiver Keith Kirkwood. All four entered the N.F.L. as undrafted free agents within the past three years. The Falcons, meanwhile, struggled to hold onto the ball, losing three fumbles inside the Saints 20 — something no team facing streaking New Orleans (10-1) can afford this season. Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan was stripped by safety Marcus Williams on a third-and-2 from the Saints 3 and Williams recovered to end Atlanta’s opening drive. Julio Jones was stripped by linebacker Alex Anzalone after a catch on the New Orleans 17, and safety Vonn Bell recovered to preserve a 17-3 lead going into halftime. The Saints’ defense, which had a season-high six sacks, continued to come up with big plays in the second half, with Anzalone breaking up a fourth-down pass in the third quarter and linebacker A. J. Klein intercepting a pass tipped by defensive tackle Tyeler Davison in the fourth. The interception gave the Saints possession on the Atlanta 22, setting up Kirkwood’s diving 4-yard touchdown catch. Just for good measure, Lattimore stripped Calvin Ridley on the Saints 1 after a 29-yard completion with about four minutes to go. Defensive back Eli Apple recovered that one. Ryan was under pressure all night from a Saints defense that was bolstered by the return of first-round draft pick Marcus Davenport from a toe injury. Ryan finished 35 of 47 for 377 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Atlanta rushed for just 26 yards, while New Orleans finished with 150. Statistically, Brees did not have one of his more impressive games, completing 15 of 22 passes for 171 yards. He also threw his second interception, a pass picked off by Damontae Kazee, his league-leading sixth pick year. But Brees’ ability to play to the strengths of unheralded receivers allowed the Saints to cash in on scoring opportunities.",The New York Times

2018,Salome Zurabishvili Wins Georgia Presidential Runoff,"TBILISI, Georgia — Salome Zurabishvili, the French-born former foreign minister of Georgia, claimed victory in a presidential runoff Wednesday that marked the final popular vote in the country for the head of state. With nearly all of the ballots counted, the Central Election Commission said that Ms. Zurabishvili, 66, who was backed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, had won more than 59 percent of the vote in the race against Grigol Vashadze, 60, who was supported by a coalition of opposition forces. Georgia, a nation of nearly 4 million people in the volatile Caucasus region south of Russia, is transitioning to a parliamentary republic that substantially reduces the authority of the president and elevates the prime minister to the most powerful figure in the country. Once the term ends for Ms. Zurabishvili, the first woman to be elected president of Georgia, heads of state in the country will be chosen by delegates. “Our choice is peaceful Georgia, united country and of equal citizens,” Mr. Zurabishvili said after seeing an exit poll that showed her heading for victory. “Our choice is the dialogue with those parts of the society who today have not voted for me and who today don’t agree with us. But we all are citizens of one country.” The election was seen as a crucial test for Georgian Dream. The party is led and funded by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia. Georgian Dream has dominated the nation’s political scene since defeating former President Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement in 2012. Mr. Ivanishvili briefly served as prime minister in 2012-2013 and has remained a prominent force in Georgian politics ever since. After the polls closed, Mr. Saakashvili spoke on Rustavi 2 television, claiming that the vote was rigged and calling for protests to annul the results. Ms. Zurabishvili ran as an independent but was backed by Georgian Dream and captured 39 percent of the vote in the first round last month, a narrow victory over Mr. Vashadze, who was supported by a coalition that includes the United National Movement and won 38 percent. Ms. Zurabishvili was born in France and served as French ambassador to Georgia until she became the country’s foreign minister in 2004, but she was fired the following year. Some Georgians have never fully accepted her because she was born in France, and others remain angry after she contended that Georgia was responsible for starting a war in 2008 with Russia. Ms. Zurabishvili’s opponents cast her as a pro-Russia candidate, a claim she and Georgian Dream strongly denied. Ms. Zurabishvili argued that her background made her strongly qualified to serve as president as Georgia seeks closer ties with the European Union. “Diplomatic work in France for me was also work for Georgia,” Ms. Zurabishvili said. “Everyone knew that I am a Georgian who fights for its country. I knew very well the price of independence and freedom, because I am the child of the country whose ancestors have sacrificed themselves for the independence and freedom.” Mr. Vashadze, who served as Georgia’s foreign minister from 2008 to 2012, vowed to re-establish control over the breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by peaceful means. Georgia lost control of both provinces after the war with Russia, which erupted when Mr. Saakashvili made a failed attempt to reclaim sovereignty over South Ossetia. “Georgia has outlived many empires and will definitely outlive the current Russian empire,” Mr. Vashadze said. He also vowed to pardon Mr. Saakashvili, who was stripped of his citizenship in 2015 and sentenced in absentia for abuse of power. Earlier this month, the Georgian government announced that a charitable foundation controlled by Ms. Ivanishvili promised to write off the debts of 600,000 people, a move described by critics as an attempt to buy votes before the runoff.",The New York Times
2018,"Salon Art + Design, a Fair With Wit, Cheek, History","Exhibition Review The Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Architecture and Design has given the lasting impression that the Bauhaus, with its skeletal steel chairs and practical teakettles, owned Modernism for much of the last century. But 56 well-stocked booths at the Salon Art + Design fair at the Park Avenue Armory, which opened Thursday and runs through Monday, offer an alternative story. Consider the evidence: a fluffy armchair upholstered with white tails of mohair from Rome’s Giustini/Stagetti gallery; a bronze bench sculpted as a grinning lynx from Philadelphia’s Wexler Gallery; two concave dish mirrors shaped like a pair of gigantic contact lenses, hanging at the Maison Rapin. And then at Adrian Sassoon, there’s a thick, erect, 7-foot-high, ceramic vase shaped like a column and painted with fig leaves. It’s enough to make any man jealous. You smile your way through the fair. There’s wit, spirit and cheek. The sass of a slipper chair by the Indian designer Satyendra Pakhalé in Ammann gallery in Cologne leads with a pair of breasts, like an ancient Greek sphinx, and it’s just as insolent today as it was when designed over a decade ago. In this year’s Salon, instead of Bauhaus ideology delivered with strict Euclidean geometry, there’s a high delight quotient. This branch of bespoke modernism played out in ateliers rather than in factories: Artists produced limited art editions rather than toasters and coffee pots stamped out by the thousands. The artists didn’t heed rules of industrial efficiency. They gorged on their imagination, and sometimes on their libido. Don’t expect Ikea prices, of course. But compared with the sticker shock of serious art these days, modern and contemporary designs are accessible collectibles. And, in an era of digital living, twisting Mobius-strip chairs and kidney-shaped coffee tables seem more relevant than veneered antiques. Somehow, Federico Munari’s boomerang couch, circa 1950, at the Maison Rapin works better than Biedermeier when streaming Hannah Gadsby or “Game of Thrones.” But the show does not tell its Modernism story in a straight line, and it doesn’t even start with Modernism. In New York’s Phoenix Ancient Art gallery, the abstract, smoothly contoured marble Neolithic mother goddess is as modern and abstract as a Brancusi, and the bronze, fourth century B.C. Greek warrior’s helmet, designed to deflect the slings and arrows of battle, already embodies Modernism’s maxim, form follows function (otherwise you’re dead). Some galleries root Modernism in well-known American and European classics. The New York-based Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts exhibits oak chairs by Frank Lloyd Wright, each a small piece of architecture, and in the booth directly opposite, Yves Macaux shows Wright’s Austrian contemporaries. Cabinets, chairs and lamps by the architects Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos are arranged with drawings by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, to suggest a room of the period. Though many exhibitors hail from the United States, most are European, and British, French, Danish and Italian galleries came with evidence of their own local modernism. Galleria Rossella Colombari in Milan exhibited a spectacular double wooden desk of cascading shelves attributed to the Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa, and another Milanese gallery, Nilufar, brought rare leather stools, almost like campaign chairs, designed in the 1930s by the father of modern Italian design, Gio Ponti. Surrealism influenced many pieces, whether it was the grandfather clock tied up in a knot by the British sculptor Alex Chinneck, or a bronze bench dripping dew drops by Reinier Bosch in the Priveekollektie stall. Of course there were classics in crafted wood, like a monumental George Nakashima table and bed at Philadelphia’s Moderne Gallery, and across the aisle, Danish modern design at Copenhagen’s principal design gallery, Dansk Mobelkunst. A 1935 table by Mogens Koch exemplified Denmark’s tradition of no-nonsense simplicity, and it stood next to an updated take on Danish modernism, a crisply cut Minimalist table by the London designer Michael Anastassiades. By contrast, in the Sarah Myerscough Gallery, British artists with a rarefied sensibility using exotic techniques reinterpreted woods that craftsmen have worked for centuries. Eleanor Lakelin bleached, sandblasted and hand-turned horse chestnut burr into amphoras that reveal the fibrous chaos beneath its bark. But no show of modernism today would be contemporary without the handiwork of the computer. In Galerie Maria Wettergren, a Danish-born, London-based designer Mathias Bengtsson created a protoplasmic maple tabletop set on skeletal legs that grew organically from a natural algorithm that he scripted into software. Another piece, the undulating “L’Infini Chair ” in Galerie BSL, looks digital, but a Canadian visual artist, Gildas Berthelot, actually carved the curvilinear lounge chair out of bleached maple. Sitting on “L’Infini” delivers the thrill of surfing a lunging wave. Most galleries built environments so that their objects could be understood as livable pieces in an immersive homelike setting, but some installations took the idea well beyond domestic comfort. Cape Town’s Southern Guild showed artists rooted in South African culture. The improbably named Porky Hefer, a former ad man, created a suspended nest made of natural grasses and cane into which a person could retreat for a little solitude. Rich Mnisi designed a sprawling leather chaise (Nwa-Mulamula) comfortable enough for several people. He shaped an accompanying side table as an eye that hovers over a pool of tears to honor his great-grandmother and generations of black women who shed their tears of work and sorrow across generations. Perhaps the most off-the-grid installation was the Todd Merrill booth, a Hollywood fantasia: chromed branches of a chandelier floated over demi-settees and a tufted sofa, arranged symmetrically as in a Busby Berkeley musical. The gallery pushed good taste to an intriguing decadence definitely outside the Bauhaus canon. It was one extreme of modernism in a salon curated to show that there have been — and are — many. The Armory is a very big room. The Salon proved to be a very big tent.",The New York Times
2018,"Sam Darnold Pass Decides It, in Favor of Dolphins, Not Jets","Dolphins 13, Jets 6 MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Jets quarterback Sam Darnold had Miami Dolphins linebacker Jerome Baker dancing and waving and clicking his heels on Sunday. That’s the reaction returning an interception for a score can bring out. Baker scored the game’s only touchdown, on a 25-yard return with 10 minutes 48 seconds left, and a resilient defense helped the Dolphins beat the Jets, 13-6. Darnold, a rookie, threw four interceptions and took four sacks, and the Jets (3-6), who lost their third in a row, went 2 for 15 on third and fourth downs. Darnold went 21 for 39 for 229 yards and a passer rating of 31.8, the third time his rating was below 40. He entered the game tied for the N.F.L. lead with 10 interceptions. “Two for sure he’d like to have back,” Jets Coach Todd Bowles said of the interceptions on Sunday. “Back to the drawing board.” Darnold said: “I just have to be sharper. Personally, I have to have a better plan when I get to the line of scrimmage. I’ve got to know exactly where to go with the ball. If No. 1 or 2 isn’t there, I have to go to” the No. 3 receiver. Center Spencer Long reinjured a finger and had a half-dozen off-target shotgun hikes, including one on Baker’s interception, which compounded problems for Darnold. “We need to be more consistent, myself included especially,” Long said. The injury on the middle finger of his right hand, which he dealt with earlier this season, finally forced him from the game. Darnold said of the bad snaps, “It disrupts timing, but there’s no excuse for how I played out there.” The hobbled Dolphins (5-4) endured another wave of injuries and the departure of safety Reshad Jones, who pulled himself out of the game without explanation. Their defense was much improved after giving up a combined 102 points in the previous three games. “We never panicked; we knew what our defense was capable of,” said Baker, also a rookie. “When we are executing and do our job and play together, we’re one of the best defenses out there.” The quality of the opposition helped the defense dominate, allowing Miami to win with only seven first downs and 168 yards of offense. Darnold tried to rally the Jets from a 6-3 deficit, but he took a high snap and made an ill-advised throw to tight end Eric Tomlinson. Baker stepped in front for his first career interception and scored untouched. “I didn’t throw it with confidence,” Darnold said. “I just alligator-armed it, threw it a little bit short.” Much of the game was a slog, but Baker provided a video highlight celebrating with his teammates. “There is nothing like it,” he said, game ball cradled under his arm. “It is the sweetest feeling ever, especially getting in the end zone, seeing your brothers running toward you.” T. J. McDonald and Walt Aikens made interceptions to end the Jets’ final two possessions. The Jets’ points came on field goals of 48 and 56 yards by Jason Myers. Jason Sanders had two field goals for Miami. “The guys did a good job of complementary football,” Dolphins Coach Adam Gase said. “They played together. They did a good job of stopping the run and making it as one-dimensional as possible.” Miami broke a two-game losing streak and won for the second time in the past six games. Gase improved to 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins this year. The Jets have scored 33 points during their three-game skid and have dropped nine of their past 10 road games dating to 2017. Safety Jamal Adams called the latest defeat a 53-man effort but added: “It’s the same, same, same stuff. It’s frustrating. I’m not going to hold my tongue for anything anymore. Enough is enough. I’m not a loser.”",The New York Times

2018,Samantha Bee Urges Viewers to Vote: ‘You Cannot Take This Election for Granted’,"Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. On the eve of the election, early-voting numbers suggest that this could be a record-breaking year for midterm turnout. Samantha Bee, hosting a special, election-eve edition of “Full Frontal” on Monday, warned audiences against taking those reports of high turnout as an excuse not to go to the polls themselves. “You cannot take this election for granted. I certainly won’t make that mistake again. I have a full-on, Ben Affleck-level back tattoo that says, ‘Hillary Clinton is the president and my favorite show is “House of Cards!”’” — SAMANTHA BEE Stephen Colbert joked about how intense and high-stakes the election feels. Then he threw a jab at Republicans. “In America’s ongoing bitter divorce, the big question is: Who’s getting the House?” — STEPHEN COLBERT “CNN just released new numbers on their generic ballot, where women favor Democrats 62 percent to 35 percent. But Republicans aren’t worried, because they have a history of not believing women.” — STEPHEN COLBERT The actor Mike Myers made a cameo on “The Tonight Show,” appearing in character as Dr. Evil (again). He told Jimmy Fallon he was running for Congress on a “Make America Evil Again” platform, and outlined his “five-point evil plan.” And he explained how he decided to run in the first place. JIMMY FALLON: I just didn’t realize that you wanted to run for office. MIKE MYERS: Well, originally I was hoping for Brett Kavanaugh’s job, but Trump said I was too even-tempered for that. “Many states are seeing a massive turnout. For instance, Florida has seen a huge increase in young voters. Although, to be fair, in Florida a ‘young voter’ is anyone under 75.” — JAMES CORDEN “A Japanese man has broken the Guinness world record for the most skips over a rope in 24 hours, with a total of over 151,000. This story was first reported by the man’s downstairs neighbor.” — SETH MEYERS “A luxury hotel in the Maldives has opened a $50,000-per-night underwater villa in the Indian Ocean. And if you love real estate that’s underwater, try Trump’s hotels.” — SETH MEYERS “The New York City Marathon was yesterday, and President Trump freaked out because he thought the caravan was here. [impersonating Trump] ‘Oh no! Oh no, they’re going to vote!’” — SETH MEYERS Jimmy Kimmel’s team duped passers-by into thinking it was Election Day, then they persuaded them to lie about voting. Bee pushed her viewers to familiarize themselves with their local-level races, not just statewide candidates. Colbert, Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah will all go live on Tuesday, commenting in real time on the election results. The late-night hosts have been going after President Trump on a nightly basis since 2016. What effect has it had? Today’s midterm election is the closest thing we have to a referendum on their impact.

2018,San Francisco 49ers to Release Reuben Foster After Latest Arrest,"The San Francisco 49ers are releasing the linebacker Reuben Foster on the heels of his latest off-field incident, the team announced Sunday, ending his tumultuous two-season tenure. Foster, 24, was arrested late Saturday at the 49ers’ team hotel on a charge of misdemeanor domestic violence, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office in Florida. At a bail hearing Sunday morning, his bond was set at $2,000, and he was instructed to avoid any contact with his accuser. The 49ers were in Florida for a Sunday afternoon game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This was not the first domestic violence accusation against Foster, though the previous charges were dropped after the same woman, Elissa Ennis, recanted in April. On Sunday, with charges that Foster had slapped Ennis, pushed her in the chest, and slapped a phone out of her hand, the team delivered on an ultimatum it had issued in April as a result of Foster’s previous arrest. “We have a set of standards in place that the players were involved with in developing,” General Manager John Lynch said at a news conference on Sunday. “In this case, it was communicated exceptionally clear and to the point as to what we expected out of him, and unfortunately, what transpired yesterday, this isn’t a comment on what happened there because that would be mere speculation on our part. It’s more of a comment on him not living up to what we had communicated and to the energy and the time that we’ve invested in him.” The release cannot be made official until Monday. Foster’s previous domestic violence arrest had come after an incident with Ennis in February. The team chose at the time to take a wait-and-see approach, and Foster appeared to be vindicated when Ennis fully recanted the accusations. In a statement provided to the Sacramento Bee in April, Stephanie Rickard, a lawyer for Foster’s girlfriend, said of the February incident in question, “He did not strike her, injure her or threaten her.” Arrest reports indicated that the accuser had suffered injuries, but in her recanting of the accusation, Ennis said the injuries had come in a fight with another woman. “She was extremely upset and told him if he broke up with her she would ‘trash his career,’ ” Rickard said. Foster served a two-game suspension at the beginning of this season for violations of the league’s conduct and substance abuse policies — he had been charged with second-degree marijuana possession in February — and the team made it clear that it would have a zero-tolerance policy for domestic violence as it kept a close eye on Foster. “We can promise you guys, if there’s someone who ever hits their significant other, girlfriends, some person like that, that person is not going to be on our team,” Coach Kyle Shanahan said. “Obviously, Reuben is on our team right now, so we’re waiting to see how that goes. But, if that’s something that we felt he did or ended up happening, you guys will see how we feel.” Foster was controversial from the start of his N.F.L. career. Named the nation’s top college linebacker when he won the Butkus Award for Alabama in 2016, he was considered a supremely talented player, with the potential to make an impact similar to that of Ray Lewis. He was initially considered a top-five talent ahead of the 2017 draft, but he tumbled to the 31st pick after a run-in with a hospital employee over his drug test sample at the N.F.L. combine that resulted in his being sent home without meeting with any teams. It was later reported that he had a diluted drug sample, which is treated the same as a positive result. Because of that, he was put in the N.F.L.’s substance abuse program before he had even joined the 49ers. As a rookie, Foster largely stayed out of trouble and played in 10 games, compiling 72 tackles and five quarterback hits, showing much of the potential that had intrigued teams in the past. This season, after the two arrests and the suspension, he played in just six games with a lingering hamstring injury and had 29 tackles. “He was really taking some very positive steps and maturing in a really nice fashion,” Lynch said. “Unfortunately, in life, there’s consequences for your actions, and when you show bad judgment, particularly after something has been communicated very clearly what the expectations are, there are consequences.”",The New York Times
2018,San Francisco Approves Business Tax to Fund Homeless Services,"SAN FRANCISCO — Voters in San Francisco approved a tax increase on the city’s largest businesses that would nearly double its budget for homeless services, a measure seen as an effort to hold wealthy technology companies accountable for exacerbating the local housing crisis. Tech executives have poured money into the campaigns for and against the measure. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and the payments company Square, spent $125,000 to oppose it, while Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, spent $2 million to support it. Salesforce contributed an additional $5 million to the campaign in favor of the initiative, known as Proposition C. Mr. Benioff and Mr. Dorsey sparred on Twitter over Proposition C in October, fueling a debate that coursed through the tech industry in the run-up to the election. The battle continued in the days before the vote, with Mark Pincus, the co-founder of the online gaming company Zynga, tweeting Saturday that Proposition C is “the dumbest, least thought out” initiative and asking his followers to vote against it. Mr. Benioff argued that San Francisco’s businesses needed to take a more aggressive role in dealing with the city’s homelessness crisis. “What we do matters and we can improve the world,” Mr. Benioff said. “We can’t just be part of the problem.” The final results showed that three of every five people who voted supported the measure. “I think what’s been so incredible about this measure is we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of support from the community,” said Sam Lew, the manager of the campaign favoring the initiative. “If there is a legal challenge, there will be thousands of San Franciscans who will fight against it.” Opponents of the measure may challenge the results. A state Supreme Court ruling last year raised questions about whether tax increases proposed by voters for specific causes needed the same two-thirds majority to pass as those proposed by elected officials. The San Francisco City Attorney’s Office is currently seeking a court order to resolve the confusion, asking the city’s Superior Court to affirm that special tax increases proposed by voters can be passed with a simple majority vote. Jess Montejano, a spokesman for the No on C campaign, expressed confidence that Proposition C’s failure to meet the two-thirds threshold meant it would never go into effect. “Despite outspending the No on C campaign by at least four to one, the Yes on C campaign failed to earn the two-thirds voter support necessary for San Francisco to ever see a penny that Proposition C promised,” Mr. Montejano said.",The New York Times

2018,Satanic Temple Settles Lawsuit Over Goat-Headed Statue in ‘Sabrina’,"The Satanic Temple said on Wednesday that it had settled its lawsuit accusing Warner Bros. and Netflix of copying the temple’s goat-headed statue in their new “Sabrina” series. The lawsuit was “amicably settled,” Lucien Greaves, a co-founder of the temple, wrote in a blog post on the Patheos religion-themed website. The temple will be acknowledged in the credits for episodes of “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” that have already been filmed, Mr. Greaves wrote. The rest of the settlement, including details on what will happen in future episodes of the show, is confidential, according to Bruce Lederman, the temple’s lawyer. The Satanic Temple’s lawsuit, filed on Nov. 9 in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asked for at least $50 million for the alleged copyright infringement and injury to the temple’s reputation. Mr. Lederman would not comment on whether there was any financial settlement. The temple, an activist group based in Salem, Mass., defines its mission, in part, to “reject tyrannical authority” and to “encourage benevolence and empathy among all people.” The statue, “Baphomet With Children,” was designed about five years ago. It was based on an 1856 drawing of the muscled goat-headed deity made by Éliphas Lévi, an occultist. The statue features two children staring up at Baphomet as if worshiping him. It was meant as a protest to religious statues appearing on public property. In 2015, the temple tried to get it installed at the Oklahoma Capitol in response to a Ten Commandments monument. (The State Supreme Court eventually ordered the Ten Commandments removed.) This year the temple brought it to the Arkansas Capitol to protest a Ten Commandments display there. A similar statue to “Baphomet With Children” appears in “Sabrina” representing the Dark Lord, who fights the teenage half-human, half-witch Sabrina. The Satanic Temple said the statue not only infringed on its copyright, but damaged its reputation by portraying the statue as evil. In a statement, Warner Bros., which produces the show, acknowledged the settlement without elaborating. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Greaves, in his blog post, thanked people who had supported the lawsuit, but he also complained about the “large number of people who flooded us with hate mail and armchair legal analysis.” One email implored him not to ruin a show that “just tries to bring joy into the world,” he wrote. “So ends one of the most overpublicized of copyright claims,” Mr. Greaves added. “Press can now stop pretending this was unique and momentous, or even interesting.”",The New York Times
2018,Satanic Temple Sues Over Goat-Headed Statue in ‘Sabrina’ Series,"The Satanic Temple filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Warner Bros. and Netflix, alleging copyright violation of its goat-headed statue, which it says appears in the new “Sabrina” series. The temple objected to the use of the statue’s likeness in the “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” which features a much darker portrayal of the teenage half-human, half-witch immortalized decades ago in Archie comics. In the lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs ask for at least $50 million for each alleged infraction: copyright infringement, trademark violation and injury to the business’ reputation. They also request an injunction barring the companies from redistributing the series with the image of the statue. The temple argues that the television show not only copied its conception of the deity — a muscled figure with two young children staring up at it — but also that it gives the statue and the Satanic Temple itself a bad rap. The Satanic Temple, based in Salem, Mass., defines its mission, in part, to “reject tyrannical authority” and to “encourage benevolence and empathy among all people.” Last year, the temple drew headlines for sponsoring a billboard in Texas that condemned corporal punishment. The Satanic Temple designed the statue, called “Baphomet With Children,” about five years ago as a response to religious displays on public property. In 2015, the Satanic Temple pushed to install a bronze statue of Baphomet — hooves, horns and all — to counter a Ten Commandments display at the Oklahoma Capitol. (The state Supreme Court later outlawed the Ten Commandments display from appearing there.) “The reason the statue was commissioned was to be a symbol that they could bring out when they felt government wasn’t separating church and state,” said Bruce Lederman, the lawyer for the Satanic Temple. But in “Sabrina,” the lawsuit argues, the statue is an evil symbol representing the show’s antagonists. The statue sits at the center of the academy where Sabrina is sent to learn magic, and it is considered a homage to the “Dark Lord,” whom Sabrina is fighting against. Mr. Lederman said the concern is that the next time the temple uses its statue to send a message about the separation of church and state, people may associate it with the television show instead. Warner Bros., which produced the show, declined to comment. Netflix referred questions to Warner Bros. Baphomet, described as a goat-headed hermaphroditic deity, is not a character invented by the Satanic Temple, the lawsuit said. It was depicted by an occultist, Éliphas Lévi, in a mid-19th century drawing, which the temple put on a T-shirt. The lawsuit argues, however, that “Sabrina” copies particular details from the Satanic Temple’s Baphomet statue that have not been reproduced elsewhere. For example, it argues that the appearance of the children staring up at the goat-headed deity is identical to what appears in the Netflix show. Lucien Greaves, a co-founder of the Satanic Temple, said designing and constructing the statue took over a year and cost about $100,000. Mr. Greaves said that the icon had become a sort of logo for Satanists and that it was distressing for him to watch it get swept up into the plot of a major television show. “It makes you feel that all the work you’ve done can be totally eclipsed by this mega-giant media company,” he said. On Twitter, Mr. Greaves compared the depictions on top of each other, with the show’s image below. In an interview with VICE last month, Lisa Soper, the production designer for the show, said she thought the similarity between the statues was “kind of a coincidence.” She said hundreds of depictions of Baphomet existed, some with people surrounding him. Mr. Lederman said that depending on how the lawsuit progresses, one remedy for the situation could be editing the image of Baphomet out of the show. “It won’t cure what’s been done,” he said, “but at least they should go back and change it in each of the scenes.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Saudi Arabia After Khashoggi,"The kingdom comes up with another story on the journalist’s murder. The Trump administration appears ready to buy it. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In a one-two punch on Thursday, Saudi Arabia announced it would seek death sentences and the United States levied sanctions against some members of the team of Saudis suspected of murdering Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. So, a month and a half after the killing, all is clear: Attempt to repatriate a critic terribly botched, suspects identified, stern punishments meted, case closed. And, oh, Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, exonerated. ""Absolutely, his royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir assured reporters in Riyadh on Thursday. The American sanctions do not rise to the prince’s level, nor to those closest to him. Whether the latest version will put the Khashoggi issue to rest remains to be seen. Turkey, which apparently has a full audio recording of what happened and has steadily made portions public (in the latest, a member of the kill team instructs a superior by phone to “tell your boss” the deed has been done) is not buying it. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, stressed that the murder was not a spur-of-the-moment decision. “The necessary equipment and people were previously brought in to kill and later dismember him,” Mr. Cavusoglu said. Indeed, it’s hard to believe that a planeload of security agents, including a forensic specialist, flew all the way to Istanbul just to gently persuade Mr. Khashoggi, a one-time intimate of the royals who became a self-exiled critic of the crown prince, to come home. The truth may never be known, especially if the Saudi public prosecutor succeeds in obtaining the death penalty that he said he’s seeking against five of the Saudi suspects, thus eliminating the main witnesses. But what is already clear is that the relationship between the oil-soaked kingdom and the United States needs to change. It is not simply that the furor over the crude assassination has put the House of Saud on the defensive, giving Riyadh’s most important ally and arms supplier leverage to direct it more toward American objectives. What has changed is that the assassination and the pathetic attempts to cover it up have left the emperor (read crown prince) with no clothes. Almost from the creation of Saudi Arabia, the United States and Western powers thirsty for oil and hungry for Saudi investment dollars have largely closed their eyes to its systemic abuses of elemental human rights, including the suppression of women and freedoms of religion and expression. The blinkered approach was not limited to Saudi Arabia — the West dealt with the Soviet Union and scores of other despotic regimes to prevent war, ensure supplies of oil and other raw materials and, in recent decades, to combat terrorism. But Prince Mohammed went too far, on too many fronts. Campaigning to contain the rival power of Iran, he launched an ill-conceived war in Yemen, which has blown up into a humanitarian disaster of unspeakable proportions in which America is complicit as provider of weaponry and military support; he blockaded Qatar; he detained the prime minister of Lebanon. The self-defeating outcome has been to make Saudi Arabia appear the main regional menace, rather than Iran. At home, the prince began what on first appearance were promising social and economic reforms, including the lifting of a ban on women driving. But he also detained a host of his princely cousins and other petro-billionaires to consolidate his power, and cracked down on dissenters — leading, whether on his orders or not, to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Through most of his misrule, Prince Mohammed continued to enjoy the favor of President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who despite a glaring lack of qualifications assumed the Middle East portfolio in the White House. They saw the young prince as an ally, along with Israel, against Iran, and as a buyer of limitless American arms. Among Mr. Trump’s first reactions to the Khashoggi murder was to state that it would not affect the lucrative arms sales. The president has now finally nominated an ambassador to Riyadh, a critical post vacant since he took office. The more common demonstration of displeasure in diplomacy is to pull back an ambassador, not to appoint one, but John Abizaid, a retired general with broad knowledge of the Middle East, is a good choice, and we hope he will enlighten the White House about the Saudis. In any case, some in Washington and other capitals were growing wary of M.B.S., as Prince Mohammed is known to his friends, long before the Khashoggi murder. The hit in Istanbul, caught in all its horror on Turkish audiotapes, ripped down the last of the curtain, with governments, business executives and politicians quickly scaling back their association. Yes, that does give the Trump administration considerable leverage over a weakened Saudi regime, to make it come clean on how Mr. Khashoggi died, end the disastrous war in Yemen, repair its breach with Qatar, help make peace in Israel, keep oil prices stable and, depending on the outcome of investigations of Mr. Khashoggi’s death, replace the crown prince with a less impulsive and dangerous heir. Any such demands, however, would be hypocrisy if not accompanied by an end to the kingdom’s brazen flouting of fundamental human rights. These did not begin with the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, but that’s where they, and American complicity, must end.

2018,Opinion | Saudi Arabia Is Misusing Mecca ,"In the aftermath of the Jamal Khashoggi murder, the kingdom has exploited the podium of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by using its imams to praise, sanctify and defend the rulers and their actions. Mr. Fadl teaches law at the University of California, Los Angeles. The rulers of Saudi Arabia derive much of their legitimacy and prestige in the Muslim world from their control and upkeep of the Grand Mosque and the Kaaba in Mecca and the mosque of Prophet Muhammad in Medina. King Salman, like the rulers before him, wears the title of the “Khadim al-Ḥaramayn al-Sharifayn,” which is translated as the “Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques” or, more precisely, “The Servant of the Two Noble Sanctuaries.” Despite the humility of the royal title, the Saudi monarchy has a long history of exploiting the podium of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by using its imams to praise, sanctify and defend the rulers and their actions. In the aftermath of the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as the world’s accusatory gaze was transfixed on Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi monarchy has again used the Grand Mosque to defend and deify the crown prince in a manner that makes its legitimacy and control of Mecca and Medina morally troubling like never before. On Oct. 19, Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sudais, the officially appointed imam of the Grand Mosque and the highest religious authority in the kingdom, delivered his Friday sermon from a written script. Friday sermons at the Grand Mosque are broadcast live on cable networks and social media sites, watched with great reverence by millions of Muslims and carry a great deal of moral and religious authority. Imam Sudais delivered a troubling sermon, violating the sanctity of the sacred space he occupied. He referenced a saying attributed to Prophet Muhammad that once every century, God sends a mujaddid, a great reformer to reclaim or reinvigorate the faith. He explained that the mujaddid is needed to address the unique challenges of each age. He proceeded to extol Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a divine gift to Muslims and implied that the crown prince was the mujaddid sent by God to revive the Islamic faith in our age. “The path of reform and modernization in this blessed land … through the care and attention from its young, ambitious, divinely inspired reformer crown prince, continues to blaze forward guided by his vision of innovation and insightful modernism, despite all the failed pressures and threats,” the imam declared, from the podium where Prophet Muhammad delivered his last sermon. Invoking the debate following the Khashoggi murder, Imam Sudais warned Muslims against believing ill-intended media rumors and innuendos that sought to cast doubt on the great Muslim leader. He described the conspiracies against the crown prince as intended to destroy Islam and Muslims, warning that “all threats against his modernizing reforms are bound not only to fail, but will threaten international security, peace and stability.” He cautioned that the attacks against “these blessed lands” are a provocation and offense to more than a billion Muslims. Imam Sudais used the word “muhaddath,” or “uniquely and singularly gifted” to describe Prince Mohammed. “Muhaddath” was the title given by Prophet Muhammad to Umar Ibn al-Khattab, his companion and the second caliph of Islam. The imam implicitly compared the crown prince to Caliph Umar. Imam Sudais prayed for God to protect Prince Mohammed against the international conspiracies being woven against him by the enemies of Islam, the malingerers and hypocrites, and concluded that it was the solemn duty of all Muslims to support and obey the king and the faithful crown prince, the protectors and guardians of the holy sites and Islam. Saudi clerics had never weaponized the podium of the prophet at the Grand Mosque so brazenly to serve the monarchy. No imam of the Grand Mosque had ever anointed a Saudi ruler as the mujaddid of the age or dared to imply as much. The sermons in Mecca and Medina are read from a script, which is approved beforehand by Saudi security forces. While the king appoints a leading imam for the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, each imam has a number of officially appointed deputies who rotate in leading prayers and delivering sermons. For decades, the sermons delivered in Mecca and Medina have been pietistic, dogmatic and predictable. They have always concluded with a prayer for the Saudi royals, but the imams would not attribute sacred qualities to the monarchy and insisted that the rulers should be obeyed only to the extent that they obey God. A lot has changed since Prince Mohammed’s rise to power. The crown prince has imprisoned hundreds of prominent Saudi imams who have shown even a modicum of resistance — including very prominent and influential jurists such as Sheikh Saleh al-Talib and Sheikh Bandar Bin Aziz Bilila, former imams of the Grand Mosque. Saudi prosecutors have sought the death penalty for Salman al-Awdah, a prominent, reformist cleric who was arrested last September. Some reports claim that another prominent cleric, Sheikh Suleiman Daweesh, who was arrested in April 2016, has died in a Saudi prison after being tortured. The only imams who seem to be allowed to lead prayers and give sermons at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina are those who have agreed to go along with whatever the crown prince wants. Some influential Saudi scholars such as Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Al Rayes went as far as saying in a lecture that even if the Saudi ruler “fornicates in public on television for half an hour each day, you are still required to bring people together around the ruler, not to aggravate people against him.” Imam Sudais’s recent sermon put Muslims at an axial turning point: Accept the crown prince as the divinely inspired reformer of Islam and believe and accept his words and deeds or you are an enemy of Islam. Muslim scholars reacted to the sermon primarily on social media with disdain and outrage. Numerous Arabic language comedy shows and talk shows on YouTube reacted with mockery and condemnation. When an imam of the Grand Mosque calls upon Muslims to obediently accept Prince Mohammed’s incredulous narrative about the murder of Mr. Khashoggi; to accept his abduction, jailing and torture of dissenters, including imprisonment of several revered Islamic scholars; to ignore his pitiless and cruel war in Yemen, his undermining the democratic dreams in the Arab world, his support for the oppressive dictatorship in Egypt, it makes it impossible to accept the imam’s categorization of the crown prince as a divinely inspired reformer. The sanctified podium of the prophet in Mecca is being desecrated and defiled. The control of Mecca and Medina has enabled the clerical establishment and the monarchy flush with oil money to extend their literalist and rigid interpretations of Islam beyond the borders of the kingdom. Most Muslims will always prefer a tolerant and ethically conscientious Islam to the variant championed by the crown prince and the acquiescent Saudi clergy. By using the Grand Mosque to whitewash acts of despotism and oppression, Prince Mohammed has placed the very legitimacy of the Saudi control and guardianship of the holy places of Mecca and Medina in question. Khaled M. Abou El Fadl is a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of “Reasoning With God: Reclaiming Shari‘ah in the Modern Age.” An earlier version of this article misstated a term that Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sudais used to describe Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a divinely inspired reformer. The word was ""mujaddid,"" not ""mujtahid."" The earlier version also misspelled one of King Salman's titles. It is Khadim al-Haramayn al-Sharifayn, not Khadim al-Ḥaramayn as-Sarifayn.",The New York Times
2018,"Saudi Arabia, Hillary Clinton, Black Friday: Your Friday Briefing","Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Before being implicated in the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been overseeing a deal worth upward of $80 billion to get the U.S. to sell the kingdom designs for nuclear power plants. There was a hitch: Saudi Arabia insisted on producing its own nuclear fuel, according to U.S. and Saudi officials familiar with the negotiations. That raised concerns that the Saudis could divert their fuel into a covert weapons project — exactly what the U.S. and its allies feared Iran was doing before the 2015 nuclear accord. Prince Mohammed set off alarms this year by declaring that if Iran “developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” • Why it matters: The Saudi government has changed its story about what happened to Mr. Khashoggi several times. Can the country be trusted with nuclear fuel and technology? • Doubling down: President Trump rebuffed the C.I.A. over its conclusion that Prince Mohammed was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. He said the agency merely had “feelings” on the matter. Statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau have predicted that white Americans will form less than half the population in 2044. The presentation of that data has been a concern for Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director, who thought the information needed to be handled carefully, to avoid the impression of a zero-sum game that white Americans were losing. These figures inflame passions on both right and left. For white nationalists, they signify a kind of doomsday clock counting down to the end of racial and cultural dominance. For progressives, they promise inevitable political triumph. But some researchers question whether the bureau’s projections provide a true picture. At issue, they say, is which people the government counts as white. • Clinton on Europe: In an interview published Thursday, Hillary Clinton warned the Continent’s leaders that they “need to get a handle on migration” in order to defeat right-wing populism. Her remarks surprised and drew criticism from scholars, immigration advocates and pundits on the left and right. A loophole in New York’s campaign finance law has let corporations create limited liability companies that can give virtually unlimited amounts of money to candidates. Democrats, in their successful campaign to recapture the State Senate for the first time in a decade, promised to end the practice. But they too, have benefited from such donations. • Looking to 2020: Bernie Sanders is pondering another presidential run. But he is no longer a singular figure in the party. • 16 rebels: Meet the Democrats who oppose Nancy Pelosi’s bid to become speaker of the House. At least two police officers were killed in an attempted terrorist attack on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi on Friday. Officials said that all three attackers were dead. • The background: The attack was the most significant strike against Chinese interests in Pakistan, which has been a showcase for China’s huge international development program, the Belt and Road Initiative, in years.

2018,Saudi King Stands by Crown Prince as Outrage Over Khashoggi Killing Spreads,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Monday stood by his son and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, avoiding any mention of the international outrage toward the kingdom in his first public remarks since Saudi agents killed the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month. The echoes of that killing continued to spread Monday, with Germany imposing sanctions on 18 Saudis suspected of involvement and freezing arms exports to Saudi Arabia. And the Turkish defense minister suggested that Mr. Khashoggi’s killers could have left the country with his body. Mr. Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has become a lightning rod for Western criticism of Saudi Arabia, its human rights record and the leadership of Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler. A growing chorus of current and former Western officials have concluded that an operation as elaborate as the one to kill Mr. Khashoggi could not have been carried out without the prince’s knowledge. American officials told The New York Times and other publications last week that the C.I.A. had concluded that the prince had ordered the killing. Saudi officials have vehemently denied that the crown prince had any involvement in the death of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident who wrote columns for The Washington Post that were critical of some Saudi policies. They have portrayed the killing as a result of a rogue operation to return Mr. Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia. The heightened scrutiny of Prince Mohammed, 33, has caused speculation in some quarters that he could be pushed aside. But in Saudi Arabia’s absolute monarchy, only his father has the authority to do so, and in Monday’s remarks, he showed no intention to sideline his son. In his annual address to the Shura Council, the kingdom’s advisory assembly, the 82-year-old monarch stuck to general statements on official Saudi policy, calling on the world to stop Iran’s nuclear program, press for political solutions to the wars in Syria and Yemen, and keep up the fight against terrorism. If the king made any reference to the aftermath of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, it was done obliquely. He praised the country’s public prosecutor, whose office is handling the official Saudi investigation into the killing. Last week, the prosecutor’s office said that it had filed criminal charges against 11 Saudis for suspected involvement in the killing and that it was seeking the death penalty against five of them, usually carried out in Saudi Arabia by beheading. “We affirm that this country will never deviate from the application of Allah’s law without any distinction or delay,” the king said. He also made a vague reference to governmental reforms to ensure that instructions are properly followed to “avoid any violations or mistakes.” Saudi Arabia has said that the operation that led to Mr. Khashoggi’s death was carried out outside the chain of command. Last month, King Salman announced the formation of a committee charged with restructuring the intelligence apparatus to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. Heading that committee is Prince Mohammed. Those steps have done little to cast doubt on the narrative laid out by Turkish officials that Mr. Khashoggi was suffocated soon after entering the consulate and then dismembered by a team of 15 Saudi agents who had flown in to do the job. Nor have the kingdom’s frequently shifting explanations stemmed the outrage in Western countries over the death. Germany on Monday froze the delivery of previously approved arms exports to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. It also barred 18 Saudis from entering Europe’s border-free Schengen zone because of their suspected involvement. Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, told reporters in Brussels that his country had issued the ban for the 26-nation zone in close coordination with France, which is part of the Schengen area, and Britain, which is not. “As before, there are more questions than answers in this case, with the crime itself and who is behind it,” Mr. Maas said. Over the weekend, the United States announced sanctions on 17 Saudis suspected of involvement in the killing. The German list included the same names, plus that of Gen. Ahmed Asiri, the former deputy head of Saudi intelligence, who was fired after Mr. Khashoggi was killed. Mr. Khashoggi, 59, went to the consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain papers that would allow him to marry his fiancée, who is Turkish. Over the past few weeks, the Turks have leaked evidence of the plot, including the names and photographs of the Saudi team members and surveillance footage of them arriving at the airport and moving around in Istanbul. The Turkish defense minister provided further information over the weekend, pressing the case that the team had set out to kill Mr. Khashoggi, rather than deciding to do so only after an effort to bring him home had failed, as Saudi officials have contended. “The most important issue is this crime was premeditated, it did not happen in a second,” the minister, Hulusi Akar, said at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada on Saturday. “It was premeditated. Those people were sent to Istanbul and they did their work.” Mr. Akar also provided a new possible answer to one of the killing’s enduring mysteries — the location of Mr. Khashoggi’s remains — suggesting that the Saudi agents could have carried Mr. Khashoggi’s dismembered body out of the country in their luggage under the cover of diplomatic immunity. “Possibly, possibly they committed the murder and then after that, within three or four hours, they left Turkey,” said Mr. Akar, a retired general who left his post as chief of staff in the summer to take up the civilian post of defense minister. “And because of the diplomatic immunity they left very easily, without having any problem with the luggage,” he added. “Possibly in the luggage they carried the dismembered body of Khashoggi.” The killers had several hours between Mr. Khashoggi’s arrival at the consulate and the time when his fiancée and friends alerted the Turkish authorities that he had not emerged, Mr. Akar noted. By then, Mr. Khashoggi’s body had probably already been removed from the consulate, he said. “Possibly, Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he entered and after that dismembered. And they removed the body parts from the consulate,” he said. “Turkish teams did some work in the consulate but they could find nothing.” Turkish officials have said that most of the 15 Saudis who arrived in Istanbul by commercial and private planes in the hours before the killing did not have diplomatic status. When they left, their luggage passed through airport security machines. Security officers also hand-searched some of the luggage on the second plane. At least nine of the Saudis were government and security officials. One, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, was a frequent companion of Prince Mohammed. A diplomat who left shortly after the killing was an intelligence officer and the deputy head of the Saudi consulate, Ahmad Abdullah al-Muzaini. Mr. Muzaini made a quick trip to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, after Mr. Khashoggi first visited the consulate on Sept. 28. He returned to Istanbul the day before the killing and was photographed passing through Ataturk Airport, which serves the city, with heavy luggage. He left the country again at 9:35 p.m. on the evening of the death, flying direct to Riyadh from Sabiha Gokcen Airport on Istanbul’s Asian side, according to security camera footage released to the Turkish news media. The Saudi consul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, who was also at the consulate during the killing, left the country two weeks later.",The New York Times
2018,"Saudi Prince Faces G-20 Leaders, Drawing a Laugh and a Confrontation","BUENOS AIRES — Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia exchanged laughs and clasped hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in an incongruously celebratory moment as they took their seats among other world leaders for a meeting in Buenos Aires during an economic summit. It was the surest sign yet that the crown prince can still expect a warm welcome from at least some heads of state even after American intelligence agencies and many Western officials have concluded that he authorized the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist ambushed two months ago by Saudi agents in a consulate in Istanbul. The prince has denied advanced knowledge of the killing. The Group of 20 summit meeting, a gathering of the leaders of the world’s largest economies, is a closely watched test for Crown Prince Mohammed, the 33-year-old favorite son of the aging King Salman and de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom. An Argentine prosecutor has begun an inquiry into potential criminal charges against the crown prince for human rights abuses, including allegations that he was responsible for the torture of Mr. Khashoggi and certain Saudi prisoners, as well as for war crimes committed by Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen. Legal authorities said there was no chance of any action against Prince Mohammed during the two-day meeting, but some world leaders had said that they might seek to confront him over the killing. French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to do just that, as he had promised. When he met with Prince Mohammed on the sidelines of the summit, a microphone captured fragments of their dialogue. Mr. Macron stood in a gray suit with a stern face just inches from Prince Mohammed, nodding his head and smiling awkwardly. “Don’t worry,” the crown prince told the French president. “I do worry. I am worried,” Mr. Marcon responded. “I told you.” “You told me. Thank you very much,” Prince Mohammed said, bowing his head almost bashfully. “You know what I mean,” the French president continued, adding moments later, “You never listen to me,” and “I am a man of my word.” “I do listen to you,” Prince Mohammed insisted, adding, “It’s O.K., I can deal with it.” The crown prince also met Friday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose country sends many temporary migrant workers to Saudi Arabia. But a video clip of Prince Mohammed’s encounter with Mr. Putin was the most talked about image of the day, in part because of the delight the two leaders appeared to take in their meeting. Mr. Putin also faced international criticism over a murder this year. Britain has concluded that Mr. Putin’s government ordered the killing of a former Russian spy living near London, a charge the Kremlin denies. Approaching seats next to each other at a round-table at the summit meeting, they clapped their palms together in the air as though in a high-five. As their handshake continued, the prince patted Mr. Putin three times on the back of his hand, and they continued to laugh together as though enjoying a joke. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch had petitioned the Argentine courts this week for a criminal investigation into Prince Mohammed’s potential responsibility for rights abuses, under a broad jurisdiction for such crimes in Argeninian law. Although it cited the Khashoggi killing, the petition focused primarily on the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster, and United Nations experts have said both sides may have committed war crimes. Judge Ariel Lijo formally requested information on Wednesday from Argentina’s foreign ministry about guarantees of legal immunity given to Prince Mohammed while he was attending. The judge also requested information from Turkey, Yemen, the International Criminal Court and elsewhere to begin evaluating the allegations. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina said Thursday that the crown prince’s potential role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi was a legitimate subject for discussion at the meeting of the Group of 20, an association of the leaders of the world’s biggest economies. “This issue that has impacted the world is on the table and maybe it will come out in bilateral meetings or in the agenda of the G-20,” Mr. Macri said at a news conference in the Argentine capital. Mr. Macron of France had said he intended to bring up the killing with Prince Mohammed. “I’ve always been very clear about the issue of Saudi Arabia and I will inevitably have the opportunity to discuss it with the Saudi crown prince,” Mr. Macron said at the same news conference. “Personally, I’m in favor of transparency and associating the international community in this affair, because the whole world is concerned,” he said. A French official said Friday that Mr. Macron had sought to discuss the Khashoggi killing, the Yemen war and the oil markets with the prince during their one-on-one conversation. President Trump, for his part, said before leaving Washington on Thursday that he would have been happy to meet one-on-one with Prince Mohammed but the summit schedule was already booked. “I would have met with him but we didn’t set that one up,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump has emphasized Saudi Arabia’s importance to the United States as a weapons buyer, source of oil and ally against Iran, and he has sought to cast doubt on the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Prince Mohammed knew in advance about the Khashoggi killing. “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t,” the president said last week in a dictated statement. Prince Mohammed, who has denied ordering or having advance knowledge of the killing, kept a low profile Thursday. He arrived in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, after a weeklong tour of Arab capitals, and he was welcomed at the airport by the host country’s foreign minister, Jorge Faurie. Officials of Human Rights Watch said Thursday that its petition to the Argentine courts had already shaped the atmosphere at the summit meeting for Prince Mohammed. “No world leader attending the G-20 summit today can ignore the fact that Mohammed bin Salman is under scrutiny for alleged war crimes in Yemen and torture,” said José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch.",The New York Times
2018,"Saudi Sisters, Seeking Asylum, May Have Committed Suicide, Police Say","Two months before their bodies would wash up dead on the rocky banks of the Hudson River, making them known throughout the world, two sisters from Saudi Arabia traveled from Virginia to Manhattan for reasons that are not yet clear. During their two-month stint in New York City, the two stayed at pricey Midtown hotels — the Hilton, the Hyatt, the Knickerbocker — ordered room service twice a day and maxed out their credit cards shopping. Before their bodies were found bound together by duct tape, a jogger saw the two young women in a playground in Riverside Park, burying their heads in their hands and praying. Their bodies would be found by a passer-by five miles downriver from the park. On Friday, the police revealed more details of their investigation into the deaths of Rotana Farea, 22, and Tala Farea, 16, that gave a sharper picture of the sisters’ whereabouts in the months before their bodies were discovered nearly two weeks ago. The mysterious circumstances of their deaths have puzzled investigators and have prompted global press coverage. Investigators said they were examining reports that the sisters, who emigrated to Virginia from Saudi Arabia with their family in 2015, had been physically abused by family members and had claimed asylum in the United States. Dermot Shea, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, said the investigation revealed that the sisters had said they would rather kill themselves than return to Saudi Arabia. The leading theory the police are considering is that the sisters died by suicide driven by despair, but investigators have not ruled out other circumstances. “At this time we have no credible information that any crime took place in New York City, but it is still under investigation,” Chief Shea said. Chief Shea said a witness came forward on Wednesday to share information that had been “haunting him.” The man, who Chief Shea said was exercising in Riverside Park about 7 a.m. on Oct. 24, told the police that he had seen the two women nearby, sitting approximately 30 feet apart, with their heads bowed and making loud noises that he described as praying. The sisters, who were seen roughly between 158th and 163rd Streets, were seated several feet from the river, which could explain why they were found downriver, Chief Shea said. At about 3 p.m. that day, a passer-by discovered their bodies, clad in similar black jackets and black leggings, below a pier about 100 blocks south near 68th Street. Their bodies were wrapped in tape, which was “keeping them together,” but it was not tightly binding them, Chief Shea said. “It is entirely credible that the girls entered the water alive,” Chief Shea said. “We have them praying a short distance from the water. We also have sources that detectives have developed thus far, statements that they would rather inflict harm on themselves, commit suicide, than return to Saudi Arabia.” The Farea family moved from Jeddah, a port city in Saudi Arabia, to Fairfax, Va., about three years ago. The sisters lived with their mother and at least two brothers, according to neighbors and the Arab News, an English-language Saudi Arabian newspaper. Their father traveled back and forth between the two countries, relatives told the news outlet. Tala Farea briefly attended a public school in Fairfax County for her sophomore year, according to a spokesman for the school district, and Rotana Farea was an engineering student at George Mason University from early 2016 until last spring. “The news of her death is tragic,” a spokesman for the university said. “University officials are cooperating with police and will assist in any way we can.” The family was kind and cordial, said a neighbor who lived next door to the family at an apartment building in Fairfax from 2016 until they moved out in early August and who asked not to be named. He said he saw the father about three times and would typically see the mother interacting with other Muslim women who appeared to live in the building. She once knocked on his door and gave him a Saudi Arabian dessert similar to star fruit. He occasionally saw the mother with her two youngest boys. The neighbor said he saw the daughters “very rarely, and within the last six or seven months, I didn’t see the girls at all.” On Sept. 22, the neighbor said, he ran into the mother in the plaza outside the building. He said he asked about her well-being, and she told him that she was O.K. but that one of her daughters — she did not say which — had been missing for “months.” The sisters were first reported missing to the police in Virginia on Dec. 1, 2017, by their mother, whom the New York police have not identified. When the police in Virginia located the sisters the next day, they asked for protection and were placed in what Chief Shea described as a “shelter-like facility.” The sisters said they had been physically abused and “some other things,” Chief Shea said. “We have reports of abuse involving the family; this is not corroborated at this time from us, but there are reports of abuse between the brother, the mother and the father that have been brought to our attention,” he said. “This is in another jurisdiction and this is some time in the past.” The family had no contact with their daughters in the eight-month period they spent in the shelter and after their disappearance from that location on Aug. 23 or Aug. 24, according to Chief Shea. Using credit card billing data, investigators found that the girls traveled from Fairfax to Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, before arriving in Manhattan on Sept. 1. The police said there was no indication that they left the borough after arriving. Their credit card activity suggests that they were always together. Chief Shea said the police obtained two pieces of surveillance footage that showed the sisters alone and “in good health” about five to six days before they were found dead. “It’s just the two girls, dressed as normally as two girls would be dressed,” he said. It’s not unheard of for Saudi women to seek asylum in the United States, fearing death for their refusal to live in a country that requires women and girls to live under the control of male legal guardians. But the sisters’ deaths, weeks after a Saudi Arabian journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was killed at the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey, sparked speculation on social media that they were the victims of an honor killing. The police said the girls’ mother had received a call from the Saudi embassy notifying her that her daughters had requested asylum in the United States. Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that the request had prompted the Saudi government to order the family to return home. Fatima Baeshen, the spokeswoman for the Saudi embassy in Washington, pushed back on Friday in a statement, calling reports that the government had ordered the family to leave the United States because the sisters sought asylum “absolutely false.” The consulate in New York has appointed a lawyer to investigate the deaths, Ms. Baeshen said last week. How Saudi officials would have known about the sisters’ request for asylum remains a mystery that concerns immigration lawyers and advocates. Smita Dazzo, the legal services director of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit that helps refugees, said the information probably came from someone the girls told of their plans. “I can’t imagine that the leak comes from the U.S. government itself,” said Ms. Dazzo, whose organization did not have contact with the sisters. “If it has, then we all have a lot to be worried about.”",The New York Times
2018,Saudis Close to Crown Prince Discussed Killing Other Enemies a Year Before Khashoggi’s Death,"WASHINGTON — Top Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked a small group of businessmen last year about using private companies to assassinate Iranian enemies of the kingdom, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The Saudis inquired at a time when Prince Mohammed, then the deputy crown prince and defense minister, was consolidating power and directing his advisers to escalate military and intelligence operations outside the kingdom. Their discussions, more than a year before the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, indicate that top Saudi officials have considered assassinations since the beginning of Prince Mohammed’s ascent. Saudi officials have portrayed Mr. Khashoggi’s death as a rogue killing ordered by an official who has since been fired. But that official, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, was present for a meeting in March 2017 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where the businessmen pitched a $2 billion plan to use private intelligence operatives to try to sabotage the Iranian economy. During the discussion, part of a series of meetings where the men tried to win Saudi funding for their plan, General Assiri’s top aides inquired about killing Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and a man considered a determined enemy of Saudi Arabia. The interest in assassinations, covert operations and military campaigns like the war in Yemen — overseen by Prince Mohammed — is a change for the kingdom, which historically has avoided an adventurous foreign policy that could create instability and imperil Saudi Arabia’s comfortable position as one of the world’s largest oil suppliers. As for the businessmen, who had intelligence backgrounds, they saw their Iran plan both as a lucrative source of income and as a way to cripple a country that they and the Saudis considered a profound threat. George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, arranged the meeting. He had met previously with Prince Mohammed, and had pitched the Iran plan to Trump White House officials. Another participant in the meetings was Joel Zamel, an Israeli with deep ties to his country’s intelligence and security agencies. Both Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel are witnesses in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and prosecutors have asked them about their discussions with American and Saudi officials about the Iran proposal. It is unclear how this line of inquiry fits into Mr. Mueller’s broader inquiry. In 2016, a company owned by Mr. Zamel, Psy-Group, had pitched the Trump campaign on a social media manipulation plan. A spokesman for the Saudi government declined to comment, as did lawyers for both Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel. During the March 2017 meeting about the plan to sabotage Iran’s economy, according to the three people familiar with the discussions, the Saudis asked the businessmen whether they also “conducted kinetics” — lethal operations — saying they were interested in killing senior Iranian officials. The businessmen hesitated, saying they would need to consult their lawyer. The lawyer flatly rejected the plan, and the businessmen told the Saudis they would not take part in any assassinations. Mr. Nader told the Saudis about a London-based company run by former British special operations troops that might take on the contract. It is unclear which company he suggested. Before he was ousted last month, General Assiri was considered one of Prince Mohammed’s closest advisers, a man whose sharp ascent tracked the rise of the young crown prince. In 2016, he became the public face of Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen, giving briefings about the state of the war. He traveled frequently to Washington, where Saudi-paid lobbyists brought him to think tanks to give optimistic assessments about the campaign’s progress and he extolled the Saudi concern for the welfare of civilians. By 2017, however, the Saudi campaign that General Assiri oversaw in Yemen had ground into a military stalemate and, despite his assurances, a humanitarian catastrophe. But his patron, Prince Mohammed, also consolidated his power over all of the kingdom’s security apparatuses, and he promoted General Assiri to the deputy head of the kingdom’s spy agency, the General Intelligence Directorate. Western analysts believe that Prince Mohammed moved General Assiri there in part to keep an eye on the spy chief, Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan, known as Abu Ali, who was close to Western intelligence agencies and suspected of harboring loyalties to one of the crown prince’s royal rivals. General Assiri was dismissed last month when the Saudi government acknowledged Mr. Khashoggi’s killing and said he had organized the operation. On Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said his government had handed over a recording of Mr. Khashoggi’s killing to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Britain and France, pressuring President Trump to more harshly punish the Saudis over the murder. Mr. Nader’s and Mr. Zamel’s plan dates to the beginning of 2016, when they started discussing an ambitious campaign of economic warfare against Iran similar to one waged by Israel and the United States during the past decade aimed at coercing Iran to end its nuclear program. They sketched out operations like revealing hidden global assets of the Quds Force; creating fake social media accounts in Farsi to foment unrest in Iran; financing Iranian opposition groups; and publicizing accusations, real or fictitious, against senior Iranian officials to turn them against one another. Mr. Nader is an adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, a country that, along with Saudi Arabia and Israel, has identified Iran as the primary threat to stability in the Middle East. Both he and Mr. Zamel believed that Hillary Clinton’s anticipated victory in the 2016 election meant a continuation of the Iran nuclear deal signed by President Barack Obama — and little appetite in Washington for a concerted campaign to cripple the Iranian economy. So, they decided to pitch the plan to Saudi and Emirati officials, even submitting a proposal to General Assiri during a meeting in Belgium. The election of Donald J. Trump changed their calculus, and shortly after, Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel traveled to New York to sell both Trump transition officials and Saudi generals on their Iran plan. Mr. Nader’s initiative to try to topple the Iranian economy was first reported in May by The New York Times. His discussions in New York with General Assiri and other Saudi officials were reported last month by The Daily Beast. Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel enlisted Erik Prince, the former head of Blackwater and an adviser to the Trump transition team. They had already discussed elements of their plan with Mr. Prince, in a meeting when they learned of his own paramilitary proposals that he planned to try to sell to the Saudis. A spokesman for Mr. Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to give specifics about the meeting but said that Mr. Prince had no discussions with Saudis about assassinations. In a suite on one of the top floors of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York, Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader spoke to General Assiri and his aides about their Iran plan. The Saudis were interested in the idea but said it was so provocative and potentially destabilizing that they wanted to get the approval of the incoming Trump administration before Saudi Arabia paid for the campaign. After Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mr. Nader met frequently with White House officials to discuss the economic sabotage plan. General Assiri’s interest in assassinations was unsurprising but unrepresentative of official policy, said one Saudi familiar with the inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. The investigation has shown the general to be a grandiose and ambitious novice to intelligence who sought to impress the crown prince with unauthorized schemes for black operations, the person said. But General Assiri’s well-known closeness to the crown prince — the general often joined Prince Mohammed for meetings in Riyadh with visiting American officials — might make it difficult for the prince’s supporters to distance him from the proposals, just as the same connections have helped convince Western intelligence agencies that the prince must have known about the plot against Mr. Khashoggi. Moreover, General Assiri and his lieutenants were meeting with Mr. Nader around the same time that Mr. Nader was meeting with Prince Mohammed himself, as Saudi officials have acknowledged. In emails to a business associate obtained by The Times, Mr. Nader sometimes referred to conversations he held with Prince Mohammed — also known by his initials, M.B.S. — about other projects he had discussed with General Assiri. “Had a truly magnificent meeting with M.B.S.,” Mr. Nader wrote in early 2017, discussing possible Saudi contracts. The crown prince, he said, had advised him to “review it and discuss it with General Ahmed.”",The New York Times
2018,"Saudis Sent Experts to Remove Evidence of Khashoggi’s Killing, Turkey Says","ISTANBUL — More than a month after Saudi agents assassinated the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, officials in Turkey continue to drip out sensational new details in a killing that has caused an international uproar. The latest twist in the case that has drawn heavy global criticism of Saudi Arabia: The kingdom sent an expert team to clean up evidence of the crime under the guise of helping with the investigation, a senior Turkish official said on Monday. A pro-government newspaper, Sabah, published news of the Saudi cleanup team and photographs of two of its members, whom it identified as a chemist and a toxicologist, who visited the Saudi Consulate where Mr. Khashoggi was killed. The senior Turkish official confirmed the main details of the report and said the Saudi team was sent with the knowledge of top Saudi officials. The two men traveled to Turkey for the sole purpose of covering up evidence of the killing before the Turkish police were allowed to search the premises, the official said in comments relayed by electronic message. The two men were identified as Ahmad Abdulaziz al-Junabi, a chemist, and Khaled Yahya al-Zahrani, a toxicologist, part of a team of Saudi investigators who spent several days in Turkey visiting the consulate and the consul’s residence, ostensibly to help with the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper reported. The Turkish official confirmed the names of the two individuals and said they were part of a cleanup team. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, according to the rules of his office. The killing has severely strained relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and officials in Istanbul have regularly leaked new information about the case to ratchet up pressure on the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has detained 18 people implicated in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, but has not said who ordered what Turkish officials have characterized as the political assassination of a prominent critic of the Saudi government. Turkish and Western officials have said that it is unlikely that such a plan would have been carried out without the blessing of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is seen as the country’s de facto ruler. While the killing has compromised Prince Mohammed’s global standing, there is growing international consensus that the case has not appeared to weaken his grip on power. In the wake of the killing, international companies have come under pressure to cut ties to Saudi Arabia, but on Monday, the chief executive of SoftBank of Japan said it would continue to do business with the kingdom. Speaking on Monday in Geneva, the president of Saudi Arabia’s human rights commission, Bandar al-Aiban, vowed a full investigation and punishment of those responsible, but shed no new light on the case. His remarks, before the United Nations Human Rights Council, came in a review of the kingdom’s human rights record. Turkey has demanded, to no avail, that Saudi Arabia disclose what became of Mr. Khashoggi’s body, that it name the “local collaborator” who a Saudi official has said helped dispose of the remains, and that it turn over the 18 suspects to face the Turkish justice system. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mr. Khashoggi’s two sons, Salah and Abdullah, called for their father’s body to be returned for a burial in Saudi Arabia. Salah Khashoggi said that he had “faith” in the Saudi investigation of the killing and that “everybody involved will be brought to justice.” The Saudi cleanup team arrived in Istanbul on Oct. 11, nine days after Mr. Khashoggi’s death, and visited the consulate every day from Oct. 12 to Oct. 17, according to Sabah. Turkish investigators were not allowed into the consulate, which is considered Saudi sovereign territory, until Oct. 15. Sabah published photographs of Mr. Junabi and Mr. Zahrani emerging from the entrance of the consulate and also published photographs that the newspaper’s investigative editor, Abdurrahman Simsek, said were head shots from cameras at airport passport control. The men arrived on the same day as a Saudi delegation that met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 11, as Turkish officials demanded to know what had happened to Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who lived in the United States and wrote opinion articles for The Washington Post. He had entered the consulate on Oct. 2 for a prearranged meeting to collect papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancée, and was never seen again. When the group identified as a cleanup team was in Turkey, Saudi officials were still insisting that Mr. Khashoggi, 59, had left the consulate safely, and that they did not know where he was. They later acknowledged that he had been killed in the consulate, at first describing his death as the accidental result of a fight, and later calling it premeditated. Turkey has identified a team of 15 Saudi officials that it has accused of being the perpetrators of the murder, who arrived in Turkey in the hours before Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance and left the same day. Some of the 15 turned out to be security officers close to Prince Mohammed, and included a top forensic specialist. The Khashoggi case has worsened Saudi relations with not only Turkey, but also with the United States and some of its closest allies, particularly in Europe. It has also increased attention on Saudi Arabia’s role in the civil war in Yemen, where civilian casualties continue to climb, leading to calls in the West to stop arms sales to the Saudis. The United Nations review of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record included demands for a transparent investigation into the killing, but representatives of several countries took a broader approach to criticizing the kingdom. They pointed to Saudi Arabia’s frequent and increasing use of capital punishment, including for nonviolent offenses, and accused the Saudis of executing people for political or religious dissent.",The New York Times
2018,"Saudis Shift Account of Khashoggi Killing Again, as 5 Agents Face Death Penalty","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia threatened five of its agents with the death penalty on Thursday for killing the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, as the kingdom changed its story, again, about how the crime was committed and continued to try to distance its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, from any responsibility. Announcing an update on the kingdom’s own investigation, the public prosecutor portrayed the killing of Mr. Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul as an improvised decision taken at the last minute by a team that had been dispatched there with orders to retrieve him. While the prosecutor’s report did not name any of the suspects, the leader of the team that confronted Mr. Khashoggi at the consulate was Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a frequent companion of Prince Mohammed, who often traveled with him abroad, according to a Saudi official familiar with the investigation. Thursday’s explanation closely echoed a previous Saudi account — portraying the killing as a rendition gone wrong — that President Trump had derided as “one of the worst in the history of cover-ups.” But the Saudis acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that the team sent to meet Mr. Khashoggi in Istanbul had not only ambushed and killed him in their consulate but had also dismembered his body — as Turkish officials have maintained for weeks. Speaking to reporters in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, a spokesman for the public prosecutor said the order to kill Mr. Khashoggi had been taken by only a single intelligence agent on the scene in Istanbul, without authorization from superiors in Riyadh, and that it was accomplished with a deadly dose of a tranquilizer — not by strangulation, as the kingdom had previously said. The mutilation of the body, the prosecutor said, was a spur-of-the-moment decision to get the body out of the consulate. In addition to the five threatened with execution, by beheading, six others have been charged with crimes related to the killing. The prosecutor’s office said none of the accused could be identified while the investigation goes on. The announcement on Thursday filled in none of the many remaining gaps in the accounting of the killing and offered almost nothing to shake the conclusions of United States intelligence agencies and many Western officials that Prince Mohammed had to have authorized the assassination. These gaps, and the Saudis’ insistence that the killing was an improvisation, present a dilemma for the Trump administration, which has embraced the crown prince as the central figure in its plans for the region and has stood by him in the face of mounting outrage over Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Just hours after the Saudi announcement on Thursday, the Trump administration said it was slapping sanctions for human rights violations on 17 Saudis who were involved in the killing, including a top adviser and several security agents with close ties to the crown prince himself. [Read more about the close ties some of those charged in the killing have with Crown Prince Mohammed.] Many questions remained on Thursday. Saudi prosecutors said the team included a criminal evidence specialist to clean up the scene if necessary. However, publicly available information about that agent portrays him as a medical doctor specializing in autopsies, and the Turks have said he arrived in Istanbul with a bone saw. Nor did the Saudi investigation disclose the name or contact information of a supposed local collaborator who prosecutors said disposed of Mr. Khashoggi’s remains in a still unknown location. The prosecutors said they interviewed the accused agents to produce a sketch of the collaborator, which they said they would share with the Turks. Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist, disappeared inside the consulate on Oct. 2, and Saudi Arabia maintained afterward that he had left unharmed. When the kingdom later acknowledged that he had died inside, it first claimed he had been strangled by accident in a fight with its agents — an account that convinced almost no one. The kingdom finally acknowledged three weeks ago that evidence provided by Turkey had indicated a planned assassination, and the Trump administration welcomed the admission as a sign of progress toward accountability. “The Saudis have acknowledged that this was a premeditated attack,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Nov. 4. Now, the kingdom is hedging on that acknowledgment of premeditation, with the prosecutor indicating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi was planned, at most, within a few hours before it took place. Turkey has applied pressure on the kingdom to reveal who ordered the killing and has implied the plan must have been approved by Prince Mohammed. This week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey expressed frustration that the prince was failing to follow through on his promise to expose the truth about the disappearance and death of Mr. Khashoggi. On Thursday, Turkey quickly dismissed the Saudis’ new explanation, with the country’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, declaring it “unsatisfying.” “The dismembering of the body is not an instant decision,” Mr. Cavusoglu said, according to news reports. “They brought the necessary people and tools to kill him and dismember the body in advance.” The American sanctions targeted 17 people for their connections to the killing, including Saud al-Qahtani, a close aide to the crown prince; Mr. Mutreb, the intelligence agent who has often traveled abroad as part of the crown prince’s security detail; and Salah Tubaigy, the autopsy specialist who Turkish officials say dismembered Mr. Khashoggi after he was killed. The public prosecutor said that Mr. Qahtani, a powerful aide to Prince Mohammed who has directed vast social media campaigns against the kingdom’s enemies, met with some of the agents before they flew to Turkey. The purpose, the prosecutor added, was to give them “some useful information” related to “his belief that the victim had been co-opted by organizations and countries hostile to the kingdom and that his presence abroad constituted a danger to the security of the homeland.” Thursday’s sanctions were the harshest responses yet by the United States to Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, but the death has also energized Congress. A bipartisan group of senators on Thursday introduced legislation that would block weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose further sanctions on individuals involved in the killing and aspects of the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The United States did not sanction the most senior Saudi official implicated in its internal investigation, the deputy head of Saudi intelligence, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri. Prosecutors said that in the days before the killing he had ordered an operation to return Mr. Khashoggi to the kingdom, by convincing him or “by force.” A team of 15 operatives was assembled, with five of them charged with confronting Mr. Khashoggi, the prosecutor’s announcement said. Heading the group was Mr. Mutreb, who knew Mr. Khashoggi from their time working together at the Saudi Embassy in London. Mr. Khashoggi came to the consulate to get the paperwork he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée. An argument broke out with the Saudi agents, the prosecutors said, so Mr. Mutreb gave the order to kill Mr. Khashoggi. The agents bound Mr. Khashoggi and gave him a large dose of a tranquilizer, which killed him, the prosecutors said. The team then dismembered him and gave his remains to a local collaborator to dispose of before filing a false report to Riyadh stating that Mr. Khashoggi had left the consulate safely. It was this false report, the prosecutor said, that accounted for the denials and changes in the Saudi story in the weeks following Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Turkish officials have laid out a parallel narrative of how Mr. Khashoggi died, based on what they say is an audio recording of the killing captured inside the consulate. Turkish officials familiar with the recording have said Dr. Tubaigy moved quickly and methodically to dismember Mr. Khashoggi’s body with a bone saw, further suggesting premeditation. The audio recording, shared by the Turks with the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, during her visit last month to Ankara, also appears to cast doubt on the Saudi assertion that Mr. Khashoggi’s killing had not been planned in advance and was not expected by top officials back in the kingdom. According to three people familiar with the recordings, Mr. Mutreb can be heard instructing a superior in Arabic over the phone to “tell your boss” that the mission was accomplished. United States intelligence officials believe the “boss” referred to by Mr. Mutreb is almost certainly Prince Mohammed, the people familiar with the recording said. But those people said that Prince Mohammed’s name is not heard, so the belief that he was the “boss” was a matter of deduction. It is also possible that Mr. Mutreb may have incorrectly believed that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing. Saudi officials disputed that account of the audio recording, saying Turkey had provided a transcript of a recording and allowed Saudi intelligence services to listen to it. The officials said that the recordings heard by Saudi intelligence agents did not contain the phrase “tell your boss.” It is possible that the Turks may have shared their evidence selectively with other intelligence services, including the Saudis and Americans. Saudi officials remain insistent that Prince Mohammed did not know about the killing in advance. “Absolutely, his royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said at a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday. “Sometimes mistakes happen,” he added. “Sometimes people exceed their authority.” Thursday’s statement from the Saudi prosecutor put the blame for the killing squarely on Mr. Mutreb and four other agents the Saudis say were in the room with him when Mr. Khashoggi was killed. In a statement carried by the state news service, the public prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty for those five men and that criminal charges had been filed against them and six others, while the investigation continued. If the death sentences of agents who had worked so closely with the crown prince are carried out, it would surely shock a kingdom where powerful princes often protect those they trust. The Saudi courts could take years to render a verdict and might ultimately reduce the sentences. As an absolute monarchy, Saudi prosecutors and judges all report to the king and his royal court, headed by Prince Mohammed. Scholars of Saudi Arabia said the capital punishment of five government agents could carry a high cost for Prince Mohammed. “It would send a really bad message to his close allies and the people he has trained to carry out these operations: They are not safe if things go wrong and they are the ones to be blamed,” said Madawi al-Rasheed, a professor at the London School of Economics. “But if he does not kill them, how does he protect himself from the international outrage?” Professor Rasheed added. “It is a double bind.”",The New York Times
2018,Saudis Want a U.S. Nuclear Deal. Can They Be Trusted Not to Build a Bomb?,"WASHINGTON — Before Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was implicated by the C.I.A. in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, American intelligence agencies were trying to solve a separate mystery: Was the prince laying the groundwork for building an atomic bomb? The 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne had been overseeing a negotiation with the Energy Department and the State Department to get the United States to sell designs for nuclear power plants to the kingdom. The deal was worth upward of $80 billion, depending on how many plants Saudi Arabia decided to build. But there is a hitch: Saudi Arabia insists on producing its own nuclear fuel, even though it could buy it more cheaply abroad, according to American and Saudi officials familiar with the negotiations. That raised concerns in Washington that the Saudis could divert their fuel into a covert weapons project — exactly what the United States and its allies feared Iran was doing before it reached the 2015 nuclear accord, which President Trump has since abandoned. Prince Mohammed set off alarms when he declared earlier this year, in the midst of the negotiation, that if Iran, Saudi Arabia’s fiercest rival, “developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” His negotiators stirred more worries by telling the Trump administration that Saudi Arabia would refuse to sign an agreement that would allow United Nations inspectors to look anywhere in the country for signs that the Saudis might be working on a bomb, American officials said. Asked in Congress last March about his secret negotiations with the Saudis, Energy Secretary Rick Perry dodged a question about whether the Trump administration would insist that the kingdom be banned from producing nuclear fuel. Eight months later, the administration will not say where the negotiations stand. Now lurking behind the transaction is the question of whether a Saudi government that assassinated Mr. Khashoggi and repeatedly changed its story about the murder can be trusted with nuclear fuel and technology. Such fuel can be used for benign or military purposes: If uranium is enriched to 4 percent purity, it can fuel a power plant; at 90 percent it can be used for a bomb. Privately, administration officials argue that if the United States does not sell the nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia someone else will — maybe Russia, China or South Korea. They stress that assuring that the Saudis use a reactor designed by Westinghouse, the only American competitor for the deal, fits with Mr. Trump’s insistence that jobs, oil and the strategic relationship between Riyadh and Washington are all far more important than the death of a Saudi dissident who was living, and writing newspaper columns, in the United States. Under the rules that govern nuclear accords of this kind, Congress would have the opportunity to reject any agreement with Saudi Arabia, though the House and Senate would each need a veto-proof majority to stop Mr. Trump’s plans. “It is one thing to sell them planes, but another to sell them nukes, or the capacity to build them,’’ said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Following Mr. Khashoggi’s death, Mr. Sherman has led the charge to change the law and make it harder for the Trump administration to reach a nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. He described it as one of the most effective ways to punish Prince Mohammed. “A country that can’t be trusted with a bone saw shouldn’t be trusted with nuclear weapons,” Mr. Sherman said, referring to Mr. Khashoggi’s brutal killing in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. Nuclear experts said Prince Mohammed should have been disqualified from receiving nuclear help as soon as he raised the prospect of acquiring atomic weapons to counter Iran. “We have never before contemplated, let alone concluded, a nuclear cooperation agreement with a country that was threatening to leave the nonproliferation treaty, even provisionally,” said William Tobey, a senior official in the Energy Department during the Bush administration who has testified about the risks of the agreement with Saudi Arabia. He was referring to the crown prince’s threat to match any Iranian nuclear weapon — a step that would require the Saudis to either publicly abandon their commitments under the nonproliferation treaty or secretly race for the bomb. The Trump administration declined to provide an update on the negotiations, which were intense enough that Mr. Perry went to Riyadh in late 2017. Within the last several months, a senior State Department official engaged in further discussions over the deal in Europe. The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement: “The Saudi government has repeatedly confirmed that every component of the Saudi atomic energy program is strictly for civil and peaceful uses. The Saudi government has decided to move with this project not only to diversify energy sources but also to contribute to our economy. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly called for a Middle East free from all forms of nuclear weapons.” Saudi Arabia has long displayed interest in acquiring, or helping allies acquire, the building blocks of a program that could make nuclear weapons and protect the kingdom from potential threats from its neighbors — first Israel, then Iraq and Iran. The Saudi government provided the financing for Pakistan to secretly build its own nuclear arms, the first “Sunni bomb,” as the Pakistani creators of the program called it. That financial link has long left American intelligence officials wondering if there was a quid pro quo: that if Saudi Arabia ever needed its own small arsenal, Pakistan could provide it — perhaps by moving Pakistani troops to Saudi territory. The Saudis were also thinking of delivery systems. In 1988, the kingdom bought medium-range missiles from China that were designed to be fitted with nuclear, chemical or biological warheads, drawing protests from American officials. Riyadh’s worries spiked in 2003 when it was revealed that Tehran had secretly built a vast underground plant for enriching uranium — a fuel for nuclear arms and reactors. Back then, the Iranians made the same argument that the Saudis are currently making: that they needed to possess all of the production facilities necessary for fueling nuclear power plants. (The Iranians in 2011 opened one such plant, a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, built by the Russians.) That insistence is what set off the Iranian nuclear crisis. Over the years, several nations have demonstrated that it is possible to turn ostensibly civilian programs into sources of bomb fuel, and thus atomic warheads and military power. Israel recently released an archive of material, stolen from Tehran in January, to prove that the Iranian government deceived the world for years. The Saudis, meanwhile, had no equivalent facilities. They promised to get them. “Whatever the Iranians build, we will also build,” Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi intelligence chief, warned as the Obama administration sought to negotiate what became the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Under that pact, Iran is currently spinning a small number of nuclear centrifuges, though it had to ship 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country. The Saudis believe they need to be positioned to match Iran’s every move, though experts say it would take a while. “No one thinks the Saudis would be able to do this anytime soon,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “They couldn’t plausibly build a weapon without outside help.” The core challenge for the Trump administration is that it has declared that Iran can never be trusted with any weapons-making technology. Now, it must decide whether to draw the same line for the Saudis. The United States’ own actions may be helping to drive the Saudis’ nuclear thinking. Now that the Iran agreement, brokered with world powers, is on the edge of collapse after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States, analysts are worried that the Saudis may be positioning themselves to create their own nuclear program in response. The kingdom has extensive uranium deposits and five nuclear research centers. Analysts said Saudi Arabia’s atomic work force was steadily growing in size and sophistication — even without producing nuclear fuel. Saudi leaders saw a political opening when Mr. Trump was elected. In its early days, the administration spent considerable time discussing ways that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states could acquire nuclear reactors. Michael T. Flynn, who briefly served as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, backed a plan that would have let Moscow and Washington cooperate on a deal to supply Riyadh with reactors — but not the ability to make its own atomic fuel. As a precondition, American economic sanctions against Russia would have been dropped to allow Moscow to join the effort. Mr. Flynn was fired in early 2017 as questions swirled around his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, including about ending the trade restrictions. In late 2017, Mr. Perry, the energy secretary, picked up the nuclear cooperation issue. Excluding Russia, he began negotiating with Riyadh over the terms. Whether the Saudis would be banned from fuel production quickly became a flash point in Congress. At his Senate confirmation hearing in November 2017, Christopher A. Ford, the assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, called the safeguards a “desired outcome.” But he equivocated on whether the United States would insist on them. Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described the administration’s approach as “a recipe for disaster.” In February, Mr. Perry led a delegation to London to discuss a pact that would ban fuel production, known as a 1-2-3 agreement, for at least 10 to 15 years. (As it happens, the time frame is about how long the Iranians are banned from fuel production under the Obama-era nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump has called “a disaster.”) The Saudi delegation was led by the energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who resisted the proposal. Nuclear experts said the kingdom wanted to build as many as 16 nuclear power plants over the next 20 to 25 years at a cost of more than $80 billion. Recently, it scaled back its initial plan to the construction of just two reactors. Westinghouse, based in Pennsylvania, would provide the technology, but probably under a license to South Korean manufacturers. The crown prince made headlines in March by shifting the public discussion over Riyadh’s intentions from reactors to atomic bombs. In a CBS News interview, he said that if Iran acquired nuclear arms, Saudi Arabia would quickly follow suit. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb,” Prince Mohammed told “60 Minutes.” “But without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” A few days later, Mr. Falih, the energy minister, raised concerns about the outcome of negotiations with Washington by insisting publicly that Riyadh would make its own atomic fuel. He said in an interview with Reuters that he was hopeful for a deal. “It will be natural,” he said, “for the United States to be with us and to provide us not only with technology, but to help us with the fuel cycle and the monitoring, and make sure we do it to the highest standard.” But Mr. Falih emphasized that the kingdom had its own uranium deposits and wanted to develop them rather than relying on an overseas supplier. “It’s not natural,” he said, “for us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Save Us, Al Gore","Another Florida recount prompts appreciation of a man nothing like Donald Trump. Opinion Columnist Time and Donald Trump do interesting things to a man. They make Al Gore glitter. It’s almost impossible not to be thinking of Gore this week, with the words “Florida” and “recount” so prominent in the news, and it’s hard not to credit him with virtues absent in Trump and increasingly rare in politics these days. Grace in defeat, for one. For another: a commitment to democracy greater than a concern for self. Sure, the review of ballots that Gore’s campaign demanded in 2000, as he and George W. Bush waited tensely to see who would get the Sunshine State’s electoral votes and become president, was a rancorous affair lousy with recriminations. But after the Supreme Court halted it, Gore didn’t reject that ruling as partisan, rant about rigged systems, rail about conspiracies or run around telling Americans that he was their rightful leader, foiled by dark forces. He felt that the stability of the country hinged on the calmness of his withdrawal. So he told Americans to move on. Then he did likewise, a decision that seems positively exotic in retrospect. Joe Biden, 75, is contemplating a third bid for the presidency, even though bids No. 1 and 2 raised questions about his ability to get to the finish line with both feet on the ground rather than one in his mouth. Bernie Sanders, 77, also seems to be mulling another run. And there are people unconvinced that Hillary Clinton, 71, has fully surrendered her Oval Office dreams. Several prominent Democrats — including Mark Penn and Andrew Stein in an essay in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday — have suggested that she may give Hillary 2020 a whirl. While that’s highly doubtful, she hasn’t rushed to throw buckets of cold water on it. Gore, 70, is younger than all of them. Like Clinton, he can proudly point to a lengthy political résumé — including senator and vice president, in his case — and to having won the popular vote. But while scores of Democrats are mentioned as possible contenders for the party’s next presidential nomination, he isn’t. When a new try for the White House made the most sense for him, in 2004, he took a pass. There were many reasons, including this: His ambition had parameters, and he possessed the ability to cede the spotlight even when it was his to claim. Imagine that. He wasn’t always easy to like. He could be patronizing and stiff. He exaggerated. His judgment wobbled. He let his disgust with Bill Clinton’s conduct eclipse his need for Clinton’s help. But how quaint are those quibbles in the context of Trump? Trump is the yardstick by which every president and near president measures larger than before. Gore is looking good — virtuous, visionary — in many ways. Wildfires are once again ravaging California, and if climate change isn’t the culprit, it’s an aggravating factor — an accomplice. Trump won’t go there. Gore went there decades ago. His documentary “An Inconvenient Truth,” about global warming, came out in 2006, a successor to his best-selling 1992 book “Earth in the Balance,” about our degradation of the environment. Both spoke to a passion and set of principles that transcended political expedience. Imagine that, too. Imagine ending a long and celebrated marriage — as he and Tipper did, in 2010 — and having the restraint and discretion to prevent that from becoming anything close to a media spectacle. Imagine letting go of grudges to the extent that Gore did, at least in terms of his public comportment. As The Times’s Patrick Healy wrote in a 2012 eulogy of sorts for Gore’s abandoned political career, “When people tell him that he would have governed differently than Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore usually replies, ‘You know what: I would have just made different mistakes.’” A close friend of Gore’s told Healy: “He doesn’t let his anger take priority over his policy obsessions, where he still believes he can make a difference.” During the Florida recount in 2000, when the presidency was on the line, it took the Gore and Bush teams weeks to ratchet up their language to a level in the vicinity of where Trump and Rick Scott, the Florida governor, started out. Scott, running for the Senate, was trying to protect his lead over Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, and increase the Republicans’ Senate majority. He and Trump quickly raised the specter of voter fraud and election theft even though Scott was poised to win, even though his narrow margin of victory compelled a recount under Florida law, and even though there was no real evidence of wrongdoing. In Trump’s case, that’s unsurprising. He complained about illegal voting and a rigged result before Election Day 2016, presaging a refusal to accept the results as legitimate if he lost. He’ll almost surely do the same in his re-election effort. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” Shaun Bowler, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, told me. “Britons and Americans have been very smug for two or three generations now: ‘We know how to do democracy, and we’re committed to it.’ But in the last couple of years in both countries, that’s just not the case.” Bowler, an expert in comparative electoral systems and voting behavior, said that many Americans and some politicians, especially on the right, “are drawing into question the legitimacy of the system as an election-winning tactic. They’re doing this for short-term gain without thought to long-term erosion.” The greatest perils are a widespread loss of faith in the process and unwillingness to honor its outcomes. That was precisely what Gore sought to avoid in 2000. The Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, who was one of the Gore campaign’s principal spokesmen, recalled that Gore issued “an edict to the team not to do things that would question the integrity of our electoral system.” Lehane also reminded me of the previously reported detail that when the recount was stopped, Gore “emailed me on my BlackBerry: ‘Don’t trash the Supreme Court.’” In an interview with The Washington Post in 2002, Gore noted that he could have “launched a four-year rear-guard guerrilla campaign to undermine the legitimacy of the Bush presidency, and to mobilize for a rematch.” Some people urged that. But, Gore added, “There’s so much riding on the success of any American president and taking the reins of power and holding them firmly, I just didn’t feel like it was in the best interest of the United States, or that it was a responsible course of action.” Those read like lines from some fairy tale at this point, and so do parts of his concession speech shortly after the Supreme Court ruling. “I accept the finality of this outcome,” he said. “This is America, and we put country before party.” We do? Maybe we did. I thank Gore for the reminder. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni).",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Save the Germs,"With modern medicine killing off whole categories of bacteria and viruses — including benign ones that promote health — scientists propose a way to preserve microbes that may rescue us one day. Ms. Schenck is a documentary filmmaker. Set in a tuberculosis sanitarium in the Swiss Alps on the eve of World War I, Thomas Mann’s novel “The Magic Mountain” delves deep into the “feverish process of decay and repair” that is life. In the century that has passed, the use of antibiotics made tuberculosis disappear from the modern world. But now a drug-resistant form of this horrible bug has appeared — and we have nothing in our medicine chest with which to fight it. Enamored of the antibiotics’ power, medicine has overprescribed them, making a new pandemic possible when the old strain of bacteria adapted. But humans are resilient too, and we’ve known for decades about “good germs” that can resist or defeat “bad germs” in our bodies. The trouble is that industrial environments, antibacterial drugs and sophisticated medical procedures can kill off those good germs while letting bad ones grow unchecked. Last month, a team of scientists led by Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, a Venezuelan now at Rutgers University, suggested a source of new cures: Create a global microbe vault or system of vaults, perhaps where the climate is easy on refrigeration, to collect and preserve such beneficial microbes, particularly from countries least affected by modernization. Who knows the magic that surviving ancestral biotics might hold for understanding and curbing today’s diseases? In the magazine Science, Professor Dominguez-Bello, Rob Knight of the University of California, San Diego, Jack A. Gilbert of the University of Chicago and Martin J. Blaser of New York University Langone Medical Center argue for the urgency of preserving stool samples and matter swabbed from the skin, mouth, vagina and nose, especially from remote traditional peoples, before modernity kills off these microbes. The key to understanding the proposal is that not all germs are bad. Some bacteria and viruses aid digestion; others regulate immune systems. But modern medical, dietetic and hygiene practices have put many on the endangered list. The scientists argue that the diversity of the human populations in which they occur creates diversity in how they function. There are even germs that display “amphibiosis”: They can be good or bad depending on which other microbes are present, or on their human hosts’ genes, age or environment. Put simply, while we were nearly eradicating TB, the arsenal of wonder drugs — along with practices like elective cesarean sections, processing foods and purifying water — were carpet-bombing many good microbes, alongside toxic germs, that come with birth. We get them when we squeeze through the birth canal and when we drink breast milk — a co-evolution of mothers and microbes unbroken for at least 200,000 years. Researchers like Jeff Leach, who has studied Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, and Cecil Lewis and Alexandra Obregon-Tito, who have worked with the Matses people in Peru, have documented that beneficial germs have been disappearing less often in less developed societies. Americans may have lost half their microbial diversity in recent decades. In China and India, the loss grows ever faster as those countries’ development accelerates. Research also points to a strong link between this loss, especially in early life, and the epidemic-level increase of many terrible diseases and disorders. In Canada, Meghan Azad has shown that babies receiving antibiotics are likelier to become overweight children and teenagers; research by Brett Finlay and Marie-Claire Arrieta shows that if babies 3 months old lack normal levels of four key bacteria, they are predisposed to asthma. And evidence grows that diminished microbial diversity may trigger or worsen inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes, food allergies and autism. An example of a vault’s potential benefit comes from Dr. Blaser, one of the writers in Science: “For most infectious diseases, there isn’t 100 percent mortality. Our ancestors survived many plagues with the help of their microbes. While antibiotics can cure us from some diseases, resistance to these powerful drugs is growing. New treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections, like multi-drug-resistant TB, could come from our ancient microbes.” New treatments could mean newly discovered antibiotics or uses for bacteria-eating bacteriophages. Stool samples would contain viruses also from a person’s digestive tract, which could, in theory, point toward a cure for drug-resistant TB and other maladies. Creating the vault could also increase technology transfers to the developing world. Professor Dominguez-Bello argues passionately that making it a public resource could catalyze the creation of local microbe collections around the world. Many questions remain unanswered: Would a vault offer long-term preservation only? A working collection for countries and researchers? What would be the criteria for a withdrawal — a W.H.O. declaration of a medical emergency? But the thinking behind the project is sound. We should muster resources to halt the loss of good germs, and restore their diversity and population. You can’t restore microbes that have gone extinct. The key to success is to keep in balance Mann’s “feverish process,” which is life itself.

2018,Opinion | Saving Wilderness Areas Before It’s Too Late,"letter The Wildlife Conservation Society says we must act to save what little remains of the world’s wilderness. To the Editor: Re “Why I’m Giving $1 Billion for the Planet,” by Hansjörg Wyss (Op-Ed, Nov. 1): The Wildlife Conservation Society applauds Mr. Wyss for his $1 billion commitment to preserving the Earth’s remaining wild places. Bold philanthropy is vital to advancing new protections for nature’s strongholds on land and at sea. Our research recently published in Nature found that we have lost 77 percent of the world’s wilderness. We must act now to save what remains, and we share Mr. Wyss’s vision and optimism about what can be accomplished if we rally the global community around the ambitious goal of protecting 30 percent of our planet’s wild places by 2030. Through decades of experience partnering with governments, local communities and indigenous people to preserve the world’s great wilderness areas, we know that this approach works. A 2015 study by a consortium of Amazon NGOs found that deforestation rates in the Amazon are more than five times lower inside indigenous peoples’ territories than for the region as a whole. What we do next will determine whether we secure a foundation for the global recovery of nature.

In a way, Anna Harrington was one of the lucky ones. When Pilotworks, a chain of incubator kitchens, suddenly closed last month, it left 175 small food producers in New York and elsewhere without professional kitchen space. Ms. Harrington, who makes savory and sweet cookies called the Rounds, was scheduled to begin working at Pilotworks in Brooklyn, but it closed two days before she was going to start. She found a different commercial kitchen. “I am in much better shape than the producers who have been in there for a long time and have to move all of their things on very short notice,” she said. “The only nice thing about a crisis such as the current Pilotworks situation is how much people are willing and happy to help each other.” Ms. Harrington’s savory cookies are buttery, appetite-whetting and delicious, perfect for holiday entertaining in flavors like parmesan-olive, Cheddar-chive and anchovy-scallion.

2018,Saying Goodbye to Glamour,"Unbuttoned The glossy magazine is pivoting to digital. It should have gone out of print with a bigger bang. It should have been bigger. More momentous. When you are holding something in your hands that is the last of its kind, you feel as if it ought to be more … special. A collectible. Something worthy of a time capsule, or a memory box. But the last regular print issue of Glamour, which landed on newsstands on Tuesday, ahead of the magazine’s complete pivot to digital (with, O.K., the occasional special physical product, exactly when to be determined), is an anemic little thing, not even 100 pages. On the cover there is a blond Amber Heard in a light blue shirtdress perched on the hood of a red convertible and a few halfhearted plugs for what’s inside: “365 Days Worth of Ideas and Inspirations” “Meghan Markle’s Major Fashion Impact” and so on. There’s no drumroll for the “goodbye to paper,” no editor’s letter extolling the virtues of the more immediate future — we’re off the newsstand but on all your devices! There are no clues that this is a milestone moment in the struggle for survival of old media, and how women relate to the sisters-in-arms-advice-over-wine voice of the magazine, one that is now moving from their mailboxes to their inboxes. It is, consequently, both an anthropologist’s treasure, a perfect example of what exactly the problem is with legacy fashion magazines in the early 21st century — stories that can’t get published until well past their relevancy date (hasn’t everyone done that Meghan Markle piece?), fashion we’ve all seen before (hello, Instagram!) — and one that is entirely disposable, despite some smart articles. But thus does print go out: not with a bang, but a fizzle. That’s evolution for ya. To be fair, Glamour’s last regular issue is also a January issue, which is traditionally one of the thinnest of the year even in healthy magazine times. (Only July/August can rival it.) And chances are, when it was put together a few months ago, the decision had not yet been confirmed that it would be the end of the run, so perhaps it could not have been signposted in the pages themselves. And maybe Condé Nast, which owns Glamour, was leery of calling too much attention to the change, wanting it to seem like no big deal. (That seems likely given that it made the announcement about print two days before Thanksgiving, when attention was on meal plans, not on media.) Glamour is not by any means the first glossy to pivot to all digital. Teen Vogue, Self and Redbook all got there first; Seventeen practically at the same time. But Glamour was once the cash cow of Condé Nast, the 80-year-old workaholic women’s magazine that powered the shiny town cars at the curb. If the move to abandon print can happen there, it can happen to any denizen of the newsstand. And indeed, given the shake-up announced at Condé Nast this week, with its American and international arms scheduled to merge under a single chief executive, who knows what the future may hold for the glossy stable. So isn’t it about time we started thinking about planning the transitions better? Not just in terms of how they are spun in the media, or handled in-house, but how they are marked for posterity. If we’re going to say farewell to all that, why not say it with feeling? Pay homage to a past that meant something to the women who paid for it, while acknowledging it was time to move into the future? The two are not mutually exclusive, though we tend to treat them that way. It wasn’t as if we (the we who follow such things, anyway) didn’t know this was coming. It will come for us all, in the end. Those vaunted September issues have been shrinking for a while now. Millennial readers want what they want when they want it: witty commentary on Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin now, not three months after it happens. And when Glamour’s longtime editor Cindi Leive resigned last year and was later replaced by Samantha Barry, a “digital native” from CNN, it seemed pretty clear the groundwork was being laid for the magazine to go into that good digital night. Whoops! Sorry, “future.” The strange part, given the current news, is that Condé Nast didn’t announce both new editor and new format in one fell swoop. (Maybe the company worried that would be too much too fast.) The pity is that executives didn’t use the many months in between the two to think about the progression. After all, it’s not as if there’s no history to talk up. Glamour occupied a very specific place in the landscape of women’s fashion magazines for a very long time. That’s why many readers took to social media in the hours after the closure was announced to mourn its print demise. It “feels like my teenage self is getting a golf club to the back of the knees,” went one post. “End of an era! My mom was always a subscriber (then so was I) I thought it was the quintessential fashion mag that was still accessible to women in diff economic backgrounds,” went another. If Vogue was about aspiration in a dreaming-of-fabulousness way, Glamour made substance and hard work stylish. It may have been born Glamour of Hollywood but quickly moved on from that to calling itself just plain Glamour — the magazine “for the girl with the job.” (That was in 1943.) It combined fashion and politics, that high/low frivolous/serious duo, long before Teen Vogue existed. It put an emphasis on accessible fashion before Zara and H&M were invented. It was one of the first American fashion magazines to put a black woman on the cover, in August 1968: Katiti Kironde, a Harvard student who was the winner of the magazine’s “best-dressed college girls contest,” which became “college women of the year” and included Diane Sawyer, Martha Stewart, Curtis Sittenfeld and Tamira A. Cole. It created Dos and Don’ts. It tackled abortion early on. It was the place former President Barack Obama chose to declare his feminist leanings. Lots of stuff happened in those pages when there actually were pages — the kind you turn, instead of swipe or click. Acknowledging that in some way, perhaps by creating a souvenir of the moment it vanished into the maw of the internet, would have been to everyone’s advantage. We manage life transitions via ritual. Why not manage stuff-of-life transitions with ritual objects? The January issue could have been the perfect opportunity to create the first special issue, one that functioned as a bridge between past and future. Instead we got the last same old thing. Something for well-dressed sister mags to consider when their pulp-and-ink number is up.",The New York Times
2018,Saying Goodbye to the Man Who Brought Australia’s Cafe Culture to Life,"Critic’s Notebook The killing of Sisto Malaspina, which is being treated as terrorism, leaves Melbourne grappling with the loss of two lives that capture Australia’s greatest hopes and fears around immigrants and what they bring to our shores. MELBOURNE, Australia — On Nov. 9, a Somali-born man named Hassan Khalif Shire Ali set his car on fire in the heart Melbourne’s Central Business District, and then began to attack random bystanders with a knife. Before the police shot and killed Mr. Ali, he managed to kill one man and seriously injure two others. The man he killed was Sisto Malaspina. He was 74, and the longtime owner of Pellegrini’s, a cafe unlike any other in Melbourne, and perhaps all of Australia. Two days later, I went and stood outside Pellegrini’s along with hundreds of other mourning customers and friends. The Red Cross was on hand with therapy dogs. Flower bouquets were piled around the building, and handwritten tributes papered the windows. One note written in wobbly scrawl read: “Sisto, you are truly a Melbourne icon. Our hearts are broken.” The attack, which is being treated by the police as an act of terrorism, was deeply shocking to Melbourne on a number of levels. It leaves the city grappling with the loss of two lives — that of Mr. Malaspina and his attacker — which between them encapsulated all of Australia’s greatest hopes and fears around immigrants and what they bring to our shores. But the death of Mr. Malaspina is especially cruel and his life is worth contemplating. A few years ago, after more than two decades living in the United States, I set out to write a loving tribute to my hometown of Melbourne. The resulting story was big and unwieldy and full of longing. Its central question was: what is it about Melbourne that is so magical? The answer to that question might well be: Pellegrini’s. In my ode to Melbourne, I told the story of the place. It was the city’s original espresso bar and when it opened in 1954, it paved the way for the incredible cafe culture for which the city (and this country) is now known. I quoted my father, who remembers the cafe’s opening as being “the beginning of Melbourne becoming what it is.” The story of Pellegrini’s really is the story of Melbourne, the story of wave after wave of immigrants giving the city its multifaceted vibrancy. It helped build Melbourne’s European-style devotion to pleasure, where good food came from casual cafes as often as from fancy restaurants, where coffee and wine and conversation flowed across well-worn counters. Pellegrini’s counter was long and narrow, a wooden ribbon between customer and creator. In almost every photo you see of it there is conversation between a customer and a smiling gesticulating Sisto. Usually, he is the photo. He was Pellegrini’s. Mr. Malaspina was born in Italy in 1944, and came to Australia in the 1960s, one of hundreds of thousands of Italians who migrated here during the 20th century. Like many of his countrymen, Mr. Malaspina fell into the restaurant business, and in 1972 he and business partner, Nino Pangrazio, bought Pellegrini’s, the iconic espresso bar on Melbourne’s Bourke Street, just steps from Victoria’s Parliament House. The cafe has barely changed since its opening. Its red sign is heritage listed. Its menu of simple pastas might as well be heritage listed as well — and for the last half century, the person likely to greet you when you entered was Mr. Malaspina. Because of this, and because a visit to Pellegrini’s was such a rite of passage, Mr. Malaspina interacted with an uncommon number of locals and visitors. It’s hard to imagine one person in Melbourne who touched more lives. Whenever I returned to Melbourne, an espresso at the counter of Pellegrini’s was a necessity, and Mr. Malaspina’s hospitality and jaunty colorful kerchief were like beacons of home. Much of Melbourne, a city deeply loyal to its own though less well known to the world than Sydney, felt the same way. At the state funeral held for Mr. Malaspina on Tuesday, I sat with more than 1,300 attendees, who included dignitaries, state government leaders, and the wife of the prime minister. The city’s Saint Patrick’s Cathedral provided overflow seating outside, and the service was broadcast on screens in Melbourne’s Federation Square. A state funeral for the owner of a cafe might seem unlikely, but it gives you an idea of the love Melburnians have for this one restaurant and this one man, and the reverence Australians have for this particular type of immigrant story. “Sisto Malaspina’s story is an Australian story,” said Victoria’s governor, Linda Dessau, during her welcoming remarks at the funeral. “He came to a country of new promise for himself and for his future family. He appreciated the opportunities that were offered to him, and he prospered from those opportunities because he worked so very hard.” Throughout the ceremony, the violent circumstances of Mr. Malaspina’s death were only touched on in passing. Speakers focused on Mr. Malaspina’s love for his customers, and his wild sense of fashion was discussed extensively. Harold Mitchell, a television executive who was one of several friends to provide eulogies, went so far as to tear off his black tie and jacket and don colorful alternatives in homage to Mr. Malaspina’s love of vibrant clothing. Only Ms. Dessau, the governor, spoke directly of the attack. “The mark of the man is that so much high praise had already been written about him well before last week’s terrible tragedy could ever have been imagined,” she said. “And, indeed it was a tragedy, and one that we need every voice to condemn, to condemn such a wicked act and the perpetrator of it.” “But these are the times when we need to stick even closer to one another, to seek unity not conflict, and to hold to our hopes much more closely to our fears, even when it’s hard.” For many Australians, that trick — of holding out against fear — is hard. Polls show support for immigration waning. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is now proposing stricter limits on immigration, and has been accused of using this particular tragedy as a political tool to vilify Muslim immigrants. In contrast, Mr. Malaspina’s son, David Malaspina, struck a tone of inclusivity during his remembrance. He stressed that his father made sure to treat every customer the same, regardless of race, religion, or social standing. “Dad is an example of what makes Melbourne the best city in the world,” he said. “People bring their culture and their dreams with them. Melbourne is a melting pot of these cultures, and that’s what makes Melbourne magical.” Many Melburnians who knew and appreciated Sisto will remember that forever.

2018,Scandal Around Billionaire Prime Minister Leaves Czechs in Limbo,"PRAGUE — A billionaire turned politician sweeps to power by tapping into deep public disgust with a system that many believe is rigged against them. Even before taking office, he has been hounded by controversy about conflicts of interest related to the company he ran for decades. Opponents threaten to remove him. If some of that sounds familiar, Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic and its second-richest person, has long been compared to Donald J. Trump for his populist politics, bombastic style and exuberant wealth. He has also been similarly besieged by opponents he accuses of being part of an organized cabal out to bring him down. On Friday, those tensions hit another high point when lawmakers held a vote of no confidence seeking to end Mr. Babis’s government, the second time they have done so since he came to power more than a year ago. Though Mr. Babis survived the challenge, all sides agree that the conflict has become so venomous that it has paralyzed the politics of this small Central European country at a critical moment when populist forces are threatening to tear apart the democratic gains made since the fall of communism almost 30 years ago. For Mr. Babis, those politics have become increasingly personal. In the most recent and bizarre turn of the scandal, it was reported that Mr. Babis’s eldest son — Andrej Babis Jr., 35, known as Junior — had claimed that his father had had him abducted and held outside the country against his will to prevent him from talking to investigators. In response, Mr. Babis revealed that his son was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2015 and charged the reporters, whom he called “hyenas,” with exploiting his mentally ill son when they tracked him down in Switzerland and interviewed him on the doorstep of his home. Sitting in a conference room outside his office in Prague, Mr. Babis was by turns angry, rueful and deeply emotional. “What if I will say you are a pedophile?” He leaned in closely to emphasize his point. “I will say it 10,000 times, and finally you will be a pedophile. Then start to make your defense. How could you fight against this?” Wojciech Przybylski, the editor of the magazine Visegrad Insight, said that Czech politics was now in a state of limbo — caught between fortifying its democratic institutions and moving in the illiberal direction of other countries in the region. It “has not gone as far as Hungary or Poland, but if it continues along the path it may very soon follow,” he said. “Importantly, the rise of pro-European sentiment in public opinion and increasing mobilization of protesters are showing that there is a new counter-trend,’’ he said, referring to the forces arrayed against Mr. Babis, whom opponents say tends toward a populist, anti-immigrant and increasingly authoritarian approach. ‘‘The important trigger will be next steps or lack of progress by the prosecutors investigating the prime minister’s corruption,” Mr. Przybylski added. Mr. Babis came to power vowing to clean up politics. The credentials he ran on included the argument that he was so rich that he could not be tempted by corruption. But he has never been able to lift himself out of a scandal that dates back more than a decade tied to the conglomerate he built, Agrofert, and that made his fortune — in particular, whether he misused subsidies from the European Union. Tomas Pergler, head of domestic political news at the Prague financial daily Hospodarske Noviny and author of “Babis — The Story of an Oligarch,” said that Mr. Babis had become the country’s largest employer — with some 34,000 people on the payroll — through a combination of hard work and clever tactics. “Agrofert prosperity is to a large extent based on as efficient as possible use of subsidy programs, both from the E.U. as well as the national ones,” he said. “The magic is the structure of the holding that is divided into more than 250 companies. At first sight, smaller agricultural companies of the group receive individually relatively small sums,” he said. But if you add it all up, he said, it amounts to billions. Mr. Babis called Mr. Pergler one of his enemies and said there was nothing wrong with the way he had structured his former company. Still, it was one of those subsidiaries that is at the heart of the scandal plaguing Mr. Babis. In 2007, his company looked at investing in a farm known as Capi Hnizdo, or Stork’s Nest, about an hour outside Prague. Mr. Babis has offered varying explanations about what happened next, but no one disputes that the company decided to set up a subsidiary to develop the property. Mr. Babis, in the interview, said that the project was the idea of his daughter, who loved horses and wanted a place where she could ride. In creating a subsidiary, he was able to tap into some $2 million in European Union funds for the project. However, at the time, he did not disclose the shareholders of the newly formed company. It was only later revealed, under pressure from Parliament, that they included his two children from his first marriage, his current wife and her brother. The revelation — coming long after the former farm had opened for business as a hotel and resort, complete with a horse-riding school — gave his critics new ammunition. Mr. Babis, in the interview, asserted repeatedly that questions had never been raised about the project until he decided to enter politics. Those questions reached full boil as Mr. Babis’s ANO party competed in the parliamentary elections in 2017, with the Czech police bringing fraud charges against him and ten other people, including his two children from his first marriage. When investigators sought to interview the children, their lawyer claimed that both suffered from mental illness and could not testify. It was around this time that Andrej Babis Jr. left the country. In late December of 2017, he sent an email to the Czech police saying he was being held against his will in Crimea. Mr. Babis, in the interview, said that his son had been on vacation, seeking to escape from the media glare, and there was nothing unusual about the trip. Last month, two journalists, Jiri Kubik and Sabina Slonkova, working for the news website Seznam Zprávy, tracked down the son, who was now in Switzerland. With his mother by his side, he at first declined to talk, but then claimed that, at the time of his trip to Crimea, he had been told he could either go on an extended “holiday” or be locked up in a mental institution. Mr. Kubik defended his pursuit of that interview. “Even if he is mentally ill, it does not mean that he cannot speak his mind,” he said, adding that his mother had been by his side the whole time and had never contradicted a word he said. After Mr. Babis flew to Geneva last weekend, however, she issued a video statement saying that the reporters had asked leading questions and taken advantage of her son. Mr. Babis accused the reporters of “terrorizing” his family and aggravating his son’s condition. Critics of Mr. Babis are quick to note that the doctor who had diagnosed his eldest son as schizophrenic, Dita Protopopova, would later work for Mr. Babis at the Finance Ministry and join his ANO party. Shortly after the report about Andrej Babis Jr. was published, she resigned from her position at the National Institute of Mental Health, and stepped down as an elected representative in a district of Prague. Mr. Babis repeatedly said that all the charges against him were part of an orchestrated campaign and that those same people were now trying to use his family against him. Asked if he now regretted getting involved in politics, he said: every day. But just as quickly, he made it clear that he was not going anywhere, no matter the cost. “The truth is on my side,” Mr. Babis said. “I am very sorry this is making negative publicity, because all these people, which want to destroy me based on these lies, of course, hate me, because no one can corrupt me.”",The New York Times
2018,"Scandals Catch Up to Private Chinese Hospitals, After Fortunes Are Made","The Putian network of 8,000 facilities, which expanded rapidly with little government oversight, is facing national outrage and scrutiny over a death and fraud allegations. Mansions built with wealth from the Putian network of private hospitals, behind a pair of farmers in the village of Dongzhuang in southern China.CreditCreditBryan Denton for The New York Times PUTIAN, China — Chen Deliang, wearing an orange tunic, a gold watch and fluffy bedroom slippers decorated with snowflakes and the word “Love,” stood proudly in the 130,000-square-foot temple he had built. He had filled it with pagodas, Buddhas and a towering statue of a local goddess. There were several wings, with bedrooms and an office where he practiced calligraphy. A chain smoker with a wispy beard, he initially hesitated talking about his path to unimagined wealth, but eventually relented with a matter-of-factness that betrayed no sense of smugness: “I was the first person to create everything.” Nearby his family and friends owned mansions, many several stories tall, rising above the unpaved roads and sweet potato fields of the village of Dongzhuang in southern China. They exuded a gaudy opulence — elevators, minarets, gilded gates, fountains with Greek gods. Just days before the Lunar New Year, the most important festival in China, Ferraris and Lamborghinis lined their driveways. Even in a country where multimillionaires are minted daily, Mr. Chen and his brethren are unlikely testaments to the Chinese dream. A middle school dropout turned martial arts performer turned itinerant salesman, Mr. Chen parlayed a remedy to treat scabies into a chain of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases and then into the country’s largest network of private hospitals. Along the way, his relatives and neighbors in Dongzhuang and the surrounding area of Putian got into the same business and also made lots of money. “All of us were from Dongzhuang, and one by one, we started engaging in medicine,” Mr. Chen said. “It was your relatives, his relatives — all of us were relatives.” The Putian system, a loosely affiliated network that traces back to Mr. Chen’s initial forays into medicine, accounts for eight of every 10 private hospitals in the country, some 8,000 facilities. Although they don’t all have the same owners, all were started by people with connections to the area of Putian and are members of the same trade group. They offered a vision of the future of medicine, promising everything the old state hospitals lacked, like well-trained specialists, quick appointments at the click of a mouse and state-of-the-art equipment. Public officials praised the hospitals, while big Wall Street firms invested billions of dollars in them. Then came the scandal. A university student died after a doctor at a Putian-linked hospital tried to treat his cancer with a discredited form of immunotherapy. The case prompted nationwide outrage and protests. Shares of Putian-linked hospitals plummeted. The government announced an investigation into Putian ads. For the Chinese leadership, the death has exposed weaknesses in the country’s health care system. While public hospitals are subject to tighter scrutiny at the national level, private hospitals like those in the Putian network are largely overseen by local governments, many of which don’t have the resources and expertise to police the medical profession. Some hospitals in the Putian group fabricated patients’ testimonies and doctors’ credentials. Others listed false certifications or used outdated treatments. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, called them “harmful hospitals.” Wu Xidong, executive president of the Putian health industry association, which oversees the group of private hospitals, defended its practices and operations. The public anger at Putian hospitals reflected dissatisfaction with poor regulation and the entire health care system, he said. “The patients still give us recognition, isn’t that correct?” Mr. Wu said. “This proves that we have no problems. The state has also not taken any measures against us, right? Because our hospitals themselves are very good.” Mr. Chen, 67, lives a quiet life in Dongzhuang after retiring in the 1990s from the health care empire he created. He drives his golf buggy around the temple complex, which has a statue devoted to Chen Jinggu, a woman who is revered in the area as the goddess of the land. None of the pilgrims seemed to recognize him. Like other Putian tycoons, Mr. Chen has been keeping a low profile. He doesn’t want to talk about the scandal but rails against the “misinformation” out there. “The reports were nonsense. They were a mess,” Mr. Chen said. “Now, when people go and see a doctor, they’ll ask: ‘Is this a private hospital? Should we go in?’ There’s a question mark. Will they be deceived? It’s making things difficult for us.” During the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, doctors were scarce and medicine was limited. Scabies, an itchy, highly infectious disease caused by mites, afflicted many Chinese. “It spread like wildfire,” Mr. Chen said. Mr. Chen saw an opportunity, coming up with a homemade remedy — a combination of nitric acid, mercury and vinegar. Traveling throughout China, he sold it for 30 cents a bottle, 10 times the cost. Mr. Chen made about $2,200 a year, at a time when public servants earned about $5 a month. “The country’s medical system was so backward,” Mr. Chen said. He attracted a core group of disciples, training them in his practice. “None of us had any medical background.” For decades, the Communist Party provided the basics. In the countryside, legions of so-called barefoot doctors, medical professionals with limited training, treated farmers, with the government picking up most of the costs. In cities, most Chinese workers received coverage through their employers, state-owned companies. When China’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, started to open the economy in the late 1970s and introduce market reforms, he took away government subsidies for health care. “Barefoot doctors” lost their source of income, and hospitals were left to fend for themselves. Mr. Chen and his apprentices started renting rooms in small hotels across from bus stations, where there was a lot of foot traffic. They posted ads on utility poles to target more customers. In the decades that followed, Mr. Chen and his partners branched out, starting clinics to treat sexually transmitted diseases. Prostitution was on the rise, and people were embarrassed about going to public hospitals to be treated. The clinics allowed patients to register anonymously. “S.T.D.s are embarrassing. You don’t want anyone else to know,” Mr. Chen said. “You could write down any name — we wouldn’t care.” He and others in the Putian network soon developed a signature style, expanding widely with clinics in nonemergency fields like infertility, dermatology and cosmetic surgery. After clinics, they opened entire hospitals. Mr. Chen bowed out of the business in the 1990s, after a car accident. The network continued to flourish. The group got a major boost from the government in 2003, when China granted private hospitals tax-free status for three years. Severe acute respiratory syndrome had swept the country, forcing the authorities to scramble to get more hospital beds and build more quarantine facilities. And officials realized the public hospitals were insufficient to care for the rapidly swelling population. A decade later, the government, at a meeting of the top party leadership, said it would further encourage the development of private hospitals. Chen Zhili, former vice chairwoman of the National People’s Congress, wrote a letter to the Putian network in 2014, thanking it for “making positive contributions to the development of private medical care in China.” The government backing attracted interest from Wall Street. American financial firms like Sequoia Capital and Morgan Stanley have invested billions of dollars in health care companies in the Putian network. Several of the companies listed their shares on the stock exchanges of Shanghai and Hong Kong. Steven Wang, founder of HighLight Capital, a private equity fund in Shanghai, said he had first heard about the Putian network from his parents, both doctors in public hospitals. When Mr. Wang visited the city of Putian in 2001, he found a place still mired in poverty, but he was impressed by the spirit of the locals. Centuries earlier, the city had been invaded by Japanese pirates. A massacre followed, and people fled to the mountains. They were a people, Mr. Wang said, who could “eat bitterness,” referring to an expression used by Chinese to describe the ability to endure hardship. Mr. Wang invested $150 million in the Putian-linked Angel Group (China) Holding Company, which runs a maternity hospital in the southwestern city of Chengdu. He said the second generation of entrepreneurs from Putian, who followed Mr. Chen and the initial founders, were mostly university educated. So their “knowledge, insights and vision” are different from those of their forebears, Mr. Wang said. “They are full of vitality, are keen to learn, are open-minded and want to improve,” he said. Xing Jiaming was excited in 2015 to start his internship at a marketing firm for Putian hospitals in the cities of Nanjing and Jinan. As an economics student, he thought it would be useful to gain some other experience, especially at a fast-growing business. Over the previous decade, more than 9,000 private hospitals had opened in China, most connected to the Putian group. During his first week at work, he got a plum assignment. A doctor had recently left one of the hospitals, and Mr. Xing was assigned to write up the credentials of the doctor’s replacement. The résumé of the replacement was identical to his predecessor’s. When the intern asked about the similarities, his boss told him to finish. For the Nanjing Brain Hospital, Mr. Xing said, he was told to promote its treatment success rate as 100 percent. He also made up testimonials, including one of a woman in Nanjing who was cured of anxiety after going to a Putian-related hospital. “Everything was fabricated by us,” he said. “None of them was a real case.” Mr. Xing said he and his colleagues had been given templates. “We had to exaggerate the harm caused by the disease,” he said. “The more exaggerated, the better.” The company, he said, had a “professional art team” that would steal online photographs of other people and stick them onto testimonials. Mr. Xing resigned after two weeks. “This phenomenon doesn’t only pertain to the Putian network, right?” Mr. Wu of the Putian health association said. “All over the internet, it’s likely that there are many other businesses who engage in that.” Putian tapped the power of the internet to expand, plowing profits into marketing. Liang Jianyong, a former Communist Party secretary in Putian, said the network invested $1.8 billion in advertising on the Chinese search giant Baidu in 2013. It amounted to nearly half the search engine’s advertising revenue that year, according to the National Business Daily. Baidu declined to comment. Many of the online marketing materials have a similar feel. They feature dozens of specialists, with lengthy résumés promoting “abundant clinical experience” and “praise from peers within the industry.” There are glowing testimonials from satisfied patients with emotional narratives. One details the case of a father who “knelt down” pleading with the chief doctor at the Putian-linked Edward Hospital, in the far western region of Xinjiang, to treat his 5-year-old daughter. She received treatment that was “the most advanced technology in the world.” Some Putian hospitals promoted credentials they didn’t have. Two of the nine doctors advertised on Shenyang Metropolis Hospital’s website are not accredited to work there, according to an analysis of a doctor database run by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, the government agency. Others tried to make it seem they were affiliated with some of the country’s top hospitals. Weining He Mu Jia, one of the 8,000 hospitals in the Putian network, had the patina of legitimacy. He Mu Jia was the Chinese name of Beijing United Family Hospital, China’s first foreign-owned hospital and one of its most respected. President Barack Obama and Gary F. Locke, a former United States ambassador to China, graced the covers of Weining He Mu Jia’s magazines. A photo of Roberta Lipson, the founder of Beijing United Family Hospital, hung in the Weining hospital’s lobby. The photo, which was doctored, featured Ms. Lipson at the grand opening of the emergency room expansion of the “Weining United Family Hospital and Clinics.” The connections were purely show. Despite no relation, more than 20 hospitals in the Putian network have used the Chinese name He Mu Jia or similar variations, according to Ms. Lipson. Her company, Chindex International, has sued six Putian hospitals for trademark infringement, including Weining He Mu Jia. “Every single day in the news, there are people on the internet complaining about them, complaining about malpractice, and it’s our name,” Ms. Lipson said. Beijing United won the trademark infringement lawsuit against the Weining hospital in 2014. But Weining still runs an account on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, with the He Mu Jia name. Wei Zexi, a 22-year-old university student, was lured by the promises of a Putian hospital. With a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks the tissue in the muscle joints, Mr. Wei had undergone three operations, four chemotherapy sessions and 25 radiation therapy sessions and had taken traditional Chinese medicines hundreds of times. With the help of donations, he bought Keytruda, an immunotherapy drug that is not available in most parts of the mainland, for $5,000 in Hong Kong. When none of it worked, Mr. Wei desperately looked online for options. A Putian center at a military hospital in Beijing, appearing at the top of his search results on Baidu, offered what seemed like a miracle: an immunotherapy program called DC-CIK. “As long as you have 1 percent of hope, it is worth using your life to take a gamble,” he wrote in a May 2015 reply to a post on Zhihu, a Chinese knowledge-sharing website. A doctor, a specialist for the Putian treatment center, Shanghai Kangxin hospital management company, told him that the DC-CIK treatment had a success rate of 80 to 90 percent and could extend his life by 20 years. He touted a partnership with Stanford University. His parents borrowed money from relatives and friends for the four treatments, which cost $30,000. Within a few months, the cancer had spread to his kidneys. In April 2016, 19 months after he first sought treatment in the Putian-linked hospital, Mr. Wei was dead. The DC-CIK treatment had been phased out in the United States because it was largely ineffective. There was no partnership with Stanford. Mr. Wei, according his best friend, Wang Xi, believed the treatment was legitimate because of Baidu’s search results. The influential state broadcaster China Central Television had also once interviewed the doctor who treated Mr. Wei. “He felt he was already cautious enough,” his friend said. A nationwide scandal erupted after his death. The Putian network became the emblem of unfettered corruption within the private health care system. Local authorities took particular aim at one of its more egregious violations, operating clinics within other hospitals. The practice had been outlawed years earlier, but many players in the Putian network continued to develop them. In 2017, a court in Anhui Province said a hospital had violated local regulations by renting out several specialist departments in andrology and dermatology, among others, to a man from Putian, who was eventually forced to shut down. That same year, the local governments in the provinces of Liaoning and Henan announced crackdowns on the practice. “China’s health care fraud is pretty rampant,” said Dr. Ma Jun, director of the Harbin Institute of Hematology and Oncology, a public hospital in China’s northeast. “With China’s private hospitals, there are a lot of traps.” In October 2016, Chen Zhanghao paid $580 for nasal surgery in the eastern city of Ningbo at what he believed was a subsidiary of Tongren Hospital, a prestigious hospital in Beijing. He had found the Putian-affiliated hospital on Baidu. According to Mr. Chen, the hospital at the time purported on its website to be a Tier 3 institution, the government’s top classification. Later, Mr. Chen learned, through a freedom of information request, that the hospital did not have the designation and was not allowed to conduct that type of surgery, according to a copy of the government’s response to his request, which was viewed by The Times. (The hospital has since removed the classification.) Mr. Chen, 25, now has difficulty breathing sometimes because his nose either hurts or is congested, he said. He tried looking for the doctors who had treated him, but they have left the hospital, now known as the Ningbo Yinzhou Tongren Hospital. Mr. Chen has nightmares thinking about his surgery. “I just don’t want to think about it anymore,” he said. In March 2017, he joined five other patients with similar problems, protesting outside the offices of Baidu for compensation. They held banners that read: “We are the living Wei Zexis.” Back at his temple, Chen Deliang defended the health care empire that he founded all those decades ago. Mr. Chen said the hospital department that Mr. Wei had visited in Beijing had nothing to do with Putian but was owned by a company from Zhejiang Province. He did not elaborate, and corporate records showed otherwise. When asked about the fake ads, Mr. Chen defended them, saying all ads need to have an element of “boastfulness,” but added that “it’s impossible that they are fake.” He said many Putian hospitals had lost money, struggling to get loans and pay their workers. But when asked how many exactly, he said he could not tell for sure. “We are not selling fake drugs, nor are we deceiving people,” Mr. Chen said. “The government has done nothing to us.” Research was contributed by Zhang Tiantian, Amy Cheng, Tang Yucheng, Elsie Chen and Ryan McMorrow.",The New York Times
2018,Schneiderman Will Not Face Criminal Charges in Abuse Complaints,"After a six-month investigation, prosecutors said Thursday that they would not pursue criminal charges against Eric T. Schneiderman, the former New York State attorney general who resigned in May after four women accused him of assaulting them. The decision not to file charges was announced in a statement issued by Madeline Singas, the Nassau County district attorney, who was asked by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to investigate the case shortly after Mr. Schneiderman left his post. Ms. Singas said the women who accused Mr. Schneiderman of abuse were credible, but there were legal hurdles to bringing charges. She did not elaborate on those obstacles, except to say that some of the accusations were too old to pursue under state law. “I believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team,” Ms. Singas wrote, “however legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution.” Ms. Singas also noted that she had proposed a new state law that would protect victims of sexually motivated violence by making it illegal to hit, shove, slap or kick someone without their consent for “the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.” She added that her inquiry had “found no misconduct” by the staff of the attorney general’s office. Mr. Schneiderman’s sudden resignation, which took place only hours after the accusations against him were published in The New Yorker, was a stunning fall for a politician who had not only risen to prominence as an antagonist of the Trump administration, but who had also played a forceful personal role in the #MeToo movement. The women, who had been romantically involved with him, accused him of choking, hitting and slapping them, sometimes during sex and often after drinking. All of them said the violence was not consensual. In the immediate wake of the allegations, Mr. Schneiderman at first denied assaulting or abusing anyone, saying he had “engaged in role-playing” with the women. But in a statement issued Thursday morning, he apologized both to them and to the people of New York. He also said that he had spent time in “a rehab facility” and was “committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed.” “I recognize that District Attorney Singas’ decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong,” he wrote. “I accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.” One of the women, Michelle Manning Barish, described to The New Yorker being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman so violently and abruptly one day it left one of her ears ringing. Ms. Manning Barish said that when she tried to fight back, Mr. Schneiderman pushed her onto a bed, pinned her down with his body weight and then began to choke her. Ms. Manning Barish said Thursday that she felt “completely vindicated” by Mr. Schneiderman’s apology, which she took as an admission that he had abused her and her fellow accusers. But she called on him to go further and to donate the millions of dollars he collected for his abandoned re-election campaign to groups that combat sexual violence against women. “This is a victory for all women, but we need more than words,” she said in a written statement. In October, another accuser, Tanya Selvaratnam, wrote an opinion article for The New York Times, detailing how Mr. Schneiderman often slapped her until she agreed to call him “master” and sometimes referred to her as his “property.” Ms. Selvaratnam also claimed that Mr. Schneiderman frequently belittled her looks and told her that he could tap her phone and have her followed. “This wasn’t just cruel or weird sex,” she wrote. “It was one element in a larger dynamic of power and control.” On Thursday, Ms. Selvaratnam thanked Ms. Singas “for the care she gave to the investigation.” She added that “this experience underscores the need for legislation addressing intimate violence.” After the allegations were made public, many of Mr. Schneiderman’s allies, including Mr. Cuomo and Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, moved swiftly in asking him to step down. Within two weeks, the New York Legislature voted to confirm Barbara D. Underwood, the state’s top appellate lawyer, as Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement, making her the first woman to hold the post of state attorney general. (On Tuesday, Letitia James, the former New York City public advocate, was elected to the job.) Although Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, initially announced that he would investigate the claims against Mr. Schneiderman, Mr. Cuomo instead appointed Ms. Singas, a career prosecutor who had worked on sex crime cases, to oversee the inquiry. Ms. Singas said Thursday that her investigative team interviewed each of Mr. Schneiderman’s accusers, as well as his security detail, former staff members and other witnesses whom she did not identify. The bill she sent to New York legislative leaders would change the harassment law to cover cases in which someone is subjected to unwanted violence during sex. The law currently says that slaps, shoves or kicks qualify as harassment only if the offender intends to “alarm” or “annoy” the victim, but not when the motive is sexual gratification. Debra S. Katz, Ms. Manning Barish’s lawyer, praised the proposal. “The legislation the D.A. proposed today is crucial to protect victims of sexual abuse and violence from the deeply emotionally scarring injuries they experience in their intimate relationships,” Ms. Katz said. “Without it, abusers can get off scot-free — even when they later admit to the behavior, as Mr. Schneiderman did today.”",The New York Times
2018,Scholar Who Escaped Nazis Dies After a Push by a Subway Rider in a Rush,"Among the thousands of commuters traveling through Pennsylvania Station late last month was Kurt Salzinger, a native of Austria who fled the country as the Nazis marched in. He distinguished himself years later in the United States as a scholar in the field of behavioral psychology. Dr. Salzinger, 89, and his wife were on their way to Macy’s Herald Square on Oct. 27, when a hurried straphanger rushed past them on a subway platform in Penn Station, the police said. The man shoved the couple out of his path with an arm that knocked them both to the ground, Mr. Salzinger’s family and the police said, before disappearing on a southbound 3 train headed to Brooklyn. Strangers rushed to help Dr. Salzinger, who was lying helpless on the platform. He was hospitalized with bleeding of the brain from the fall, and later contracted pneumonia, his relatives said. He died on Thursday. The police and Mr. Salzinger’s family believe his death was an accident, but they are awaiting an official determination from the medical examiner. The encounter was not captured on video, and the police have not yet located the straphanger to interview. Dr. Salzinger’s death was a tragic end to the everyday jostle of straphangers who often move about the city elbow to elbow. But his family said the collision shows a need for more care as people rush to and fro in the subway. “It just shows a complete disregard for the elderly,” Mara Chitayat, Dr. Salzinger’s stepdaughter, said on Sunday at his memorial service on the Upper West Side. More than 100 people attended the service at Riverside Memorial Chapel, where his colleagues and loved ones recalled his sly wit, his passion for his work and his dedication to his wife and children. He leaves behind his wife, Dr. Deanna Chitayat, 85, six children and stepchildren, and four grandchildren. Mr. Salzinger was born in Vienna in 1929. As the Nazis marched into the country in 1938, he escaped with his father, mother and older brother, through an underground Jewish network, Mara Chitayat said. During a two-and-a-half-year journey, they traveled on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Japan, then took a boat to Seattle before finally settling in New York. During the journey, Dr. Salzinger never felt afraid, he told his children, because he trusted his father would protect him. “That security that he had, he passed on to us, and it allowed him to do amazing things,” his oldest daughter, Leslie Salzinger, said. The loved ones Dr. Salzinger’s family left behind all died in the Holocaust, and the ordeal made him an anxious traveler, relatives said. But it also instilled in him a sense of obligation to stand up for what he believed was right, and that included speaking out against the rise of far-right politics in the United States and corporate dominance of American life. “He felt that there were some parallels to what was happening today and he was very angry about it — that it was reminiscent of the rise of fascism,” Mara Chitayat said. He married Dr. Chitayat 38 years ago, and they were inseparable, their children said. They traveled together every day to Hofstra University, where they both worked as professors, said his stepdaughter Aimee Chitayat. When his wife had a bout with cancer, he took a semester off to help out. “He was my mother’s right arm and she was his,” Aimee Chitayat said. Their children recalled weekends on Fire Island, where Dr. Salzinger often spent his time trying to train toadfish, rather than frolicking on the beach. Or he could be found writing books and speeches on animal and human behavior, including schizophrenia. Over his career, Dr. Salzinger wrote or co-wrote 14 books and more than 120 research articles and book chapters, according to a remembrance from Hofstra University, where he worked for 19 years until 2001 and was a professor emeritus. He also taught at Columbia University and City College, and was the former director for science of the American Psychological Association. He peppered his work with literary references, and often infused them with humor, said Dr. Mark Serper, a psychology professor at Hofstra who co-wrote a book with Dr. Salzinger that was published in 2009. “The world has lost another giant among scholars, a singular intellect, a voice of reason and a mensch,” he said. A few days into his hospital stay, Dr. Salzinger suddenly woke up and drew his wife close, reminding her of how they met, his children said. He spoke for about an hour, and even then, found humor. “Hey, what are you doing down there?” Meryl Salzinger, his daughter, recalled him asking as a nurse adjusted his bed linens. When she assured him that the nurse was not trying to take a peek, he responded, “I just don’t want her to be disappointed.” The room erupted in laughter. “We cracked up and he sat back with a satisfied smile,” she said. “It was a testament to his magic that in the middle of the night, he could turn that drab hospital room into a joyous space.”",The New York Times
2018,School District Apologizes for Costumes of Mexican Stereotypes and Border Wall Prop,"The superintendent of an Idaho school district apologized on Friday after photos circulated showing some staff members at an elementary school wearing Halloween costumes depicting Mexican stereotypes and others posing behind a border wall adorned with President Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.” The two photos were among several costume pictures posted to the school district’s Facebook page before being taken down. One showed a group wearing sombreros, ponchos and dark mustaches; the other included staff members dressed in American patriotic gear standing behind what appeared to be a cardboard border wall. By Saturday, 14 staff members who were involved in the photos had been placed on paid administrative leave, The Associated Press reported. The photos of staff members from Middleton Heights Elementary School in Middleton, Idaho, were quickly met with outrage from the local Hispanic community and beyond. The pictures exacerbated a racial divide in a state that is predominantly white but where Hispanic people are the largest minority group. The episode also came at a time when the president has stoked anti-immigrant animus just before the midterm elections. Josh J. Middleton, the superintendent of Middleton School District, has said the school district was investigating what had happened. “Do I think there was a malicious intent in this poor decision? No, I don’t,” he said in Facebook video posted Friday. “Was there a poor judgment involved? Absolutely.” He added that he was “deeply troubled by the decision by our staff members to wear those costumes that are clearly insensitive and inappropriate.” “We are better than this,” he said. “We embrace all students. We have a responsibility to teach and reach all students — period.” A letter addressed to the superintendent from 12 community groups — including the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, Planned Parenthood and Immigrant Justice Idaho — said that “the school and community climate in Idaho continues to grow more harmful against specific groups and identities, including our Latinx friends, family and neighbors.” “The intent or misjudgments of the individuals involved does not undo the trauma experienced by students, families and communities,” the letter said. Middleton, Idaho, is a city of 7,400 just over 20 miles northwest of Boise. During the 2015-16 school year, about 12 percent of students at Middleton Heights Elementary School were Hispanic, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. It was unclear why the employees dressed up the way they did. Two parents who visited the elementary school on Halloween, and who spoke only on the condition that their names not be used for safety reasons, said the faculty was having a costume competition where groups of teachers dressed up to represent various countries. State education officials said complaints — and any possible disciplinary or corrective action — would be handled by the local school board. Dr. Middleton and other school district officials, including board members, did not respond to requests for comment. J.J. Saldaña, who oversees education efforts for the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs, a state agency that serves the Hispanic community, said Friday that he had been inundated with calls from upset parents and community members. “My phone has been ringing off the hook all day,” said Mr. Saldaña, who said he was collecting letters from community members. The photos were particularly concerning, he said, because anti-immigration messages have been used to bully Hispanic children in school settings. For example, he said, during basketball games involving schools with large Hispanic populations, crowds had at times referred to the border wall to taunt players. “We’ve already been hearing since the last presidential election that Hispanic kids have been taunted with that: ‘We’re going to build a wall’ or ‘Your parents are going to be deported,’” Mr. Saldaña said. “They are still getting taunted and teased and bullied with that, so being an educator, an adult doing this, it’s heartbreaking.” Jon Yorgason, who has children who attend Middleton Heights Elementary School, said the Halloween event was supposed to be fun, though part of it was mishandled. “This was just a Halloween dress-up day,” he said. “Adults have blown this out of proportion. This was really something fun for the kids — that was the intent.” But he said there was a difference between dressing up as another culture and depicting a border wall, which is one of the country’s most sensitive and contentious political issues. “The wall — considering the current environment of our country, the political environment of our country — I would have hoped that some adults could have seen better to make a smarter choice on that,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Scientists Find a New Way to Take the Oceans’ Temperature,"Editors’ Note: November 14, 2018 An earlier version of this article included a conclusion from a study about ocean warming that is now in doubt. The researchers are working to revise their study because of errors detected in their calculations and it appears unlikely that they will be able to support their original conclusion that the oceans have warmed an average of 60 percent more per year than the current official estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The sections of the article dealing with that conclusion have been removed and the headline has been updated. How do you take the ocean’s temperature? The question might sound like the prelude to a children’s joke. But for climate scientists, the answer has serious consequences. Climate change is rapidly warming the world’s oceans, killing off aquatic organisms — like coral reefs and kelp forests — that anchor entire ecosystems. The warmer waters also cause sea levels to rise and make extreme weather events like hurricanes more destructive. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global organization for climate data, released a major report predicting that some of the worst effects of climate change — including coastal flooding, food shortages and a mass die-off of coral reefs — could come to pass as soon as 2040 if human greenhouse gas emissions continue at current levels. The I.P.C.C. report showed that scientists may have been underestimating the severity of the world’s present climate trajectory. If scientists can more accurately measure the speed at which oceans are warming, they can better predict the future effects of climate change. A study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, led by Laure Resplandy, a biogeochemical oceanographer at Princeton University, used a new approach that derived ocean temperatures by measuring the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere. Those gases dissolve in ocean waters, but the amount the ocean can hold depends on its temperature. “As the ocean has been warming, it’s basically pushing out oxygen and carbon dioxide,” said David Nicholson, an associate scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved in the study. As Dr. Resplandy put it: “If you leave a Coke outside in the sun, it’s going to warm and it’s going to lose the gas. It’s a little bit the same idea.” Scientists normally measure ocean temperatures using thermometers, but stitching together a global temperature record requires thermometers around the globe. Global temperature records were spotty before 2007, when an international consortium began a program, known as Argo, creating an international network of ocean-temperature-measuring instruments. But a group from Scripps Institution of Oceanography had been taking careful measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1991, for unrelated reasons. Dr. Resplandy and her team used that data set for this study. Dr. Nicholson said the study was an example of how collecting data now can have unexpected benefits later. “It kind of supports the importance of collecting these long-term time series even if it isn’t apparent at the start what the outcome will be,” he said. This year is on track to be the third consecutive hottest year on record. Where does that heat go? The oceans, mostly. There are some caveats. This is a novel approach, and it is unclear if it will hold up to further scrutiny. Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, noted that the methodology works best over long periods of time but does not detail what happens year to year. Dr. Resplandy said her work did not upend the I.P.C.C. report’s warnings that humanity has only a couple of decades to ward off some of climate change’s most catastrophic effects. “It doesn’t change the results,” she said. “What it does is that it makes it harder to get there.” For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.",The New York Times
2018,Scott Pruitt’s Environmental Rollbacks Stumbled in Court. His Successor Is More Thorough.,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Before resigning as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency this year, Scott Pruitt delighted President Trump with his zeal for proclaiming sweeping regulatory rollbacks, even though he left behind a trail of courtroom setbacks. Andrew R. Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist whom Mr. Trump plans to nominate to lead the E.P.A., has been quietly cleaning up the mess. Where virtually all of Mr. Pruitt’s hastily written rollbacks and suspensions have been blocked by the courts, Mr. Wheeler has taken a far more deliberative approach, immersing himself in the legal intricacies — a strategy that could make Mr. Wheeler one of the most effective drivers of the Trump administration’s ambitious plan to rewrite the nation’s rule book on the environment and climate. “He’s done a fantastic job,” Mr. Trump said Friday of Mr. Wheeler, who has served as the E.P.A.’s acting administrator since Mr. Pruitt stepped down in July amid a wave of ethics scandals. Supporters say the White House sees in Mr. Wheeler the anti-Pruitt: drama-free, low-key, and, most importantly, able to get the proposed rollbacks through the courts. In doing this, however, Mr. Wheeler has already found himself at odds not only with conservative groups but others within his own administration. But these tensions underscored what many say is the essential difference between Mr. Trump’s first and second choices for E.P.A. chief: Where Mr. Pruitt sought the limelight, Mr. Wheeler sweats the details. And that could make him a far more formidable weapon than his predecessor in the Trump administration’s vast reshaping of environmental and climate rules. “Andy Wheeler is one of the few calm spots in the turbulent seas of this executive branch,” said Scott Segal, a fossil fuel lobbyist for Bracewell who has worked closely with Mr. Wheeler. “That must come as a pretty welcome relief to this White House.” He also has “sufficient process understanding to make that agenda stick,” Mr. Segal added. This summer, for instance, the E.P.A. took steps to replace the Clean Power Plan, a major Obama administration policy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The new version of the plan is significantly weaker. But Mr. Pruitt had wanted to eliminate the program entirely, while Mr. Wheeler, according to several industry sources, insisted that the government was legally obligated to have a climate plan. Therefore, eliminating the Clean Power Plan without replacing it could be challenged in court and leave an opening for even tougher regulations under a future Democratic president. “I got phone calls from conservatives wanting to know, ‘Why did we do anything? Why are we putting forward a proposal at all?’” Mr. Wheeler acknowledged in an interview last week. His argument, that more restrictive replacement is better than killing off the climate regulation entirely, won the day. Then, in August, the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department moved to gut another major federal effort to combat climate change by relaxing rules aimed at reducing car tailpipe pollution. The Trump administration plan also voided California’s ability to set its own, stricter standards, triggering a potentially ugly legal battle between Washington and blue states over the ability to fight global warming. Mr. Wheeler, according to several people involved in the discussions, pushed back forcefully against an analysis used by highway officials to justify the rollback, which argued that stricter fuel pollution rules would cause thousands of deaths in road accidents. The agency argued that more efficient cars are less safe because they are lighter. People who have attended meetings with Mr. Wheeler said he argued that the fatality numbers relied on bad calculations and were likely to be successfully challenged in court. Mr. Wheeler on Friday denied that he had clashed with Jeffrey A. Rosen, the chief Transportation Department architect of the auto-standards rollback, saying he merely sought to understand his colleagues’ mathematical modeling and legal reasoning. “I wanted to make sure what we were putting forward would be upheld in the courts, and he assured me that the work they had done would be,” Mr. Wheeler said. A department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Tuesday that there was “no dispute” between the agencies. Mr. Wheeler’s predecessor, Mr. Pruitt, faced more than a dozen federal investigations into his conduct, including his extensive use of first-class air travel, renting a condo from the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before the E.P.A. and enlisting aides on personal tasks like buying a used mattress from Trump International Hotel and seeking a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. The grandson of a coal miner and an Ohio native, Mr. Wheeler studied biology in college and got his first job after law school in the 1990s working at the E.P.A.’s office of pollution prevention and toxics. He later worked in the Senate for 14 years, most of that time for Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who has denied the established science of climate change. During that time, Mr. Pruitt was seen as a protégé of Senator Inhofe. The senator last week said he strongly supported Mr. Wheeler’s nomination. As an energy lobbyist since 2009, Mr. Wheeler’s top client was Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of one of the country’s largest coal companies, a fierce opponent of E.P.A. climate change regulations and a denier of established climate science. Asked last week to describe his understanding of the best available science on global warming, Mr. Wheeler said: “I think climate change is happening. Man has an impact. CO2 has an impact.” It’s not a full acceptance of the scientific consensus that humans are the dominant cause of rising global temperatures. But it’s closer to it than the positions of Mr. Pruitt, who falsely claimed that there was “tremendous disagreement” among scientists about how great a role humans play in driving warming, or Mr. Trump, who said “I don’t know that it’s man-made.” Still, Mr. Wheeler argued, sweeping regulations, like the plan put forth by the Obama administration to force a shift toward renewable energy by asking states to reduce emissions from coal plants, would have “basically ended the coal industry in the United States.” “People have to realize the use of coal worldwide has not peaked,” Mr. Wheeler said. Since taking over as acting E.P.A. administrator, Mr. Wheeler has replaced Mr. Pruitt’s artwork of Henry Clay, a former senator and secretary of state, with wall hangings of the Senate roll call vote for a highway spending bill he helped pass in 2005 and the bronze medals he earned for budgetary work at E.P.A. in the 1990s. He said he has not needed to use the $43,000 secure phone booth Mr. Pruitt installed. He also has made a point of being more deeply involved in the agency’s inner workings. He visited all 10 of the E.P.A.’s regional offices at the start of his tenure and has involved the agency’s longtime career employees in policy meetings, things Mr. Pruitt hadn’t done. Moves like these have won praise from some of Mr. Pruitt’s fiercest critics. “He’s somebody that respects the institution of the E.P.A.,” Kevin Minoli, the E.P.A.’s former top ethics counsel who had called for investigations into Mr. Pruitt, said of Mr. Wheeler. That hasn’t endeared him to environmental groups, however. In fact, many say Mr. Wheeler’s softer touch has made it harder to focus the public’s attention on his weakening of clean air and water laws. “In some ways Pruitt distracted from some of the very negative things that were going on in environmental law, but in other ways there was a lot of attention being paid to E.P.A.,” said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director for the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental nonprofit organization. Analysts on both sides say Mr. Wheeler is more pragmatic than his predecessor and more disciplined. Where Mr. Pruitt would throw his energy into ideological battles, like trying to create support for a military-style televised debate of climate science, Mr. Wheeler has eschewed the limelight and strategically focused on a handful of major policy initiatives. Under Mr. Wheeler’s watch, the E.P.A. has moved forward with rolling back or weakening every major Obama-era climate change regulation. In addition to the proposal to loosen car pollution rules, those moves include replacing a landmark effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants with a plan that the agency says will see air pollution actually rise, and reducing limits on methane pollution, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells. He also has focused on work begun by Mr. Pruitt to revise Mr. Obama’s clean water regulation, known as the Waters of the United State rule, saying on Friday that the revisions “will be coming out soon.” He has taken on an effort to weaken and perhaps repeal a 2011 rule that limits mercury, a toxic chemical that is emitted from coal plants. And, while he has pushed back to 2020 a plan initiated by Mr. Pruitt to impose broad new restrictions on the types of scientific research the E.P.A. uses to write regulations, he said he fully intended to finalize it. Emails obtained by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, have found that Mr. Pruitt’s political staff excluded the E.P.A.’s chief science adviser from helping to design the rule. The group says the absence of scientists in the writing of the regulation undermined the administration’s argument that the proposal was done in the interest of science. “Which is why we’re taking our time with it now,” Mr. Wheeler said. “It was proposed before I got here.” However, under Mr. Wheeler, the E.P.A. also has eliminated the office of chief science adviser. “By word and deed, Wheeler is proving to be as bad and dangerous as Pruitt,” said John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Conservatives see Mr. Wheeler and his predecessor in a different light. Among them is Myron Ebell, who led Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. transition team. “Pruitt was an outstanding advocate for the Trump agenda, and now it’s up to Andy Wheeler to be the outstanding implementer of the Trump agenda,” Mr. Ebell said.

2018,"Scouring for Stacey Abrams Votes, Georgia’s Democrats Keep on Campaigning","ATLANTA — The allies of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate trailing in the Georgia governor’s race, hit the streets and the phones on Friday in a vigorous last-minute push to get anyone who cast a provisional ballot to ensure that their vote would count, in the hopes of forcing the close, bitter and expensive contest into a runoff. It was a dramatic and unorthodox political effort, a kind of post-campaign campaign to give Ms. Abrams the chance to go into a Dec. 4 overtime round with Brian Kemp, her Republican adversary. Earlier this week, Mr. Kemp declared victory in the race and argued that no math could bring his total to less than 50 percent, which would automatically force a runoff. Mr. Kemp currently has 50.3% of the 3.9 million total votes cast, leading Ms. Abrams by about 63,000 votes. President Trump, who has endorsed Mr. Kemp, declared him the victor on Twitter Friday. “It is time to move on!” he said. It is not clear whether there are enough uncounted votes to help Ms. Abrams. She needs to amass about 24,000 votes to prompt a recount, and is just shy of 26,000 votes to pull Mr. Kemp below a bare majority and force a runoff next month. The office of the secretary of state — which was occupied by Mr. Kemp until he resigned on Thursday — said on Wednesday night that it believed fewer than 25,000 votes remained to be tabulated across the state, including fewer than 22,000 provisional ballots. Ms. Abrams’s campaign questioned those statistics, contending that with military and overseas ballots facing a Friday deadline for return, there was no way for the state to know how many ballots were pending. The suspicion about Mr. Kemp’s motives run deep in Georgia. He has overseen legal purges of more than 1.5 million inactive voters, and moved more than 50,000 voters to “pending” status because their registration forms did not precisely match personal information on government databases. He has also basked in the support of Mr. Trump, who has made numerous unsupported voter fraud allegations. Two days before the election, when Mr. Kemp was still serving as secretary of state, his office announced, with scant evidence, that it had opened an inquiry into the Democratic Party of Georgia for an attempted hacking of the voter registration system. Democrats assailed the announcement as bogus, and a political stunt. “What Georgia and the country is witnessing in this election is blatant and callous voter suppression,” said State Senator Nikema Williams, state director of Care in Action, an advocacy group for domestic workers that also arranged much of the postelection phone banking. “We are doing everything we can to defend democracy in the cradle of the civil rights movement.” Late Friday, a pair of groups, including Care in Action, said that at least 12 of Georgia’s 159 counties had “prematurely certified election results.” Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for the Georgia secretary of state, did not immediately respond to a message on Friday. Mr. Kemp has called accusations of voter suppression a “farce,” and noted that registrations rose about one million statewide after he took office in 2010. There was also widespread mistrust about his office’s claims about the number of uncounted ballots. “I don’t trust anything he says around the numbers,” Ms. Williams said in an interview. “What I do want to make sure is that every vote is counted.” The effort to lock down the provisional votes unfolded Friday as an end-of-day deadline approached. The activists’ main target on Friday were those Georgia voters who had showed up to vote but had some kind of issue proving their identity at the polls. Such voters were allowed to vote with a provisional ballot on Tuesday, but their ballots would not be counted unless they returned to their county elections boards with a valid ID to rectify any outstanding problems. We’re tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins. In Fulton County, which covers much of Atlanta, those problems had to be addressed before a 5 p.m. deadline. And so a call for help went out among grass-roots liberal groups around the state. At a maze of cubicles at an office space in Atlanta’s Candler Park neighborhood, individual volunteers showed up after heeding calls pinging around online grass-roots networks, and began dialing as part of an effort overseen by Care in Action. In front of them computers gave names of voters who were thought to have voted provisionally — lists that activists had demanded from elections officials in Georgia’s 159 counties. Marisa Franco, a 27-year-old volunteer and a psychology professor, called a voter and, reading from a script, said, “The Georgia election isn’t over yet.” She continued: “You need to go to your county election office ASAP to verify your ID. Once you go, ask them to give you proof that your vote has been counted.” Professor Franco saw the call for volunteers on Facebook. “I feel like there is a lot of despair around a lot of the voter suppression things going on in Georgia,” she said. She also held out hope that the votes could be found somewhere, and that Ms. Abrams would be able to fight on. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think she had a chance,” she said. The campaign also extended to cities in Georgia’s south, like Albany and Savannah, where Ms. Abrams performed well, and in Atlanta’s vote-rich suburbs, former bastions of Republican power that have undergone immense demographic changes and increasingly vote for Democrats in statewide races. Around midday on Friday at the suburban Gwinnett Place Mall, volunteers shuffled into a Democratic office wedged between a shoe store and a vacant space to contact voters who had cast provisional ballots. “I really want Stacey to win, and I think that the whole process with Kemp has been unethical,” said Deb Morelli, a retired paralegal, who drove from neighboring DeKalb County to volunteer after receiving a Thursday night text message asking for her help. “This is amazing for Georgia that we could come close to having a Democrat.” In a lawsuit filed Thursday, Democrats argued that circumstances like Hurricane Michael had kept Dougherty County voters from receiving their ballots quickly. On Friday, a judge agreed, allowing the county to accept ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday and received by Friday. But it was unclear how many ballots would be added to the tally as a result. A few hours before the Fulton County deadline, a group of canvassers with the New Georgia Project, a get-out-the-vote group Ms. Abrams founded, fanned out across the Atlanta University Center, home to a cluster of historically black colleges. This was a sea of voters that had been well fished. Ms. Abrams is a graduate one of the famed schools, Spelman College. A week ago former President Barack Obama went to Morehouse College to stump for her. Still, canvassers asked young people walking by if they had voted provisionally. Patrick McCaskey, a New Georgia Project employee, found one such voter, after many unsuccessful tries. He was a slim young man burdened with a large backpack. “You know, you’ve got to get to the county before 5 o’clock,” Mr. McCaskey said. The young man said something about having to get to class. Mr. McCaskey gave him a flier with instructions, and hoped for the best. “It’s good to put the literature in their hands,” Mr. McCaskey said. “At least it reminds them.”",The New York Times
2018,Seafood From Two Tapas Masters at Saint Julivert Fisherie,"Restaurant Review 10 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie. And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino, Txikito and La Vara, but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of “Blossom.” Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino’s very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It’s a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in “Casino Royale.”) At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep, in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they’re available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideuà, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple’s restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there’s a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing — even when Saint Julivert does them better. The sautéed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I’ll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you’re an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you’ve actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn’t stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there’s an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn’t always take it. I understand why I can’t have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn’t there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert’s issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won’t see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you’re hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that’s worth doing even if you’re not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,Seahawks Seize Inside Track to Wild Card,"Seahawks 27, Packers 24 SEATTLE — After a shaky beginning, Russell Wilson got hot in the fourth quarter and kept the Seattle Seahawks in the middle of the N.F.C. playoff race. Wilson threw for 225 yards, and his 15-yard touchdown pass to Ed Dickson with 5 minutes 8 seconds left was the difference in the Seahawks’ 27-24 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night. [N.F.L. Week 11 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread] In a key matchup in the battle for the two N.F.C. wild-card spots, Seattle (5-5) broke a two-game losing streak by overcoming an early 14-3 deficit. Wilson was shaky at times early in the game, but he was outstanding at the end, capping the winning drive by recognizing a blitz and hitting Dickson quickly for his second touchdown pass of the night. Seattle still has not lost three straight games since the middle of the 2011 season. Aaron Rodgers had a huge first half for Green Bay (4-5-1) and threw for 332 yards, but the Packers had just one scoring drive in the second half, helped by a 57-yard strike from Rodgers to Davante Adams. Rodgers threw a pair of touchdown passes in the first half, but never got the ball back after Green Bay punted with 4:20 left. Seattle ran out the clock, thanks to a pair of runs from Mike Davis. Chris Carson rushed for 83 yards and a touchdown, overcoming the mistake of fumbling on the first play of the game and setting up Green Bay’s opening score. Tyler Lockett had two key receptions late in the fourth, and Doug Baldwin had his first touchdown catch of the season for Seattle. Rodgers was 21 of 30 passing, with 10 of those completions going to Adams for 166 yards receiving. The backup tight end Robert Tonyan had the first catch of his career go for a 54-yard touchdown to give Green Bay an early 14-3 lead. The Packers led by 21-17 at halftime after Aaron Jones caught a 24-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers in the final minute of the half, but Green Bay’s offense was stymied in the second half. The Packers gained just 114 yards in the second half, half of which came on the one throw from Rodgers to Adams. That pass set up 36-yard field goal by Mason Crosby with 8:23 left, but Wilson had one more answer. Wilson hit Lockett on consecutive plays for 18 yards and 34 yards to the Green Bay 16. Two plays later, facing another third-and-long, Wilson recognized the blitz and hit Dickson quickly over the middle to put Seattle in front.",The New York Times
2018,Sean Hannity Erased a Line by Taking the Stage With Trump,"Mediator At 11:02 a.m. on Monday, after the Donald J. Trump for President campaign announced that Sean Hannity would appear at his rally on the eve of the midterm elections, the prime-time star of Fox News posted a Shermanesque tweet: “I will not be on the stage campaigning with the president.” A few hours later, in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Rush Limbaugh’s hometown, Mr. Hannity was on the stage campaigning with the president. By taking part in the rally, Mr. Hannity was crossing the line that had traditionally separated those in the news media — even opinion hosts like him — from the people they are supposed to cover. When Rupert Murdoch and Roger E. Ailes started the Fox News Channel in 1996, they meant to counter CNN, which Mr. Ailes referred to as the “Clinton News Network.” They succeeded in their aim over the next two decades, invoking the slogan “fair and balanced” as they broadcast shows that appealed especially to red-state voters. But after Mr. Trump entered the Oval Office, the network’s opinion hosts — from the cast of the president’s favorite morning show, “Fox & Friends,” to the anchor of “Hannity” — began to cheerlead his agenda more and more. Ratings and revenue increased, thanks to the overlap between the network’s audience and the Make America Great Again crowd. On Monday night, though, with its biggest star joining Mr. Trump at a raucous campaign event, Fox News entered new territory — a thicket in which it’s hard to tell where the network ends and the president begins. The morning after, Fox News employees were complaining about what had happened in Cape Girardeau. [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis.] Mr. Trump introduced Mr. Hannity — an informal adviser and close confidant since the 2016 campaign — as someone who had been “with us since the beginning.” After a firm handshake and a warm bro-hug, Mr. Hannity pointed toward the reporters in the back and said, “By the way, all those people in the back are fake news.” The host and the president smiled as the crowd jeered the press pen — which included the Fox News White House correspondent Kristin Fisher. Then Mr. Hannity delivered, in a thunderous voice, one of the Trump campaign’s slogans: “Promises made, promises kept!” His Fox News colleague Jeanine Pirro also appeared on the rally stage that night. “Do you like the fact that this man is the tip of the spear that goes out there every day and fights for us?” she said, to cheers. For all his many faults, Mr. Ailes understood the value of maintaining at least the semblance of separation between the network and the political party he was effectively commandeering from his desk in Manhattan. And he believed he had to protect his stable of news correspondents and producers to give Fox News some credibility beyond the core viewers who tuned in for its opinion hosts. So, for instance, when Mr. Hannity went to Cincinnati to headline a planned Tea Party event in 2010, the boss forced him to cancel, angry that he had even said yes to such a thing. These days, it seems, Fox News doesn’t have anyone drawing the line. It has been that way since the departure of Mr. Ailes, who was booted from the network in 2016 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and who died the next year. Before he died, Mr. Ailes went to work as an adviser to Mr. Trump. He would not be the last Fox News alumnus to make that move. The network’s former co-president, Bill Shine, followed in Mr. Ailes’s footsteps this year when he became the president’s deputy chief of staff, overseeing communications. Mr. Shine left Fox News at a time when the output from its pundits increasingly matched Mr. Trump’s initiatives and outbursts. Mr. Hannity has called the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, part of a “deep state” conspiracy run by a “crime family.” Laura Ingraham has likened the federal detention facilities holding migrant children to “summer camps.” And Tucker Carlson has described the caravan of asylum seekers as “highly dangerous.” Ainsley Earhardt, a “Fox & Friends” host, did not score one for journalism when she offered an on-air defense of Mr. Trump’s use of the phrase “enemy of the people” to describe the news media. “He’s saying: ‘If you don’t want to be called the enemy, then get the story right. Be accurate and report the story the way I want it reported,’” Ms. Earhardt said. That statement would seem to be the limit for Fox News personalities wishing to please the president. But by taking the stage at the rally, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Pirro showed there was another room nobody knew about. Both-siders may claim that the liberal-leaning MSNBC is nothing more than a reverse image of Fox News. That network can resemble Resistance Central at times, but I have yet to see Rachel Maddow showing up at a campaign event for Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. The morning after the rally in Missouri — after in-house complaints from anchors and reporters and a broader social media backlash — the network issued a statement that mentioned neither Mr. Hannity nor Ms. Pirro by name. “Fox News does not condone talent participating in campaign events,” it said, before referring vaguely to “an unfortunate distraction” that had “been addressed.” But the Monday rally was not the first time the network had gone too far this campaign season. Two weeks ago, a guest on Lou Dobbs’s show on the Fox Business Network, the conservative activist Chris Farrell, made the false allegation that the liberal political donor George Soros, who is Jewish, had paid migrants to come to the United States; he also asserted without evidence that Mr. Soros had undue influence in the State Department. Those false charges hark back to common anti-Semitic tropes. After deafening blowback, Fox News said Mr. Farrell would no longer appear on its channels. And earlier this month, Ms. Pirro headlined a fund-raiser for Scott Wagner, the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania. As The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, she earned $24,500 for serving as an “event speaker.” (Fox News had no official statement on that one.) The only guardians of the old rules separating Fox News journalists from the people they are supposed to cover are the working journalists at the network. Apparently fed up with the caravan hysteria promoted by the prime-time pundits, the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said on-air, “There is no invasion. No one is coming to get you. There is nothing at all to worry about.” Others, like the Fox News anchor Bret Baier and the Sunday host Chris Wallace, have at times made public complaints. As Mr. Wallace once said about the network’s pundits parroting Mr. Trump’s anti-press attacks, “It bothers me.” Such complaints are puny in comparison with the hefty ratings generated by Mr. Hannity, however. The only obvious countervailing force has been the advertisers who have occasionally boycotted the prime-time hosts’ shows. That has had limited effectiveness. When companies pulled their commercials from “The Ingraham Angle” after its host poked fun at David Hogg, a student survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., the show’s ratings went up. Mr. Hannity and Ms. Pirro went to Missouri at a time when the distinction between Fox News and the White House was already blurred. Administration officials with former on-air roles at the network include Ben Carson, the housing secretary; John Bolton, the national security director; Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman; and Mercedes Schlapp, the White House strategic communications director. Oh, and Mr. Trump’s former communications director, Hope Hicks, has been hired as the communications director at Fox News’s corporate parent. Mr. Shine, who effectively succeeded Ms. Hicks at the White House, is a longtime friend of Mr. Hannity’s. He was at the rally on Monday night. And just before Mr. Hannity took the stage, the two shared a celebratory moment that made literal the fusing of the network and the presidency: They high-fived.",The New York Times
2018,Searching Social Media for Clues About Violent Crimes,"Times Insider Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In the last several weeks, my colleagues and I have reported on two suspects in high-profile crimes: Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and Cesar Sayoc Jr., who has been charged with sending explosives through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Mr. Sayoc to be held without bail. In both cases, the social media accounts of the suspects were instrumental in determining possible motives for their alleged crimes. Mr. Sayoc’s Twitter and Facebook accounts were filled with pro-Trump partisan content, right-wing conspiracy theories and violent threats — including some he made against Democrats who ultimately were sent explosives. And in Mr. Bowers’s case, most of his social activity appears to have been online — interviews my colleagues at The New York Times conducted with people who knew Mr. Bowers in Pittsburgh revealed that he didn’t socialize much, and barely made an impression on his neighbors. But he was an active poster on Gab, a social media network beloved by right-wing extremists, where he displayed virulent anti-Semitism and often posted violent rhetoric about Jews. Typically, the first step in investigating a breaking news situation playing out on social media is to save and screenshot everything you can find. Social networks often act quickly to remove the pages of named suspects in high-profile crimes. And if you want to study these accounts, you need the raw material. You also need to verify that the accounts actually belong to the suspect. In Mr. Sayoc’s case, his accounts didn’t match the name given out by law enforcement. On Twitter, he went by “Cesar Altieri.” On Facebook, he went by “Cesar Altieri Randazzo.” Verifying account ownership often takes a combination of conventional reporting (contacting the platforms, as well as law enforcement) and digital forensics. Often, it’s hard to be 100 percent sure, but in the case of Mr. Sayoc, several clues — such as photos of decals posted to his Twitter account that matched the photos of his van — helped us feel confident enough to move forward. While I was verifying Mr. Sayoc’s accounts, my colleagues helped me scrape their contents. My colleague Rich Harris built an automated tool that allows for the mass-archiving of tweets. It’s incredibly useful, and allowed us to save thousands of Mr. Sayoc’s tweets before they were taken down. I also took screenshots of the images that appeared on Mr. Sayoc’s Facebook page, and another colleague, Paul Murray, helped me archive years’ worth of Mr. Sayoc’s Facebook posts. In Mr. Bowers’s case, others first discovered his profile on Gab and, luckily, a few of them archived the contents on archive.is, a website that allows you to save a snapshot of a website at a given point in time. Someone also posted a video to Bitchute, a video-sharing site, that showed a person scrolling through Mr. Bowers’s Gab feed before it was taken down. We used that video, plus the archived posts, to reconstruct as much of Mr. Bowers’s feed as possible inside a Google doc, which we shared with the team reporting on the shooting. Sometimes, once you find one piece of a social media trail — say, a username or alias used on one website — you can use it to find other pieces. Other times, you hit a dead end. I have a small toolbox of apps and utilities I turn to in situations where I need to dig deeper into a given person’s social media presence. But in this case, I didn’t need to — there was more than enough information on each suspect’s profiles to start reporting on them. The point of using social media as an investigative tool is not just voyeurism. It’s often the best way to find the story behind the story. People reveal themselves online, and social media is also increasingly where extremists are radicalized. In the context of a violent crime, it’s often much more useful to know which memes a suspect was posting on Facebook than where he worked, what kind of car he drove, or which bands he listened to. (Although you can find out those things from social media, too.) In both cases, social media provided a trove of evidence. For Mr. Sayoc, I was able to use my archived copies of his social media feeds to reconstruct a picture of his political awakening. Before 2016, he had posted about normal, everyday things — restaurant dinners, sports games, fancy cars. But in 2016, his feeds switched over to politics, and he began posting increasingly sensationalistic stories from right-wing media outlets, along with professions of his love for President Trump. For Mr. Bowers, whose online persona was based in full-throated hatred for Jews, I was able to provide context to the story by explaining the community of extreme anti-Semites that have adopted Gab as their online home. Ultimately, there was no more clear-cut evidence for the nature of his alleged crime than the fact that he posted a final, menacing message to Gab (“Screw your optics, I’m going in”) just minutes before the police say he entered the Tree of Life synagogue and started shooting. Social media will never give a full measure of a person’s motivations. But as more people live more of their lives on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, it’s increasingly important to understand the contours of these networks, including the darker corners where violent behavior can take root.",The New York Times
2018,Searching for an Extra Hour of Sleep ,"The Hunt Burdened with a 90-minute commute from Newark, a teacher scours Harlem and the Bronx for a place with outdoor space — and a shorter trip to work. After he moved to New York in 2001, Darrell E. Roberson bounced around the Bronx and Harlem, often sharing an apartment with roommates. “People were moving in and out of town, or people had life happening, and that caused me to shift my plans,” he said. Eventually he moved out to New Jersey and found himself living in Teachers Village, in downtown Newark — a new development primarily for educators — paying $1,420 a month for a one-bedroom. From there, he commuted to the South Bronx, where he works as a middle-school special-education teacher. It wasn’t until he first made the 90-minute trip that he realized how burdensome it was going to be. With a walk to Newark Penn Station, a ride on either New Jersey Transit or the PATH train, and a switch to the subway in Manhattan, “the commute was really killing me,” said Mr. Roberson, who is originally from Oakland, Calif. “You are on pins and needles: Am I going to get to work on time? Coming home could be even longer. I started thinking, ‘Is this really worth it for me?’” So last spring, after enduring the commute for nearly two years, Mr. Roberson, now 39, resolved to return to New York, preferably to Harlem. He went on the hunt for a one-bedroom with good subway access, laundry in the building and outdoor space. “I like having access to outside without going totally downstairs,” he said. “I want to know what the weather is doing.” His price range was $1,600 to $1,900 a month. But in Harlem, the one-bedrooms he liked rented for the low $2,000s. In the past, broker fees had typically been one month’s rent; this time around, he noticed, they were higher. “The Bronx is just a hop, skip and jump away,” he said to himself. “I don’t need to live in Harlem. I am coming back to the Bronx.” He considered a one-bedroom in an older, six-story building on Cedar Avenue in University Heights. Rents started at around $1,400, but the apartments lacked outdoor space and the building was closer to the Metro-North train than any subway line. Parkchester, the massive housing development on 129 landscaped acres, was an obvious option, where one-bedrooms also started in the $1,400s. Mr. Roberson had friends who lived there and knew it well, but he decided that laundry was a problem. With no machines on site, he would have to make a trek to a laundromat. Mr. Roberson, who has two graduate degrees in education, provides early-intervention services for children after school hours. One client, Julie Barreto, lived with her two young sons in a one-bedroom in the Lafayette Boynton Apartments in Soundview, a neighborhood, like Parkchester, to the east of the Bronx River Parkway. The four-building complex, built in 1969 as part of the Mitchell-Lama development program, has nearly 1,000 apartments. “I know the Bronx well, but for some reason, this side I wasn’t too familiar with,” said Mr. Roberson, who worked with Ms. Barreto’s older son. He started arriving early to their appointments, taking the time to walk through the neighborhood and nearby Soundview Park. The Barretos’ one-bedroom was spacious, with a balcony and a dining room. Mr. Roberson appreciated the unobstructed Manhattan views, even taking some photos from their balcony. “There was something within me that said, ‘I think this is going to be home,’” he said. Ms. Barreto has lived in her apartment for nearly eight years. “I’m new here,” she said. Some of her neighbors have been there for decades. “We started to talk about his life, about our life,” Ms. Barreto said. “I knew he was planning to move because he told me he was waiting to finish his lease. I said, ‘You know, the office is just down the block.’ I encouraged him to move here because it was really convenient for him.” Mr. Roberson saw several one-bedrooms before choosing one on a high floor. Some had shared balconies, partitioned in the middle, but he has his own. His view is slightly obstructed, but it includes the World Trade Center, the George Washington Bridge and La Guardia Airport. The bathroom is small, the closets are large, and the laundry is in the basement. His rent is $1,615. (The application fee is $50 per adult.) “He saw the added value of living here,” said Steve Seltzer, the general manager of the complex. “It is so much more expensive in Harlem.” Mr. Roberson arrived in the summer. “We met in the street the day he moved,” Ms. Barreto recalled. “I said, ‘Wow, we are going to be a neighbor!’” Mr. Roberson’s apartment is near a garbage chute, so he can hear the trash thundering down. And on Saturdays he catches noise from two additional rental buildings currently rising at the complex. But all things considered, he finds his new home sufficiently quiet. “My neighbors are very long-term people here, and that’s a good sign,” he said. “People were very welcoming.” He discovered that one school colleague was a 14-year resident, saying she was “instrumental in helping me get acclimated to my new environment.” Mr. Roberson appreciates the ShopRite that recently opened in nearby Bruckner Plaza. And with outdoor parking at the apartment complex available for $100 a month, he plans to get a car. As for his commute, the trip to school now takes 20 to 30 minutes on the Bx5 bus and the 2 train, giving him an extra hour to sleep every morning. “I love the fact that I live so close to work,” he said. “I remember complaining to my friends. Now they say, ‘You have not complained about your commute whatsoever.’ I don’t have a terrible commute anymore. It just disappeared, and I’ve been happier as a result.” Email: thehunt@nytimes.com For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,Secondary Identity,"daily crossword column Alan Southworth and Yacob Yonas reveal their super powers. TUESDAY PUZZLE — One of the things I really love about the crossword puzzle community (I’m including both solvers and constructors here) is the generosity and kindness shown to those who are new. Solvers teach each other, and many constructors mentor those who would like to try their hands at puzzle-making. Anyone who gets anywhere in a profession understands that they stand on the shoulders of those who came before them. Such is the case today: The constructor, Alan Southworth, made his debut in January with the help of Ryan McCarty, subsequently collaborating with Yacob Yonas to bring you a nice reward either before or after you vote (and please vote). If I had to pick a superpower for our constructors, I think my first choice would be the ability to find the quirks in our language that entertain us; but kindness and collaboration, which keeps this pastime of ours going, would be a very close second. 49A: Hi, kids! There was a time in film when it was popular for people to speak in a kind of slang, and there were approximately eleventy-six synonyms you could use when you wanted to get a man’s attention. You could call them “Bub,” you could call them “MAC,” you could call them “pal.” You could call them “Ray,” but that’s another story. And whatever you do, don’t say “Niagara Falls”: 3D: “Hot rods?” are not cars in today’s puzzle. With that question mark, they are hinting at rods that are actually hot, or POKERS. 42D: It’s tough to know a Pac-12 team just by its distance from the ocean, but I already had the U and the T in there, so I correctly guessed UTES. 51D: Commit this one to memory: A PASEO is a leisurely stroll. Mr. Southworth and Mr. Yonas’ theme dramatically tears off its glasses, ducks into a phone booth (Hi, kids! Ask your parents about phone booths.) and transforms itself into a set of five phrases that all contain the surname ALTER EGO — the 9D revealer — of a popular superhero. The entries are clued to the given superhero. For example, at 18A, the clue is “Superman’s fist?” and the answer is DUKE OF KENT. Fists are slangily called “dukes” (as in “Put up your dukes!”), and Superman’s alter ego was Clark KENT. So his fist would be a DUKE OF KENT. No one tell Prince Edward. Yacob Yonas: I’m ecstatic to be making my New York Times Crossword debut on Election Day; it was such a pleasant surprise when we heard that our puzzle would run today! A bit about me: I’m a 24-year software engineer/singer based in New York City. I’m delighted that my first accepted crossword was a collaboration with Alan, since he was one of the main people who encouraged me to keep crosswording even when I couldn’t solve Mondays. Alan Southworth: This is my second puzzle in The New York Times and, as with my debut co-constructed with Ryan McCarty, I collaborated with another member of our college a cappella group. Yacob and I are now intramural basketball teammates in Manhattan, so I was especially excited to team up with him off the court for his New York Times Crossword debut! I’m confident that Yacob’s data-science skills will help him uncover some clever themes as he continues to construct puzzles for The Times. One of the first theme answers we thought of was 16 letters long, so you’ll notice that the grid is not square today (16x15). Given that we didn’t have any other theme answers that long, we realized two things: We needed five theme answers (the longest across the entire middle row, with two above and two below); and the revealer would be tricky to place. We placed our five symmetrical theme entries fairly quickly, but struggled with the revealer, even debating whether to split it between two answers with cross-referenced clues. Finally, Yacob came up with a heroic solution and found a Down answer where our revealer could cross three of the Across theme answers, et voilà: We had all of the thematic material placed, and the rest of the grid fell into place. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Your thoughts?",The New York Times

2018,See How New York Celebrated Veterans Day,"This year’s parade marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. For Chris Lotspeich, Veterans Day is a family affair. It’s a chance to honor his grandfather who served as a naval officer during World War II, and his cousin who still serves as a colonel. But, for the first time, that family celebration took place on Fifth Avenue, where Mr. Lotspeich, 52, and his family were among the thousands of spectators who gathered Sunday for New York’s annual Veterans Day Parade. “It’s important for people to appreciate the sacrifices of our veterans,” said Mr. Lotspeich, who was dressed in traditional Scottish garb to honor his family’s heritage. This year’s parade — stretching from 26th Street to 46th Street — featured thousands of participants, including members of local military schools, historical societies and active duty military members. Florent Groberg, who received the Medal of Honor for his services in Afghanistan, served as the Grand Marshal. Mr. Lotspeich, who lives in Glastonbury, Conn., applauded the public recognition of veterans, and said he hoped events like the parade would spark improvements to the treatment of veterans. “Our society likes to honor our veterans, but it typically does not follow through with taking care of them in terms of benefits,” he said. “Perhaps this will help build public support for stronger veterans programs and services.” This year’s parade also celebrated 100 years since the end of World War I, and many participants honored that history. “It’s just the icing on the cake,” Myra Carvalho, a Marine Corps veteran, said about the World War I centennial.",The New York Times
2018,See How the Fires Burned Where California Goes to Escape It All ,"Among the blackened and charred areas in Southern California were hiking trails overlooking the ocean, summer camps and historic movie sets. The Woolsey Fire burned down toward the shoreline at Leo Carrillo State Beach in Malibu, Calif.CreditCreditStuart Palley for The New York Times LOS ANGELES — These are the places seared into the memories of local residents, the places many people who just come to visit never see. Now, after the fires that ripped through Southern California this month, they are unrecognizable, or unimaginable, as the spots where nature brought joy, peace or relief. The wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties were nowhere near as deadly as those in the north. But just as they destroyed homes, they also brought a different kind of devastation, ravaging many of the region’s most prized outdoor recreation areas. Almost all of the federal land within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area — a staggering 88 percent, totaling some 20,000 acres — was burned by the Woolsey Fire, according to the National Park Service. Among the blackened and charred are the Old West film sets at the Paramount Ranch, which have been featured in movies and television shows for decades. The 155-year-old Diego Sepúlveda Adobe, a mission station that was still being restored from damage suffered in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, is now “just a shell,” in the words of one archaeologist. At Malibu Creek State Park, the campground survived, but the landscape beyond is largely unrecognizable. That includes the replica of the set from the “M*A*S*H” television series, a supremely popular hiking destination, which had replaced the original set after that was burned in a 1982 brush fire. Two popular Jewish summer camps, Hess Kramer and Gindling Hilltop, were almost completely wiped out by the flames. The list goes on, including Solstice Canyon, the Circle X Ranch and the Peter Strauss Ranch, with its popular concert venue where Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson performed. Residents who have lived through devastating wildfires point out a source for optimism: The moonscapes left behind often give way to a riot of colorful wildflowers and plants, making the cycling, hiking and camping adventures even better.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Seeking Asylum at the Border: Victims, Not Criminals","letter An advocacy group discusses the case of gender-based persecution. To the Editor: Re “Common Sense on the Caravan” (editorial, Nov. 4): As a law student more than 20 years ago, I helped Fauziya Kassindja, a 17-year-old who fled Togo to avoid forced marriage and female genital mutilation. Upon arriving in the United States, instead of finding protection, Fauziya spent more than 17 months in detention. Her case would go on to become a landmark ruling setting the legal precedent for gender-based asylum cases and led to my founding the Tahirih Justice Center. Since then, our pro bono lawyers have represented thousands of women and girls like Fauziya seeking protection from gender-based persecution. Those protections and the vulnerable communities they serve are now threatened if the Trump administration turns away asylum seekers or incarcerates them indefinitely. Seeking asylum at the border is not illegal and is in compliance with United States and international law dating back to the Holocaust. Women like Fauziya and countless others are victims, not criminals.

2018,"Senate Latest, Brian Kemp and Alleged ‘Hack,’ Gun Mailer in Florida: 2 Days to Go","The Tip Sheet Welcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters. • Follow updates from around the country on Sunday. • Just as there’s a consensus in both parties that Democrats are likely to pick up about 35 House seats on Tuesday, there’s a bipartisan view that the outlook for the Senate is … far less clear. • Top officials on both sides agree that Republicans are likely to defeat Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who is roughly 10 points down in the polls. • But every other Senate Democrat is still seen as viable. That itself is rather extraordinary given that Democrats are defending 10 seats in states that President Trump carried. • A new poll on Saturday showed Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri tied with Josh Hawley, the Republican nominee; she was widely seen throughout October as the most vulnerable incumbent after Ms. Heitkamp. Mr. Trump is set to campaign for Mr. Hawley in Missouri on Monday night, joined by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh. Ms. McCaskill, campaigning Sunday outside a Walmart in Ferguson, Mo., suggested that Mr. Trump’s rallies for Mr. Hawley might backfire with voters like the African-American shoppers she was greeting here. “A lot of my constituents at this Walmart, they now identify Josh Hawley as Donald Trump. And that is not a positive thing for most of my constituents here,” she said. “Now, in other parts of the state it may be a very positive thing, so we will have to see how that all comes out in the wash.” • Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, has a small lead in some public polls even as Republicans claim that their surveys have him trailing. • If Democrats manage to lose just the Heitkamp seat, they have a (remote) chance of winning the Senate. They would have to win three of these four Republican-held seats: Texas, Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee. • Of the four, officials in both parties think Democrats are best positioned to win in Arizona and Nevada, where Mr. Trump’s incendiary language on immigration has infuriated Hispanic voters. What’s less clear is which of the remaining two seats is more viable: • In Tennessee, Democrats insist that Phil Bredesen, the former governor, is only narrowly trailing in the Senate race. Public polls, though, show the Republican, Representative Marsha Blackburn, enjoying a lead. • That leaves — yes — the Texas race between Representative Beto O’Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz. Republicans insist that the race is in their favor and that Mr. Cruz leads outside the margin of error in polling. But early voting in Texas is reaching historic levels and veteran Democrats say it’s folly to trust any polling when it’s not clear what the universe of voters could be, given that Mr. O’Rourke has excited many Texans beyond those who usually vote. So, yes, control of the Senate could be coming down to turnout. The office of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also the Republican nominee for governor, said Sunday that the authorities had opened an inquiry into the Democratic Party of Georgia after “a failed attempt to hack the state’s voter registration system.” Mr. Kemp’s office offered no evidence or details of the episode. Democratic leaders called the inquiry an abuse of power and political stunt by Mr. Kemp, given his dual role overseeing an election in which he is also running for the state’s top job. Democrats said any claims of the party being involved in a hack were false. Mr. Kemp’s office disclosed two days before an election in which polls show Mr. Kemp effectively tied with Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the first black woman elected governor anywhere in the United States. Ms. Abrams said Sunday that the hack inquiry was a desperate move on Mr. Kemp’s part. Although Mr. Kemp’s office raised the specter of wrongdoing by Democrats, word of the inquiry was certain to heighten fears that Mr. Kemp was seeking to tamper with the integrity of the election. Democrats have spent weeks calling on Mr. Kemp to resign his post, arguing that he could not independently oversee an election in which he is running. “While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,” Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kemp, said in a statement. “We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.” Rebecca DeHart, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party, said: “This is yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State. To be very clear, Brian Kemp’s scurrilous claims are 100 percent false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp’s official office released a statement this morning. “This political stunt from Kemp just days before the election is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor.” Mr. Kemp’s office said the F.B.I. was notified about the inquiry. Kevin Rowson, a spokesman for the F.B.I. office in Atlanta, declined to comment on Sunday. Mr. Kemp’s dual status as candidate and regulator has been a subject of rancorous debate in Georgia, where allegations of voter suppression have repeatedly been litigated in the courts. As recently as Friday, a judge sided with Mr. Kemp’s critics in one case. Mr. Kemp has broadly decried “this farce about voter suppression” and said he had “made it easier to vote and harder to cheat in our state.” But Ms. Abrams, who made much of her reputation through her work to register new voters across Georgia, argued that voters had “been purged, they’ve been suppressed and they’ve been scared.” Mr. Kemp is set to appear with President Trump at a campaign rally Sunday afternoon in Macon, Ga. Mike Bloomberg and George Soros want to take away Florida’s guns, according to mailers arriving at homes there last week urging support for Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate for governor. The literature — claiming to be from the National Rifle Association’s political arm — says Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the Democratic nominee who is locked in a tight race with Mr. DeSantis, “shares the same radical anti-gun agenda as Michael Bloomberg and George Soros.” • Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Soros favor gun control. And both have been targets of gun rights advocates in the past. Most recently, pro-gun conspiracy theorists circulated a meme suggesting that Mr. Soros funded and organized teenage survivors of the Parkland massacre who became gun control activists. Facebook ads posted by the N.R.A. this year called Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, a hypocrite for using an armed security detail while pushing gun control. Mr. Bloomberg formed the gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety. • In a tweet this week, the N.R.A. took aim at the billionaires, along with Tom Steyer, a California megadonor to Democratic candidates. Mr. Soros and Mr. Steyer were among the targets who had pipe bombs sent to them by a fervent Trump supporter last month. “Another billionaire is pumping unlimited money into electing anti-gun lawmakers,” the tweet said. “Notorious anti-gunner George Soros joins anti-gun billionaires Steyer and Bloomberg. There is no end to how much they’ll pay to push their elitist agenda on Americans.” The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. • Mr. Gillum has said he supports the Second Amendment but favors a series of gun control measures. His campaign has received millions in support from the three men. Mr. Gillum has spent part of his campaign swatting away criticisms over crime issues in Tallahassee on his watch. So Democrats had cause to privately wonder if the fatal shooting at a yoga studio there on Friday might place him on the defensive. On Saturday, after returning home briefly to tend to the situation, Mr. Gillum resumed campaigning and chose to confront the subject directly. “It only, for me, underscores what we have to do just three days from now,” he said at a rally in West Palm Beach, “when we send an unapologetic message to the N.R.A. that their time is up in the state of Florida. In the closing days of the tight Senate battle in Missouri, Mr. Hawley, the Republican candidate, has been fighting off the latest questions about his turbulent tenure as attorney general. His opponent, Senator McCaskill, has seized on a Kansas City Star article that said Mr. Hawley’s “out-of-state political consultants gave direct guidance and tasks to his taxpayer-funded staff” soon after his 2016 election, and followed up to “ensure the tasks were completed, according to emails, text messages and other records.” The same day the article appeared last week, Ms. McCaskill’s campaign tweeted video of Mr. Hawley proclaiming after his election that political consultants would no longer run the state. A Saturday tweet from Ms. McCaskill on the topic simply proclaimed “goodness gracious.” Mr. Hawley, whose team did not comment, has been busy with a string of 11th-hour rallies featuring President Trump (the final one is Monday night), Vice President Mike Pence and Oliver North, the president of the N.R.A. • The president has two campaign rallies scheduled: 4 p.m. in Macon, Ga., with Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor; and 7 p.m. in Chattanooga, Tenn., with Ms. Blackburn. • Our colleagues Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Katie Rogers on the White House team have a really good story about women at Trump rallies who see the president as a hero protecting a way of life.

2018,Senator Tim Scott Sinks Thomas Farr’s Judicial Nomination Amid Racial Controversy,"WASHINGTON — Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone black Republican senator, said on Thursday that he would oppose the judicial nomination of Thomas A. Farr, a lawyer who defended a North Carolina voter identification law and a partisan gerrymander that a federal court said was drafted to suppress black votes “with surgical precision.” Mr. Scott will join Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has vowed to oppose every White House nominee unless the Senate votes on legislation to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. With Democrats united against Mr. Farr, his nomination to a United States District Court appears doomed. Mr. Scott’s decision marks the second time he has brought down a White House judicial nominee who was seen as insensitive or hostile to African-Americans. He had previously helped to sink the nomination of Ryan W. Bounds over his writings in college, which upbraided “race-focused groups” on campus and “race-think.” The Republican Party, Mr. Scott told reporters, is “not doing a very good job of avoiding the obvious potholes on race in America.” The Farr defeat comes just days after Representative Mia Love, the only female black Republican in the House, conceded her failed re-election campaign by blasting her party for ignoring the nation’s minorities. Mr. Scott said on Thursday that he was ultimately too troubled by Mr. Farr’s involvement in one of former Senator Jesse Helms’s racially tinged campaigns. The senator cited a Justice Department memo published this week by The Washington Post detailing an investigation the department launched into the campaign in 1992. The department accused Mr. Helms of intimidating black voters by sending out postcards that suggested they were not eligible to vote and that they could be prosecuted for fraud if they tried. “Weighing these important factors, this afternoon I concluded that I could not support Mr. Farr’s nomination,” Mr. Scott said. Mr. Farr’s defeat is a win for Democrats who, emboldened by an unusual set of circumstances and infuriated by Mr. Farr’s résumé, had mounted an aggressive campaign against him. “Senator Tim Scott has done a courageous thing, and he’s done the right thing,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “Thomas Farr has been involved in the sordid practice of voter suppression for decades and never should have been nominated, let alone confirmed to the bench. Thankfully, he won’t be.” The vote to fill the seat in North Carolina, the nation’s oldest federal judiciary vacancy, dating to 2005, appeared to be one of the toughest yet for Mr. Scott. With Vice President Mike Pence waiting on Wednesday to cast a tiebreaking procedural vote to move Mr. Farr’s nomination forward, Mr. Scott kept his colleagues in suspense, deliberating on his own vote in the cloakroom off the Senate floor for nearly 40 minutes. Mr. Scott voted to keep the nomination alive, but he emerged from the floor clearly frustrated, telling reporters that he was still unsure whether he would ultimately vote to confirm Mr. Farr, whom he had spoken to earlier that morning by phone. His fellow Senate Republicans, meanwhile, had shrugged off criticisms against Mr. Farr, with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling them “utterly false character assassination nonsense.” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Scott, while maintaining that he was still doing his research, told Fox News that one of his chief concerns — Mr. Farr’s role in what he called a “nasty, racist campaign” — had been assuaged. “If he was the architect of that nasty, racist campaign, I would have been a no without any question,” Mr. Scott said. “What I’ve found so far from appointees of the Obama administration to my conversations with them is he was in fact not.” But the senator appeared to change his mind. “This is a massive victory for those who have organized for a year against this nomination,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a liberal group. “It shows what progressives can do when we decide to wage a fight on the courts.”",The New York Times
2018,Senator Urges Trump to Ease Ban on Aid Workers Traveling to North Korea,"WASHINGTON — A Democratic senator has urged President Trump to allow American humanitarian aid workers into North Korea, despite a recent ban on travel to what officials consider a hostile nuclear state but also one of the world’s poorest nations. The senator, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a letter dated Nov. 7 that he was “deeply troubled” by reports that the Trump administration was barring aid workers “from shipping supplies or traveling to North Korea as they seek to provide the most basic humanitarian assistance.” Mr. Markey praised Mr. Trump’s decision to engage in diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, but said the aid workers needed to be allowed to do their jobs. Aid groups provide a range of services, including agricultural training and surgery, but are finding it impossible to enter North Korea because of new State Department restrictions. “The humanitarian situation in North Korea is far too dire for these draconian policies,” Mr. Markey wrote in the letter to Mr. Trump that was also sent to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. In a statement to The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Markey said American interests “are best served when our moral and global leadership are in lock step.” “Addressing the grave security challenge we face in North Korea while also trying to mitigate its longstanding humanitarian crisis will require exactly this,” he said. North Korea suffered a devastating famine in the mid-1990s and has a chronic food shortage. Mr. Markey cited United Nations data that estimates 60,000 children are at risk of starvation in North Korea, and he said drug-resistant tuberculosis, if left untreated, could spread across the country and to neighboring nations. In September 2017, the Trump administration enacted a general travel ban to North Korea after the death of Otto F. Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who was arrested while on tour in the North in 2016. Mr. Warmbier suffered severe brain damage while being detained and was released in a vegetative state in June 2017. He died days later. During the first year of the ban, American humanitarian aid workers were given a “special validation” to travel to North Korea with a one-visit-only passport issued by the State Department. (Journalists traveling there get the same passport.) Some aid workers received the special passport multiple times during that first year, and the ban was renewed in 2018. But in September, aid workers found that State Department officials had begun rejecting their applications for the passport. The letters of rejection said the workers had no recourse for appeal. A dozen American nonprofits work regularly in North Korea. “The potential life-threatening consequences of this policy are far reaching,” said Keith Luse, executive director of the National Committee on North Korea, which represents the groups. The State Department has said each application is determined case by case and must be in line with American interests. The travel ban on American aid workers was reported by The Times and The Wall Street Journal last month. Aid workers praised Mr. Markey’s demand. “Thank you Sen. Markey for holding the administration accountable,” Kee Park, a Korean-American doctor who until this fall traveled regularly with medical delegations to North Korea, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The Trump administration has been looking to exert maximum pressure on North Korea by tightening economic sanctions. That is the main thrust of a plan to force North Korea to end and dismantle its nuclear weapons program. American analysts estimate North Korea has 30 to 60 nuclear warheads and can produce enough fissile material to make six to seven bombs annually. Mr. Trump has been keen to engage diplomatically with Mr. Kim and persuade him to get rid of his nuclear weapons. The two held a historic summit meeting in Singapore in June. But the diplomacy has since stalled, and a critical meeting that was scheduled for Thursday between Mr. Pompeo and a North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-chol, was canceled. Kang Kyung-wha, the South Korean foreign minister, said American officials relayed that North Korea had canceled the meeting, The Associated Press reported on Thursday. Separately, the State Department announced on Thursday that it was imposing sanctions on three individuals and nine entities that support Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The targets of the sanctions are individuals or companies that engage in business in Crimea that further the goals of annexation or carry out serious human rights abuses, the State Department said. “The United States does not and will not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea,” it said.",The New York Times
2018,Senators Ask Verizon and XPO About Pregnancy Discrimination,"Nine senators, led by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote letters to the chief executives of Verizon and XPO Logistics demanding that the companies account for the conditions in a Memphis warehouse where several women suffered miscarriages. The senators’ inquiry was spurred by a New York Times investigation last month that revealed that six women had lost their pregnancies after being denied breaks from heavy lifting at the warehouse. The facility is operated by XPO Logistics and handles cellphones, tablets and other gadgets that Verizon ships to customers on the East Coast. “In light of this latest disturbing report that chronicles XPO turning a blind eye to pregnant workers, we urge XPO to re-evaluate its priorities with its work force and make immediate changes to its current, allegedly deleterious workplace practices,” the senators wrote to XPO’s chief executive, Bradley Jacobs. In a letter to Verizon’s chief executive, Hans Vestberg, the senators urged the telecommunications giant to push XPO to change its practices. The letters ask both companies whether they have policies about providing accommodations for pregnant workers and whether they train their managers to deal with requests for job adjustments from expecting mothers. The senators — eight Democrats and an independent, Bernie Sanders of Vermont — also asked whether Verizon had initiated an investigation into the XPO warehouses that handle its products. The senators asked the companies to respond to their questions by Dec. 4. Representatives of XPO and Verizon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In last month’s Times article, a Verizon spokesman said the company was “deeply troubled” by the issues raised by The Times and said it would open an investigation. An XPO spokeswoman said at the time that workers’ allegations about their treatment at the warehouse “are unsubstantiated, filled with inaccuracies and do not reflect the way in which our Memphis facility operates.”",The New York Times
2018,"Senators, Furious Over Khashoggi Killing, Spurn President on War in Yemen","WASHINGTON — Furious over being denied a C.I.A. briefing on the killing of a Saudi journalist, senators from both parties spurned the Trump administration on Wednesday with a stinging vote to consider ending American military support for the Saudi-backed war in Yemen. The Senate voted 63 to 37 to bring to the floor a measure to limit presidential war powers in Yemen. It was the strongest signal yet that Republican and Democratic senators alike remain vehemently skeptical of the administration’s insistence that the Saudi crown prince cannot, with certainty, be blamed for the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. While the vote showed widespread disapproval of the administration’s stance, it did not necessarily indicate that the measure would ultimately be approved. It took place hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed senators about the Yemen conflict in a classified discussion, which the administration had hoped would persuade lawmakers that Saudi Arabia must remain a vital American ally. But many senators had insisted that Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, also be there to answer questions about Mr. Khashoggi’s death. American officials have said the C.I.A., which Mr. Pompeo led until the spring, has concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the killing in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a stalwart supporter of President Trump in recent months, vowed to freeze the administration’s legislative priorities until Ms. Haspel spoke to the Senate. “I’m talking about any key vote. Anything that you need me for to get out of town, I ain’t doing it until we hear from the C.I.A.,” Mr. Graham told reporters after the 90-minute briefing at the Capitol. He also promised there would “be no business as usual with Saudi Arabia” if American intelligence confirmed that Prince Mohammed was involved in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. One United States official said that was precisely why the administration did not want Ms. Haspel to participate in the briefing. The Khashoggi killing has cast light on Saudi tactics in Yemen, where an economic war has pushed millions to the brink of starvation. The C.I.A.’s press secretary, Timothy Barrett, denied that Ms. Haspel was blocked from attending and noted that agency officials had already discussed its findings with the Senate Intelligence Committee and congressional leaders. The vote was striking for its defections by Republicans who in the past had supported the yearslong military alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia. As part of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which began with a bombing campaign in 2015, the Pentagon is mostly providing military advisers and intelligence. Mr. Graham initially rejected Wednesday’s measure, then huddled with colleagues and switched his vote. Thirteen other Republicans joined all Senate Democrats to end American military action in Yemen — with the exception of operations against Al Qaeda. A similar measure in March was rejected by the Senate, with only 44 votes in support. Senators Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, pushed to force a vote on the latest resolution. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the retiring chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he had previously backed arms sales to the Saudis but was now in a different place. He estimated that 80 percent of the senators who attended Wednesday’s briefing left dissatisfied with the administration’s explanation about Mr. Khashoggi’s death. “As to whether the crown prince was involved in this killing, it’s my belief that he was,” Mr. Corker said on the Senate floor. “It’s my belief that he ordered it.” Prince Mohammed “has done nothing to show ownership over what has happened,” Mr. Corker said. “And that is an affront — not just to the American people, but it’s an affront to the world.” After the briefing, Mr. Pompeo said there was “no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi.” Separately, Mr. Mattis told reporters on the steps of the Pentagon that “we have no smoking gun the crown prince was involved.” The war powers measure still faces several procedural hurdles before a final Senate vote. Even if it is approved, it is unlikely to pass the House before the congressional session concludes at the end of the year. It has a better chance in the House next year, when Democrats take over the majority. The Khashoggi crisis has called attention to a largely overlooked Saudi-led war in Yemen. On a rare trip to the front line, we found Yemenis fighting and dying in a war that has gone nowhere. The final vote in the Senate is likely to be scheduled for next week — giving the Trump administration time to win back Republicans and hold on to a Middle East strategy that has been largely built around a blossoming partnership with Prince Mohammed. Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer at the Brookings Institution, said Wednesday’s vote was one of the gravest threats to the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United States in 75 years. “This is an unprecedented setback for the Saudis and the Trump administration,” Mr. Riedel said. Mr. Mattis and Mr. Pompeo had urged senators against withdrawing military support and warned that doing so could embolden Iran and endanger the United States. They also said the death of Mr. Khashoggi, an American resident and Washington Post columnist, should not eclipse the crucial strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. “The October murder of Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey has heightened the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on,” Mr. Pompeo wrote in an editorial published Tuesday evening in The Wall Street Journal. “But degrading U.S.-Saudi ties would be a grave mistake for the national security of the U.S. and its allies.” Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis have called for a cease-fire in Yemen. Although peace talks between the Saudi-led coalition and its Houthi rivals are scheduled for early December in Sweden, the two sides remain far apart. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, noted that Congress had never authorized the American military’s role in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. “We sent an important message today — that Congress will stand up to Saudi leadership when the Trump administration won’t, and that Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the murder of Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi as well as for the disastrous war in Yemen,” he said. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, initially said Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis had helped persuade him to vote against the resolution. “Based on what they have said today in terms of the peace process — in other words, a commitment to have peace talks — I think voting ‘yes’ would be bad timing,” he said. Two and a half years of war and a crippling cholera outbreak have brought Yemen to the brink of collapse. But later in the day, Mr. Portman voted to at least proceed with debate. Since the complex civil war ramped up in Yemen in early 2015, an estimated 85,000 children there may have died of hunger and 14 million more people have been put on the brink of starvation. It has also evolved into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has aided the Houthis. The Saudi-led coalition has been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights organizations for indiscriminate attacks — including against a wedding party and a school bus that killed more than 40 children — and for failing to pay compensation to the victims. Mr. Pompeo told senators that the kingdom was, in fact, following up on commitments to compensate victims and had “been responsive to international concern about the humanitarian situation,” including by donating relief funding. But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said misgivings about the Saudis were justified. “Senators on both sides of the aisle have legitimate concerns about the war in Yemen, the terrible humanitarian plight of Yemeni citizens caught in the cross-fire and the multiple U.S. interests wrapped up in this conflict,” Mr. McConnell said. He also cited reservations “about the recent conduct of the Saudi government” from senators of both parties. Senator James Lankford, a Republican of Oklahoma who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said that senators were “exceptionally frustrated with the administration’s response, and the lack of strong response toward Saudi Arabia with Khashoggi.” But he noted that without American guidance to the Saudi military, the war and ensuing humanitarian disaster in Yemen could become far deadlier. “If we pull out of helping what’s happening, civilian casualties increase in Yemen absolutely,” Mr. Lankford said.",The New York Times

2018,"Opinion | Send Judges to the Border, Not Troops","The Trump administration’s handling of the migrant crisis is a failure. Here are concrete steps it could take to make things better. Ms. Jacobson was the United States ambassador to Mexico from 2016 to 2018. Mr. Restrepo was a special assistant for Western Hemisphere affairs to President Barack Obama. Trying to stop immigrants as the Trump administration is doing — unilaterally, at the border and with tear gas and troops — is a sign of only one thing: failure. In fact, the administration’s response to the migrant caravan from Central America that recently arrived at the border with Mexico highlights much of what is wrong with American politics and immigration policy today. These migrants, regardless of their reasons for coming, are being exploited and victimized at both ends of their journey: at home by street gangs, human traffickers and major criminal organizations, and in the United States by politicians seeking political gain. Given the situation at the border, there is an urgent need to deploy practical solutions to the challenges of migration with the clear goal of establishing safe, orderly and legal migration. This means that the United States must stay true to its national interests, history, values and legal obligations in the ways it handles people seeking asylum. That does not mean letting in every petitioner. Economic migrants do not qualify for asylum; they should understand that, for them, the perilous journey north will ultimately be a fruitless one. But being scrupulously selective about asylum requests does not mean we should be firing tear gas at families at the border, wastefully deploying troops to string concertina wire as cameras roll, ignoring our historical role as a haven for the persecuted or manufacturing a crisis for political purposes. Instead, the United States and its partners in the region need to address the governmental dysfunction in Central America that is driving so many desperate people to embark on incredibly dangerous journeys in search of a better, more secure life. In the short term, this means radically increasing the United States’ capacity to adjudicate asylum claims. The slow-walking of processing asylum claims, and the huge backlog of cases at ports of entry, are only adding to tensions in the region. More judges and Customs and Border Protection officers, not more troops, should be sent to the border to speed up the processing of claims. The United States also needs to expand its refugee programs in the so-called Northern Triangle of Central America — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — so that people can apply for refugee status while still in their home countries. The United States must also work with international organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration as well as the Mexican government to provide shelter and food to migrants on Mexico’s southern border. The Mexican government has said that Central American migrants in that area, as well as near the United States-Mexico border, can apply for Mexican work permits. At the same time, the United States should increase its funding to and engagement with the United Nations refugee agency to quickly expand Mexico’s ability to process refugee and asylum claims. This would be a major change for the Trump administration, which has been hesitant to work with many international organizations and which pulled out from the United Nations-brokered Global Compact on Migration before it was even finalized. Longer-term work is also essential to break the cycles of lawlessness and economic deprivation fueling migration. The United States should not be threatening to curtail assistance to the Northern Triangle countries, as President Trump has done. Instead, it should be providing additional assistance focused on job creation and strengthening anti-gang and violence prevention programs. Effective but small-scale local programs to combat these problems already exist — they should be expanded so their impact is felt across the region. The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who will take office on Saturday, has spoken of his country playing a more active role in economic development in the Northern Triangle. The United States should leverage that interest to the fullest extent possible. Any effort to promote more stable, sustainable societies in the Northern Triangle must also include the region’s private sector, which should be pressed to contribute financially to American aid packages. And the United States should support efforts to root out corruption that is often fueled by predatory corporate interests. Instead of tough talk and empty gestures, it is time for the United States to provide leadership based on both our national interests and our values. If it is smart and open to working with others, the administration can manage the flow of migrants humanely and efficiently. If it is not, this crisis will only get worse. Roberta Jacobson was United States ambassador to Mexico from 2016 to 2018 and assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs from 2012 to 2016. Dan Restrepo was special assistant for Western Hemisphere affairs for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2012.

2018,Send in the Stagers,"With the real estate market sluggish, a little decluttering won’t be enough to sell your home. Time to turn the space into a showroom. 11 Photos View Slide Show › John and Molly Cesarz have three young sons and an insufficient number of bedrooms to go around. This past August, they decided it was time to put their Upper East Side co-op on the market. Martin Eiden, an associate broker at Compass Real Estate, laid things out for his clients. To ready the apartment for its close-up, the two bedrooms as well as some cabinets would have to be painted, and all the family photographs on display tucked away. The couple, who were preparing to close on a four-bedroom co-op nearby but would have to remain in their apartment for a few months, had fully expected such diktats and nodded agreeably. But Mr. Eiden wasn’t finished. He also wanted to rearrange some furniture and temporarily replace several pieces with things he believed would make the space more pleasing to prospective buyers. The list included lamps, a sofa, an area rug, plants and assorted knickknacks. “Our first reaction was ‘No way,’” recalled Mrs. Cesarz, a high school teacher. As for the couple’s second reaction, well, let’s just say a beloved Oriental rug that once covered the living room floor can now be found tied up in a closet. These days, thanks to New York’s sluggish real estate market, all the world’s staged. Inventory is high, buyers are eager to find fault with a property (get a load of that plaid sectional in the living room and the statue of a shepherdess in the foyer!) and quick to find the exit. Understandably, sellers want to ensure that those prospects — any prospects! — stick around long enough to sniff the fresh-baked cookies. Thus, they are living, and not always happily, in the company of unfamiliar sofas, easy chairs, end tables, headboards and tchotchkes, and relegating much of their own furniture to storage. In some instances, the sellers haven’t yet closed on their new homes and would like to skip the bother and the added expense of a short-term rental. And, of course, many people simply can’t afford to carry two properties, so they’ve got no choice but to stay where they are until they’ve lassoed a buyer. “Staging is the new norm at all price points,” said Stuart Moss, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group. “Back in the day, it was recommended only if the apartment had certain flaws, like a bad view, or relatively a lot of wear and tear, or if the space required a better definition of space.” [Tastes are constantly shifting, but here are the top ten items being used these days to stage apartments.] When the market was booming, even an estate sale might call for only minimal tweaking. “If an apartment was in nice condition with a view, you expected prospective buyers to come in and have their own imagination and know how a room could be laid out,” Mr. Moss continued. “Now every apartment has to be prepared for showing.” As Nicole Beauchamp, a sales agent at Engel & Volkers put it, “Five years ago, the discussion would have been, ‘Let’s declutter, let’s maybe touch up the paint and let’s do a professional cleaning.’ I would have brought up staging only if absolutely necessary. But these days the staging discussion happens at every listing appointment.” And sellers don’t need a lot of convincing. “It used to be that the conversation around staging was, ‘Wait, you’re saying I need to fork over 10 or 20 grand up front, and it might help but it might not?’” said Ari Harkov, an associate broker at Halstead Property. “Now they’re not arguing. They get it.” Disheartening statistics help explain sellers’ willingness to get with the program. In the third quarter of 2018, New York City home sales were down 8 percent from the same period last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade association. Sales in Manhattan had the deepest plunge, of 15 percent, with Queens dropping 9 percent and Brooklyn 7 percent. But the difficult market isn’t the only driver here. “Because of HGTV, we’ve become more visually and design-oriented as a society,” Mr. Harkov said. “Many of us are skimming through Pinterest or looking at photos on Facebook, so we expect to see things look a certain way.” Mr. Moss is currently representing the owners of a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath condo on Riverside Boulevard with water views. “My clients bought it new construction, and a few years ago I would never have bought a stager in,” he said. In a nod to the current climate, a stager was engaged to do the living room and master bedroom to the tune of $3,000 a month. Many stagers typically accept jobs only on properties that have been emptied of furniture — and emptied of occupants. They don’t want the wear and tear on their sofas and rugs; they certainly don’t need the aggravation. But some stagers, loath to miss out on a revenue stream, are taking all comers. “I’ve had to come around and loosen my strings on what we will do,” said Cathy Lorenz, the owner of Cathy Lorenz Designs. Two years ago, 90 percent of Ms. Lorenz’s business was staging vacant properties, and 10 percent owner-occupied spaces. Now it’s a 75/25 split. Staging for a studio runs about $5,000, including the consultation and installation fees and the cost of renting the furniture for three months (although most staging contracts are for six months). The tab can run $40,000 to outfit a Classic Six, depending on how high end a client wants to go. “Everything we bring in has a price tag,” Ms. Lorenz said. Of course, storing a seller’s furniture has a price tag too. Done & Done, a move management and organizing company, charges $400 and up each month, depending on the size of the storage room, said Ann Lightfoot, a founder of the company. If an apartment sells — mirabile dictu — on its very first day on the market, “That’s wonderful news,” Ms. Lorenz said. “But our contract still holds in its entirety because of all the work we already put into the project.” Churchill Living, a furniture rental company often used by stagers, offers a special promotion available only for vacant apartments: Pay for three months, get three months free. “But we’re getting more stagers doing owner-occupied apartments,” said Eileen Guinnessey, a senior account manager at Churchill. Ms. Guinnessey has also seen an uptick in requests for, say, a headboard but no mattress or a dining table but no chairs to go with it. “That’s the kind of order from a stager that tells me someone is still living in the apartment,” she said. Stagers face a particular set of challenges when working on an owner-occupied apartment — the biggest being the presence of the owner and the owner’s stuff. “You can’t do all the things you’d be able to do with an empty apartment, when you have total control of the design and can choose a style and a color palette and make sure everything is the right scale,” said Sid Pinkerton, the owner of Manhattan Staging. When the seller hasn’t moved out, “you’re working with what’s in the apartment,” he said. “The people may have a navy easy chair and a maroon sofa, and I think, ‘Hmmm, now what am I going to do? Maybe I’ll bring in white pillows or a white rug to make the room feel lighter and brighter.’” In some instances, stagers working on an owner-occupied apartment will charge an additional fee to cover wear and tear on the furniture and accessories. Ms. Lorenz has just instituted a 10 percent security deposit on every item from her own inventory. She and several fellow stagers have also established some new terms of engagement. Ms. Lorenz, for instance, will not stage an owner-occupied apartment that has pets. And if she puts a bunch of wine glasses on the bar for show, she said, “we don’t want clients to use the glasses.” For her part, Anne Kenney, the owner of a staging company called Anne Kenney Associates, does not invite client participation in the process. “I have to tell people all the time that they don’t get a vote about the kind of couch or end table I’m going to use, and I have to be very firm on that point,” she said. “I explain to them the difference between interior design, which is for a specific taste, and staging, which has to have broad appeal. That’s our expertise.” Last month, partly in response to the softening market, Compass introduced Compass Concierge, a service that assumes the costs of decluttering, painting and staging clients’ apartments; the cost is repaid by the sellers at closing. “It’s even more important in this climate to put your apartment in the best light,” said Samantha Lynch, the senior director of corporate development and strategic finance at Compass. “The program lets sellers invest in their homes while we assume the upfront costs.” In some cases, real estate agents themselves will take on the role of ad hoc stager, in the interest of saving a client both the cost of furniture rental and the staging fees charged by the professionals. Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers, has a cache of chairs, lamps, glassware, vases and multiple sets of bed linens that she keeps in her own apartment and deploys gratis to dress up residences that she finds wanting. “It tells clients ‘I’m in this with you,’” she said. Mr. Eiden, of Compass, rents a few storage spaces to hold a collection of furniture and accessories (much of it from Wayfair) sufficient to outfit four two- or three-bedroom apartments. “I don’t charge my sellers anything,” he said. “It’s all-inclusive of my commission. That’s how important it is to me.” These part-time stagers may lack a certain je ne sais quoi. “You start to see some of the same accessories at showings,” said Lisa Larson, an associate broker at Warburg Realty, enumerating items like white nailhead love seats, cowhide rugs and small abstract sculptures, including various versions of metal orbs. Ms. Lorenz said she has had many sightings of a certain lightly textured cream-colored rug and a glass-topped coffee table with a gold base. Sellers accept the invasion of the end tables and accent chairs with varying degrees of enthusiasm. “Initially, people are a little bit worried to sit on the sofa that isn’t theirs. They’re a little intimidated by the whole setup,” Ms. Kenney said. “But several of our sellers have thrown parties because the place looks so darn good they want people to come and see it.” Mrs. Cesarz, Mr. Eiden’s client, described her staged apartment as “feeling institutional.” She isn’t wild about all the throw pillows on the bed, and she doesn’t care a whit for the blue-and-white area rug that has taken the place of her Oriental. “But it probably photographs well,” she said. But Mark Mayo and My My Tntien, the parents of two young children, were only too happy for Mr. Eiden to have his way with their two-bedroom apartment in South Park Slope. “A lot of our furniture is stained with baby vomit and milk,” said Mr. Mayo, 40, a data engineer. “Martin showed us a couple of sofa styles, and he let us choose.” Mr. Eiden also switched out the coffee table and TV stand and staged the couple’s roof deck, adding a Buddha statue, an outdoor rug and plants. “We had to water them and everything,” Mr. Mayo said of the plants. Listed at $869,000, the apartment recently sold for $800,000. “Martin told me I would have to lose my sectional and maybe the dining table,” said Alex Hall, 43, whose Mercer Street duplex recently went on the market for $1.5 million. “I was pleasantly surprised that he and his team kept a couple of my things here,” added Mr. Hall, who works in the tech sector. “I mostly love what they’ve done, even though my apartment is no longer perfectly set up for slouching around and watching a movie marathon.” Occasionally, a staged apartment looks so good that sellers rethink their decision to move. One of Ms. Kenney’s first projects was an owner-occupied two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. The clients were suburbia bound. “The apartment wasn’t set up well,” Ms. Kenney said. “Most people aren’t designers; they just do the best they can. We had the sellers take a lot of stuff out, then we rearranged everything and brought in accent pillows and bedding.” She continued: “And when we got done, they said, ‘This is so great. We’re not going to move.’ And I thought, ‘I am never going to work in this town again!’” Three months later, the couple decided, on second thought, that they really did need more space. Mr. Eiden recalled a similar experience, when the owners of a three-bedroom duplex in Chelsea said to him, “Please don’t be mad at us. The apartment looks super great, and we don’t want to sell it.” He had decluttered their apartment, brought in lighting and a clutch of throw pillows, and rearranged the furniture to better define the space. “I made more than my commission back with all the referrals they’ve given me,” Mr. Eiden said. But with staging, as with weight-loss products, results may vary. “I don’t think, in this market, we can guarantee that if you stage you will get X amount more dollars or a bidding war or even the asking price,” said Ms. Larson, of Warburg. “It’s just that this is a buyer’s market with a lot of competition, and we need to check every box we can.” Still, staging does have one invaluable benefit: Like packing up the pots and pans and books and linens, it’s another, well, stage in the letting-go of home sweet home and the moving-on process. “I really think staging in an owner-occupied apartment helps people detach from the property,” said Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers. “Then it becomes a commodity that we’re trying to sell for the best price possible.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,Sending Lewd Nudes to Strangers Could Mean a Year in Jail,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] Rebecca Odorisio was traveling home on a crowded A train on Tuesday when a photo suddenly appeared on her phone from someone identifying himself as “The Enterprise.” It was a picture of an erect penis, sent to her over AirDrop, an iPhone feature that allows users to send photos and documents to anyone within 30 feet who has left that feature open. Disgusted, she quickly rejected it. “I felt like I had been punched in the gut,” Ms. Odorisio, 31, a Brooklyn-based actress and singer, said Wednesday. She said it was not the first time something like that had happened to her, adding, “It was extremely violating.” Kathe Hannauer, 58, had a similar experience last month, as she traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan on a crowded train during the evening rush. When an image of male genitalia suddenly appeared on her screen, she said she felt more surprised than flustered. “It was kind of like, ‘At my age?’” she said. “No one has harassed me in the longest time.” But she worried about what would happen if a young girl was sent such a photograph, so she quickly wrote about the incident on Facebook to warn her friends to turn their AirDrop feature off when they are in public. The two women were victims of what has become known as cyber flashing, a growing trend of technology-enabled sexual harassment. It has become so common that two lawmakers introduced a City Council bill on Wednesday to explicitly make it a crime, punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to a year in jail. One of the first news reports of cyber flashing was in London in 2015, when a female commuter told the British Transport Police that she had received lewd photos on her phone via AirDrop as she traveled to work. Since then, people in New York, Toronto and other cities have written articles, tweeted and posted on Facebook and Instagram about how explicit pictures have showed up on their phones, often while on crowded public transportation. Because AirDrop allows people to send images anonymously, there is no way for a commuter to know who in a busy train car might have sent it. And unlike traditional public lewdness crimes, the sender might not know who exactly within 30 feet is receiving the picture, because the feature identifies nearby phones only by the phone’s nickname. “In the old days, you had to have a long trench coat and good running shoes,” said Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island who is co-sponsoring the anti-flashing bill. “Technology has made it significantly easier to be a creep.” Some people interpret the images as a harmless prank. About a month ago, Michael May, a medical resident in Manhattan, said he was on the A train when a stranger sent him a photo of a completely nude man covering his genitals with a glowing light saber. “I thought it was funny,” Mr. May, 26, said. He looked up from his iPhone to try to determine who had sent it, but everyone around him was staring intently at their phones. Donovan J. Richards, a Democratic councilman from Queens and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation was intended as a bipartisan effort to raise awareness — and to remove the sense of impunity that may embolden those sending the images. “Keep your pic in your pants,” he said, adding, “If you do it, the message we are sending is that the repercussion is a fine or jail time.” AirDrop, which first debuted in 2011, is specific to iPhones and other Apple products. It uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate over a short range to other devices, like other iPhones. More recently, some Android-enabled devices have had access to a similar feature called AirDroid. What makes Apple’s feature particularly vulnerable to cyber flashing is that it automatically shows the recipient a preview of the image, then asks the user to accept or decline it. The only way to block the image is to set the AirDrop feature only for use between phone contacts (which is the default setting from Apple) or to turn it off completely. It is already a misdemeanor in New York State to harass someone by telephone, mail or other forms of written communication. But that law does not explicitly address the issue of visual images. The bill introduced on Wednesday would add language to the city code that would make it “unlawful for a person, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, to send by electronic device an unsolicited intimate image.” Danielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland and the author of a book on hate crimes in cyberspace, said that clarification could be helpful. New York may be the first municipality to consider a specific law targeting the practice, she said. “This is unwanted electronic harassment,” she said. “Just like we have telephone harassment laws that have been upheld by federal and state courts, it is absolutely possible to regulate this.” Ms. Citron said there were no statistics tracking the prevalence of cyber flashing, adding the entire field of electronic harassment is “woefully understudied.” Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, did not address the issue of cyber flashing directly, but said in a statement, “ Any complaints made in regard to aggravated harassment will be recorded and fully investigated.” Mr. Richards said that Apple and other tech companies should share the responsibility for warning users about the potential misuse, and modify the feature to be safer. “The onus can’t just be on the Police Department,” he said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. For now, protection mostly consists of past victims warning others to look out. Ms. Odorisio was so upset by the explicit image she received that she posted a censored version of it on Instagram, with her own text over it: “To those who say — aw, come on, that doesn’t happen …” Under the image it read: “Not asking for it.” There are two ways to restrict the AirDrop feature on an iPhone. In the main settings app, select “General,” and then “AirDrop.” Then select either “Receiving Off” or “Contacts Only.” The “Everyone” setting is when sexual harassers can send you photos. Alternately, swiping up from any screen will bring up the control center. Pushing down on the Bluetooth icon will open another menu, in which there is an AirDrop icon. Tap that, and the options for “Receiving Off,” “Contacts Only” and “Everyone” appear.",The New York Times
2018,Senior Google Lobbyist Is Stepping Down From Her Role,"WASHINGTON — Susan Molinari, who leads Google’s federal lobbying and policy effort and is a former Republican congresswoman from New York, is stepping down from her role at the company. The change, during a turbulent time for Google, is the latest indication of a shake-up at the company’s large Washington operation. Google has been under fire from lawmakers in Washington and Europe and faces growing antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. Corporate leaders at Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have been criticized by their workers for working on artificial intelligence with the Pentagon and for developing a search engine that would censor results in China. Google subsequently did not renew its Pentagon contract and has not moved forward on the search product for China. Thousands of employees also walked out of work on Thursday to protest the company’s treatment of women. [Read more: How Google protected Andy Rubin, the “Father of Android,” paying him $90 million while keeping silent about a misconduct claim.] “I am writing to share the news that after nearly seven years at Google, running the Americas Policy team and leading our D.C. office, Susan has decided to take on a new role,” Karan Bhatia, Google’s global policy chief, said in a memo to his staff on Friday. In a statement, Ms. Molinari called her time at Google “exhilarating” and “exhausting.” She said she had begun looking for the right time to step back from her responsibilities amid several life changes, including her husband’s retirement, her daughter’s college graduation and her father’s death. Axios earlier reported on her leaving her role. Ms. Molinari joined Google in 2012 as vice president of policy and government relations for the Americas. During that time, Eric Schmidt, the company’s former chief executive and a current board member, was often a large presence in Washington. Mr. Schmidt and other senior Google leaders were close with the Obama White House. Several went to work in government, including Megan Smith, who became the chief technology officer at the White House and an assistant to the president. After the election of President Trump, Mr. Schmidt’s presence in Washington waned. Ms. Molinari was poised to take on some of his former lobbying duties. But it is unclear how effective she was at working with the Trump administration. She has not been able to stem attacks by Republicans like the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, on issues such as political bias in Google’s search results. Google ranked first among companies in lobbying spending last year, but its Washington operation has been under fire for months. Last year, Google pushed out a former Obama administration official, Caroline Atkinson, the vice president of global public policy, from her role. That job remained empty for several months until Google hired Mr. Bhatia, the head of global policy from General Electric. The Washington office, including Ms. Molinari, has been blamed by some inside Google for not sending an executive to a recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference, according to a person familiar with internal discussions and who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. The committee focused on Google’s absence during the hearing, putting an empty chair at the witness table in his place. Mr. Bhatia said that after a transition period, Ms. Molinari would continue as an adviser at Google. The company is looking for a replacement for Ms. Molinari.",The New York Times
2018,Sentinelese Tribe That Killed American Has a History of Guarding Its Isolation,"NEW DELHI — In the late 19th century, a British naval officer described stepping onto a remote, coral-fringed island in the Andaman Sea and encountering one of the world’s most enigmatic hunter-gatherer tribes, an extraordinarily isolated group of “painfully timid” people who ate roots and turtles and stored a heap of wild pigs’ skulls. Fascinated, the officer, Maurice Vidal Portman, basically kidnapped several islanders. He took them back to his house on a bigger island, where the British ran a prison, and watched the adults grow sick and die. After returning the children to the island, he ended his experiment, calling it a failure. “We cannot be said to have done anything more than increase their general terror of, and hostility to, all comers,” Mr. Portman wrote in his 1899 book. Over the next century, few outsiders ever returned. The island, called North Sentinel, was a bushy, hilly world unto itself, about the size of Manhattan. Just about anyone who dared to visit was greeted by flying arrows. In the 1970s, the director of a National Geographic documentary took one in the leg. [Read about T.N. Pandit, an anthropologist who spent time with the Jarawa and Sentinelese tribes.] Maybe the islanders were traumatized by that original kidnapping. Maybe they feared foreign disease. No one has ever figured out exactly why they are so hostile to outsiders and their language remains a mystery. Over the years, North Sentinel faded back into obscurity. That is until Wednesday, when the Indian government revealed that a young American had paddled to shore in a kayak and tribesmen killed him with bows and arrows. The episode appeared to be a culture clash between an adventurous foreigner, who may have been trying to spread Christianity, and one of the most impenetrable communities in the world. Last week, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old from Washington State, paid a group of fisherman $350 to take him to North Sentinel under the cover of darkness. Fishermen had warned him not to go. Nevertheless, Mr. Chau paddled to shore with a kayak and a Bible, according to Dependra Pathak, the police chief in the area. He tried to speak to the tribespeople, who were small in stature and wore yellow paste on their bodies, in their own language. Some were friendly, others were not, according to Mr. Pathak, who cited a long note Mr. Chau gave the fishermen just before he set out in his kayak in case he did not come back. In it, he wrote that Jesus had bestowed him with the strength to go to the most forbidden places on Earth, police officials said. His father, Patrick Chau, said Thursday that his Christian faith provided solace after hearing of his son’s death. He said he was particularly comforted by a biblical passage: “There’s time and seasons for everything under heaven.” Missionary organizations said Mr. Chau died for the ultimate cause and friends called him a martyr. “John was a gracious and sensitive ambassador of Jesus Christ,” said a statement from All Nations, an international Christian missionary group. “The privilege of sharing the gospel has often involved great cost. We pray that John’s sacrificial efforts will bear eternal fruit in due season.” According to the fishermen who helped Mr. Chau, they motored for several hours from Port Blair to North Sentinel. Mr. Chau waited until the next morning, at daybreak, to try to get ashore. He put his kayak in the water less than half a mile out and paddled toward the island. The fishermen said that tribesmen had shot arrows at him and that he had retreated. He apparently tried several more times to reach the island over the next two days, the police say, offering gifts such as a small soccer ball, fishing line and scissors. But on the morning of Nov. 17, the fishermen said they saw the islanders with his body. The seven people who helped Mr. Chau reach the island have been arrested and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and with violating rules protecting aboriginal tribes. In an Instagram post, Mr. Chau’s family asked for the release of the seven and said he had “ventured out on his own free will.” India strictly monitors access to tribes, which are given protected status and the indigenous groups living on the islands of Andaman and Nicobar are some of the most carefully guarded. The islands are more than 700 miles from the mainland. And the Indian government has made the decision that any contact with these islanders, whose lifestyle has changed very little over the centuries, could destroy their culture and maybe even their lives. Their immune systems may be no match for modern microbes. But some officials say this approach is outdated and paternalistic. The islanders, whom Mr. Pathak described as a cultural treasure to be protected, wear loin cloths and live in simple huts. They are thought to number between 50 and 100, and hunt with spears and arrows fashioned from scraps of metal that wash up on their shores. Their island is heavily forested. T.N. Pandit, an Indian anthropologist who visited North Sentinel several times between 1967 and 1991, said their hostility is simple: They want to be left alone. “They are not wanting anything from you. We are coming to them,” he said. “They suspect that we have no good intentions. That’s why they are resisting.” Anthropologists believe the people on this island descended from migrants from Africa who came to the Andamans thousands of years ago. North Sentinel is among a shrinking handful of Andaman Islands home to people who still, in 2018, have had very little contact with the outside world. In the years since India won independence from the British, groups of anthropologists have tried to study them. But no one has managed to get through. Several times, Mr. Pandit said, the Sentinelese have turned their backs on anthropologists and squatted down, as if they were defecating. In 2006, two Indian fishermen who accidentally washed up on their shores were killed. When a military chopper flew low over the island, some men fired arrows at it. These days, the Indian authorities aren’t taking any chances. The Navy enforces a 3-mile buffer zone around North Sentinel. But police suspect Mr. Chau went at night with the intention of circumventing the authorities. It is unknown what the Sentinelese call themselves, or whether any other group in the world understands their language. When an expedition brought members of another indigenous tribe to North Sentinel, thinking they might share linguistic similarities, neither side understood one another. The farthest anyone has gotten was in 1991, when some anthropologists stood in waist-deep water near the shore and gifted coconuts to smiling tribesmen. A few years later, though, these “gift giving” expeditions stopped. A.K. Singh, a former lieutenant governor in Andaman and Nicobar, said friendly encounters were rare. He said there were two schools of thought about how to govern these islands, which, after all, are part of India. One end of the spectrum holds that “any contact is detrimental to their interest and therefore leave them alone,” he said. “The other end of the spectrum says who are we to deny them the fruits of development. Why shouldn’t their children go to school? They aspire to a more modern way of living.” “There was always conflict in these views,” Mr. Singh explained. As for what the Sentinelese want, experts say it is very difficult to know. Some years back, after a young man from another once-hostile tribe, the Jarawa, was treated for a broken leg at an Andaman hospital, some attitudes in the Jarawa community began to change. But not all. In 2015, a Jarawa man was accused of killing a lighter-skinned baby born to an unmarried Jarawa woman and apparently an outsider. A tribal leader said that if the baby’s body were handed over to investigators, “the world will start shaking, and we will all die.” The police did not arrest the Jarawa man for the crime. The same thing could happen now. Indian officials are weighing whether to pursue murder charges or even retrieve Mr. Chau’s body, which the police believe may be buried on the beach. Some police officials worried about where the investigation would lead. If they went to the island to get Mr. Chau’s body, they said, they might be killed as well.",The New York Times
2018,Serena Williams Is GQ’s ‘Woman’ of the Year. Fans Ask: What’s With the Quotation Marks?,"GQ did not name Serena Williams its 2018 Woman of the Year on its cover. It named her its 2018 “Woman” of the Year — and the quotation marks made a troubling difference to her fans. The men’s fashion magazine unveiled the covers of its upcoming issue this week — one cover for Ms. Williams, three others for GQ’s Men of the Year — and was immediately denounced on social media. Ms. Williams, one of history’s most accomplished tennis players, has a muscular physique, which she said last year has resulted in people calling her a man or telling her she belongs in men’s sports. Critics said the magazine’s use of quotation marks around “woman” on Ms. Williams’s cover appeared to call into question her gender or her femininity, a trope with at least a touch of transphobia. “To everyone saying this is a reach, you have to consider the context of Serena’s career and the way people have mocked and challenged her and Venus’s femininity because of their strength and athleticism,” one Twitter user wrote, referring to her sister, Venus Williams. “In that context, this was a bad choice.” Another user said GQ should have known better, given the “misogynistic and violent trans insults that Serena (and Venus) have dealt with for the last almost 20 years.” [Sign up here for Gender Letter, our newsletter that helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it.] GQ did not immediately return an email seeking comment. But Mick Rouse, a research manager for the magazine, said on Twitter that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation: The word “woman” on the cover was handwritten by Virgil Abloh, a celebrated designer who created Ms. Williams’s apparel at this year’s U.S. Open, and who frequently uses quotation marks in his work. Mr. Abloh, a longtime creative director for Kanye West and founder of the streetwear label Off-White, is a familiar name to many of GQ’s fashion-conscious readers. In March, he was named Louis Vuitton’s artistic director of men’s wear. Indeed, the items Ms. Williams wore during the U.S. Open had quotation marks around words like “LOGO” and “SERENA.” But not all of GQ’s readers — or the countless others who saw the cover in their social media feeds — were familiar with Mr. Abloh’s designs or his connection to Ms. Williams. To them, it was a conscious punctuation choice. It might have gotten less notice if someone other than Ms. Williams, who has often discussed struggles with sexism, had been the honoree. Last year, in an open letter to her mother, she said she had been called a man “because I appeared outwardly strong.” “It has been said I don’t belong in Women’s sports — that I belong in Men’s — because I look stronger than many other women do,” she wrote on Reddit, adding that she works hard and was born with a body she is proud of. Ms. Williams gave birth to a daughter in 2017 and came back in 2018 to make the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, losing both. Her next Grand Slam singles championship would tie the record of 24. Her U.S. Open loss was memorable for a heated argument with the chair umpire that was seen by many as an illustration of common sexism. The umpire gave her a warning for receiving help from a coach in the stands, then assessed a penalty after she slammed her racket and broke it. “There are men out here that do a lot worse,” she pleaded to the umpire, “but because I’m a woman, because I’m a woman, you’re going to take this away from me? That is not right.” Billie Jean King, a former top tennis player, supported her at the time, saying Ms. Williams had been subjected to a “double standard.”",The New York Times
2018,"Sessions, Election Results, Amazon: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The realignment of power in Congress. Voter fury toward President Trump lifted Democrats into control of the House of Representatives, ending two years of single-party dominance. Some districts hit by retaliatory tariffs switched to Democratic candidates from Republican incumbents. See what the blue wave looked like. Republicans held their Senate majority and gained at least two seats. Voter turnout was unusually high — we’re still gathering the data on that. Voters approved Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska by comfortable margins. Climate initiatives, though, earned mixed results. Among the historic firsts: the election of Muslim and Native American women. Catch up on the results from the House, the Senate and for governorships and other state positions. _____ 2. The new Democratic majority in the House sets up the likelihood of two years of intense conflict with President Trump. Our chief Washington correspondent says the big topics they are likely to wrangle over are health care, investigating Mr. Trump, bipartisan efforts on drug pricing and public infrastructure, and appealing to millennials. For his part, Mr. Trump may have to choose between escalating the partisan warfare in Washington or trying to reach across the aisle. Mr. Trump pledged bipartisan cooperation and even praised Nancy Pelosi, whose return as House speaker is looking increasingly likely. But he also promised to adopt “a warlike posture” if Congress investigated his political and financial dealings, and renewed his attack on reporters. Above, a heated exchange at a news conference. _____ 3. “Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation.” With much of the country mulling over the election results, President Trump made a high-profile ouster: Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He became a frequent and public target of the president after he recused himself from investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff and a Trump loyalist, will step into the gap, as acting attorney general — and will oversee the Russia investigation, whose scope he has questioned as verging on a “witch hunt.” Read our profile of Mr. Whitaker, written in September, when Mr. Sessions’s resignation appeared imminent. Will Mr. Trump meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at a lunch for world leaders in Paris on Sunday? The messaging has been contradictory. _____ 4.

2018,"Sessions, in Last-Minute Act, Sharply Limits Use of Consent Decrees to Curb Police Abuses","WASHINGTON — Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions has drastically limited the ability of federal law enforcement officials to use court-enforced agreements to overhaul local police departments accused of abuses and civil rights violations, the Justice Department announced on Thursday. In a major last-minute act, Mr. Sessions signed a memorandum on Wednesday before President Trump fired him sharply curtailing the use of so-called consent decrees, court-approved deals between the Justice Department and local governments that create a road map of changes for law enforcement and other institutions. The move means that the decrees, used aggressively by Obama-era Justice Department officials to fight police abuses, will be more difficult to enact. Mr. Sessions had signaled he would pull back on their use soon after he took office when he ordered a review of the existing agreements, including with police departments in Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Mo., enacted amid a national outcry over the deaths of black men at the hands of officers. Mr. Sessions imposed three stringent requirements for the agreements. Top political appointees must sign off on the deals, rather than the career lawyers who have done so in the past; department lawyers must lay out evidence of additional violations beyond unconstitutional behavior; and the deals must have a sunset date, rather than being in place until police or other law enforcement agencies have shown improvement. The document reflected Mr. Sessions’s staunch support for law enforcement and his belief that overzealous civil rights lawyers under the Obama administration vilified the local police. The federal government has long conducted oversight of local law enforcement agencies, and consent decrees have fallen in and out of favor since the first one was adopted in Pittsburgh more than two decades ago. The new guidelines push more of that responsibility onto state attorneys general and other local agencies. Mr. Sessions conceded in his memo that consent decrees are sometimes the only way to ensure that government agencies follow the law. But he argued that changes were necessary because agreements that impose long-term, wide-ranging obligations on local governments could violate their sovereignty. By setting a higher bar for the deals, Mr. Sessions limited a tool that the Justice Department has used to help change policing practices nationwide. Mr. Sessions’s new guidelines make it nearly impossible for rank-and-file Justice Department lawyers to use the agreements, warned Jonathan M. Smith, a former official in the department’s civil rights division and the executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “This memo will make the Justice Department much less effective in enforcing civil rights laws,” Mr. Smith said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the memo. A consent decree is a type of injunction that allows federal courts to enforce an agreement negotiated between two parties — say, the Justice Department and a local police department — to address a violation of the law. The department started enforcing them during the Clinton administration, after a statute was enacted in 1994 allowing the attorney general to use court agreements to remedy systemic, unconstitutional behavior. The agreements gained a higher profile as the Obama administration entered into 14 of them as part of its efforts to improve relationships between the police and their communities. They became even more prominent after the killings of black men at the hands of the police captured headlines and set off the Black Lives Matter movement. In March 2017, a month after he took office, Mr. Sessions ordered a review of the use of consent decrees to ensure that they “advance the safety and protection of the public.” He said that the pacts should also ensure that the police are safe and respected and that they should not interfere with recruiting efforts by the local police. Mr. Sessions, who has long championed local sheriffs and police officers, maintained that the agreements “reduce morale” among police officers and lead to more violent crime. Academics and researchers have contested his assertions about the links between consent decrees and crime rates. Under Mr. Sessions, the department also dropped Obama-era investigations into the police in Chicago and Louisiana. Last month, Mr. Sessions opposed a consent decree between the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois attorney general enacted after a Justice Department report unveiled in the final days of the Obama administration found rampant use of excessive force aimed at black and Latino people. Under Mr. Sessions, the Justice Department said the deal placed too many restrictions on Chicago’s police superintendent. “When Jeff Sessions intervened in the locally negotiated consent decree in Chicago, it belied the love of federalism that he professes and uses to justify this effort to effectively end the use of consent decrees,” said Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division. The agreements enacted after high-profile police killings in recent years would likely not exist if Mr. Sessions’s restrictions had been in place. “The need for consent decrees and the oversight they guarantee,” she said, “has not disappeared.”",The New York Times
2018,Set for ‘Westworld’ and Other Shows Destroyed in California Fire,"The famed Paramount Ranch, which served as a set for numerous Hollywood television shows and films over almost a century, was destroyed in the so-called Woolsey Fire in California, the National Park Service, which operates the site, said in a social media post on Friday. “We are sorry to share the news that the #WoolseyFire has burned Western Town at #ParamountRanch in Agoura,” the post said. “We do not have any details or photos, but it is our understanding that the structures have burned. This area is an active part of the incident and we cannot access it.” The 2,700-acre site, which offered lush panoramic views of the Santa Monica mountains, was a shooting location for the first two seasons of the HBO show “Westworld.” “‘Westworld’ is not currently in production, and as the area has been evacuated, we do not yet know the extent of the damage to any structures remaining there. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by these horrible fires,” the network said in a statement. The primary shooting location for the show is at the unaffected Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita, which is where its Main Street scenes are filmed. Melody Ranch is also where the “Deadwood” movie is being filmed. Evan Rachel Wood, one of the show’s stars, said on Twitter: “This is eerie. So sad for the history lost.” The ranch, which until Friday resembled a town straight out of a western, was originally developed in 1927, when Paramount Pictures purchased the lot in the old Rancho Las Virgenes and used it for various films, including “The Maid of Salem” (1937) and “The Adventures of Marco Polo” (1938). In the 1950s, Paramount sold the lot to William Hertz, who built the permanent western town that would serve many shoots and as a tourist destination. Over the next several decades, the ranch would change hands multiple times, until the National Park Service took over ownership of a portion of the lot in 1980. Since then, the town was a filming location for the 1990s CBS show “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,” the Clint Eastwood film “American Sniper” (2014) and as a ghost town in the 1981 version of “Scream,” among many others. California has been battling three major fires, one in the northern Sierra and two west of Los Angeles. In Southern California, the authorities ordered residents of Malibu, the Los Angeles beach-town home of many Hollywood celebrities, to evacuate. One of the actors who evacuated Malibu was Martin Sheen. His son Charlie Sheen posted a Twitter message on Friday, saying he could not contact his parents. They were found safe by a local television crew on Zuma Beach. “Emilio, Ramon, Renee, Charlie, we’re fine; we’re at Zuma Beach and we’re probably going to sleep in the car tonight. We’re just fine,” Mr. Sheen told a reporter from Fox 11. Other shooting locations that may be in danger, according to Robert Mills, head of alternative programming at ABC, include the Bachelor Mansion, where the reality show “The Bachelor” is shot. The mansion, which is primarily a family home that is used during production of “The Bachelor,” is in one of the areas that has been evacuated, a spokesman for the production company said. The spokesman said the roads around the home were closed and that it “may be intact with damage to surrounding structures, but have no way to confirm.”",The New York Times
2018,Seth Meyers Calls Trump a ‘Wannabe Dictator’ (and Gullible Fox Viewer),"Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Seth Meyers attacked President Trump on Wednesday over the news that Trump had pushed the White House counsel for prosecutions of Hillary Clinton and James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. According to a New York Times report, Trump was motivated in part by commentary he heard on Fox News, where hosts like Jeanine Pirro often insist that the Justice Department is not doing enough to support the president. “So not only is the president a wannabe dictator who thinks he can jail whoever he wants, he also genuinely believes all the insane stuff he sees on Fox News. Trump probably sits there all day watching Fox and shouting to his aides: ‘Prosecute Hillary! Stop the caravan! And ask my doctor if Otezla is right for me! Why can’t I have Otezla?’” — SETH MEYERS Meyers also pointed to Trump’s criticism of a judge who ruled against his administration’s asylum policy; Trump called him “an Obama judge.” That drew a hard rebuke from the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. “Chief Justice John Roberts today defended federal judges and said, quote, ‘We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.’ They do, however, have two judges appointed by Grover Cleveland.” — SETH MEYERS, showing photos of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 The late-night hosts braced us for what is expected to be an unusually chilly Thanksgiving Day. “According to the National Weather Service, it will be one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record — with the most frigid air between Rhode Island and Boston. And the second-most frigid air will be found directly between your stepfather Ronnie and your aunt Janice. She knows what she did.” — JAMES CORDEN “Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and I saw that a record 30 million Americans are flying this year. When the airlines heard that, they were like, ‘Yeah, we’ll see about that.’” — JIMMY FALLON And Stephen Colbert offered advice on how to handle sensitive dinner-table conversations. “According to Pew Research, Americans are more divided along party lines than ever. So I would avoid controversial subjects like politics, religion, sports, movies and how much voter I.D. you need to buy cereal.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, referring to a recent assertion from Trump “After Thanksgiving, the holiday shopping season officially begins. It’s when everyone has to decide: Do I want to get trampled on Black Friday or have my identity stolen on Cyber Monday?” — JIMMY FALLON “Recently, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed under the headline, ‘Sorry, Feminists, Men Are Better at Scrabble,’ because ‘Since the World Scrabble Championship began in 1991, all winners have been male.’ Just because men keep winning a thing doesn’t mean they’re better at it. Have you seen who the president is?” — STEPHEN COLBERT Wherein a strangely cute four-legged robot does a back flip, and a creepy humanoid robot named Sophia reveals an even stranger miniature version of itself. James Corden’s brand of magic tricks might not quite cut it at Hogwarts. Seth Meyers is planning to welcome a number of family members onto his show for a holiday edition of “Late Night.” Almost all the other hosts are taking Thanksgiving off, so we are, too; “Best of Late Night” will be back next week.

2018,Seven Artists on the Warhol Influence ,"WARHOL’S LEGACY How the Pop master’s experimentation helped them find their own voice. Three decades after Andy Warhol’s death, he remains one of America’s most provocative artists. His influence on popular culture is so pervasive that each emerging art movement after him has had to grapple with Warhol’s focus on surface perfections and his singular celebrity. Despite their complicated feelings, many contemporary artists say they continue to admire Warhol’s radical experimentation in all media and reach back to him as an unflagging inspiration, citing his practice of fusing photography and painting, as well as his presentations of race, gender, religion and desire. We asked an intergenerational group of artists at the forefront of painting, photography, video, installation and sculpture to gauge the impact of Warhol’s influence on their work. They include Yasumasa Morimura, who spoke of learning from Warhol the relationship between handicraft and mass production. Glenn Ligon, for his part, praised the Pop master’s use of color, saying it helped him illuminate the hard realities of race in paintings based on Richard Pryor’s scabrous stand-up comedy. “Much of my work had been in black and white,” Mr. Ligon recalled. But in the ’90s, he recognized “that the spoken word — Pryor’s off color jokes — needed to be in color. I thought, ‘What’s my model for using color?’ Andy Warhol.” Here are edited excerpts from their conversations. I remember going to MoMA and seeing his “Campbell Soup Cans” [1962], and it was at that moment I decided to become an artist. What makes Warhol the gold standard is the utter elegance, simplicity and directness of his paintings — his ability to distill a world of information out of a picture through minimal but brilliant intervention. It reveals a profound social and technological complexity. He deals with the deepest of human emotions: desire, fear, voyeurism, how the individual intersects with culture, and the fabric of meaning. Like Warhol, I use silk-screen, a technology made for seriality and reproduction. Unlike Warhol I always pair the silk-screen panels with at least one hand-painted panel. I sometimes duplicate the hand-painted panels, shifting the logic so that the hand-painted panel becomes the repeated image. They are nearly identical but it is their difference, and failure of perfection, that interests me. There is an incredible sense of longing, loss and desire in Warhol’s attachment to the world of culture. He couldn’t be Marilyn Monroe but he wanted to be. Those images of her, I think, are a displacement of his own desire. Painting for me has been the format to address deeply negative, culturally constructed ideas like racism and sexism, as well as desire. Julia Wachtel’s work will be in the group show “Paintings” at Mary Boone Gallery, Nov. 3 — Dec. 21. Warhol exposed so many people to so many different things that they hadn’t really looked at. He forced the viewer to rewrite narratives in ways that queered our own notions of reality and what’s acceptable. What’s most interesting to me are his photographs. I love the casualness of them, the intimacy in the party scenes. For “Cry, Baby,” my exhibition at the Warhol Museum, I was influenced by his “Ladies and Gentlemen” series [of African-American and Latino drag stars Warhol photographed in 1975 with a Polaroid and whose images he transferred onto silkscreen]. His works of Wilhelmina Ross are alongside my painting of Miss Toto, from a series of Miami drag queen portraits. But Warhol’s drag figures were represented in a flattening way that removed imperfections — Wilhelmina is missing a tooth in Polaroids, which was edited out. That move by Warhol removes some of the humanity of those individuals while celebrating them in a more fashionable way. I spend an immense amount of time rendering those imperfections in pencil. I’m trying to celebrate and invent some sort of new fictions of the queer black male by subverting pre-existing Caribbean and ancient Fertile Crescent religious myths. “Devan Shimoyama: Cry, Baby” is at the Andy Warhol Museum through Mar. 17. At times my goal is to broaden my audience by using iconography or symbols so that anyone can relate to the work. I think about stencils and Warhol, and the way his hand is not present in the work, which at one point might have been controversial. Is that important? Or is the art really about the thoughts behind it? All my stencils I make myself, but I use everyday imagery as inspiration, to make a new kind of gesture loaded with many meanings. I relate to the way Andy Warhol used pop imagery that aspires to some kind of universality. You see this in “Little Race Riot” from his “Death and Disasters” series, which deals with how ubiquitous media portrayals of violence, over time, make us numb to them. It’s similar to how social media presents images today, over and over, making us indifferent to things that are important. In my pieces centered around police brutality, like “Why” — where I use an “X” to cover text and to make a word appear as two different possibilities — I was thinking about the ambiguity of Andy Warhol. He never wanted to give a specific meaning, so the viewer could participate equally. He was great at making us refocus on important things by blowing them up into symbols, but he didn’t give too much away. This idea of accessibility led me to do merchandise and murals. It’s challenging myself to go into spaces where there might not be a lot of women of color. It also allowed me to challenge the idea that I couldn’t have a painting that’s in the Whitney collection and then have a pair of sneakers in a store. Can a very expensive painting and my work in an alleyway function in the same way? Warhol showed us it could. Someone who might play on a basketball court painted by me might not go in an art gallery but I want to reach them. This desire comes from my own encounters with art. I never went to a lot of museums growing up, and I was exposed to the gallery scene very late. “Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush” is at the California African-American Museum in Los Angeles through Jan. 20. When I was a young artist, Andy Warhol’s process was a model for mine. I lived on the Lower East Side, in the late ’80s and earlier ’90s, and I copied the master. There was something about the methodology and the graphic quality of the silk-screen that spoke to me. I came to art from a commercial art background. I was very familiar with screen printing and was very distrustful of my hand as a painter. What I came to understand through trying it on my own is that a mechanical process didn’t just have to be a printing process but could be a painting process. I also related to Warhol’s Catholicism. I remember somebody said, “Oh, he’s making American icon paintings but in a religious sense.” I really related to that sentiment, and I think that’s in my painting “Peach Oswald,” of President Kennedy’s alleged killer, Lee Harvey Oswald. I think what Warhol was saying, if he was saying anything at all, is that the secular is now the spiritual. I was not a religious Catholic. I was behind the church smoking when I should’ve been inside. But there was something in his work that made it O.K. for me to accept my way of seeing a subject as one iconic figure. The Oswald painting was based on the last photograph taken before he got shot by Jack Ruby. The photograph had the potential, with a simple modification, to be a movie star head shot, which seemed Warholian. I changed his eyes to move them upward so that he looked up to the viewer. It’s a gesture that makes him look like he is almost confessing to the viewer after he died, because, after all, nobody knows the truth except for him. I guess I have a love-hate thing with Warhol. Sometimes I think I’m kind of more against what he represented and then I start looking at the work, and it’s like, ‘Oh yes, I get it again.’ Wayne Gonzales’s “Peach Oswald” is in “Everything Is Connected: Art and Conspiracy” at the Met Breuer, through Jan. 6. Andy Warhol has been a vital influence. I have responded most to his iconic portraits of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor; two exceptional women who, just by their presence, provided platforms for other women. These works referenced mostly celebrity or political archetypes but were also deeply rooted in the visual culture of their time. I thought about how I might position the women of my images in a similar dialogue. In 2008, I thought about the power of Michelle Obama being the first black first lady in the White House and how crucial this moment was for young black girls, to see themselves in her. So, using similar images of Andy Warhol’s Jackie silk-screen canvases, I reclaimed the space with Michelle O. Both women harbored strength, intelligence, generosity and beauty. For an earlier work, “Sweet and Out Front,” I was invited to respond to Melvin Van Peebles’s film “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” (1971). I noticed that the women in the film were reduced to secondary roles. They seemed marginalized, and it was a lost opportunity to celebrate black women. My response was to position these female characters at the forefront. I took cues from the formation and color rhythm of Andy Warhol’s photo booth style portraiture in the Jackie canvases. “Sweet and Out Front” was my first attempt at silk-screen. I love the residue quality and photo manipulation process. It allows for a painterly presentation and graphic pop-cultural forwardness. I like the Warholian notions of allowing the work to exist as it is, fusing photography and painting. And I appreciate the tension and the gray area between painting and photography, which represents a mystical area of discovery. Warhol’s work is unabashed, unapologetic and queer. His paintings are stylistically fashion forward, of the moment and in your face political. I like to think that I do the same with my work. One of our differences is how we represent women. We both deal with the notion of desire from a queer lens. But his is from an asexual white male perspective and mine is from a lesbian perspective. Desire manifests in his art as a longing and desire, consumed by a particular beauty, which framed his own sexuality as one that leaned toward femininity. My desire is defined by the need to connect with and celebrate black women, not only as models, muses and mentors. My desire is also at times motivated by sexuality: the queer lens of black women loving black women, which is seldom celebrated. Like Warhol, I make my own icons of beauty and desire. “Mickalene Thomas: I Can’t See You Without Me” is at the Wexner Center through Dec. 30. Andy Warhol proposed a witty way to inherit Marcel Duchamp’s legacy. From both Duchamp and Warhol I learned the relationship between handicraft and mass production, and between works of art and every day consumable commodities. As the times were changing, and moving to a more genderless and borderless culture, Warhol successfully embodied the spirit of the era. Now, it is inevitable that any artist will touch upon the themes of genderlessness and borderlessness when we express something. My favorite work of Warhol’s is “Silver Clouds” [floating metallic pillows that hover in space, from 1966] because the inside of each cloud is empty and the way the artwork shows itself is ever-changing, determined by the outer world that is reflected on the surface of the artwork. I sincerely admire the hollow, weightless brilliance. Yasumasa Morimura’s exhibition “Ego Obscura” at Japan Society is on view through Jan. 13. For Warhol, color seemed to represent a kind of freedom. It’s a freedom that I needed for my “Coloring Book” series, but to get it I needed to commission little kids to color images of cultural figures like Malcolm X. I first tried to make paintings by coloring in the images myself and they were terrible. The closest I got to it was with the Pryor paintings. The spoken word — Pryor’s off-color jokes — needed to be in color. I thought, ‘Well, what’s my model for using color? Andy Warhol.’ He was a genius colorist. I don’t think he made so much of a distinction between a muddy brown, acid yellow, or vivid blue. It all worked for him. When I am using text or images from other sources, I feel like I can’t be arbitrary in that way. I feel a responsibility to the source material, and color feels added on top of that content, rather than generated from it, and that’s why I use it sparingly. In Warhol’s [1975] series “Ladies and Gentlemen,” of trans women, there’s a kind of license he takes that he doesn’t have with other commissioned portraits he was selling. They were mostly of white people — they weren’t going to pay for a big purple slash through their faces. But maybe he felt that the trans women were representing themselves in every palette. In my own work, I’m thinking about what’s expected of me as an artist of color in terms of my subject matter, how race operates in the work even when the work is not about race. Glenn Ligon’s essay, “Pay It No Mind,” appears in the catalog for “Andy Warhol — From A to B and Back Again” at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Nov. 12 through March 31.",The New York Times
2018,Seven Convicted in Killing of Prominent Honduran Environmentalist,"MEXICO CITY — A Honduran court on Thursday found seven men guilty of murder in the 2016 assassination of an Indigenous environmental leader whose opposition to a dam project brought her an international prominence that still failed to protect her life. The verdict, delivered by a panel of judges after a six-week trial in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, ended a proceeding bitterly denounced by the family of the environmentalist, Berta Cáceres, and the organization that she led. They criticized the prosecution for focusing its efforts on those believed to have carried out the crime, and disregarding evidence that could have implicated powerful business leaders in its planning. “This is undoubtedly a first step towards justice,” said Marcia Aguiluz Soto, the director for Central America and Mexico at the Center for Justice and International Law, a human rights group that has worked closely with the family. “But of course there are other people who are the ones who paid for the assassination of Berta Cáceres and they should be here.” The judges convicted two former executives of Desarrollos Energéticos, or Desa, the company with the concession to build the 21-megawatt dam, a project that was eventually abandoned after Ms. Cáceres’s killing. Ms. Cáceres, 44, was shot six times by two gunmen in March 2016 in the small town of La Esperanza, where she had led indigenous opposition to the dam, which was planned for the Gualcarque River in western Honduras. The Lenca people consider the river to be sacred and said the dam would jeopardize their water resources. Among those convicted were Sergio Rodríguez Orellana, Desa’s director of environmental and social development, and Douglas Bustillo, a retired Honduran Army lieutenant who had worked as the company’s security chief but left before Ms. Cáceres was killed. Five others, including Mariano Diaz, a Honduran Army major, were also convicted. Another defendant, the brother of one of the accused, was acquitted. Desa’s general manager, David Castillo, who was arrested in March, will be tried separately. The company has denied any involvement in ordering the killing and said that Mr. Castillo and Mr. Rodríguez, the two executives working for Desa at the time of the killing, had been wrongly accused. “This is a completely political verdict,” said Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer for Desa. “The Honduran government has given into the pressure of the European Union and the U.S. State Department and issued a political ruling.” The company said it had consulted with community groups about the dam project, but Ms. Cáceres’s organization, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, known as Copinh, vigorously opposed the dam. Ms. Caceres’s fight won her the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015. Her killing just a few months later became emblematic of the threats faced by environmental activists in Latin America. In 2016, according to the organization Global Witness, 14 environmental activists were killed in reprisal for their work in Honduras. International organizations have expressed skepticism that the prosecution will reach up to those who ordered the murder. “Justice for victims will be effective and comprehensive when all the material and intellectual authors of the crime are brought to justice and held accountable,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’ office in Honduras and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in a joint statement on Wednesday. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the environmentalist who was killed. She was Berta Cáceres, not Bertha. The article also misstated the name of the human rights group that has worked with her family. It is the Center for Justice and International Law, not the Center for International Justice and Law.",The New York Times

Five would also be an acceptable number of years to travel back in time, if you could, but the closest you’ll ever get to time travel is voting in the midterms, which could land you and everyone else much further in the past than five years. This casserole calls for dairy and gluten, so make sure you have two bathrooms if serving to friends whom natural selection somehow skipped over. Loaded Baked Potato Casserole. With the word “loaded” in its name, you might hope that it contains a little something extra like, say, batteries, to power something useful like, say, a time machine, but it doesn’t. Nope! This casserole mostly contains just potatoes, which are unfortunately useless in the attempt to time travel, except, of course, when used to defend oneself from baffled torch-wielding serfs in 15th-century France. This recipe also calls for six tablespoons of unsalted butter — great for lubricating time-machine skids, but you won’t have to worry about that because this casserole will not allow you to travel through time. Sorry! Shepherd’s Pie. What’s worse than calling oneself a pie, despite being filled with beef? Why, not having access to a time machine, of course! Shepherds herd sheep, which must be why they were cool with turning cows into deceptively named non-dessert items. Surprisingly, the mutton-filled “cowherd’s pie” never quite caught on, almost giving the impression that society had room in its heart for only one crust-covered baked meat dish pretending to be pie. Mediterranean Tuna Noodle Casserole. Though this dish boasts a sensory transport to the Mediterranean, the very cradle of tuna noodles, you will unfortunately remain firmly planted in the present day, where everything is still happening right now. The recipe also includes the option of adding dill, which, time-chronology-wise, will change nothing. Unless, of course, you’re a survivor of an herb-related trauma and suffer dill-induced flashbacks, which is supposedly the least desirable form of time travel. Ancient Grain and Vegetable Casserole. Bet you thought this one would be a time machine for sure. Nope! Though ancient grains do not actually transport you back to ancient times, they are haunted, providing you a nifty portal for communicating with the netherworld. “Amaranth, what was it like riding a horse and buggy everywhere?” “Time is cyclical, and your daughter used to be a stinkbug you stepped on in another life.” “Quinoa, was Julius Caesar hot?” “The dream about the Russian sailor was actually a memory, and the Mayans were off just by 10 years.” Roasted Vegetable Lasagna. This cozy dish layers savory roasted vegetables with wide flat noodles, much the way time is layered with your egregious mistakes and carelessness. Maybe you haven’t yet figured out how to traverse the past while riding an 11-pound starch-and-broth-filled Pyrex sled to repair all the damage you’ve incurred in your short life. But slow cookers will go on sale soon, and with free shipping and some jumper cables, you just might be able to rectify those childhood grievances between the midterms and Thanksgiving.

2018,Seven Flames Kindled by the Focused Fire of Ntozake Shange,"Ntozake Shange called it a choreopoem, and it began as performance poetry. But when she brought it from San Francisco to New York, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf” became a play — first downtown, where the producer Woodie King Jr. gave it a stage, before Joseph Papp brought it to the Public Theater in the summer of 1976. From there it went to Broadway and became a long-running hit, starring seven black women — including Ms. Shange — whose characters were named for the colors of the rainbow. Bolstered by an Obie Award and a Tony nomination for best play, it entered the canon. “For Colored Girls” remains the best known work by Ms. Shange (her full name is pronounced en-toh-ZAH-kee SHAHN-gay), who was 70 when she died on Saturday. [Read our obituary for Ms. Shange here.] She left behind an American theater whose most exciting and lauded work in recent seasons has often come from black female playwrights. Lynn Nottage, the author of “Sweat,” called this “a golden moment,” with an enormous amount of talent on display after “years of pressing up against the door and trying to get in.” This week seven playwrights who came powerfully onto the scene in the decades after Ms. Shange’s debut spoke about her impact and legacy. These are edited excerpts from those interviews. Dominique Morisseau, a 2018 MacArthur Fellow, has had what she said is “an ongoing relationship” with Ms. Shange’s plays since high school. There have been so many of us who have found our entry point into playwriting through her work. For me that’s very particularly true because I was a spoken-word artist who had never written a play. “For Colored Girls” is written with no punctuation and no capitalization and with all these slash marks, and that really inspired a different kind of pentameter than Shakespeare, a different kind of rhythm and heartbeat to the work. And that revolutionized the way I saw myself as a participant in theater in general, as an actor and a writer. So when I wrote my first play in college, it was a choreopoem. Ms. Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, watched the success of Ms. Shange — who was just 27 when “For Colored Girls” opened on Broadway — but also her struggles later on. I think it’s really hard on an artist when you’re in your 20s and suddenly the world’s spotlight goes on you and you’re being asked to be the voice representing a generation. That was an incredible gift and burden that was placed on her shoulders. She certainly was writing at a time when the resistance was not only the white establishment but also black theaters that really defined theater as that which was written by men. And she was putting things onstage that for a long time no one dared to speak of in mixed company. Abuse within the black community. There were people who felt that she was airing dirty laundry — black men who as a result resented not only her writing but her success. The playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith still detects Ms. Shange’s rhythmic influence in her students at New York University. Ms. Smith, who depicted Ms. Shange in her documentary play “Fires in the Mirror,” first saw “For Colored Girls” at the Public in 1976. It was a phenomenon at the time, and I frankly don’t believe that any of us would be here without Zake — not just black artists and not just women. African-American women, we get punished for running our mouth. If I run my mouth too much, I’m going to pay for it. And what I loved about Zake was, she didn’t care. She ran her mouth. She gave us such a great gift. And even if people thought it was an indictment of men or an indictment of white people, what she brought with her was an incredible love of human beings. Aleshea Harris, the Obie Award-winning author of “Is God Is,” was, like Ms. Shange, a performance poet before she became a playwright. She’s given me so much permission — to be unapologetic, to talk about my pain and my joy. I’ve certainly been a colored girl who’s considered suicide, so just the title, everything, it feels like “You are here, I affirm you, you exist, and you should exist loudly.” I was thinking about that line in “For Colored Girls,” “I found God in myself and I loved her fiercely,” and the lineage of her work in my work. However sort of subconscious, it’s there. The idea that God is in a black woman and that she should fight for herself is certainly something that I’m exploring with “Is God Is.” Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose plays include “Fairview,” credited Ms. Shange with making experimentation “part of the lifeblood” of black female playwrights. I’m pretty sure that I purchased my first copy of “For Colored Girls” when I was 14 or 15 years old. It was one of the first plays I bought that had a black woman on the cover. I thought that it wasn’t really a play, that it was a series of poems, because I was really tied to those kinds of formal designations. It still is completely insane to me that that show was on Broadway at all, just because it’s miles ahead of anything that anyone is doing right now in terms of form, and in terms of speaking directly to a group of people who are often not represented on theater stages. It’s so essential. Ngozi Anyanwu, currently starring Off Broadway in her own play “Good Grief,” grew up going to predominantly white schools and didn’t encounter Ms. Shange’s work until college. She very much encouraged black women to appreciate the fullness of themselves and to speak from their perspectives, not trying to fit into anyone else’s structure. What now you’re seeing is a flourishment of black women and women of color just writing how they really want to write. Because I think we’re very much children of her. It’s a bit of a tragedy that the Broadway lights have not dimmed for her. It’s sad that there has to be a movement to do that, as important as she is, to not just women of color but to the theater. That’s a bit of a “Shame on you, New York theater.” The Pulitzer Prize winner Suzan-Lori Parks credited Ms. Shange as one of the people who paved the way for her own career — and also as a fiery inspiration. I was on panels with her where people would wither. She had the courage to speak truth always. You didn’t want to say some B.S. to her, because she would do immediate course correction. That kind of fearless brilliance that I looked at and thought, “Yeah, I want to be like that.” Poetry onstage was an old thing, but she was one of the people who brought it into the now. It sounded like people you knew, which is beautiful, but like Shakespeare, too. “Bein’ alive and bein’ a woman and bein’ colored is a metaphysical dilemma I haven’t conquered yet”: Hello. That’s very alive, bristling with intellect and passion. And beautiful architecture.",The New York Times
2018,Sewing That Ends Up in Orbit,"Vocations Hue Nguyen, 64, is a seamstress at Leidos in Webster, Tex. How did you learn sewing? When I was growing up in South Vietnam, my mom’s friend had a clothing alterations business, and I loved watching her sew. One day I asked for some leftover cloth to make clothes for my doll. She taught me how to sew buttons on her customers’ clothing and gave me a little money to buy candy. Eventually, to save my parents money, I started making clothes for my siblings. In high school I tutored young children and studied sewing instead of following an academic path. I graduated with a certificate in sewing and taught first and second grade in a private school afterward. How did your career develop? In 1975, an uncle in the South Vietnamese Army helped my family escape by boat. We traveled to the Philippines, and then to a refugee camp in the United States, finally settling in San Antonio. I got a job sewing at a men’s clothing store and then did alterations for various bridal shops. After having children, I started a home business sewing bridal gowns, bridesmaid dresses and other items. When they were older, I began sewing for several space industry companies, and in 2011, I started as a sewing technician at Leidos, a science, engineering and I.T. services company. What types of items do you sew? Leidos has several contracts with NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, including some related to cargo logistics and astronaut performance. I modify some of the astronauts’ clothing by removing buttons and snaps that can break off in space, float away and damage equipment, and I add Velcro on pocket flaps to keep items from escaping. I also design and modify cargo bags, blankets and so forth. Do you also fit the astronauts? I do. Their spacesuits always seem to need altering when they come from the manufacturer, so I travel to the space center for that. At first I was star-struck, but I see them fairly often and I’m not intimidated anymore. I just want to do a good job. In 2014, an astronaut gave me a Silver Snoopy award, their personal achievement award. I was so nervous in front of people that I don’t even remember his name. Do you sew by hand? I sew Velcro on small pockets by hand, but mostly I sew by machine. I use two heavy-duty, commercial ones; another with a five-foot arm for large items; one for lightweight material; and a serger, which sews a seam and finishes it in one process and also removes the extra material. What has been particularly challenging to work on? A thermal cover for the astronauts’ digital cameras. It needed nine layers of insulation to meet spaceflight requirements and protect the camera from the extreme temperatures, which change from minus-250 degrees to 250 degrees Fahrenheit when the camera moves between shade and direct sunlight in space. The astronauts need to be able to operate buttons on the camera and replace the battery, photo card and lens in their bulky spacesuits and gloves, so I cut openings in the cover, added flaps and used Velcro for closing them. I made a pattern and then a mock-up. Following that I made a prototype, incorporated a few minor adjustments from the client and then made the final product. I sewed two covers for training and four for spaceflight, and when they changed the camera, I had to redesign the cover and make more.",The New York Times
2018,Sex Assault Rules Under DeVos Bolster Defendants’ Rights and Ease College Liability,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos unveiled a highly anticipated overhaul on Friday of the rules governing campus sexual assault, reducing the liability of colleges and universities for investigating sexual misconduct claims and bolstering the due process rights of defendants, including the right to cross-examine their accusers. The rules would be the first regulations to govern how schools should meet their legal obligations under Title IX, the 1972 law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding. The regulations will now face a 60-day public comment period before they are final. The regulations mirror a draft proposal first reported by The New York Times in August, which established a narrower definition of sexual harassment, tightened reporting requirements, relieved colleges of the responsibility to investigate off-campus episodes, and outlined steps schools should take to provide support for accusers. They also give schools the flexibility to choose a higher evidentiary standard, establish an appeals process, and offer the option of cross-examination. “Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,” Ms. DeVos said in a statement announcing the regulations. “We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas.” Victims’ rights advocates and Obama administration officials denounced what they saw as an overly aggressive rollback of the steps taken by the previous administration to combat sexual assault on campus. “We brought this hidden violence into the public eye, and we saw schools change their practices as a result,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a statement. “These protections made students safer and gave parents peace of mind. Today’s proposed rollback would return us to the days when schools swept rape and assault under the rug and survivors were shamed into silence.” The most significant changes outlined in the final proposal include procedural mandates that underscore Ms. DeVos’s belief that the system shaped by the Obama administration lacks fairness, consistency and due process. The new rules codify procedures that would essentially turn college boardrooms into courtrooms when adjudicating sex assault disciplinary proceedings. Under the new rules, schools would be required to hold live hearings and would no longer rely on a so-called single investigator model that has become common at colleges. Accusers and students accused of sexual assault must be allowed to cross-examine each other through an adviser or lawyer. The rules require that the live hearings be conducted by a neutral decision maker and conducted with a presumption of innocence. Both parties would have equal access to all the evidence that school investigators use to determine facts of the case, and a chance to appeal decisions. Elementary and secondary schools, which are also bound by Title IX, would not have to hold live hearings. Though the rules were drafted over the last year, they were vetted in recent weeks by the White House and other administration agencies where emotions still ran hot over the fallout from the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. President Trump used due process arguments to rally conservatives when his Supreme Court nominee faced allegations of sexual assault, including an episode said to have occurred at Yale. Justice Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed even after one accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, publicly aired her allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that all sides considered painful. “If this proposed rule goes into effect, every single campus Title IX process is going to replicate what happened in the Senate Judiciary Committee against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,” said Jess Davidson, the interim executive director of End Rape on Campus. Victims’ rights and due process advocates commended the department for including safeguards in the cross-examination requirement. The rules prohibit direct questioning of victims by the defendant, keeping in line with the Obama administration’s recommendation; require cross-examination to occur through a third-party, such as an adviser or lawyer; and include a “rape shield” protection that would keep a complainant’s sexual history off limits. “There is no better way to test the truthfulness of an accusation than by questioning the accuser during a live hearing,” said Justin Dillon, a partner at the Washington-based law firm KaiserDillon, who has represented dozens of accused students. “If colleges are going to adjudicate what are essentially crimes, then accused students deserve to have the tools to defend themselves effectively.” But victims’ advocates said the regulation undermined the intent of the sex discrimination law, which is to combat gender-specific discrimination and define sexual misconduct as a means of denying students access to an education. Several groups said they believed the rules were meant to decrease the number of Title IX investigations on campus and chill sexual assault and harassment reporting. In a summary of its proposal, the department said the rules sought “to produce more reliable outcomes, thereby encouraging more students to turn to their schools for support in the wake of sexual harassment and reducing the risk of improperly punishing students.” Legal experts say that the department appears to be aligning itself with the courts, where a wave of opinions in the last two years have weighed heavily on the side of accused students. K. C. Johnson, a history professor at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York, said he believed the Education Department sought to institutionalize a recent decision by a federal court. In that ruling, against the University of Michigan, the court said that universities must allow students or a representative to directly question their accusers in a live Title IX hearing. But Terry W. Hartle, a senior vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents college presidents, warned that while schools welcomed clarity from the Education Department on how to properly balance support for survivors and the rights of accused students, colleges and universities were ill-equipped to essentially conduct trials. “Colleges and universities are not courts, and these sort of proceedings would require us to legalize student disciplinary proceedings,” Mr. Hartle said. “We lack the knowledge, the expertise, and credibility to do this.” Last September, when Ms. DeVos announced that she would propose Title IX rules, she rescinded nonbinding Obama-era guidelines, which she said “failed too many students” and coerced colleges into setting up “quasi-legal structures.” The Obama-era guidelines were hailed by victims’ rights advocates for holding colleges accountable for properly addressing rising reports of sexual assault on campuses, but they were nonbinding. Particularly contentious was the encouragement of colleges to adopt a lower standard of evidence — “preponderance of evidence” — in adjudicating cases. They also applied a broader definition of sexual harassment and maintained a longstanding standard that a school “reasonably should know” of an episode in determining a school’s liability for failing to investigate a complaint. The rules also required schools to investigate any claim of harassment, regardless of where it initially took place. The new rules would require that institutions only be held legally responsible for investigating formal complaints and responding to reports that school officials have “actual knowledge” of happening. A formal complaint is one made to “an official who has the authority to institute corrective measures.” If a victim opts not to file a formal complaint, the rules encourage schools to provide “supportive measures,” without being penalized. The new rules would adopt a new Supreme Court definition of sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school’s education program or activity.” The rules also maintain that complaints must involve conduct that occurred in the school’s own program or activity, though the department said that schools should look at factors like whether the harassment occurred at a location or under circumstances in which the school “owned the premises or exercised oversight, supervision or discipline over the location or participants.” The rules would also allow schools to choose the evidentiary standard — “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing” evidence — to apply in determining whether accused students are responsible for alleged misconduct. In determining whether schools took the proper steps to address the allegations, the department would apply a standard called “deliberately indifferent,” meaning that an institution would be in violation of the law “only if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.”",The New York Times
2018,"Sex, Surrealism and de Sade: The Forgotten Female Artist Leonor Fini","The artist Leonor Fini worked tirelessly throughout most of the 20th century, often alongside universally acknowledged masters like Max Ernst, André Breton and George Balanchine. Her paintings and designs were shown in London, Paris and New York over decades. Portraits of her, an eccentric European artiste draped in wild costume at fancy masquerade balls, regularly appeared in magazines like Life. Fini also had three works in the landmark 1936 exhibition “Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism” at the Museum of Modern Art, curated by the museum’s founder, Alfred H. Barr Jr. But the museum owns none of her work, and she remains little known in the United States. A new exhibition at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan aims to remedy that. “Leonor Fini: Theater of Desire” is the first American retrospective devoted to her paintings, drawings and other objects, and it fills two floors of the museum. Fini, who died in 1996 at 87, was close to many of the Surrealists, including Breton, and has frequently been grouped with them, but she always resisted labels, said Lissa Rivera, the curator of the exhibition. “She was really not interested in contemporary movements,” she said, adding, “Although she was included in shows on Surrealism, she didn’t really want to be associated with that group because André Breton, she thought, was a misogynist.” Born in Argentina, Fini grew up in Trieste, Italy, and found her way to Paris as a young woman. She made a place for herself in the city’s artistic circles, but declined the confining roles (muse, lover, student) that were usually offered to young women. “She already knew how to paint,” Ms. Rivera said. Her work in this period was fantastical, but stands out from the Surrealists for its inversion of the usual gender roles. Fini painted a number of erotic male nudes that celebrate androgyny and feminine qualities in their subjects. Like the Surrealists, she had muses, but her depictions are tender and affectionate, often rooted in her personal connection to her subjects, including her two lifelong partners, Stanislao Lepri and Constantin Jelenski. Fini was successful enough in the ’30s, including the MoMA exhibition, to get a show at the gallery of Julien Levy, the New York dealer who helped introduce artists like Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Salvador Dalí to America. A rather condescending review of that show in The New York Times dings Fini’s work for showing too much skin in a self-portrait: “In one picture, called ‘The Miracle That Sweeps,’ the ‘costume’ pantaloons worn by our miraculous heroine have just about dropped off.” “She lived every aspect of her life creatively, as a form of investigation in the human psyche,” said Ms. Rivera, “and for her, gender and sexuality were the greatest ways to perform those kind of experiments, both on the canvas and in real time.” Fini also illustrated about 50 books in her life, choosing authors and titles that fit her own interests, including “Satyricon” and works by Jean Genet and Charles Baudelaire. Some of her best-known works in this area are her drawings for a 1944 edition of the Marquis de Sade’s “Juliette.” After World War II, Fini’s work grew somewhat darker and more abstract, although it remained deeply focused on the corporeality of the body, as in “The Angel of Anatomy,” depicting a stern-looking winged figure stripped of skin. It fixes a steady gaze on the viewer, a memento mori stuck somewhere between life and death. Fini herself chose to live as something of a recluse, although she loved to make brief, shocking appearances at formal events, dressed in elaborate costumes of her own design. “She always liked to have center stage,” Ms. Rivera said. “She wasn’t afraid to be seen as a narcissist; she just was herself completely and didn’t feel any sense of questioning or shame.” One of her costumes, including an owl mask, inspired the final scene in the erotic novel “The Story of O,” which Fini would later illustrate. Well into the 1980s, she worked tirelessly, often on theatrical sets and costume designs. But she continued painting as well, with her works evolving toward a more dreamlike style, but always with a strong current of sexual energy. “She always felt that identity was just a mask,” Ms. Rivera said. “So the masks that she chose to wear were more true than her biological face.” “Leonor Fini: Theater of Desire” runs at the Museum of Sex through March 4; 233 Fifth Avenue (at 27th Street); museumofsex.com.",The New York Times
