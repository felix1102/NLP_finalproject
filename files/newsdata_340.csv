2018,The Hidden Gems of 2017 Movies Are on ... Netflix?,"Streaming It is a truth universally acknowledged that the first two months of the year are desolate times for movie lovers who prefer to gorge on new releases. Once the holiday season’s tidal wave of blockbusters and prestige pictures has receded there’s not much action beyond the awards season itself. Releasing only chaff during the first two months of the year has been a studio tradition so longstanding that nobody seems to remember the rationale. But even for awards mavens, now is a good time to catch up and explore. During the last week of 2017 I was out of New York, visiting relatives, and one evening circumstances left me alone in their house with a few hours to kill. I ended up using my phone to watch “Série Noire,” a grimy 1979 French crime thriller that I saw maybe 20 years ago, via a pretty grimy-in-itself 16 -millimeter print, and had no expectation to see again. Directed by Alain Corneau, the movie is an adaptation of the novel “A Hell of a Woman,” by the American genre writer Jim Thompson. (Mr. Corneau wrote the screenplay with Georges Perec, the French literary genius who wrote “Life: A User’s Manual.”) The story line of “Série Noire” is jaw-droppingly squalid — less than 10 minutes into the movie an abusive aunt is pimping her young niece (Marie Trintignant) to a feckless traveling salesman (Patrick Dewaere) — and the movie’s setting, an impoverished Paris suburb in the depths of a drippy winter, is depicted with such rigor that you suspect the film stock itself of carrying mold. Not everyone’s cup of tea, obviously, and not to make light of trigger warnings, but this movie could conceivably be eligible for at least a dozen of them. But I’ve long found it unnerving and fascinating, and when a friend on social media mentioned that it was available on FilmStruck, I was genuinely surprised. [ See the best 100 movies currently on Netflix. ] One comes to expect at least a certain amount of the unexpected on a carefully curated site like FilmStruck. That’s less true of Netflix. Still, I’ve always thought the commonly propagated complaint about the dearth of “classic” films on Netflix something of a straw man. The streaming service has never advertised itself as a curated haven of greatness. People perhaps confuse Netflix’s DVD rental service, which offers a wide variety of older and critically elevated films, with the streaming service, on which you cannot watch “Citizen Kane” or “Casablanca.” Television has changed remarkably over the past few years. It might be time for your viewing habits to change as well. My own complaint about the service is more about the presentation of the movies they have than the quality of the movies themselves. It’s no secret that Netflix doesn’t do a great job letting consumers know what more recent critical favorites are available, so if you’re on that site and looking for hidden gems, you’re not going to find them gathered under a category. Nor is it a sure thing that the site’s algorithm is going to recommend them to you. But they’re there. A few weeks back Bilge Ebiri, the lead film critic for the Village Voice, placed “My Happy Family,” a drama from Tblisi, Georgia, at the top of his 2017 best films list. Mr. Ebiri had first seen it at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017, and after that it dropped from sight. As it happens, it is on Netflix. Another 2017 Sundance favorite, “I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore” turned up on Netflix very shortly after it played the festival. But these streaming premieres were hardly big Netflix events. A big Netflix event is “Bright,” a sci-fi fantasy film widely mocked by reviewers that garnered sufficient viewership on the service to justify a sequel. I understand the relations of scale between indie films and blockbusters, but in the streaming world there ought to be a middle ground between “Bright”-style exposure and zero public awareness. That said, the service now has more than a few films that made my own best-of-2017 list, and a couple that skirted it. All of them are provocative, pertinent, well made and, yes, in some cases even entertaining. “The Unknown Girl,” directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne, is a typically high-quality drama from the Belgian filmmakers, this one a mystery with a social conscience that begins with a young doctor going by regulations and not allowing clinic entrance to a young woman after hours. When the woman is later found dead, the doctor is determined to find her killer. “Last Men in Aleppo” is a searing and illuminating documentary about volunteer medical aid workers in war-torn Syria. “The Son of Joseph,” written and directed by the American-born French filmmaker Eugène Green, is a droll comedic moral tale whose baroque trappings make it an initially puzzling but eventually winning delight. If you’re looking for something a little more overtly perverse, “Slack Bay,” a Bruno Dumont comedy about class difference and cannibalism set in a French beach community that seems at least partly out of one of Hergé’s “Adventures of Tintin,” will do the trick. “The Ornithologist,” a new film from the Portuguese director João Pedro Rodrigues, is a religious allegory on queer themes, and one of the most disarming theologically inflected films since Luis Buñuel’s “The Milky Way.” “A Woman, a Part,” written and directed by Elisabeth Subrin and featuring a spectacular lead performance from Maggie Siff, is a sharp portrait of an actor in crisis that takes more pleasure in artistic ambiguity than most such studies do. And because I myself haven’t seen all of the critically praised pictures of 2017, I intend to use Netflix for catching up on, among others, “Graduation,” the latest film from the always-trenchant Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, “Strong Island,” a Netflix Original documentary about racism in the United States, focused on the 1992 murder of William Ford Jr., and directed by his brother, Yance Ford; and “Super Dark Times,” an intense teen thriller. The offering I’m most looking forward to is Errol Morris’s epic C.I.A. and LSD saga “Wormwood,” not just streaming on Netflix but, like “Strong Island” and, um, “Bright,” a Netflix Original. These should keep me happily occupied until I’m obliged to pay attention to awards season again. [ Interested in reading more about Netflix?

2018,"Trevor Noah Pans Trump’s Vulgarity, a Bleep for Other Hosts","Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s vulgar comments about immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa — what he called “shithole countries” — inevitably served as late-night TV fodder on Thursday. But most hosts had a hard time figuring out how to make them funny (and all shows but Trevor Noah’s bleeped out the operative word). “Trump reportedly said, ‘Why are we having all these people from [expletive] countries come here?’ Sir, they’re not [expletive] countries: For one, Donald Trump isn’t their president.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Mr. Noah deadpanned: “Guys, I don’t know how to break this to you, but I think the president might be racist,” adding, “As someone from South Shithole, I’m offended.” Jimmy Kimmel, calling the comments “unfathomable,” said he was sure it was a coincidence that the countries Mr. Trump disparaged are “mostly populated by people of color.” “Because if it wasn’t, it would mean we voted for a racist — like a real one — and we’d have to get pitchforks and chase him out of the White House. But I also assume the White House would deny he said that. They did not. They just tried to spin it. It really is unfathomable.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Mr. Colbert said that as long as he uses this kind of speech, Mr. Trump probably shouldn’t accuse other world leaders of being divisive. “Now, at one point Donald Trump said that North Korea might be trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea, but assured us that ‘I know more about wedges than any human being that’s lived.’ Oh, sir, you are a wedge. The simplest of tools.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Tweeting Thursday about the House’s vote on warrantless surveillance, Mr. Trump seemed to contradict the Republicans’ party line — and then himself. “We need to get smart? You’re the only one live-tweeting a debate with yourself — that you’re losing.” — STEPHEN COLBERT It would seem no one can dismiss presidential hostility quite like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.’s all-time leading scorer and the inventor of the famous “skyhook” jump shot. He talked to Mr. Noah about the time Mr. Trump sent him a nasty letter. NOAH: You wrote an op-ed in and around Donald Trump, comparing him to Bernie Sanders, explaining the differences and trying to show how different their worldviews were. And the president then wrote you a personal letter on your own column. I think we have the picture here, what he wrote. It reads, “Dear Kareem, Now I know why the press always treated you so badly. They couldn’t stand you. The fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again. Best wishes, Donald Trump.” What do you do with a personal note like that from the president? Do you frame it or do you burn it? ABDUL-JABBAR: Actually, when I got that I crumpled it up in a ball and I skyhooked it into a wastebasket. President Trump’s approval rating fell across many demographic groups over his first year in office, including among those seen as important to his base. “After being out of business for years, Circuit City announced that they’re opening stores again. Yeah, they said they couldn’t wait to fax their employees the news.” — JIMMY FALLON “Vermont could become the first state to legalize recreational marijuana through the state legislature. Yeah, then the state full of Ben & Jerry’s and snowboarders said, ‘Oh, good, we can finally start smoking weed. Finally. Wonder what that’ll be like.’” — JIMMY FALLON “According to NBC News, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has hired a lawyer to help him prepare to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. I’d say Bannon’s starting to sweat — but I’m pretty sure he never stopped.” — SETH MEYERS James Corden played “live Tinder” with a writer on his show, and it looked a lot like a classic dating show. Mr. Colbert’s audience learned some things. One of them: It’s probably not a great idea to invite him to your party. Conan O’Brien is back next week after a long break. The Times Late-Night Comedy Committee will be here again on Tuesday morning to tell you about it. After Fifth Harmony broke up acrimoniously, Camila Cabello — singer of the hit song “Havana” — has come out on top.",The New York Times
2018,A $65 Million ‘Animal Terminal’ at Kennedy Airport Sits Empty,"The animals are not coming to the Ark at Kennedy International Airport. Not one by one. Not two by two. On a recent Thursday morning, no million-dollar racehorses or sleek show horses from Europe were standing in the 48 specially designed stalls for their mandatory three-day quarantine. No pigeons or finches bound for pet shops fluttered in the 5,000-square foot aviary. Paradise 4 Paws, a dog and cat resort with 150 suites inside Ark, has yet to open. The $65 million animal transit facility opened a year ago to great fanfare, as “the world’s only animal terminal and the first full-service quarantine facility” for the import and export of horses, pets, zoo animals and livestock. Built just yards from the runways, the idea was that animals could be deplaned and within minutes be enjoying the Ark’s climate-controlled environment and, if needed, the services of its veterinary clinic. Instead, just before the new year, John J. Cuticelli Jr., the Ark’s owner, filed a $426 million lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Queens against his landlord, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that oversees the airport and solicited the animal handling center. Mr. Cuticelli says the Ark is incurring “massive operational losses” and is in imminent danger of shutting down. The suit charges the Port Authority with failing to enforce his lease, which gives the Ark “exclusive rights” to handle the animals coming to the airport from overseas. The lease requires that the Port Authority “must use reasonable efforts to cause other providers to cease their provision of the exclusive services.” The project was financed with a combination of conventional loans and tax-free bonds, with Ark responsible for all payments. The heart of the Ark’s business is supposed to be horses coming from Europe, which must be quarantined for at least three days in order to prevent the spread of equine diseases. The Ark’s primary competitor is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 40-year-old operation in Newburgh, N.Y., about 90 miles north of Kennedy Airport. Most of the hundreds of birds and more than 3,500 horses that enter the United States at Kennedy every year are still put onto trailers for the 2-½-hour ride to Newburgh, even though the cargo planes could practically pull alongside the Ark, where the horses could be transferred to a dolly and wheeled into a stall moments after landing. “I watch them go by my door every day,” Mr. Cuticelli said, “trucked up to Newburgh.” “It makes no sense to me why the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A. and all the other agencies involved in the creation of this facility are not supporting its use,” Mr. Cuticelli said. “I entered into a technically, legally binding contract with exclusivity. Otherwise, I never would have done it.” The Port Authority and the Department of Agriculture declined to discuss the lawsuit. Joelle Hayden, a spokeswoman for the U.S.D.A., did say that her agency “does not mandate use of any one import quarantine facility, airline or animal handling service. We support the use of all approved entities and services.” And a spokesman for the Port Authority said in a statement that the “limited exclusivity provision enables the private veterinary clinic to provide the first-class facility and services that J.F.K. requested.” Critics, mostly shipping agents and transporters, said that the privately owned Ark was too expensive and unnecessary, given the existence of the Newburgh operation. But Dr. Scarlette Gotwals, a veterinarian and director of flight operations for Horse America, a shipping agent, said she was mystified as to why Ark has not been embraced by the horse industry. “This is exactly what we’ve been looking for,” said Ms. Gotwals, the first shipper to bring horses to the Ark in September. “It’s a world-class facility. It’s an indoor, climate-controlled facility. In Newburgh, you’re using outdoor barns.” She said the price difference, which amounted to a couple of hundred dollars, was “not cost prohibitive.” Mr. Cuticelli, who described himself as a “broken down real estate investor,” got involved with the project at the urging of Ken Rotondo, a veterinarian and a former member of the advisory council at Cornell University’s veterinary college. In 2010, the Port Authority solicited companies willing to build a first-class animal facility at Kennedy Airport. “I proposed moving quarantine” to Kennedy, instead of going to Newburgh, Dr. Rotondo recalled. The Port Authority awarded the contract to Dr. Rotondo’s group, he said, “without going to bid.” After Dr. Rotondo retired, Mr. Cuticelli took over. Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the former airport facility “fell far below the minimum appropriate standards.” “The Ark contract was tailored,” he said, “to enable the private contractor to make the necessary investment to build and operate a world-class facility.” After three years of negotiations, the Ark signed a 310-page lease in 2014. However, in 2015, the Port Authority signed a 20-year lease with the U.S.D.A. operation in Newburgh, on the grounds of Stewart Airport. Thomas Bosco, then director of aviation for the Port Authority, recommended that the authority’s board approve the lease, saying that the “Ark does not provide quarantine services.” It was a puzzling statement given that Ark had signed a lease requiring it to provide that service. Before construction could begin, Ark had to wait for the Port Authority to remove the heart of the airport’s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System, a high-tech system of cameras, radar and sensors. Ark also had to comply with various regulations and requirements imposed by the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A., the Center for Disease Control, state and local health departments and the Department of Homeland Security. The delays and requirements drove the cost of the project from $48 million to $65 million, Mr. Cuticelli said. He obtained private financing, put up $12 million of his own money and New York City provided a $35 million bond. Ark opened in January 2017, although the U.S.D.A did not approve the equine quarantine for imported horses until September. Business was slow. Mr. Cuticelli said he does not know whether he has stumbled into some bureaucratic nightmare with the Port Authority, a turf war between government agencies, or is the object of a boycott by livestock shipping agents and transporters. “There are two big issues,” said Matt Haug, general manager for IRT Transport, which transports livestock internationally. “People aren’t acquainted with them. The other issue is the traffic difficulties at Kennedy Airport. Newburgh is situated near the interstates.” “Nobody asked for an import facility,” said a shipper, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to become embroiled in the litigation. “I don’t know how this became a $65 million facility. They’ll never recoup their money.” A Port Authority official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, blamed federal officials. “It’s no secret that the U.S.D.A. has not been friendly to this facility,” he said. The official said the Port Authority was trying to work out the issues with the U.S.D.A. Ark’s lease does appear to give it exclusivity, which is also generating friction with the horse racing industry. The New York Racing Association, which operates several tracks including Aqueduct and Belmont Park near Kennedy Airport, has built its own U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barns for international horse races, enabling the horse to compete right after it leaves quarantine. The 40 or so racehorses a year that fly into Kennedy from Europe, Japan and elsewhere for races within two weeks of landing represent only a fraction of the total expected volume. In December, Dora J. Delgado, a senior vice president of racing and nominations for the Breeders Cup, sent a letter to the U.S.D.A. expressing its concerns about the Port Authority’s plans to require “international equine athletes” to use Ark, rather than the U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barn at Belmont. Alison McGowan, who runs Ternary Performance Horses on Long Island, was importing two show horses from Belgium and Holland in September. She said she told her shipper — whom she declined to name — on numerous occasions that she wanted the horses taken to Ark. The day before the horses were to leave Amsterdam, she discovered that the shipper planned to take them to Newburgh. She canceled the flight and hired a new shipper, Ms. Gotwals, who brought the horses to Ark. “For me as a horse owner,” Ms. McGowan said, “I would never ship horses halfway across the world on a long flight and then put them on a trailer for 2.5 hours to quarantine. The Ark is outstanding. I’d rather have a state-of-the-art facility providing the best care.” Mr. Cuticelli said he may not be able to wait much longer. “What sense does it make to build a multi-, multmillion-dollar state-of-the-art facility to, among other things, mitigate the risk of hoof-and-mouth disease contamination, and then do what they are doing,” said his lawyer, Stephen B. Meister. “It’s totally insane.”",The New York Times
2018,A 96-Word Law Would Be a ‘License to Bribery’ for Insurers,"About New York Pretty much everyone who buys a home in New York is braced for sticker shock, but hardly anyone is ready for the pain of little cuts called “closing costs.” One of the deepest of these is title insurance, which guarantees that a property can change hands without anyone else having a valid claim against it. Shopping for this kind of insurance is almost futile. A cartel sets the price. Nearly all of the 30 title insurance companies that do business in New York charge the exact same rate. It is the highest in the country, 40 percent more than neighboring Connecticut, and 25 percent more than New Jersey. “It’s not that they happen to have the same rates — they work together and file them collectively,” said Daniel C. Price, the chief executive at OneTitle National Guaranty Company, Inc. “In any other industry, this would be struck down instantaneously.” An exemption to antitrust law permits this collective price-setting, though companies can apply to state regulators to charge different rates. Two of them, Mr. Price’s OneTitle and Entitle Direct, have done so and cost less but have only a fraction of the market. You’d think they would have a good chance at winning business on the basis of lower prices, but that’s not how the warped title insurance market works. We now move from the galling to appalling, as reported by Shane Goldmacher this week in The New York Times. To get people to buy one identical product over another, the title companies spend enormous amounts of the premiums they collect from home buyers on lavish entertainment. They are not entertaining the home buyers, but the intermediaries — like real estate lawyers — who steer business to members of the title cartel. “Sports tickets. Nobu. Strip clubs. Hooters. Wining and dining,” Maria Vullo, the superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services, said. “They even give gift cards! That’s cash. Why would they give a referral source cash?” No mystery about any of it. The consumer pays for the title insurance, but rarely chooses the title agent. “That’s why you have this very problematic situation where you have meals and entertainment being lavished on the real estate professionals,” Ms. Vullo said. Whatever you might think about health insurance companies, 82 percent of the money they take in gets paid out in claims for medical care. The title insurance industry in New York pays out less than 5 percent of its premiums in losses, Ms. Vullo said. Of $1.1 billion in annual premiums, 95 percent goes for salaries, bonuses and expenses. That, includes, of course, buying the actual insurance (which, Ms. Vullo said, is 15 percent of the cost) and the research on the titles. Also driving the premiums are gimmicks like renting Citi Field and paying Mets players for a meet-and-greet with real estate lawyers. One title insurer spends millions each year on luxury boxes at Madison Square Garden, baseball stadiums and the U.S. Open. The state plans to enact a regulation this week that bars much of this spending. In response, lobbyists besieged the legislature in hope of extinguishing the new rules. They are making some headway. A bill sponsored by Sen. James L. Seward, a Republican from the Ithaca area, was passed by the State Senate. The Assembly insurance committee is considering a version sponsored by its chairman, Assemblyman Kevin A. Cahill, a Democrat who represents parts of Ulster and Dutchess counties. It says that no matter which rules are enacted, nothing prohibits the companies “from undertaking any usual and customary marketing activity aimed at acquainting present and prospective customers with the advantages of using a particular title insurer or title insurance agent.” The core language reads like a 96-word loophole, but Ms. Vullo put it in stronger terms. “It would give a license to bribery,” she said. At a hearing earlier this month, representatives of the industry argued that their practices were essential to building relationships with the people they described as their “clients” — the real estate intermediaries, not the home buyers. Mr. Cahill suggested that marketing directly to the consumers would hurt home buyers inexperienced in shopping for title insurance. “Is it ethically appropriate to go over the head of the experts?” Mr. Cahill asked. His office said Tuesday that the bill remains in the committee. Industry representatives have said they are considering litigation to fight the new regulation, and have retained a former counsel to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Title insurance costs often look small compared to the price of the home. In New York, for a house costing $500,000, the average title insurance fee is around $2,700. Many people just roll that cost into their mortgage, which at current rates, winds up adding about $13 a month. Just a tiny nick from a shaving cut. One that bleeds for 30 years.

2018,A Barrier or a Fair Fee? Readers React to the Met’s New Admission Policy,"The New York Times reported last week that the Metropolitan Museum of Art would begin charging adults from outside New York State a mandatory $25 fee for admission beginning March 1. The reaction to the news was divided. Our chief art critics, Roberta Smith and Holland Cotter, disagreed with the Met’s decision, saying such museums should be free. “It divides people into categories — rich and poor, native and foreign,” Ms. Smith wrote. Some readers, however, said it was fair to charge out-of-town visitors a fee to enter a cultural institution like the Met. The pay-as-you-wish admission price will continue for all residents of New York, as well as for students who live in New Jersey and Connecticut. But for the thousands or workers who commute to New York, it will no longer be an option. We gathered reaction from readers, who weighed in on the policy in our comments section. Responses have been edited for clarity and length. This is a disgrace. Decision makers at the Met obviously have no idea what $25 means to ordinary people. A $25 entrance fee is a barrier. Museums should not put up barriers. They should reach out. I am disappointed in this museum that has long had a place in my heart for its generosity in sharing humanity’s great treasures. My feeling for it is being lost. SUBITO CORVALLIS We may as well impose a fee to walk through our city’s beautiful Central Park, or to view our city’s architecture, or perhaps even charge for a glimpse at the Statue of Liberty for that matter. Art is to be appreciated by every human being no matter where on our planet they hail from and no matter their economic status. NOO YAWKA American children up to the age of 18 should have free access. In France, I bought yearly passes for myself to all museums. My daughters could get in free because they were French citizens. Kids need more than videos! MO FRANCE I have a feeling that many of the people complaining willingly spend hundreds of dollars for a ticket to a Broadway show and/or then visit MoMA and other museums that are charging $25 with no complaints. And a $25 ticket that includes admittance to the Met’s three museums is a huge bargain. LOLA Although I agree, in theory, with almost every argument against mandatory admission fees for out-of-town visitors, budget constraints are real. This policy tries to “hurt the fewest” of many alternatives. The Met is a world treasure and should be kept open and accessible to all. Charging out-of-town visitors a modest fee so that it remains operational is fair. AMYF The Met is a city museum with a national focus. It is fair to say that the taxpayers of New York already shoulder a large part of the costs for the Met and deserve a better break. I have maintained an out-of-town membership for more than a decade, and, when in town, I visit as much as I want. Prorated, it is not a bad deal. Cut these guys a break. They have to make the books balance. ARVEY The Met is fabulous, and $25 is reasonable considering what you see. But $25 is high for many people, especially families. I wonder if the Met ever considered different pricing, such as a flat rate of $10 for everyone or surge pricing? By appearing to lower the price, the Met could actually make a lot more money. PADRAIG LEWIS Living in Hoboken, I can get to the Met just as fast as those in some of the boroughs. That said, I do want to continue to have the Met in existence and be better than the institution it currently is, so I support the need for a mandatory admission. I just wish it was applied to all visitors and perhaps at a lesser cost. CJFILM The Cleveland Museum of Art — one of the best in the country — does not charge admission, but it does charge for special exhibits. I think that is a better option for the Met — I would have gladly paid extra to see the current Michelangelo exhibit. KAREN",The New York Times
2018,A Beginner’s Guide to Backing Up Photos,"“I’ve seen it all,” says the award-winning National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, about backing up her photos. “I’ve had hard drives fail throughout my career. For example, back when I first started as a photographer, I had a very nice hard drive system in my home, and the whole thing failed.” In retrospect, Ms. Vitale says, she would have definitely set the system up differently. “I lost some historic moments from the first part of my career,” she says, “and they’re gone forever.” Ms. Vitale may shoot photos differently from how most of us capture images these days — she shoots with a digital single-lens-reflex camera (or DSLR). But her cautionary tale should resonate, since many of the same vulnerabilities exist when photographing with smartphones. In other words, if you’re snapping away without a backup plan for your photos, beware: In an instant, you could lose them all, forever. Before I explain how to back up your photos, it’s useful to understand one important aspect of digital photos that relates to storing them properly. Namely, image resolution. Every digital photo has a certain image resolution, which is the total number of pixels that make up a photo. If an image you shot on your smartphone, say, is 4,000 pixels high by 3,000 pixels wide, it contains a total of 12 million pixels (the height multiplied by the width). Since one million pixels is known as a megapixel, the resolution of your smartphone image is 12 megapixels. Now, say you upload that photo to Facebook. When you post it, Facebook, in most instances, downsizes the resolution, or reduces the number of pixels to make it smaller. It may digitally compress it, too, throwing out additional data important to image quality. However, it’s often difficult to visually detect if an image file has been altered, particularly on a smartphone’s small screen. It’s why you might think you’ve backed up your image when uploading it to Facebook or other social media sites, but that’s not really the case. But right now, most websites, including social media and even photo-printing sites, aren’t designed to truly store photos. That’s because when you back up your photos, you want to be able to retrieve an image file that is as close to, if not identical to, the original photo you captured on your phone or digital camera. That’s also why you want to carefully choose a backup solution, whether it’s online or an external hard drive. Unfortunately, preserving the original photo isn’t the only issue you’ll face when backing up your images. You also need to know that there’s no completely foolproof method to backing up your images. There’s always risk. Store images on a hard drive connected to your computer, and, as Ms. Vitale notes, it can fail. Upload images to an online backup service and you face a different problem: You might think using a cloud service from an established company — like Apple, Google, or Amazon — would be safe. Yet, consider Kodak, which for decades functioned as a powerful and lucrative photography company. In fact, in 2001, it created an impressive photo-sharing and photo-storage site, called the Kodak Gallery. Yet, despite its heritage and know-how, the company declared bankruptcy in 2012, shutting down its entire operation, including the Kodak Gallery, where many photographers had images stored. The important takeaway here is that you should consider using a combination of services and solutions to safely back up photos. Ideally, store them both online and on two external hard drives (one stored locally and another at a different location). However, at the very least, consider using one online backup, which lets you copy and transfer the photos on your phone, as well as other devices, to an alternate location. One of the most effective ways to back up photos on smartphones is by using one of several well-known cloud services, such as Apple iCloud, Google Photos, Amazon’s Prime Photos, and Dropbox. One reason you should use them is that they all share an important feature: automatic backups. (Note: You’ll find this feature on other services, as well.) “You can never predict when a crash will happen or your phone will be stolen,” says Jill Duffy, a contributing technology editor who covers productivity for PCMag.com. Each also offers free versions to back up your photos, although it’s generally just a small amount of storage space. You’ll also want to be sure to drill down and examine the details of each service to find additional pros and cons. For example, the pricing model is very different on just these four services (not to mention other photo backup apps). Take Apple iCloud. It’s very well known, but it provides just five gigabytes of free storage to start for those with Apple devices, and just one GB if you don’t own one. For more space, you’ll pay a monthly fee: $0.99/month (50 GB), $2.99/month (200 GB), or $9.99/month (two terabytes). Apple lets you share storage space on the 200-GB and two-TB plans with your family. If you’re accustomed to Apple devices (and the service integrates nicely with Apple products) and are willing to splurge for a monthly fee, iCloud might serve your needs. But if you own an Android device, it might not be the best solution. By contrast, you get free, unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, allowing you to automatically back up all images from your phone, computer and other devices. Google also recently updated its app for desktop computers, which now can automatically upload photos directly into Google Photos when transferring images from your camera to your computer, which is very convenient. However, Google Photos has limitations as well. If you shoot photos with a resolution larger than 16 megapixels, they’ll be downsized, which some photographers find unacceptable. At this time, smartphones mostly capture 12- or 16-megapixel photos, which won’t be affected, but some models already exceed that limit, as do many digital cameras. Both Amazon Prime Photos and Dropbox have their pros and cons, too. If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account. Dropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB). For serious photographers who shoot lots of photos, there are additional options: Some shutterbugs splurge for robust photo-organizing software packages, including apps by ACDSee, Mylio and Adobe, which, for a fee, include online cloud storage. In fact, Adobe recently updated its professional photo organizer, Lightroom, and expanded its cloud-storage plans, which are available at various prices. As the name implies, external hard drives, which range in price from $50 (one to two TB) to $350 and up (eight TB), are like the storage that’s built into your computers, except they’re connected externally. Most hook up via a USB connection, although there are other methods. (For instance, network attached storage, or NAS, drives, connect via an Ethernet line to your home or office network.) As with your internal drive, there are many ways to transfer, copy, or sync your photos. You can also automate your backup using your computer’s operating system, the external hard-drive’s software, or a third-party backup software app or service. If you need suggestions for a good external hard drive, Wirecutter, the New York Times product-review site, has a roundup of options at different sizes and price points here. Our personal library of images generally doesn’t end with just our digital photos. Many of us also own precious prints, photo albums, slides and negatives, some of which can be decades old. To back them up properly, you’ll need to digitize or scan them. There are scanning services available where you can mail or drop off your prints and negatives and get digital versions created for you, although some can be pricey. You can also scan them yourself if you have an all-in-one printer that can scan, or a dedicated scanner. If you’re not looking for a high-end scan, though, use Google’s PhotoScan mobile app, which lets you use your phone’s camera like a scanner to capture photos, even if they’re framed and behind glass. (The app is pretty effective at eliminating glare and reflection.) For slides and negatives, though, you’ll need to scan them yourself, or have a service process them for you. Whatever backup system you eventually select, whether it’s just an online solution or a combination of several services and hard drives, it’s important to monitor the system. Be sure to periodically check it and make sure it’s backing up your photos correctly. Consider these tips from Jill Duffy, Ami Vitale and myself, when backing up your images: • Label folders: “If your backup system lets you, sort your photos into folders, and label them by occasion, date, or both,” Ms. Duffy says. • Keep a folder of your favorite shots: Ms. Vitale recommends storing your best images in a folder on your computer’s desktop, and, periodically, creating a special backup of just these images. But, she says, you’ll need to take a little time and edit your shots after each trip or event, and choose only your best shots. • Add context: “Photographers should be diligent and write captions for their photos,” Ms. Vitale says, since it’s easy to forget important facts about your subjects. “The story behind your image is essential, and can be just as important as the picture itself.” • Start by backing up today’s photo: In Ms. Duffy’s book, “Get Organized,” she suggests ignoring past photos, since backing them up can be an overwhelming task. “Rather than organize your entire photo collection, consider just putting in place a workflow and system of organizing them moving forward.” • Test your backup periodically: When your backup system is in place, be sure to test it, at least every month or every other month. For instance, try restoring a small group of photos from the past. Also, check your backup service to see if it includes a feature that lets you test a backup after it’s complete.",The New York Times
2018,"A Beginner’s Travel Guide to Haiti, El Salvador and Africa","With recent reported inflammatory comments, President Trump put the spotlight on places many Americans have never visited. Here are some travel recommendations on a few of those places. The comments President Trump reportedly made recently, asking why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” shed an uncomfortable spotlight on Haiti, El Salvador and the entire African continent. Several political figures and others from these nations responded swiftly — with a mixture of anger and mocking humor — to counter the sentiment, both in public statements and on social media. The tourism industry jumped on the comments as well. The lodging company Gondwana Collection Namibia released a satirical Namibian tourism video featuring the voice of a Mr. Trump impersonator. And Airbnb is reportedly spending at least $100,000 on a digital ad campaign to promote travel to these countries — a message echoed in a tweet from its chief executive. While Mr. Trump’s strong language (he denied using the word “shithole”) has been widely condemned as ignorant and racist, it’s clear by other reactions that many see these countries as undesirable destinations. “This is about poverty and crime,” tweeted Paul Joseph Watson, a far-right YouTube personality and an editor at large at InfoWars.com. “It has nothing to do with race.” The tweet was liked over 5,000 times, and many users commented in agreement. Opinions, though, differ significantly from those who are familiar with the countries. “Of all the amazing places I lived in during my 18 years as a diplomat — including highlights like Paris and New York — Haiti is the place that sticks in my mind the most, because of its beauty and the character of its people,” said Peter Kujawinski, a writer who, as an American diplomat, lived in Haiti for a total of four years since 2000. Avid readers of travel journalism may have also noticed many of these same countries on a number of prominent 2018 “best of” destination lists. Our own 52 Places to Go in 2018 featured several African destinations, including Kigali, Rwanda; Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia; Tangier, Morocco; and São Tomé and Príncipe. Elsewhere, Harar and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia were recommended by National Geographic and Condé Nast Traveler, respectively, and Forbes flagged destinations in Haiti, Tanzania and Senegal as “Best Budget Travel Destinations for 2018.” And Tanzania’s Ruaha National Park was chosen by National Geographic as one of its “Places You Need to Visit in 2018.” ""Traveling is so much more to me than sightseeing. It also means sharing, learning and feeling,” said Ana Sánchez, who writes about solo female travel at anianywhere.com. Ms. Sánchez, who has spent significant time in Senegal, Turkey and Iran, added, “it was in these countries where I felt most alive.” In this spirit, here’s a small window into a few of the countries that Mr. Trump has brought new attention to — including travel recommendations from those who have spent time there. “I traveled alone to 15 countries in Africa from June to August of 2017 and it has been one of my most rewarding travel experiences to date,” said Kach Howe, who runs the Two Monkeys Travel blog with her husband, Jonathan. “Tanzania is a very modern African country, but retains its unspoiled wilderness.” Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa, is on the bucket list of many adventure travelers. For the height-averse, consider a spice tour or one of the many pristine beaches in and around Zanzibar, an archipelago off the coast. “Unlike most people’s perceptions of Africa, I was able to travel securely, comfortably and very affordably, even in the less populated village of Nungwi (Zanzibar), where I learned to cook real local cuisine,” Mrs. Howe said.

But its proximity to the Indian Ocean also makes water-related activities like windsurfing, sailing and snorkeling popular. Additionally, there’s the world’s largest permanent desert lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley; Lake Turkana; and Mount Kenya, Africa’s second tallest mountain after Kilimanjaro. Those hoping to glimpse some of Africa’s “Big Five” safari animals have many options, including the Masai Mara National Reserve, the Tsavo National Parks and the Borana Conservancy of the Laikipia region, which made our 52 Places to Go in 2017 list.

An investment of $345 million has been made in the tourism industry in recent years, according to the Department. “In my opinion, Haiti is safe for an adventurous tourist, especially if you can speak a little French,” Mr. Kujawinski said. “I think it’s very worthwhile to visit now, because you get a sense of the place before a big tourist wave rolls through.” More Coverage In Haiti, Tracing a Paradise Lost Chef José Andrés on Giving and Getting Back in Haiti Christy Turlington Burns on the Trips That Matter Like Haiti, El Salvador, which Lonely Planet calls “Central America’s most underrated country,” does have a high poverty rate and the U.S. State Department says travelers should be aware of high crime rates and violence — but that hasn’t kept tourists away.

Cape Town, which was No. 1 on our 52 Places to Go in 2014 list, has long been known by tourists for its stunning beaches, Table Mountain (South Africa’s most-photographed landmark, according to Sony) and its closeness to the Stellenbosch wine region. It is currently dealing with a severe drought and has put in place water consumption limits, so those visiting soon should find out in advance what this means and how they can help. “Tourists traveling to a destination, in terms of being a responsible traveler, should always be aware of context of a destination to which they’re traveling, whether it’s cultural sensitivity or religious sensitivity. This is water sensitivity,” Lisa Scriven, the director of Levelle Perspectives, which works to implement sustainable tourism practices, told The Times in December.

2018,A Berlin Restaurant That Cooks Without Compromise,"Bites Mrs Robinson’s manages to match the German capital’s cheeky, creative spirit in its vibe and food. Despite Berlin’s reputation for its uninhibited night life and progressive counterculture, traditionally the city’s fine dining restaurants have fit within the same ho-hum, predictable mold. In the last few years several small but ambitious restaurants have managed to break free, but none have managed to match Berlin’s cheeky, creative spirit as successfully as Mrs Robinson’s. Located in a small space (formerly a kebab restaurant) in the Prenzlauerberg neighborhood, the tiny kitchen is headed up by two recent and young Berlin transplants: the Israeli chef Ben Zviel and Samina Raza, a London native. Mr. Zviel, 28, who first trained with Amir Ilan in Tel Aviv and then, briefly, worked under Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 in New York, had always desired the freedom to develop his cooking without compromise. After some stints in Berlin, he decided that the German capital was one of the few major European cities affordable enough that he could make it happen. With help from several friends, Mr. Zviel and Ms. Raza renovated the space on a tiny budget and finally opened Mrs Robinson’s (named after a “saucy and warmhearted” friend of Ms. Raza’s) in late 2016. “We have a small budget but complete freedom,” Mr. Zviel said. “We are committed first to our truth and then to our customers, never to the whims of an investor.” From the street, the well-lit room with white-brick walls and pale oak floorboards can resemble a minimalist stage set. Once inside, though, it feels more like a friend’s dinner party where everyone is hanging out in the kitchen. An initial visit just a month after Mrs Robinson’s opened revealed an early taste of what Mr. Zviel aspired to: a lively kitchen where he could play and riff with Asian-inspired, umami-rich dishes directly inspired by New York City chefs like Mr. Dufresne and David Chang: a bowl of crispy charred brussels sprouts served with crunchy toasted rice and loads of fresh chopped cilantro; shrimp noodles in a buttery sake-saffron broth, loaded with little salty bombs of fish roe and caviar; a fried soft-shell crab served on a fluffy white bao bun with homemade spicy mayo and a thin slice of kohlrabi. (Because Mrs Robinson’s encourages both sharing and indulging, there is little difference between appetizers and mains.) During another visit in December, over some obscure and upbeat ’70s music, a guest and I perused the menu, which had clearly evolved since my last visit. We started with an off-menu special: two spicy deviled eggs with fried oysters, which were messy but delicious. There were hits and misses: A generous and gutsy sandwich of aged beef tartare, fried sweetbreads, shiso béarnaise and hot sauce was a standout; the octopus Bolognese had great potential but the ratio of sauce to pasta overwhelmed. The biggest surprise at Mrs Robinson’s is the desserts. Unlike most Berlin restaurants, Mr. Zviel treats it as a grand finale. A thick, creamy popcorn soup is poured around passion fruit ice and a swirl of sweetened black tahini cream, under which are obscured sweet crunchy bits of caramelized popcorn and peanuts. A rum banana cake was served with a nondairy amazake (traditionally a sweet, non- or low-alcoholic Japanese beverage) ice cream and like the popcorn soup, kept revealing new flavors and textures with every bite — hidden at the bottom was a layer of toasted puffed quinoa and amaranth. Like a catchy tune, the dish replayed in our minds days later. Mrs Robinson’s, Pappelallee 29; 49-152-0518-8946; mrsrobinsons.de.

2018,A Billion-Dollar Investment in New York’s Water,"New York City’s water system moves over a billion gallons a day, nearly all of it unfiltered. A major investment aims to keep it that way. The Ashokan reservoir, enshrouded in fog in Ulster County, N.Y., provides drinking water to New York City.CreditCreditPiotr Redlinski for The New York Times New Yorkers like to brag about their tap water. Not only is it safe to swill, but it has even been called the “champagne of drinking water.” Now, New York City has committed $1 billion to protect the nation’s largest municipal water system as part of a far-reaching 115-page agreement with state health officials that makes New York one of the few cities in the country that can provide nearly all of its tap water without being forced to rely on expensive filtration plants. “The city’s water system could well be its single most important capital asset — or at least on par with the subway system,” said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. “Imagine living without clean running water in New York City for even a single day. Life as we know it would grind to a halt.” New York’s immaculate water supply is backed by science, lots of it. Every day, dozens of scientists monitor the quality of the city’s drinking water, collecting samples by hand that are tested no less than 600,000 times a year for more than 250 variables, including pollutants. They are augmented by a growing army of robotic monitors that have been plunged into far-flung reservoirs, testing the water another 1.6 million times a year. This enormous monitoring apparatus is one critical part of New York City’s drinking water supply, ensuring the safety of more than a billion gallons of water flowing daily through a sprawling network of three pristine lakes, 19 reservoirs, and mile after mile of aqueducts and tunnels. About 90 percent of that water never sees the inside of a filtration plant, flowing from huge reservoirs as far as 125 miles away in the rural Catskill Mountains. New York has spent more than $1.7 billion to protect this unfiltered water supply since the early 1990s, in return for being granted a succession of federal and state waivers exempting it from costly filtration requirements. It is one of only five cities nationally — along with Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland, Ore. — that have an unfiltered water supply. This marvel of water engineering has attracted visits from scientists and government officials from Australia, China, India, Singapore and Colombia. The financial stakes are high. Vincent Sapienza, the commissioner of the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, said that if the city were refused a waiver, it would have to spend more than $10 billion to build a massive filtration plant, and at least another $100 million annually on its operation — which would be “the largest capital project that the city has ever taken on.” Water bills would have to rise significantly to cover the cost, he said. The city already filters 10 percent of its drinking water from a dozen small reservoirs surrounded by development in Westchester and Putnam counties. In 2015, it opened a $3.2 billion filtration plant under a golf driving range at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The city’s new $1 billion investment in the drinking water system will be used to reinforce and expand a host of programs that protect the one million acres of watershed land surrounding the reservoirs that supply the unfiltered drinking water. The biggest chunk, or $200 million, will be used to maintain and upgrade dozens of wastewater treatment plants. Ensuring the adequate collection and treatment of wastewater, including sewage, is crucial because that wastewater is cleaned and released back into the environment and eventually reaches the rivers and streams that feed the reservoirs. Another $180 million will go toward reducing pollution from working farms and managing forests to remove old and dead trees to make room for young trees that absorb more nutrients from rain and snow melt that run into the reservoirs. There will also be $150 million for shoring up eroding streams to improve water quality and support flood mitigation projects. In addition, $96 million has been allocated for preserving land from development, especially in critical streamside areas, and $85 million will be used to expand a program that repairs or replaces septic systems for homes and small businesses to municipal buildings, churches and other nonprofit groups as well. The new agreement is the result of more than six months of negotiations between city and state officials, along with input from environmental and public health advocates, and representatives of upstate residents near the reservoirs. “New Yorkers have a powerful impact when working toward a common goal — the protection of clean drinking water and lands that provide it,” said Dr. Howard A. Zucker, the state health commissioner. “That is the spirit behind this agreement.” New York City’s modern water system dates to 1842 when water flowed down from the first reservoir in Westchester — created by building a dam on the Croton River — in what would become known as the Croton system. It replaced a local patchwork of ponds, streams, wells and cisterns that were inadequate for a growing city, resulting in shortages during the Great Fire of 1835 and outbreaks of cholera from contaminated water. The new water system was welcomed with parades, fireworks, and fountains shooting plumes of water 50 feet into the air. Eventually, the Croton system grew to a dozen reservoirs, but it was not enough. So in the early 1900s, city officials looked further north and started building the much larger Catskill and Delaware water systems — an immense undertaking that involved relocating residents and cemeteries and submerging entire villages. Today, with three water systems, the city no longer has to worry about where to get its water. Yet it has faced challenges in keeping the water from the Catskill and Delaware systems safe enough to drink. The federal government has generally required surface drinking water systems to be filtered since the late 1980s, granting waivers to New York beginning in 1993 as long as the city’s unfiltered drinking water met federal and state water quality standards. The unfiltered water is disinfected with ultraviolet light and chlorine. The New York State Health Department took over direct oversight of the city’s drinking water system in 2007, and last month issued the latest waiver for 10 years, including a public review process to be conducted at the five-year midpoint. State health officials said that they regularly review the city’s water quality and conduct on-site inspections of the reservoirs and disinfection stations. The new agreement also calls for an independent review of the city’s water protection efforts by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. “The water continues to be of a very high quality,” said Brad Hutton, a deputy state health commissioner. Mr. Goldstein concurred that the city’s water protection efforts have been successful, but added that “this is no time to let down one’s guard.” He pointed to climate change as a growing problem, leading to more storms and floods and rapid snow melts that could increase the turbidity of the water in the reservoirs. City environmental officials said they are expanding their efforts to address the impact of climate change on the watershed, including setting aside more money to buy out homeowners in flood-prone areas and pay for engineering studies of flood hazards in towns and villages. The city’s efforts have not only safeguarded its water system, but also provided tangible economic benefits to residents of upstate towns and villages in the watershed — helping to smooth lingering tensions over the reservoirs, which were built decades ago on land seized by eminent domain. The city’s investment in the water system has created local construction jobs, and funded development loans to hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, a far cry from the economic distress in many parts of northern New York. The Catskill Watershed Corporation, whose board members include local town supervisors, has used city money to reimburse private property owners for treating storm water runoff, and for elevating homes and relocating businesses in flood areas. It has also sponsored school programs about the watershed, including having children raise trout in classrooms that they later release in the Catskills. But its most popular program may be one that has given out more than $40 million to reimburse a total of 5,200 homeowners and small businesses for the repair or replacement of aging septic systems that they might otherwise have to pay for themselves. Those septic systems now treat 1.7 million gallons of sewage a day. “Homeowners get a septic system that is working and the city gets 1.7 million gallons of clean water,” said Timothy Cox, a lawyer for the corporation. “It has been successful in not only preserving the watershed but also the community character of the watershed.”",The New York Times
2018,A Billionaire Keeps Pushing to Impeach Trump. Democrats Are Rattled.,"Democratic leaders have pressed one of their most prolific donors privately, urging him to tone down his campaign calling for President Trump’s impeachment. They have prodded him in public, declaring on television that they consider impeachment an impractical idea. And party strategists have pleaded with Democratic candidates for Congress not to join in. But that donor, Tom Steyer, a California billionaire, has only intensified his attacks in recent weeks. Buoyed by tens of millions of dollars in television commercials — financed out of his own pocket and starring him — Mr. Steyer has become one of Mr. Trump’s most visible antagonists, firing up angry Democrats and unnerving his own party with the ferocity of his efforts. Mr. Steyer is likely to unsettle national Democrats further in the coming weeks, with a new phase of his campaign aimed at pushing lawmakers in solidly liberal seats to endorse impeachment. Having collected more than four million email addresses from people who signed an impeachment petition, Mr. Steyer has begun prodding those voters to call congressional offices and lobby them for support. In an interview, Mr. Steyer was dismissive of party leaders’ reservations about making impeachment an issue in 2018. He described Mr. Trump as lawless and unfit for office; acknowledging the practical obstacles to impeachment, he said raising a popular outcry was a necessary first step. “We’re just telling the truth to the American people, and it’s an important truth,” Mr. Steyer said of his campaign. “And if you don’t think it’s politically convenient for you, that’s too bad.” Already, Democrats acknowledge that Mr. Steyer has helped force impeachment into mainstream conversation, playing to a liberal base that has cheered confrontational tactics like the three-day government shutdown. While Democrats intend to run on a fiercely anti-Trump message this year, party leaders envision a campaign of broad attacks on the president’s economic agenda rather than a blunt-force impeachment pledge. There is no realistic chance of impeaching Mr. Trump while Republicans control Congress, and Democrats from moderate and conservative districts fear the idea could alienate voters otherwise likely to vote their way in November. But the Democratic base, enraged by Mr. Trump and frustrated by party leaders counseling restraint, appears enthusiastically open to seeking the president’s removal. A handful of Democratic congressional candidates — in crucial states like California, Florida, Nevada and Wisconsin — have vowed to pursue impeachment if they are elected. That number is likely to grow during the coming season of Democratic primaries, in which throngs of candidates are competing for the affection of liberal voters who loathe the president. Mary Barzee Flores, a former circuit court judge who is one of more than a half-dozen Democrats seeking a Republican-held seat in Miami, said the issue had plainly resonated with voters in the area, where Mr. Trump is unpopular. Ms. Barzee Flores, who endorsed impeachment in a newspaper column last fall, said Mr. Trump’s firing of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had been a breaking point for her. She is preparing to launch impeachment-themed TV ads of her own. “Like a lot of people, I am appalled by the president’s conduct in office,” Ms. Barzee Flores said in an interview, adding: “I do believe that there’s a basis to impeach the president, and I do believe that he’s got to go. He’s dangerous.” But Ms. Barzee Flores said Democrats should not treat impeachment as a singular issue in 2018, over matters like health care and immigration. “There are other issues that are pressing,” she said. “More pressing, even.” For Mr. Steyer, however, impeachment is a singular cause. And he is no easy character for Democrats to ignore: From his headquarters in a San Francisco office tower, Mr. Steyer, 60, has built a sprawling political operation with more than 200 staff members around the country, mostly employed by his flagship group, NextGen America, which focuses on climate change. Mr. Steyer has amassed a mixed win-loss record over the years, along with a mercurial reputation among Democratic strategists. But he is nearly alone among Democratic donors in his willingness to spend money on a titanic scale. In 2016, Mr. Steyer spent more than $90 million supporting Democrats, and his checkbook may be critical to their efforts to capture Congress. Separate from the impeachment drive, Mr. Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund investor, announced this month that he would spend $30 million on mobilizing young voters in 2018. He has already quietly funneled nearly $2 million into a union-backed effort to capture seven Republican-held seats in California, three strategists directly involved in the campaign said. But on impeachment, Democrats in Congress have made no secret of their skepticism. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate, have called it a premature proposal. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a hero of the left, said Democrats should avoid “jumping the gun” on such a drastic action. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has urged candidates to use more measured language, endorsing investigations of Mr. Trump but avoiding an impeachment pledge. Ms. Pelosi, who has a longstanding relationship with Mr. Steyer and hosted him in her private box at the Democrats’ 2016 convention, conveyed her concerns to him directly. She told Mr. Steyer in a phone call last fall that impeachment was a profoundly divisive issue and stressed that other matters, like the Republican-backed tax overhaul, were more urgent, according to four people briefed on the conversation. But Mr. Steyer insisted that Mr. Trump had more than met the standard for being removed from office, and said his ads were electrifying the Democratic base. The conversation was cordial, according to associates of both Democrats, but neither gave ground. Mr. Steyer, his friends say, has been more pointed in private, appearing indifferent or even emboldened by the criticism of Democrats in Washington. Two of his friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Steyer has taken to declaring that when Ms. Pelosi or Mr. Schumer is complaining, he knows he is on the right track. But Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer are not alone in their reservations. An impeachment resolution introduced last year by Representative Al Green, a Democrat of Texas, garnered only 58 votes in December. (When Mr. Green pushed for a vote for the second time in January, that number rose only slightly, to 66.) Even if the House did vote to impeach Mr. Trump — perhaps under possible Democratic control in 2019 — it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove him from office — a threshold that could only be met with the help of a sizable number of Republicans. That appears an extremely remote possibility. Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania who voted against the impeachment resolution, warned that pressing now could backfire badly. Voicing the exasperation of many of his colleagues, Mr. Boyle called the Steyer campaign a fruitless exercise. “I just don’t see how the ads achieve anything,” Mr. Boyle said. “To do this now, before Special Counsel Mueller finishes the investigation, only complicates our job if Mueller finds something that warrants impeachment, which I believe is a real possibility.” The Democratic base appears more receptive: Seventy percent of Democrats favor impeachment hearings, according to an NBC News/The Wall Street Journal poll published last month. Overall, 41 percent of Americans support impeachment hearings — an unusually high number for a president in his first year, but well short of an electoral majority. If Mr. Steyer’s focus on impeachment is new, his status as one of the most mercurial figures in Democratic politics is not. He has pursued a number of political adventures over the last few years, often hiring expensive consultants and spending heavily on advertising, and then abruptly moving on to an entirely new project. Last year, Mr. Steyer embarked on a kind of political star search, gathering national political strategists, including top advisers to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, to map out a run for governor or Senate. After briefly threatening to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat, Mr. Steyer abandoned plans to run for office in 2018. Former Representative Ellen Tauscher, a Northern California Democrat, said Mr. Steyer had plainly embraced a provocateur’s role instead of putting his name on the ballot this year. But Ms. Tauscher, who leads a “super PAC” targeting California Republicans, warned that voters might balk at electing a Congress bent on driving Mr. Trump from office. “You can’t have a conversation about impeachment until you take the House back, and so this is a little bit like somebody who’s jumped ahead,” Ms. Tauscher said, adding of Mr. Steyer: “I think, to a certain extent, Tom knows this.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Blot on Ireland’s Past, Facing Demolition","Dublin Journal DUBLIN — The General Post Office in Dublin, center of the 1916 rebellion against British rule, is today a shrine to Irish freedom. Three blocks to the east, on a quiet, run-down side street, stands a monument to a very different side of Irish history — though maybe not for long. The old Gloucester Street laundry, the last of Ireland’s infamous Magdalene Laundries to shut its doors, will soon be demolished and replaced by a budget hotel and a student residence — if the City Council has its way. Founded in the 19th century, the Gloucester Street laundry was one of around a dozen such businesses run by Roman Catholic nuns and staffed by unpaid inmates — mostly orphan girls or young women who had become pregnant outside marriage or whose families could not or would not support them — who were given to the nuns to hide them away. Owned most recently by the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge, the Gloucester Street laundry usually had around 100 workers at any one time. It took in its last new inmate — transferred from a psychiatric hospital — as recently as 1995, then closed the following year. The Magdalene women endured many of the same hardships as the inmates of the brutal church-run “industrial schools” for delinquent or unwanted children, and the “mother and baby homes,” where unmarried pregnant women were warehoused until their children were born (and then often taken for adoption). Poor nutrition and hygiene, cold and damp lodgings and little or no medical supervision were the norm. The work in those walled-off institutions was backbreaking and often required handling dangerous chemicals. Mortality rates were high. Of those who died, many were buried in communal graves, sometimes unmarked and unrecorded. In the 1990s, for example, builders redeveloping part of the former High Park laundry in north Dublin discovered the bodies of 155 women in a mass grave on the site. A third of them had been buried without death certificates. A few are still unknown. Catherine Corless, a dogged local historian, made global headlines in 2014 when she published evidence that 796 infants had died between 1925 and 1961 at a mother and baby home in Tuam, in County Galway. Remains of some were found in what appeared to be a septic tank. Rocked by such scandals, and by revelations of clerical sexual abuse, the Roman Catholic Church has lost much of its former authority in Ireland. Laundries, industrial schools, and mother and baby homes have all disappeared, and the Gloucester Street laundry is now one of the last physical reminders of this Irish gulag archipelago. It is also, as it happens, among the final relics of a very different, yet complementary, secret Irish history, a parallel system for controlling and exploiting inconvenient lives. The back gate of the Gloucester Street laundry, where the delivery vans once came and went, is on Railway Street, formerly called Mecklenburg Street. In 1904, Mecklenburg Street was a terrace of grand but fading Georgian houses, and it was here that James Joyce set the “nighttown” section of his novel “Ulysses,” a phantasmagoric visit to a brothel run by “a massive whoremistress” called Bella Cohen. She was a historical figure. And Mecklenburg Street was the heart of a square mile of brothels, speakeasies and slums that took its informal name — Monto — from Montgomery Street, the next street over. It was here, when southern Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom, and when Dublin was a major garrison town of the British Empire, that the authorities tolerated, even encouraged, what was often described as the biggest red-light district in Europe. Monto was a last resort for runaways, widows and abandoned wives. Madams like Bella Cohen controlled them with violence and money, keeping them in debt to pay for clothes and lodgings. As they left their prime teen years, lost their health and their looks, the women passed from “flash houses” for the wealthy to the cheap “shilling houses” and then to the alleys. Those who became pregnant were dumped on the street. In 1921, following the Irish War of Independence, the British Army withdrew from southern Ireland and Monto lost a big chunk of its customer base. The new Irish Free State, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, fell under the social control of the bishops, and prostitution was driven underground. On March 12, 1925, the police raided Monto and closed down what remained, aided by volunteers from a Roman Catholic relief agency, the Legion of Mary. Since then, almost all the old Monto buildings have been demolished and replaced with public housing or private developments. According to a local historian, Terry Fagan, who does walking tours of the old Monto, the Gloucester Street site is among a handful of buildings left from that era. Even the street names have mostly been changed — Gloucester Street is now Sean MacDermott Street, named after a hero of the 1916 uprising. While poverty has been greatly reduced, the area remains relatively deprived, the center of a heroin epidemic that exploded in Dublin in the 1970s. Addicts and dealers haunt corners and squares where prostitutes once plied their trade. Today, the Monto area has faded into folklore, along with the names and lives of its women. One half-remembered streetwalker, Lily of the Lamplight, used to sing to herself under the streetlight where she waited for custom. Long after she was gone, her name passed, by some strange osmosis, into the English version of a wartime German love song, “Lili Marlene.” The faces and names of the Magdalene women are also slipping away from us. Few are still alive. How should they be remembered? Gary Gannon, a city councilor who represents the area, has started a campaign for the Gloucester Street site to be established as a permanent memorial to the Magdalene women. “This is going to go,” he says, standing on the former Mecklenburg Street, by the grim, gray wall of the derelict laundry, “and in 40 or 50 years, how do you explain what existed here, where everyone could see it?” Samantha Long’s birth mother, Margaret Bullen, was born in a mental institution and later transferred to the Gloucester Street laundry at age 16. While in the laundry’s supposed care, Ms. Bullen was raped and, at 19, she gave birth to Ms. Long and her twin sister. The newborns were taken from her and adopted. Too institutionalized to care for herself after a life of confinement, Ms. Bullen died in a church-run home in 2003 at age 51. Ms. Long, who tracked her mother down before she died, says she is not opposed to a hotel on part of the site — “people need jobs” — but she wants a memorial too, something “more than a plaque on the wall.” Mary Merritt, 86, is one of the last surviving inmates of the Gloucester Street laundry, albeit having only spent a week there, on a temporary transfer from the High Park laundry. Taken at birth from a mother she could never trace, Ms. Merritt, too, was raped while an inmate. She had run away from High Park and sought help at the nearby palace of the Archbishop of Dublin. There, in a side room, she was raped by a priest. Forcibly returned by the police to the laundry, she later gave birth to a daughter, herself then placed in an orphanage. Ms. Merritt’s voice breaks at the memory. “The nuns used to have a little garden for themselves there, to the side of Sean McDermott Street,” said Ms. Merritt, who now lives in England. “They should have a little garden of remembrance there. They should knock the old laundry and convent to the ground and have some little flats for the women who are left, or their children if they had them. But not a hotel. Definitely not a hotel.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the attention given to the women of the Magdalene Laundries. Joni Mitchell sang about them in the song, “The Magdalene Laundries.” It is not the case that “no one ever sang about the women of the laundries.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Blue Sky in Beijing? It’s Not a Fluke, Says Greenpeace","BEIJING — Winters in Beijing have long been choked by thick, dusty, toxic smog. But this winter, the sky has taken on a once seemingly unthinkable hue: blue. Now, an analysis of government data by Greenpeace has confirmed what many people could see but that nonetheless seemed too good to be true. Pollution in Beijing and in 27 other cities in northeastern China has fallen precipitously, dropping 33 percent on average compared with the last three months of 2016. In Beijing, pollution fell 53 percent. Greenpeace estimated that lower pollution levels resulted in 160,000 fewer premature deaths across China in 2017. The drop indicated that the government’s antipollution campaign — first announced in 2013 but accelerated last year for regions around the capital — has begun to show results. Even so, pollution levels fell less precipitously or rose elsewhere, suggesting that a concerted effort last fall to shift heating to natural gas from coal may have simply shifted the harmful effects to regions far from the capital. In the northern province of Heilongjiang, on the border with Russia, pollution levels rose 10 percent. In a statement with its analysis, Greenpeace argued that the results demonstrated the need for more government action, noting that nationwide the drop in pollutants was only 4 percent. “China’s national air pollution action plan has brought massive reductions in pollution levels and associated health risks, but policies favoring coal and heavy industry are holding back progress,” Huang Wei, one of the organization’s campaigners, said in the statement. But in Beijing, where pollution levels are tracked as closely as property prices are in Hong Kong, London or New York, the respite from eye-watering, throat-scratching smog has nonetheless been welcomed. Only a year ago the pollution was so bad on some days that schools were closed and flights were canceled. Air quality is measured by the concentration of PM2.5, or particulate matter of a size deemed especially harmful; such pollutants contribute to a variety of health conditions. Anything under 50 is considered good. For a couple of days at the end of December, levels nearly reached 300, which is considered hazardous, but those were, for this winter so far at least, the exceptions. (On Thursday evening, as this article was being written, the level was 29, according to the China Environmental Monitoring Station index.) But beyond the health risks, pollution also poses a political risk for the government of President Xi Jinping as he moves to promote the country’s rise on the world stage. The government does not seem to be resting on its laurels in the fight against pollution. The Ministry of Environmental Protection warned in a statement on Wednesday that clearer skies were caused in part by favorable weather conditions, and that conditions could worsen in late January and early February. “Local governments need to strengthen pollution controls to further cut emissions and make sure they reach their goals on air quality improvement,” the ministry was quoted as saying in China Daily.",The New York Times
2018,A Boutique Hotel in New Orleans’s Garden District,"The Henry Howard Hotel is inspired by the past of both the building and the city. From $209 While most visitors to New Orleans want to be in the heart of the city’s dynamic French Quarter, there’s no denying that its boisterous vibe doesn’t appeal to all travelers. Fortunately, there’s a more relaxing option a streetcar ride away in the Garden District. The 18-room Henry Howard Hotel, a historic double-gallery townhouse, was built by the acclaimed architect Henry Howard in 1867 as a mansion for Edward Conery, a steamship owner and ship chandler, that he later bestowed to his two daughters. After years as a rundown inn, the New York-based Fitzgerald Hotel Group modernized the property while maintaining structural elements for its opening in February 2016. Local culture is tastefully celebrated throughout, from snare drums used as coffee tables in the ground floor parlor to the second line brass instruments hanging above beds in each guest room. The designer Lauren Mabry of Hunter Mabry Design pulled inspiration from both the building and the city’s past for a stunning interior overhaul that is both fun and elegant, and unlikely to date itself. Located in the lower Garden District, only a 10-minute taxi ride from the French Quarter, the hotel sits a block away from St. Charles Street (also known as the Mardi Gras route). The restaurants, bars and antique shops of Magazine Street are a short walk away, as are several of Henry Howard’s other architectural projects that are worth checking out. Our Queen Superior room was located in the north wing, accessible from an outdoor covered corridor, overlooking a nearby parking lot. It was smartly decorated, with red pine hardwood floor, custom toile wallpaper featuring New Orleans icons like the steamboat and the St. Charles streetcar, an iron bed canopy, a mounted trumpet, vintage chairs done up in a black and white stripe fabric, and oil portraits by the local artist Hayley Gaberlavage. But it was a cramped fit for two people. The dressing table was small but helpful in the absence of a closet large enough to properly store our luggage (there was only hanging storage). The bathroom was perched on the mezzanine level of our room, which was a nice separation from the main living space, but given its small size, there was limited room to place our toiletries. The standout feature was the goat-milk bath and body products from Beekman 1802. There is no restaurant on the premises nor a room service menu. Aside from the complimentary breakfast of fresh orange juice, croissants and muffins from the local Laurel Street Bakery that is served on weekends in the downstairs Parlor, you’ll need to dine elsewhere. Fortunately, there are excellent options nearby, like District Donuts for coffee and breakfast, Joey K’s and Shaya. The property offers free Wi-Fi, flat screen TVs, local snacks (Zapp's potato chips, Slow & Low rye whiskey) and useful items like Southern Rhoades bug spray in each room for a charge, plus complimentary coffee from Revelatory Roasters, a local specialty coffee roaster. The hotel has partnered with Franco’s Gym on Magazine Street and City Surf for guests who wish to get in a workout for an extra fee. The lack of on-site dining aside, there’s no mistaking the appeal of this sharply designed boutique property in a neighborhood that was sorely lacking in quality lodging. But to truly make the most of your stay, book Royal Queen rooms and above for more space and greater comfort.

2018,A Brief History of American Independent Film: ‘Split Screen’ on FilmStruck,"Streaming For as long as I’ve been professionally acquainted with him, John Pierson has been an unusually energetic guy. In his early line of work, as a sales agent for independent movies, one had to be unusually energetic, with the travels, the marathon deal-negotiating sessions, and all the eccentric and sometimes volatile personalities at play. In the mid-90s he shifted from making deals to chronicling the deals he’d made and the people he’d met along the way. His 1996 book, “Spike, Mike, Slackers & Dykes: A Guided Tour Across a Decade of American Independent Cinema.” (reissued in 2004 as “Spike, Mike Reloaded”) told of his adventures with Spike Lee, Kevin Smith, Jim Jarmusch, Rose Troche and other filmmakers whose careers Mr. Pierson assisted and kick-started. After it was published, Mr. Pierson began producing and hosting an unusual TV program “Split Screen,” which had its premiere on IFC in 1997. Over four years he made more than 60 half-hour episodes containing freewheeling informative interviews and video essays covering a wide range of topics in American indie film. “Split Screen” served up many of what you might call the usual suspects — Mr. Smith, whose outrageous 1994 no-budget comedy “Clerks” remains an American indie landmark, showed up early and spoke freely and at length. But “Split Screen” approached familiar figures from unusual angles. An episode from 1999 features Christopher Walken and Julian Schnabel giving cooking tips and sharing a meal with John Ciarcia, known as Cha Cha or the Mayor of Little Italy. The show also made room for, say, a segment in which John Waters exchanged notes with the gore schlockmeister Herschell Gordon Lewis and an entire episode about animals in film. Mr. Pierson had long hoped to find a permanent home for the series on physical media, or elsewhere, and times being what they are, he’s gone with “elsewhere.” “Split Screen” now resides on the Criterion Channel of the streaming site FilmStruck, and Season 10 is scheduled for a Jan. 13 premiere there. The division of seasons is somewhat arbitrary, but at six episodes per season (five standard episodes, and one subtitled “Projections,” which focuses on a single film or filmmaker), it’s a reasonable system for mini-binge watches. Mr. Pierson has taped brand-new introductions for each season. (The Christopher Walken cooking segment opens Season 9.) The show took up the “guided tour” theme of Mr. Pierson’s book by depicting the host tooling around the country in an RV. One running joke was to “park” the vehicle outside New York’s Ziegfeld Theater starting three months before the 1999 opening of “The Phantom Menace,” the “Star Wars” episode. (Also noteworthy are Mr. Pierson’s casual-wear choices, which the host cheerfully recognizes as appalling. The pullover he sports in a “Projections” interview with the actor and screenwriter Buck Henry, in Season 10, is particularly vivid.) Mr. Pierson’s passion for his brand of cinema is a palpable thread throughout. It’s infectious, and the segments produced by other film folk that Mr. Pierson picked up along the way testifies to that; their work has the same informed, fervent quality. “I had to cobble the first 10 episodes on my own, for the most part, with my wife, Janet, helping,” he said. (Janet Pierson is now the chief programmer of the film section of South by Southwest, the annual festival in Austin, Tex.) “Most of the ideas were things I myself was wildly enthusiastic about,” he continued. “But there was a pool of larger people coming to me with their ideas, and the point of the whole show was to spread that enthusiasm around — I’ve sometimes described myself as the Johnny Appleseed of this world. So when people who were capable came to me with ideas they loved, but I might not have had the same personal attachment to, I was beholden to give them opportunities to create segments around stuff they loved.” After years of pursuing the Criterion Collection about putting together a DVD or Blu-ray package of the show, Mr. Pierson eventually had to accept that TV content was, with one or two exceptions, not something that Criterion did. That changed when Criterion teamed up with Turner on the FilmStruck site. “The show fits really well with what the site does; it’s a very happy home for it,” he said. Once the determination was made, Mr. Pierson was slightly surprised that the site insisted on putting up all 66 episodes over a period of time. While the show is, by definition, of a certain age, it’s not as dated as it might have seemed, in part because Mr. Pierson rarely did segments based entirely on time-specific pegs. And almost all the individual films and filmmakers he focused on turned out to have staying power. (In this sense, the series is a good companion to “Cinéastes de Notre Temps,” the French TV documentary series that ran from 1964 to 2009; right now three episodes of that show are on FilmStruck’s Criterion site.) When I spoke to Mr. Pierson on the phone from his home, where he says he’s keeping busy cooking for his wife while she prepares the slate for the next SXSW, I asked his veteran’s view of what streaming is doing for indie movies today. He expressed some skepticism. “As someone who began as a sales agent, I’m an empiricist. So I find it frustrating to have no idea of how many people are watching anything across the streaming spectrum. Back in the day, if someone said, ‘Hey my film’s doing great,’ you could verify if they were delusional or right. Now, who knows?” Streaming services don’t gauge their success according to ratings, or box office numbers, because they don’t need to. But Mr. Pierson sees in this business model not just great potential for exposure, but great potential for anonymity. “What’s notable to me, too, is that you once could gauge things to the degree by which they got traction in the general cultural conversation,” he said. “When you could have any newspaper in America riffing in headlines on ‘sex, lies, and videotape’ or ‘Slacker,’ and ‘Do the Right Thing,’ you could feel how those filmmakers are penetrating the culture. You can tell that it had gotten outside the indie community echo chamber. In the current landscape, I find myself in the dark, but thinking maybe the cultural impact has been lessened.” My own feeling is it’s too soon to tell, and that’s one thing I’ll be exploring in future columns.",The New York Times
2018,A Brooklyn Family’s Journey Finally Reaches the N.B.A.,"On the face of it, the story of Dakari Johnson — a 22-year-old backup center for the Oklahoma City Thunder — is familiar. He’s an anonymous rookie, fighting for minutes, hoping to plant the roots of a long career. When his chances have come, he has seized them. With center Steven Adams out with a contusion to his right calf on Nov. 10, Johnson got his first N.B.A. start. Late in the game, against the Los Angeles Clippers, Johnson made a crucial jump shot, then took the opportunity to blow kisses to the sky. “His swag,” the Thunder star Paul George said after the game, “is at an all-time high.” But since then, with Adams mostly healthy, Johnson has racked up as many D.N.P.s as meaningful minutes. From his seat on the bench, then, he seemingly represents potential yet unfulfilled. But it’s not that straightforward. Johnson comes from a long, boisterous line of activist-minded Brooklyn-bred ballers with nicknames like Slomotion. Behind that little-known rookie bench player is a true family saga — and the fulfilled dreams of generations. “A lot of my past teammates have people in their family who play,” Johnson said. “But my family, it’s high school, pro-am, college, uncles, aunts, cousins, daughters. Everything revolves around basketball.” Now, it revolves around the N.B.A., too. As Johnson’s cousin Clarence Fruster put it, “We feel like we fiiiinaly got one.” They are not the Mannings, not a gilded lineage whose professional successes feel preordained. This family is scrappier, woolier — more New York. It begins with the patriarch, Jitu Weusi, a basketball and community legend from Bedford-Stuyvesant. He was a fearless and hyperactive educational activist who founded Uhuru Sasa Shule, one of New York City’s first black private schools, and co-founded the East, a cultural center and jazz venue. “Hard-core progressive institutionalism,” Fruster called it. “This was organized, intentional, systemic. He was doing it in such a way that racists could not even bother him. He was the guy you cannot arrest.” Born Leslie R. Campbell, Weusi — a 6-foot-10 center — played on scholarship at Long Island University. He wore No. 44, the same one Johnson wears now. He was also the father to eight children and stepfather to two more. One of those was Keith Fruster, Clarence’s father. Weusi renamed him Pamoja, Swahili for “togetherness.” In the Cage — the cramped basketball courts at West Fourth Street — they called him something else. “He was 6-5, slender, muscular, could definitely finish above the rim,” Clarence Fruster said of his father, who died when Clarence was young. “When he was coming through, you got out the way. He’d part the lanes.” That’s why they called him Moses. While Weusi was busy consulting with activists and politicians, like Al Sharpton and David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, it was up to Pamoja to pass the game on to his brothers and sisters. He would sign them up for three-on-three tournaments, cajole them on weekend mornings to run laps around the high school track and have them practice layups for hours at a time. Kojo Campbell, another of Weusi’s sons, played on scholarship at Stony Brook and “was a freakishly good street ball legend in his own right,” Fruster said. At Rucker Park and the city’s other legendary courts, Campbell became known as Slomotion. “I guarded whoever the best scorer was: Lance Stephenson, Kemba Walker, Ron Artest — I guarded all those guys,” said Campbell, who was quite possibly the only Larry Bird fan in 1980s Bed-Stuy. (He would never scuff anyone’s Jordans, though.) Three of Pamoja’s sisters also landed college scholarships. One was Makini Campbell, Johnson’s mother. At 6-5, she had become a defensive-minded center for L.I.U., her father’s alma mater. “She would ball out,” Fruster said. “That was just plain old mind-blowing.” In her last year of eligibility, Campbell became pregnant with Johnson. “I always tell him, ‘You were inside the womb playing basketball,’ ” she said. Johnson was the prodigy. By 8, he was playing for the Gauchos, the famed New York A.A.U. club, and spending his summers zipping across the country for high-level camps. He played his high school ball at two powerhouses, St. Patrick High School in New Jersey, which produced Kyrie Irving, and Florida’s Montverde Academy, before playing at Kentucky. He declared for the N.B.A. draft after two years and was drafted by the Thunder in the second round. It was a joyous moment, but not yet the summit: Johnson was contracted to the Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder’s development league team, where he shined for two years. In the summer of 2017, he got the call he was waiting for: The Thunder were offering a two-year N.B.A. contract. “Your heart starts pounding,” Kojo Campbell said. “ ‘This is big. This is exciting.’ But even at that point it’s like, ‘O.K., O.K. — ink’s not on the paper yet.’ ” Johnson would indeed be on the Thunder’s 2017-18 opening day roster in October. And a month later, he landed that first N.B.A. start against the Clippers. “I’m at the animal hospital with his dog who’s about to have surgery for eating a corn cob,” his mother recalled. “We’re making decisions. I’m texting him. He says: ‘Mom, I can’t talk right now. I have media.’ I’m like: ‘Media? Boy, what do you have media for? You lucky you get in!’ Then I find out, oh my gosh, he might start tonight!” In Johnson’s telling, everyone had a part in helping him develop. “My uncles, they’d beat up on me,” he said. “That created the love because I wanted to compete. From my mom, what I learned was patience.” Around his sophomore year, he said, everyone “started faking injuries, started coming up with excuses” to get out of playing against him. He also had his “big cousin,” Michael Murray, to fend off. Murray played at Coppin State and now plays professionally in Spain. “He’s the one I was honestly trying to catch up to my whole life,” Johnson said. Weusi died while Johnson was at Kentucky. The funeral was held in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and the overflow poured onto the streets. Amiri Baraka, the poet and playwright, attended. Pharoah Sanders, the jazz saxophonist, played. John Calipari, Johnson’s coach, was there. “My dad would be over the moon knowing Dakari is playing in the N.B.A.,” Nandi Campbell, one of Weusi’s eight children, said. “I can see him walking down the street telling everybody. Even strangers.” Johnson has yet to crack the Thunder rotation and play regular, significant minutes. His big goals remain unfulfilled. His presence in the league is, for his family, a wonder. But they know there will be more hard work to come. “It has been generations of cultivating skills,” Kojo Campbell said. “But it’s not, ‘Oh, we needed somebody in the N.B.A. — we can breathe easy now.’ The legacy of this family is about being able to validate ourselves. It’s the focus on the process. It’s: ‘You know what? We can do this ourselves.’ ”",The New York Times

2018,A Buttery Spanish Cheese for Melting,"Front Burner It’s no challenge to find Manchego, the popular Spanish cheese. But Mahón has only recently become widely available in the United States. The pale yellow cheese, from the island of Minorca, is versatile. Typically a squarish loaf, it is buttery mild with a fruity aroma after three months of aging. Paprika gives the rind its bright orange hue. At six months, the rind darkens to brown, the texture firms up and the cheese becomes more robust. There is another six-month-old version, made from raw milk, with a more intensely fruity flavor. All are excellent melters: Mahón, Whole Foods and Gourmet Garage stores, $16 to $24 per pound, depending on the variety and the store. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,A Cake for Dr. King,"What to Cook Good morning. We commemorate the life and death of Martin Luther King Jr. today, born on this day in 1929 and assassinated 39 years later, a fiercely peaceful warrior for justice and equality in America. “Happy birthday,” Stevie Wonder first sang in 1980. “Sing it loud as you can.” If you’d like to bake in celebration, try Melissa Clark’s recipe for an almond birthday cake with sherry-lemon buttercream (above), though history records Dr. King’s preferred dessert as pecan pie. For myself, I’ll eat a slice of both and then make my way north to Canada, where I’m set to interview David Sax onstage at the University of Toronto this evening, about his article on the rising tide of Syrian refugees in Toronto’s food scene, and to talk to some of the subjects of his reporting. (Tuesday night I’ll be in Montreal, to speak with the chef David McMillan about the origins of French Canadian cuisine.) Join us if you can. There’s plenty of cooking you can do instead, if you can’t come. I like Melissa’s new recipe for red curry noodles, an easy home version of the Thai standard. As I do David Tanis’s new recipe for steamed Chinese-style fish, which takes one-pot cooking to a whole new level. You cook the fish on the very plate on which you’ll serve it! Or, if you’d like to stay with our Canadian theme, you can try Sara Bonisteel’s new recipe for butter tarts, that well-loved north country dessert. They would make a Monday night sing, absolutely. Have you made chicken teriyaki lately? Or tried Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for creamy cabbage soup with Gruyère? (It has no cream in it.) I like Mark Bittman’s recipe for pot roast with cranberries — and I bet if you tried making it in an electric pressure cooker, which is all the rage in some precincts of NYT Cooking, you could get it done in about an hour. How about spiced tomato and egg casserole, Melissa’s take on a fragrant and vivid Parsi recipe? I could see mopping that up with warm flatbread in the light of a candle and thinking myself deeply content at the top of the week. Go visit NYT Cooking for more recipes and instruction on how to make them. Save the recipes you like to your recipe box and, after you’ve clicked on the link that sends you a grocery list and shopped and cooked and eaten, rate the recipes with stars or leave notes on them for yourself and others, to remind yourself that this one needs a little more salt, or that that one can be made with chicken instead of lamb.

Now, it’s nothing to do with chicken ballotines or the proper way to steep your saffron, but I do think you ought to read King’s “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” today, written from a narrow cell in April 1963. You could watch his “I Have a Dream” speech as well, delivered in August of that year, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. And you should, for history’s sake, take a look at The Times’s riveting eyewitness coverage of his murder in 1968, which was led by the reporter Earl Caldwell. Reflect on all that.

2018,A Cake to Keep Your Sweet Tooth in Shape,"A Good Appetite There is banana bread. And there is banana cake. And though the two share many sweet traits in common, they are not at all the same thing. Banana bread, baked in a loaf pan, is necessarily restrained — the kind of thing you feel good about eating for breakfast. Though it might have a thin glaze or sugar topping, it never has frosting. You might even spy healthful flecks of wheat germ or flaxseeds folded into the batter. Such nods to wholesomeness have no place in a banana cake. With towering layers covered in billowing frosting, banana cakes qualify as dessert, not breakfast — unless, of course, a sugar rush is your waking intention. This version is most definitely a cake: a fluffy, festooned pile of shaggy coconut and caramelized, buttery banana. With their rich, round tropical flavors, coconut and banana are beautifully complementary. The cake layers house the bananas, which are roasted until golden and syrupy before being mashed into the batter. Roasting the bananas is a clever trick I picked up from cooks on the internet. It intensifies their fruitiness and gives them toasted, caramelized notes. Roasting also helps along bananas that are not quite ripe enough to be turned into cake — the ones with peels that are mostly yellow rather than speckled brown. While riper is always better for banana cake (and banana bread for that matter), roasting gives you a slightly wider window of banana usability. The coconut appears in both the cake and the frosting. Fluffy and white, it is similar to a classic cream-cheese frosting, but coconut cream stands in for some of the cream cheese. Be sure to use pure coconut cream and not cream of coconut (which you’d blend into a piña colada). If you’re unsure, read the label; if there’s any mention of added sugar, it’s not the right stuff. You can also use pure, full-fat coconut milk if you can’t find coconut cream; just chill and skim the solid cream off the top. Since this is a cake and not a quick bread, be sure to use sweetened shredded coconut rather than the unsweetened kind. Without sugar steeped into the flakes, they won’t turn golden and crunchy in the oven the way you want. Reveling in the sweet mash-up of sugar, butter, bananas and coconut is what this cake is all about. If you’re looking for something lighter and leaner, there are plenty of salubrious banana bread recipes out there. This one’s to keep your sweet tooth in shape.

2018,A Calming Elixir to Drink Before Bedtime ,"My Detox To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse — and refresh. “When I have my back issues, that’s really just my body screaming at me,” says the creative consultant Matilda Goad. “I always think I’m not stressed out. But it is hard being a one-man band.” Goad, 28, has gained a reputation in London thanks to her work for everyone from Shrimps (the purveyors of faux-fur coats beloved by millennials) to the traditional furniture brand Soane Britain; in February, she launched her eponymous home-goods website, which sells the scallop-edged rattan lampshade that is one of this year’s most coveted décor items. Behind the scenes, in lieu of drawing a bath or making a cup of hot cocoa after a long day in the studio, Goad prepares a turmeric latte as part of her nightly de-stressing routine. The drink is part of her active approach to wellness to keep her stressors in check; she also schedules regular cranial osteopathy, reflexology and acupuncture sessions with the local Ladbroke Grove practitioners. It was a chef friend who introduced Goad to “golden milk,” a warming blend of spices and turmeric served in coconut milk that is prized for its anti-inflammatory properties. Rather than purchasing a ready-made option, Goad prefers the process of making her own homemade brew. She picks up the ingredients from the Spice Shop off Portobello Road and assembles it mostly by eye, smelling and tasting the mixture and then making adjustments. Goad counterbalances the drink’s all-embracing soporific effect with a box-set binge (right now, the terrifying crime series “The Tunnel” is in her DVR). “It’s like a hug,” she says of sipping the evening elixir. “It switches me into a different mentality. You’re certainly not going to reply to an email after you’ve drunk this.” Here, she shares the recipe with T. ∙ ½ a turmeric root, grated and chopped ∙ ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg ∙ ½ teaspoon dried cinnamon ∙ ½ teaspoon cardamom ∙ 1 cup coconut milk 1. Add one cup of coconut milk to a pouring pan. (Goad likes Labour & Wait’s enamel milk pan.) 2. Peel and then grate one small turmeric root, before chopping slightly and adding to the pan. 3. Grate a little nutmeg, and then add it to the pan together with the cinnamon and cardamom. 4. Keep on a low heat stirring regularly for around five minutes until slightly steaming. Do not boil as the milk will burn. 5. Check for taste and add more spice as required. 6. Once ready, use a wooden spoon to strain the turmeric from the liquid as you transfer into a cup. For extra comfort, warm the cup with hot water before pouring the liquid from the pan. Makes one serving.",The New York Times
2018,A Canadian Food Fest and Toronto’s Islands: the Canada Letter.,"I tagged along on a Times Food section roadshow to Toronto and Montreal this week that allowed me to meet several newsletter readers and enjoy two fine dinners, including one at Joe Beef which although it’s one of the smallest restaurants in Canada, it’s perhaps best known one in Canada. Sam Sifton, the food editor, offers his impressions of the trip: This week was a Canadian whirlwind for me and some of my colleagues, as we celebrated the publication of a special Food section devoted to the pleasures of Canadian cuisine with live journalism events in Toronto and Montreal. On Monday night I led a discussion at the University of Toronto, with David Sax and the subjects of his story about a rise in Syrian food businesses in Toronto; the following morning I made my way to Montreal to interview the restaurateur David McMillan at the Corona Theater in Little Burgundy. The conversations were nuanced and deeply interesting, and the questions we took from the audiences indicated to me a real and abiding interest in the particulars and particular charms of Canadian cuisines, the plural intended: a nation of immigrants and indigenous peoples that sees its reflections on its plates. McMillan in particular was fascinating on this point, an Anglophone native of Montreal with a fierce, almost separatist take on the importance of French culture in the province, who still pointed out that French Canadian cooking has roots in Britain as well. “Ours is a cuisine of the occupied,” he said. There were murmurs of approval in the audience before him. For myself, I was struck most by the passion of all those we spoke to, onstage and off, for the culture of Canada’s foodways. We went to Canada knowing we had a few stories to tell. I return to New York knowing there are dozens and dozens more. All of us on the Food desk, and all those of us who work in our bureaus in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, hope to tell them soon and over the course of many years to come. Nearly 300 people showed up in Montreal and about 500 in Toronto. I certainly share Sam’s observations about the crowds’ passion. Five times a week, Sam sends out newsletters with suggestions of what to cook in the coming days as well as his take on music, film, books and whatever strikes his fancy. If you don’t subscribe, you should sign up here. We’ll be holding more events in Canada (and, yes, including places outside of Ontario and Quebec). Sign up here for advance notice of them by email. As Sam mentioned, the food section this week was all about Canada. It includes the fantastic story of Algonquin chef Cezin Nottaway who was visited by Dan Bilefsky, my Montreal-based colleague, at the Kitigan Zibi reserve. Don’t miss Jasmin Lavoie’s video, which explores Ms. Nottaway’s thoughts about hunting and her prey. Pete Wells, our restaurant critic, found that Kissa Tanto in Vancouver “conjures an imaginary parallel world.” And wine writer Eric Asimov tells the story of François Morissette who grew up near Montreal, worked in Burgundy and now makes wine in the Niagara Peninsula. Sam and his group of editors have also pulled various Canadian recipes from The Times’s archives, including one from me. Read: The Canada Issue Although I enjoy winter, there have been times over the last few weeks when it has been excessively cold. In Toronto, which usually suffers damp and slushy winters, the deep freeze brought skating to the harbor. Catherine Porter went out on the ice and came back with a charming update about the tiny community on the Toronto Islands, illustrated with remarkable photos by Aaron Vincent Elkaim. Your comments on the article show that decades after the residents successfully fought to remain on what is otherwise parkland, they still provoke mixed reactions from nonresidents. Some readers view the islanders as charming contributors to Toronto’s fabric. But many others, including “Bruce from Toronto,” see them as “a handful of entitled people who are allowed to essentially squat on prime waterfront acreage in the nation’s largest city.” Read: Shivering? That’s for City Folk. For Islanders, Ice Time Is Play Time. Imax, the Canadian creation that came out of Expo 67, remains the biggest thing, screen-wise, in cinema. But before Imax there was Cinerama. I still vividly remember going to Detroit at age 10 with my father to see “Grand Prix” in Cinerama. Previewing a technique that would be widely seen at Expo the film often used multiple images on a divided screen. A new exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York looks at the history of Cinerama, which required three projectors running simultaneously. Only three theaters in the world can still show Cinerama in its full glory. Read: Long Before Imax, the Curious Tale of Cinerama Well, the final numbers are in for the challenge to see if readers of this newsletter or the Australia Letter would sign up the highest number of new subscribers. And I’m sorry to report that Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief, whipped his readers into a frenzy that saw them sign up 1,921 new readers while we only gained 1,334 during the challenge period. I will note, however, that we do have three times more subscribers than the Australia Letter. So I’m doing penance this weekend by wearing a Team Australia hockey jersey while watching episodes of “Skippy The Bush Kangaroo.” (The Aussie hockey team hasn’t made it to the Olympics since 1960 but who’s counting.) As for our other contest, there were too many emails during the Commonwealth Challenge period about the newsletter to declare a single one as the best. So I randomly selected three and will be in touch with the winners. Sarah Murray, the Canadian-born coach of South Korea’s women’s hockey team, faces an unusual challenge now that the two Koreas have agreed to enter a single, unified squad at the Winter Olympics just as they are about to get underway. —Eleven Canadian cities took up Amazon’s call and pitched themselves as the site of its second headquarters.

Ms. O’Riordan was married to Canadian Don Burton for 20 years and divided her time between Ireland and the cottage country near Peterborough, Ontario. —For Caribou trapped on an island with predators, “It’s like being confined in a prison cell with someone who’s trying to murder you,” one scientist said.

HERE IN BERLIN By Cristina García Illustrated. 208 pp. Counterpoint. $26. O.K., granted I’m a sucker for anything to do with Berlin, so you may want to weigh my opinion with that in mind. But it strikes me that Cristina García’s “Here in Berlin” is one of the most interesting new works of fiction I’ve read. It’s billed as a novel, but there are few (if any) novels that take a similar form. In 35 separate monologues, plus five italicized sections describing the unnamed Visitor who elicits these interview statements, García presents a portrait of the city that is at once true and imaginary. The Visitor herself — a middle-aged Cuban-American woman who has gone through two divorces, has a grown daughter, intensely dislikes her own mother and has acquired German during a previous stay in Frankfurt — bears an acknowledged resemblance to the author, but this book is not a personal travel diary. Referring to herself in the third person, the narrator chooses, as she says, to “indulge the luxury of a more distant perspective.” Only the Berliners she speaks with have an explicit “I,” and it is through the mosaic of their perspectives that we learn the true character of Germany’s ghost-filled capital, in which the remembered or purposefully forgotten past seems as alive as the present. The voices are remarkably distinct, and even their linguistic mannerisms — with interpolations of bits of German, multiple ways of rendering or evading the facts and direct addresses to someone who is variously referred to as “Kind Visitor,” “Dear Visitor,” “Liebe” and “Schätzchen” — mark them out as separate people. They include a tango-dancing lesbian, a flower-seller from Vietnam, a nurse, a lawyer, an antique dealer, an ophthalmologist born in Africa, a number of former Nazis, several women raped by Russian soldiers, a limping ballerina, an East German cultural official assigned to invent a pop-dance craze and a photojournalist with amnesia. There are overlaps among their stories — three or four are patients of the Angolan eye doctor and many of them seem to inhabit the same old-age home or haunt the same cemetery — so the novel does begin to cohere as the stories accumulate. But it never arrives at a fixed definition, either of the city or its inhabitants, and that is partly what makes it so accurate a portrait of both. García’s version of Berlin contains perhaps a disproportionate number of Cubans, brought to Germany mainly through the Havana/East Berlin Communist nexus and introduced to the narrator through her own Cuban connections. But that too is characteristic of the general experience. Arriving in this city of exiles, the foreign visitor inevitably encounters a number of erstwhile compatriots, so it is no surprise that this Cuban-born writer should find others of her kind. And in fact she was led to Berlin in the first place by a fellow Cuban she calls A., an appealing character in his own right: “A. had been gratefully (his word) married to the same German woman for 20 years. Her family hailed from Hoyerswerda, and never forgave A. for taking their daughter away. They called him ‘the Negro’ and ‘the Mexican’ and once sang the Horst Wessel Song in his presence. ‘The family is a police state,’ the Visitor said, describing how minuscule stages lit up inside her, repeating key scenes from her life. ‘Do people remember only what they can endure, or distort memories until they can endure them?’ After a long silence, A. said: ‘Childhood is a city you never leave. In Berlin’s past, we seek our own.’ ” We can none of us ever get entirely free of our ghosts, either personal or national, and Berlin, with its peculiar history of destruction and division, seems designed to bring that realization to the fore. Given that García began her professional life as a journalist, a reader might imagine that the whole book consists of near-literal transcriptions of actual interviews. But about a third of the way through we are introduced to Maganhildi Koertig, a 2-foot-10 woman living in an insane asylum; she claims to have been matched up (“on the basis of vertical compatibility alone”) with the diminutive Oskar Matzerath, a fellow inmate who owned a set of “battered tin drums.” I know far less about German literature than García evidently does, so I can’t say how often in the book this happens, but here, at least, I recognized that we had left the real Berlin and entered the realm of Günter Grass’s fiction. And that, in turn, made me wonder how many of her other characters were either made up entirely or borrowed from novels and stories — an uncertainty that only added to my admiration. García’s much-praised earlier works, which dealt with her Cuban background, were published by major New York presses; yet this more ambitious novel, in which she transcends her own life story to tread delicately on the turf staked out by Christa Wolf and W. G. Sebald, has been released by a small press in California. Is this because big-time literary publishing can no longer tolerate seriousness of purpose? Or is it that a Cuban writer is expected to remain a Cuban writer, locked into her assigned box so as to reach her target audience? This novel, in any case, bears none of the obvious trappings of commercial success. It is not suspense-filled. It is not heartwarming. It is simply very, very good.",The New York Times
2018,"A Case for Math, Not ‘Gobbledygook,’ in Judging Partisan Voting Maps","Sidebar WASHINGTON — In October, when the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could reshape American politics, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. registered an objection. There was math in the case, he said, and it was complicated. “It may be simply my educational background,” the chief justice said, presumably referring to his Harvard degrees in history and law. But he said that statistical evidence said to show that Wisconsin’s voting districts had been warped by political gerrymandering struck him as “sociological gobbledygook.” Last week, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. came to the defense of math. “It makes no sense for courts to close their eyes to new scientific or statistical methods,” he wrote in a decision striking down North Carolina’s congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Judge Wynn directed his criticism to Republican state lawmakers, who had urged his three-judge Federal District Court to ignore what they called “a smorgasbord of alleged ‘social science’ theories,” and not to Chief Justice Roberts. But Judge Wynn did use one of Chief Justice Roberts’s most prominent opinions to make the point that numbers can have a role to play in judicial decision making. That opinion, in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, effectively struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It included a statistical chart showing the shrinking “racial gap” between registration rates for black and white voters in six Southern states. The statistics in the recent gerrymandering cases were more complicated, but not by much. Just as comparing registration rates between black and white voters yielded a “racial gap,” comparing the voting power of Republican and Democratic voters yields what the challengers in the Wisconsin case called an “efficiency gap.” The efficiency gap is a measure of the consequences of the two basic ways of injecting partisan politics into drawing legislative maps: packing and cracking. Packing a lot of Democrats into a single district, for instance, wastes every Democratic vote beyond the bare majority needed to elect a Democratic candidate. Cracking Democratic voters across districts in which Republicans have small majorities wastes all of the Democratic votes when the Republican candidate wins. The difference between the two parties’ wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes cast, yields an efficiency gap. At the argument of the Wisconsin case in October, Chief Justice Roberts mocked the efficiency gap, referring to it by its initials, and suggested that it was fiendishly complicated. “The answer is going to be because E.G. was greater than 7 percent, where E.G. is the sigma of party X wasted votes minus the sigma of party Y wasted votes over the sigma of party X votes plus party Y votes,” he said. “And the intelligent man on the street is going to say that’s a bunch of baloney.” Part of Chief Justice Roberts’s point was that a mathematical formula is not a legal standard, and that is true. In the early stages of the litigation, the challengers suggested that a gap of more than 7 percent was legally significant, which does seem arbitrary. But the three-judge Federal District Court panel in Wisconsin that struck down a state legislative map there did not base its decision on the efficiency gap, relying instead on a more conventional legal test that considered discriminatory intent, the map’s partisan effects and whether they were justified by other reasons. The efficiency gap, the court said, was evidence that corroborated the majority’s conclusions. The same was true in the Shelby County opinion. Chief Justice Roberts did not contend that a particular racial gap proved a constitutional violation, but only that his numbers were good evidence of powerful changes. (This was probably just as well, as a recent ProPublica article suggested that there were flaws in the chief justice’s methodology.) The Supreme Court has not hesitated to use social science to explore disparities between two groups. In 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, for instance, the court cited studies from psychologists and others to show the negative effects of segregation in public schools. On Friday, North Carolina lawmakers asked the Supreme Court to put Judge Wynn’s ruling on hold while the court considers two pending cases. In addition to the Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, the court has also taken up one from Maryland, Benisek v. Lamone, No. 17-333. One way or another, the Supreme Court is very likely to issue a landmark decision on political gerrymandering by June. Judge Wynn’s 190-page opinion surveyed many topics, but its most striking passages seemed addressed to justices who had majored in the humanities. “The Constitution does not require the federal courts to act like Galileo’s Inquisition and enjoin consideration of new academic theories,” Judge Wynn wrote. “That is not what the founding generation did when it adopted a Constitution grounded in the then-untested political theories of Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau,” he wrote. “That is not what the Supreme Court did when it recognized that advances in our understanding of psychology had proven that separate could not be equal.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Cheeky Novel of Male Vulnerability Hits the U.S. at Last, Timelier Than Ever","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. LONDON AND THE SOUTH-EAST By David Szalay 352 pp. Graywolf. Paper, $16. Paul Rainey is a loser. The protagonist of David Szalay’s first novel, “London and the South-East,” Rainey leads a team at a telephone ad sales company in Holborn; for years, he has worked with the kind of puffed-up men who admire Alec Baldwin’s character in the 1992 film version of the play “Glengarry Glen Ross,” which Rainey thinks depicts salesmanship as both “mythic” and “sweatily desperate, duplicitous and soul-destroying.” Playing a wealthy motivational trainer assigned to scare a group of real estate agents into closing deals, Baldwin embodies the white-collar alpha male. But unlike his colleagues, Rainey — a 39-year-old “shortish, plump,” alcoholic chain-smoker with a history of depression — has never been able to relate to Baldwin’s role. Deep down, he places himself among the “losers” Baldwin torments. He thinks this “may be significant,” and he’s right. Like a career in ad sales, “London and the South-East” is built on “innumerable moments…[of] humiliation” that begin when Rainey loses a deal he believes is guaranteed. He responds by getting so drunk that he imagines a cute young bartender is interested in him, then falls off a train. As he is lifted “like a dead weight” off the tracks, young people laugh and pelt him with bits of kebab. The blooper, its detail artfully meted out in bursts of hung-over reflection, sets the tone for a character portrait that is no less heartbreaking because it is funny, or because Rainey’s loserish qualities are shared by almost every other figure in the book. (A larger-than-average percentage of characters in this novel are seen vomiting, for example.) Soon, an elliptical set of betrayals that most resemble those of sociopathic teenage girls leaves Rainey unemployed and, in his characteristic grim self-awareness, questioning his agency — “How pathetic he must have seemed,” he reflects, “to take what had happened as if it were simply his due. He did not understand why he had acted like that.” Seizing the opportunity to escape the tedious yet all-consuming power dynamics of office life, he decides his new job should involve “useful simple manual work” and ends up on the night shift stocking shelves at a grocery store. He bungles everything from the routine smoking of a spliff to his relationship with his long-suffering partner, Heather. As the title suggests, Rainey’s pathetic nature is infused with a particularly British wetness, both unremarkable and unrelenting; though Szalay is Hungarian-Canadian, he betrays his London upbringing in a prose infused with self-deprecating cheek (the list of pubs Rainey associates with better days is nearly a page long). As a result, the novel, which begins in 2004 and was published in Britain in 2008, has taken a while to reach American readers. But the lag makes surprisingly little difference. Despite having been written before the global economic recession and the ongoing so-called crisis of masculinity, “London and the South-East” may resonate more now than when it first appeared. Clever but never cruel, Szalay renders male pain as few writers have managed, without veering into sexism or caricature. The inevitable pity you feel for Rainey is yet another insult, but Szalay’s knack for the matter-of-fact can elevate observations of the unexceptional to moving poignancy: “If it is hyperbolic to talk about ‘tragedy,’” he writes of Rainey’s brief snooker career, “a sad sense, at least, of something squandered.” Later, he simply notes, “It is all so sad.” In the 10 years since publishing this novel, Szalay has written three books, including last year’s Man Booker-shortlisted story collection, “All That Man Is.” Having recently claimed a “disaffection with the novel form,” today’s Szalay himself may find that his debut, conventional in plot and structure, reads a little stale. But for me, “London and the South-East” was like the porridge Rainey prepares as his daily breakfast/dinner when he wakes up at 5 p.m. for the night shift: traditional, sure, but also hearty and fulfilling, and somehow able to offer a kind of redemption.",The New York Times
2018,A Chinese Empire Reborn,"News Analysis The Communist Party’s emerging empire is more the result of force than a gravitational pull of Chinese ideas. A military parade in Beijing in 2015.CreditCreditJonah M. Kessel/The New York Times I am the son of two empires, the United States and China. I was born in and raised around Washington in the Nixon-to-Reagan era, but my parents grew up in villages in southern China. My father was a member of the People’s Liberation Army in the 1950s, the first decade of Communist rule, before he soured on the revolution and left for Hong Kong. So it was with excitement that I landed in Beijing in April 2008 to start an assignment with The New York Times that stretched to almost a decade. I had just spent nearly four years reporting on the bloody failure of the American imperial project in Iraq, and now I was in the metropole that was building a new world order. China had entered a honeymoon phase with other nations. For years, anticipation had built for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Though China had suppressed a Tibetan uprising that spring, it earned international good will after a devastating earthquake. People flocked to Beijing for China’s “coming out” party. Foreign leaders gawked at gleaming architecture and opening ceremonies that signaled the nation’s ambitions. After the festivities ended, the world arrived at another inflection point — the implosion of the American financial system and the global economic crisis. China’s growth buttressed both the world economy and a belief among its officials that its economic and political systems could rival those of the United States. Though unabashedly authoritarian, China was a magnet. I was among many who thought it might forge a confident and more open identity while ushering in a vibrant era of new ideas, values and culture, one befitting its superpower status. When I ended my China assignment last year, I no longer had such expectations. From trade to the internet, from higher education to Hollywood, China is shaping the world in ways that people have only begun to grasp. Yet the emerging imperium is more a result of the Communist Party’s exercise of hard power, including economic coercion, than the product of a gravitational pull of Chinese ideas or contemporary culture. Of the global powers that dominated the 19th century, China alone is a rejuvenated empire. The Communist Party commands a vast territory that the ethnic-Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty cobbled together through war and diplomacy. And the dominion could grow: China is using its military to test potential control of disputed borderlands from the South China Sea to the Himalayas, while firing up nationalism at home. Once again, states around the world pay homage to the court, as in 2015 during a huge military parade. For decades, the United States was a global beacon for those who embraced certain values — the rule of law, free speech, clean government and human rights. Even if policy often fell short of those stated ideals, American “soft power” remained as potent as its armed forces. In the post-Soviet era, political figures and scholars regarded that American way of amassing power through attraction as a central element of forging a modern empire. China’s rise is a blunt counterpoint. From 2009 onward, Chinese power in domestic and international realms has become synonymous with brute strength, bribery and browbeating — and the Communist Party’s empire is getting stronger. At home, the party has imprisoned rights lawyers, strangled the internet, compelled companies and universities to install party cells, and planned for a potentially Orwellian “social credit” system. Abroad, it is building military installations on disputed Pacific reefs and infiltrating cybernetworks. It pushes the “One Belt, One Road” infrastructure initiative across Eurasia, which will have benefits for other nations but will also allow China to pressure them to do business with Chinese state-owned enterprises, as it has done in recent years throughout Asia and Africa. So far, Chinese soft power plays a minor role. For one thing, the party insists on tight control of cultural production, so Chinese popular culture has little global appeal next to that of the United States or even South Korea. No nation knows China’s hard ways better than Norway. China punished it by breaking diplomatic and economic ties for six years after the independent Nobel committee in 2010 gave the Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy writer imprisoned in China (he died of cancer in July). President Xi Jinping is the avatar of the new imperium. The 19th Party Congress in October was his victory lap. Party officials enshrined “Xi Jinping Thought” in the party constitution, putting him on par with Mao Zedong. Mr. Xi said China had entered a “new era” of strength and the party would be the arbiter of public life. Mr. Xi holds appeal for foreign leaders aspiring to strongman status — President Trump openly admires him. Many Chinese people told me they still believed the country’s top leaders looked out for ordinary people, even if the party was rotting. This belief was rooted in abstract hope rather than empirical evidence. It was like peering through the toxic air enveloping Chinese cities in search of blue sky. The culture of hard power goes from top to bottom. In the provinces, party officials move quickly to suppress any challenges to their authority. When they sense rising mass resistance, they buy off or imprison the leaders. I saw this in my first year in China, when officials separately broke the will of parents furious over deadly tainted milk and ones grieving over thousands of children who had died in shoddily built schools during the Sichuan earthquake. I learned this was typical of the approach taken by Chinese officials. Most Chinese do not run afoul of the party, but those who do pay a high price. The abuse of power is frequent, and many Chinese say corruption is their top concern. All other issues, from environmental degradation to wealth inequality, are linked to it. Mr. Xi is canny enough to capitalize on the discontent: He leads an anticorruption drive that allows him to oust rivals and enforce party discipline. None of that results in the rule of law. And China’s domestic security budget has exceeded that of its military in recent years, even as both grow rapidly, highlighting the nation’s investment in hard power. I learned in 2016 that Tashi Wangchuk, a young entrepreneur who had spoken to me about his advocacy for broader Tibetan language education, had been detained in his hometown, Yushu, by police officers. In microblog posts, Mr. Tashi had asked local officials to promote true bilingual education, and he had appeared in 2015 in Times articles and video. Mr. Tashi is the kind of citizen China should value — someone working within the law to recommend policies that would benefit ordinary people and ease tensions. But two years later, Mr. Tashi remains imprisoned. A court tried him on Thursday for “inciting separatism” despite criticism from Western diplomats and human rights groups. The party’s style of rule threatens to turn sentiments against China even as the empire grows in stature. History teaches us about an inevitable dialectic: Power creates resistance. While the state can bend people to its will, those people meet it with fear and suspicion. The United States learns this lesson each time it over-relies on hard power. I traveled often to the frontier regions because it was there that the dynamic of power and resistance was most evident, and that I got the clearest look at how China treats its most vulnerable citizens, those outside mainstream ethnic Han culture. No other areas better embody the idea of imperial China. Conquered by the Manchus and reabsorbed by Mao, these lands make up at least one-quarter of Chinese territory. Party officials fear they are like the Central Asian regions under Soviet rule — always on the verge of rebellion and eager to break free. In October 2016, I quietly entered the sprawling Tibetan Buddhist settlement of Larung Gar and watched the government-ordered demolition of homes of monks and nuns. In parts of Xinjiang populated by ethnic Uighurs, the tension is even greater, fueled by cycles of violence and repression. Uighurs speak in hushed tones of restrictions on Islam and mass detentions. Signs across Xinjiang forbid long beards and full veils, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. On my last reporting trip in China, to the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar, I saw police patrols in riot gear rounding up young men. An important bellwether is Hong Kong, the former British colony from which my parents emigrated to the United States. On this southern frontier, as in the west, the party works to silence the voices of students, politicians and other residents critical of its rule. Agents have even abducted booksellers. But those moves have actually led to more resistance and strengthened Hong Kong and Cantonese identity. They have also stoked greater fears of Beijing among citizens of Taiwan, the self-governing island that the party longs to rule. It is not a stretch to say the party’s ways of governance perpetuate a lack of trust by the Chinese in their institutions and fellow citizens. And its international policies light the kindling of resistance overseas, from Australia to Ghana. Chinese citizens and the world would benefit if China turns out to be an empire whose power is based as much on ideas, values and culture as on military and economic might. It was more enlightened under its most glorious dynasties. But for now, the Communist Party embraces hard power and coercion, and this could well be what replaces the fading liberal hegemony of the United States on the global stage.

But a good walk helps. “For my stone dances, I was just walking on the street one day and I found a sudden connection with a rock,” she said in a telephone interview from Tokyo. She picked it up and could sense reverberations. “It’s like a creative message,” she said. “I follow it and see where it leads me.” It’s been 17 years since Ms. Takei, whose ritualistic, expressive dances value the natural world, last presented work in New York, but on Jan. 25 she returns with her company, Moving Earth Orient Sphere, as part of the Lumberyard in the City Winter Festival. Adrienne Willis, Lumberyard’s executive and artistic director, said that the focus of this season’s festival is not only women but also on female choreographers and directors whose work has been absent from New York stages in recent years. “We started with Kei,” she said. “I had never seen her work live. I had only studied it or heard about it or worked with people who had been influenced by it,” including the choreographer Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. “She always talks about Kei,” Ms. Willis continued. “There was a moment where we were sitting around and said, ‘What about Kei Takei? I wonder what she’s doing?’ ” Ms. Takei, who came to New York in 1967, moved back to Tokyo in 1992 to raise her son. There, she continued to choreograph and perform, but her engagements here have been irregular. Ms. Willis said: “Her work is still studied and appreciated. It was funny that nobody was ever like, ‘Kei, do you want to come back to the U.S.?’ ” The Lumberyard festival will also highlight work by the playwright and performance artist Robbie McCauley (in “Sugar,” Feb. 1-3) and the choreographer, dancer and visual artist Dana Reitz (in “Latitude,” Feb. 8-10). For Ms. Takei, it’s a chance to present two works, one new and the other vintage. Both come from her “Light” cycle, which she began in 1969. In “Part 8,” a solo from 1974, Ms. Takei uses fabric to tie herself up in knots, and in “Part 44 (Bamboo Forest),” which is to have its New York premiere, she explores imagery related to bamboo. It’s a work for 12 dancers to whom she’s drawn, she said, for their “expressive virtuosity.” Ms. Takei, who wouldn’t reveal her age, still dances in her works and was a featured artist in “Beyond the Mainstream,” a 1980 presentation of “Great Performances: Dance in America” that focused on new dance. Many of the choreographers in it hailed from the postmodern collective Judson Dance Theater. But Ms. Takei, who studied at Juilliard, beginning in 1967, wasn’t part of that crowd. Instead she formed a company, which she later named Moving Earth because, she explained, “we all move and we are on the earth.” She paused. “Sometimes moving companies make a mistake.” Ms. Takei spoke with some translation help from her husband, Lazuro Brezer, who is Moving Earth’s associate director. “We get a lot of calls from people looking for furniture moving companies,” Mr. Brezer explained. “Or people trying to sell us earth-digging tractors.” Ms. Takei confirmed this with a giggle. What follows are excerpts from the conversation. How did you end up at Juilliard? It was through Anna Sokolow [the politically conscious American choreographer and dancer]. She came to Japan and held a workshop. You had to show a dance to Anna, and she said that my dance was honest. I was very surprised. I didn’t have much technique or style, and there were a lot of really technically strong dancers jumping and flying around. What was your Juilliard experience like? I thought I learned modern dance in Japan, but it was totally different. American modern dance had a style — there was the Martha Graham style or the José Limón style. I was very discouraged. My English wasn’t very good, so it was very hard. But Lucas Hoving was teaching composition class and that was the one class that I really enjoyed. That was the only A I got at Juilliard. Some of the others were Fs. After two years, I finally I had to give up. Where did you go? I went to the Henry Street Settlement. I looked for other things. I went to those places where people came from other countries, like Peru or Chile, and those dancers looked like me. They couldn’t speak much English, they were kind of sitting in the corner of a studio, but they were very strong. And the passion they had! So I made my group with those people. What did you want to express that wasn’t being expressed in American modern dance? My work doesn’t start with technique. I had to find my own individual movement — movement that was honest and real for me. I lived near the Hudson River and I walked around a lot. I missed classes when I was walking. But I needed to find my dance. What did you discover? One fall day, there were dry leaves on the ground. I was walking in them, and I kind of found part one of “Light.” I had this realization that I was going to make a dance using the leaves. In “Light, Part 1,” three women and I do a very simple movement with cloth bags filled with dry leaves on our backs. That’s the sound, and I am mostly rolling around on the floor in a large pile of dried leaves. In your new work, you’ve landed on bamboo. Bamboo is a very special plant in Japan and also for me. I like the movement. They can bend over and become wild, but when they are not moving they really become silent and still. There is an ancient feeling and also a spiritual feeling. Also, the bamboo blossoms every 60 or 120 years and when the blossoms start, young or old, every tree begins to blossom and then they all die together. It’s like self-sacrifice in the trees and that is a nice, strong life feeling. Why is walking such an important part of your creative process? It’s grounding and away from daily life. It cleans up my spiritual side. It’s finding the essence of me.",The New York Times
2018,"A Chris Mullin and Patrick Ewing Reunion, This Time on the Sideline","About a minute before tipoff at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, St. John’s Coach Chris Mullin walked toward midcourt and gave a mock shrug of his shoulders. It was that universal look of, “How did we end up here?” And then he embraced his foe for the evening, his foe for the ages, Patrick Ewing. It is Mullin’s home court, but Ewing will always remind him that his Knicks jersey is hanging from the arena’s rafters. It is Ewing’s first season as the coach of Georgetown, but Mullin won’t let him forget that his advice pushed Ewing toward accepting the job. So, yes, Mullin and Ewing have long since cooled the animus that existed between the rivals during their Big East playing days. But that did not dull the interest in Tuesday’s warm and fuzzy reunion. After they hugged, Mullin turned toward the stands and pointed to a spot five rows behind the St. John’s bench. There, the former St. John’s coach Lou Carnesecca, 93, caught the gesture, stood, and blew Ewing a kiss. Ewing, in turn, could not pass up the chance to rib Mullin for his dark suit. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in a tie,” Ewing said to him. The joviality would dissipate as soon as the ball was tipped, as soon as each man could melt into the flow of the game, fueled by the competitiveness that made them fierce adversaries first, and respected off-court friends later. They have some distance to travel before their teams will remind anyone of the squads that met that February night in 1985, St. John’s ranked No. 1 in the country and Georgetown No. 2, when the Garden sold out and a national television audience tuned in. But on this night they gave a respectable crowd a good show. The play was sloppy — the teams combined to shoot 4 of 23 from 3-point range in the first half — but excitement built toward the end as St. John’s fought back from an 8-point deficit with 4 minutes 34 seconds remaining and tied the score. But a 3-pointer by Georgetown’s Jessie Govan as the shot clock ticked down with 25 seconds left gave the Hoyas enough cushion to hold on, with a final score of 69-66. It was a fitting ending — Govan is Georgetown’s center, a position long synonymous with Ewing. Ewing, 55, said it never even crossed his mind to tell his team before the game what it should mean to play in the Garden. “I think they already know what playing here means to me,” Ewing said. “My body still aches from the years that I spent here.” As if to illustrate the point, his 7-foot frame nearly buckled a few minutes later as he stepped off the dais in the news conference room after the game. Mullin, 54, still plays pickup basketball, works out furiously, and looks as if he could scale the outside of the arena without a rope. But he is still feeling his way through his third season leading St. John’s. He has found his voice, after appearing somewhat disengaged on the sidelines at times during his first season. His team is more seasoned; three starters, Justin Simon, Tariq Owens, and Marvin Clark II, transferred to the program from other high-major schools. He has had a chance to recruit players that fit his tough-nosed, quick-paced style of play. The Red Storm is also small, prone to lapses in focus, and at times can appear allergic to making baskets. It is why the team has started Big East play without a win in five contests — the second time that has happened under Mullin. When he pledged to try to return St. John’s to prominence, there was a clear image in mind. He had helped the Red Storm go 31-4 in 1985, the best record in program history. But three of those losses were to Ewing and the Hoyas, including one in the Final Four. Perhaps the most memorable game was that February matchup, in which a grinning John Thompson, Georgetown’s coach, hid a sweater under his blazer as a friendly way of goading the knit-loving Carnesecca. The game became known as the “Sweater Game.” Georgetown won that one, too. They won a lot when Ewing was there as a player, and they’re starting to win a bit more with him as coach. The Hoyas started the season 8-0 and are now 2-3 in the conference, including a double-overtime loss to Butler. “He’s done a great job,” Mullin said of Ewing. “He’s got coaching experience. The one thing from his playing career and coaching career in the N.B.A., he’s a hard worker. Puts the time in. He’s got discipline, intensity, and he loves the game.” Ewing looked cool and comfortable on the sidelines. Mullin sweated bullets, kept a towel nearby, and pounded bottles of water. Just like it always was. The two coaches are trying to think positively about the future. For a night, the Garden crowd was allowed to reminisce.",The New York Times
2018,A Cinematographer on Her Oscar History-Making Moment,"Rachel Morrison, the director of photography for “Mudbound,” broke new ground Tuesday, becoming the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for best cinematography. The film — a Dee Rees-directed period piece examining the lives of two Mississippi families, one black and the other white, circa World War II — is filled with gritty visuals brought to life by Ms. Morrison. Mud, as the title indicates, is an essential feature along with harsh wide shots that show an unromantic view of the Jim Crow-era South. Ms. Morrison’s big break came with Ryan Coogler’s 2013 drama, “Fruitvale Station.” Her success is a rarity in Hollywood. According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women accounted for four percent of all cinematographers working on the top 250 films of 2017, a decline of one percent from the year before. Her next project is another collaboration with Mr. Coogler: the Marvel film “Black Panther,” due Feb. 16 in the United States. After a flight to Park City, Utah, where she is a member of the dramatic feature jury at the Sundance Film Festival, she spoke by phone about the nomination, her career dreams and the highly anticipated superhero movie. These are excerpts from the conversation. What does this nomination mean to you? I am incredibly honored and I’m hoping that it’s just the beginning. I hope that it tells more women that they can get behind the camera. It’s a dream I’ve been chasing my entire career and I never necessarily thought it would happen. It’s also a tremendous honor to be the first. See this year’s Oscar nominees and make your picks. What are the biggest barriers you’ve faced as a woman behind the camera? I’ve actually never seen it as a deficit. I think, if anything, I’ve always found it to be an asset because I get to stand out in a crowd. I think it’s an industry that makes a ton of sense for women. It’s all about empathy and handling emotion and visuals. I don’t know that I’ve ever found it to be a challenge. Maybe in jumping the budgets — it’s definitely taken me longer to go from indie movies to studio films than most of my male counterparts. But that would probably be the only thing I’ve experienced as being challenging. Do you find it frustrating to be referred to as a female cinematographer? Yeah, I think it’s ridiculous. This is a job that’s gender neutral and I can’t wait till the day that we’re just DPs [directors of photography], the way teachers are teachers and doctors are doctors and lawyers are lawyers. I think as soon as we represent more than two or four percent, and we’re not such a crazy anomaly, then hopefully people will just start referring to us as DPs. Also, I’m excited for the work to speak for itself and not just lumped into “Here’s what the female DPs are doing right now.” The visuals for “Mudbound” are fairly dark, compared with some picturesque depictions of the South, like Steven Spielberg’s “The Color Purple.” How did you decide to go that route and how challenging was it compared with your other works? I think it’s actually very much in line with my other work. We definitely decided to go bold or go home as far as letting dark scenes be incredibly dark. We wanted to be very careful not to glorify the period. It was showing just enough beauty to understand the hope and why people chase the dream of land ownership, but enough dark and grit to understand what the reality was actually like. How different was your approach to “Black Panther” than “Mudbound”? I assume “Black Panther” was a lot more fun to film. I certainly wasn’t going for a washed-out look in [“Mudbound”]; it’s incredibly dark. [“Black Panther”] is generally speaking a much brighter, poppier, more saturated film.",The New York Times
2018,A City Where East Meets West and the Past Is Always Present,"Nonfiction GHOST EMPIRE A Journey to the Legendary Constantinople By Richard Fidler Illustrated. 492 pp. Pegasus. $29.95. ISTANBUL A Tale of Three Cities By Bettany Hughes Illustrated. 800 pp. Da Capo Press. $40. When the British writer Patrick Leigh Fermor set out to traverse Europe on foot in 1933, his fantasy was to see only one city: “The chief destination was never in a moment’s doubt. The levitating skyline of Constantinople pricked its sheaves of thin cylinders and its hemispheres out of the sea-mist.” It was a vision partially derived from Yeats and Pierre Loti, the “holy city” with its “gong-tormented sea” and its memories of many a “drowsy Emperor” entertained by mechanical golden birds — a fantasy not unlike the one that drove the Vikings to the Bosphorus in A.D. 860, spellbound by the idea of the metropolis they called Miklagard, or the Rus of Kiev to choose Christianity in the 10th century. That is, in any case, the Western vision; the Islamic vision was equally mystical: “Verily you shall conquer Constantinople,” the Prophet said. Compressed into one urban site, the layers of Istanbul’s pagan, Christian and Islamic pasts present endless narrative possibilities that historians can form into sweeping, commercially enticing sagas. Two new, purposefully encyclopedic, books do precisely that. Richard Fidler’s “Ghost Empire: A Journey to the Legendary Constantinople” and Bettany Hughes’s “Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities” follow — if we are to stay within the limits of writing in English — in the footsteps of the brilliant John Freely’s “Istanbul: The Imperial City” and Philip Mansel’s “Constantinople: City of the World’s Desire, 1453-1924.” But the two books are very different both in structure and tone. Fidler, a well-known Australian radio broadcaster, uses the conceit of exploring Istanbul with his young son as a narrative prop. Hughes, equally well known in Britain for her popular historical documentaries, gives us an even heftier opus written with a classicist’s linguistic precision. Both books tell the same story of the same city populated by the same cast of characters. Except that they don’t. Hughes’s book begins with the prehistoric substrata, delving with curiously gripping detail into layers of settlement archaeologists have only recently unearthed. She begins with the discovery of the world’s oldest wooden coffin, under the Yenikapi metro station, containing an 8,000-year-old woman whose fellow villagers even left their footprints in the ancient mud. And so, right from the start, we are confronted with a vastly larger sense of time than that in which the city is usually conceived. Moreover, Hughes also establishes just how deep the Greek roots of the settlement called Byzantion went, and how heterogenous the Hellenic frontier town of the seventh century B.C. probably was. She has a fine feel for the complexities and shadings of that distant past. One of the strangest and most haunting objects in 21st-century Istanbul is the twisted bronze monument called the Serpent Column, a fifth-century B.C. monument to the Greeks’ victory over the Persians. Still standing inside the shattered remains of the hippodrome, broken and yet superbly elegant, it was commissioned by the Spartan general Pausanius and moved to its present location by Constantine himself in A.D. 324. “One cannot help but feel,” Hughes writes, “that Pausanius would be secretly pleased to know that this monument — a rather etiolated creature now — is one of the few remaining classical antiquities to survive back in modern Istanbul in the public space next to the Blue Mosque, today a favorite lunch-break stop for tourists and young Istanbullus.” It’s like a root from a vanished forest that has accidentally survived. In contrast, Fidler begins his story more conventionally, with the Romans and, to be more precise, with his son, Joe, in Rome’s Capitoline Museum, admiring the colossal head of Constantine, the man who made Constantinople both the capital of the Roman Empire and a Christian metropolis. While Hughes’s tone is both scholarly and rich in visual detail, Fidler entertains us with novelistic vignettes and cut-and-paste erudition, though he wobbles a little here and there. In a timeline that precedes the main narrative we are informed, for example, that the city was “renamed Istanbul” in 1453. In fact, the Ottomans kept the name Kostantiniyye in official usage until the dissolution of their empire in 1923, and the two names were used in parallel fashion by court officials. “Istanbul,” in any case, comes from the common Greek expression “eis tin polin,” “into the city,” and was a word used by both Turks and Greeks long before Mehmet’s conquest. As always with this great hybrid city, the continuities have as much force as the momentous changes. That said, Fidler displays great charm in the telling of his tale, spicing it with delicious gossip. Take the story of Nicephoros II Phokas, the ruthless mid-10th-century emperor who turned the tide of Byzantine military fortunes with a series of brilliant victories against Arab armies, culminating in the reconquest of Cyprus and Aleppo. In the summer of 968, the Lombard bishop Luitprand of Cremona visited Constantinople to negotiate a marriage contract between the family of Nicephoros and the future Otto II, king of Italy. Tensions between East and West were running high. Nicephoros treated the bishop shabbily, and Luitprand returned the favor with some unfavorable immortalizations. “He is a monstrosity of a man,” Luitprand wrote, “fat-headed and with tiny mole’s eyes. A short, broad, thick beard disfigures him, half going gray and disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long, which is pig-like by reason of the big close bristles on his beard. In color he is like an Ethiopian and, as the poet says, ‘you would not want to meet him in the dark.’ ” Interestingly, this tale doesn’t appear in Hughes’s account. Instead, she goes from a discussion of the Viking presence in the 11th century to a lovely depiction of everyday life inside the walls of the city in that period and from thence to a consideration of the rich and productive cultural rivalry between the Christian empire and the caliphate, an overlooked period of synthesis and mutual imitation. She draws our attention to the “polychrome” mosaic of the Near East and the polyphony of the great Greek-speaking Roman city that lay at its heart, and rightly so. Much that we now consider “Western” had its roots in that mosaic. Hughes argues that in this period — just before the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 heralded the arrival of a new enemy, the Turks — the two religions and empires had found a way of coexisting: “The men and women of Constantinople knew, from firsthand experience, of the conviction within the vast Muslim empire that thickly rimmed their lands. Hot-headed, unilateral aggression would only result in jihad. Constantinople, the City of God, was an entity that needed guarding, not squandering, that had to rely on displays of diplomacy and strength rather than on direct aggression.” Yet surely the rivalry had itself been made more potent by the military successes of Nicephoros at precisely this time and the recalibrating of influence his “direct aggression” had achieved. After all, the reconquest of the largely Greek city of Aleppo in 962 was no small matter; it was a demoralizing catastrophe for the Hamdanid regime on the Arab side. And the pig-like emperor ridiculed by Luitprand was so violent and austere in his military methods that he was known as “The Pale Death of the Saracens.” Of course, historians always omit some things and include others that seem more important to them, and so it should be. Neither Hughes nor Fidler ignores the violent arrival in Byzantine lands of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan in the late 11th century (Fidler notes that his mustache was so long it had to be tied behind his head to keep it from flying into his eyes during battle) and with him the beginning of Christian Constantinople’s long decline. Like the Ottoman sultans who would succeed him, Arslan filled his court with mathematicians and literati, including the Persian poet Omar Khayyam, and in the end the eventual transformation of the Christian city into a Muslim one entailed less disruption and destruction than is commonly imagined. The Istanbul of Suleiman was every bit as imperial and cosmopolitan as that of Justinian, and it’s a virtue of both books that they’re able to depict this transformation subtly while at the same time showing how intricate and improbable Istanbul’s history has been. The effect is rather like stumbling across the Serpent Column late at night after carousing in Istanbul’s 21st-century nightclubs: a melancholic sense of historical vertigo.",The New York Times
2018,"A Cleansing Juice Recipe, From the Missoni Family","My detox To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse — and refresh. “My mom always tried to cure us with natural things,” says the designer Margherita Missoni Amos. The daughter of Angela Missoni (of the Italian knitwear dynasty) can remember the homespun remedies of her childhood: She would gargle apple cider vinegar to soothe a sore throat and breath in thyme essential oils to unblock a stuffy nose. Amos’s grandmother, Rosita, is a big believer in cold-pressed juices to fortify one’s system. She swears by a concoction made from carrots, apple, lemon and celery that has been part of the family’s breakfasts for a long time; Rosita used to drop in a few ice cubes to lend it a refreshing chill. That simple recipe stuck with Margherita, 34, who now likes to make it as part of her annual detox in January. Missoni says the juice helps her feel “cleaned out and energized” after rounds of Christmas lunches and dinners. She fires up a professional-grade cold-press juicer at her house in St. Moritz — where she heads for the New Year with her husband and their sons, Otto, 4, and Augusto, 2 — and starts her day with the blend before hitting the slopes. If she needs an extra dose of comfort, she adds an additional step, courtesy of Rosita. “I learned from my grandma to always drink a big cup of hot water with a half of a lemon squeezed in it” upon waking, she says. “It just balances your stomach.” Here, Amos shares the recipe for the time-honored Missoni tonic. ∙ ½ apple ∙ 3 carrots ∙ 2 celery stalks ∙ ½ lemon 1. Pass the apple, carrots and celery through a cold-press juicer and stir to combine. 2. Squeeze in the lemon by hand. Makes one serving.",The New York Times
2018,A Clothing Line Based on Her Great-Grandmother’s Aprons,"Up Next Paris Starn Age: 24 Hometown: The Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Now lives: In a two-bedroom walk-up apartment in the East Village. Claim to Fame: Ms. Starn is a hard-to-pin-down creative spirit who has been a child actress, a baker and, more recently, a fashion designer. Her professional life started early, when she appeared in several episodes of “Sesame Street” between the ages of 2 and 6. She also appeared in a short film, “Anna,” directed by Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, her godmother’s sister, when she was around 12. Artistic expression runs in her family: She is the daughter of the artist Mike Starn and Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. Big Break: When she was 15, Ms. Starn spotted the founders of the store Opening Ceremony at a fund-raising event for Dia:Beacon and got up the courage to ask them for an internship, which she landed. Ms. Starn, who by then had become a passionate cook, came up with a unique way to stand out. “I’d bring in baked goods every day, because I wanted to be the most liked intern ever,” she said. She was quickly nicknamed Mini Martha and given a food column on the store’s blog, spotlighting her tarts, cakes and cream puffs. Latest Project: In mid-January, Ms. Starn debuted her first line of clothing, Paris 99, at Opening Ceremony. The collection consists of breezy gingham mini-dresses that are suggestive of vintage kitchen aprons. Her great-grandmother’s aprons, she said, were an inspiration. “I wanted to show off backs, waists, legs — not the parts of the body that are overtly sexual, but ones that have a lot a beauty to them,” Ms. Starn said. She began making dresses a few years ago, as a student at Bard College, when she couldn’t find clothing she liked. Although she has no formal design training, she began sewing when she was about 5, creating Halloween costumes with her father. Next Thing: She’s planning to expand the collection beyond dresses, to include trousers, shirts and bustiers. When she’s not designing, Ms. Starn is pursuing a graduate degree in art history at Hunter College. The Art of Fashion: As a little girl, she would frequently spend afternoons at Chelsea art galleries with her parents. Toward the end of those jaunts, she was encouraged to choose a final gallery to visit. “I would take them to Comme des Garçons,” she recalled. “My parents always laughed at me and I didn’t understand why, because I genuinely thought those clothes were art, which they are.”",The New York Times
2018,A Colombian Rebel Group Resumes Attacks After Cease-Fire Ends,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Colombia’s fragile peace was shaken on Wednesday as the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group known as the ELN, attacked a military base and an oil pipeline just hours after a 102-day cease-fire ended, the government said. While no deaths were reported, the attacks underscored the steep challenges Colombia faces as it tries to negotiate a peace deal with the ELN similar to the one that it signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in 2016. The attacks by the ELN also came days ahead of an expected visit to Colombia by the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, to monitor the FARC peace process. President Juan Manuel Santos said in a statement that “the national government was always open to extending the cease-fire with this group and negotiating a new one.” But he added, “Inexplicably, the ELN didn’t just refuse but resumed attacks this morning.” He said he had recalled the leader of his team involved in peace negotiations with the rebels. Mr. Santos won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for his role in the deal with the FARC. But security analysts say that the ELN is far less organized and more ideological, and that Mr. Santos, whose term ends this year, has few viable paths to sign a peace agreement with a group that seems interested in continuing attacks. “The ELN is disconnected from the electoral reality,” said Jairo Libreros, a professor at the Externado University in Colombia who follows the group. “They think that through acts of violence, society will rise up to call that the government signs a peace deal.” The attacks appeared to be typical for guerrillas: a midnight raid on a military base in the eastern department of Arauca, in which commandos threw a grenade at soldiers guarding a post, injuring several them. Near the town of Aguazul, about 100 miles from Bogotá, the capital, another group bombed an oil pipeline, the government said. The guerrillas defended their decision to resume attacks. The main purpose of the cease-fire, “to improve the humanitarian situation of the population, was hardly achieved by the regime,” they said in a statement. “We delivered on the objectives.” The guerrillas said the attacks on Wednesday had “occurred in the middle of a complex situation of conflict in the country.” It called on the government to resume talks but did not offer another cease-fire. Few in Colombia believed the recent cease-fire would last. Announced in late August ahead of a visit by Pope Francis, it was seen as a temporary concession by both sides to the pontiff who had come to promote an end to the country’s multiple conflicts. Mr. Libreros said the agreement had been violated at least twice; late last year, a massacre by the guerrillas killed more than a dozen people, including an indigenous leader. The ELN, founded in 1964, has seen its presence dwindle in Colombia in recent years amid desertions and government-led attacks. Some analysts estimate that their force is now as small as 1,000 fighters. With the FARC peace deal, however, the ELN became the largest remaining rebel group in Colombia and tried to take on the mantle as leader of Marxist struggle in the country. Its insistence to keep fighting reduces hope that a peace agreement is on the horizon even if talks resume, said Camilo González Posso, the director of the Institute for Development and Peace Studies, a Bogotá-based group. “In the government there are sectors that think it’s a waste because it won’t result in anything,” Mr. González said. “And in the ELN they believe the government won’t follow through and that it’s losing ground with cease-fires.”",The New York Times
2018,A Comfort Food Dish Rich in Friendship,"Eat At least once a week, I arrive home from the office I share with a dozen other writers and, overwhelmed with hunger, immediately begin to cook. I pull out my scratched enamelware pot. I measure in rice, quinoa and water with a generous pinch of salt and set it on the stove to cook. I take a block of medium-firm tofu from its package, pat it dry, slice it into pieces and drizzle it with Bragg’s liquid aminos, soy sauce’s unfermented hippie cousin. Then I rummage through the crisper for leafy greens or broccoli — whatever I can find — and trim away the woody bits. I fry the tofu in coconut oil, boil the vegetables, cut some herbs from the garden box and serve myself dinner in my favorite shallow bowl with a healthy smear of chile paste. The entire process takes about 40 minutes. The meal is just healthful enough to justify a little self-righteousness. And though the curious trio of tofu, Bragg’s and coconut oil eventually transform to bear savory, custardy bites, this dish is about more than just tastes and textures. I grew up thinking of tofu as bland, rubbery filler food, but steeped in aminos, the semisoft tofu melts away with each bite, leaving behind a steamy, satisfying contrail of salt and umami. The coconut oil lends a trace of its sweet, tropical aroma as it yields a crisp, lacy crust. Mixed with quinoa, the rice becomes nutty and complex, a chewy counterpoint to the tender tofu. With only a few steps and five main ingredients, the dish barely requires a recipe, but the relish with which I eat it, the way I look forward to and relax into that steamy bowl, make me feel a way only a handful of dishes have over the course of my life. In the last few years, this funny, nourishing, simple meal has somehow become my preferred comfort food. By definition, comfort foods are rich and creamy, or evocative of childhood pleasures. But this dish contains no butter, cheese or chicken stock, the pillars atop which classic comfort foods are built. Quinoa and tofu don’t stoke a nostalgic flame — or even an ancestral one — for me. But this meal reflects a pair of friendships so nourishing that they’ve enveloped me in the sisterhood I’ve always sought. While I grew up in suburban Southern California in the 1980s, my friends Mara and Twilight Greenaway were scampering up avocado trees and pulling weeds on a little farm atop a mound of cooled lava half an ocean away, in Hawaii. When we all ended up in the Bay Area 20-some years later, I was working in a restaurant with Mara’s best friend while Twilight wrote about food and farming. Our lives were bound to intersect, and they did, around the table. At first, I was the one cooking for them. But several years ago, the restaurant I ran closed, and I shifted away from professional cooking. Just as I lost my steady source of income and health insurance, I injured my knee and fell into a devastating depression. I couldn’t cook for myself, let alone anyone else, so Twilight and Mara began to cook for me. Whenever I could muster the energy, I’d visit one or the other, sit at her table and let her sheathe me in friendship. At first, apologies accompanied every meal. The sisters worried constantly that the simple dishes they served me — sautéed greens, roast chicken, pots of beans — weren’t impressive enough to serve a chef. But the value of eating at a friend’s table is found around it, not on it. I’ll eat anything, even foods I’ve always shunned, when a friend cooks it. And besides, they’re both great cooks. So when one afternoon Twilight asked if I wanted a snack and then made me a pot of mixed grains when I answered yes, I ate it with gusto — even though I’d always held an inexplicable grudge against quinoa. And one evening, sensing that I was slipping into a bleak abyss, Mara invited me to stay for dinner. She was “just making tofu,” but from a stool at the kitchen counter, I watched her let the soft pieces brown and release from the pan before she gingerly flipped each one. Little tricks like this make all the difference in flavor — rush the flip, and you’ll tear the soft tofu and miss out on that golden brown crust. Having long been a champion of practice in the kitchen, I was delighted by her obvious familiarity with that delicate ingredient. When I asked her for the complete recipe, she recited it in two sentences: “Marinate tofu in Bragg’s. Fry it in coconut oil.” “Tofu was definitely a comfort food,” Mara told me with a smile and a shrug. “Our mother would get us baked teriyaki tofu from the health food store as a special treat. Now, whenever I go back to Hawaii, I have to eat several pieces.” After Mara moved to the mainland, she missed that snack and tried baking it for years, but it was always too dry. So the dish migrated out of the oven and onto the stove. “And Twilight taught me to fry in coconut oil. It gets hotter, so the tofu gets crispier.” The constant exchange of care, memory, flavor and experience throughout my friendship with these sisters has been an unwavering source of comfort. So even though my genuine love of tofu and quinoa now surprises no one more than me, it also makes complete sense: When I mimic their cooking, Twilight and Mara are in the kitchen with me. I pull up seats at my table for them. And even when I’m eating by myself, I’m not alone. Recipe: Mara’s Tofu With Mixed Grains cooking",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Congestion Pricing Plan for Manhattan,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Governor Puts Price on Driving Into Snarl of Manhattan: $11.52” (front page, Jan. 19): The congestion pricing proposal is an unfair tax on those who live within the zone, south of 60th Street. I live on West 58th Street and pay an exorbitant rent. This proposal means that someone with a car who offers to drive me home and drop me off at my front door, two blocks into the zone, will have to pay $11.52 extra. At age 86 I appreciate someone driving me home, and it is unfair to make them pay this additional amount, deterring a generous gesture. Not all who live south of 60th Street are multimillionaires, and a charge such as this will contribute to making Manhattan an exclusive residential area for the very rich. PAUL SILVERSTONE, NEW YORK To the Editor: When considering the best way forward for a congestion pricing plan, those formulating the plan should take into account that no matter where the boundary is set for a congestion fee, drivers will seek to shed their cars in order to avoid the fee, and those living in the neighborhoods just outside the boundary will suffer an immediate decrease in already rare parking spaces, a surge in cabs and car services seeking fares, and an immediate additional burden on already choked subway and bus lines leading into midtown. At the least, congestion pricing needs to be accompanied by an increase in public transportation. THOMAS V. CZARNOWSKI, NEW YORK To the Editor: A less expensive, easily implemented and more efficient system to reduce traffic congestion in Manhattan’s business district could be a color coding system, inspired by the Don’t Drive Today program used effectively in Mexico City. All registered automobiles, trucks and motorcycles in New York State and those that need to enter the district from Connecticut and New Jersey would apply for a large color-coded sticker to be displayed on the windshield. If you are “blue,” for example, you cannot enter the district on Monday, “red” on Tuesday and so on. Taxis and disabled drivers would be exempt. Drivers would have to adjust or use public transit for the restricted day. Fines for violators would be steep. BERNARD HABERDOUGLASTON, QUEENS The writer is a retired consulting engineer. To the Editor: It is too bad that no thought is being given to creating “park and ride” lots for people coming from farther afield — New England, upstate New York and other locales. Parking at many train stations is limited to residents, and available parking is prohibitively expensive. Alewife station in Cambridge is a good example of easy, affordable access into Boston’s transit system without needing to drive into the city. With millions of tourists in the city every year, creating a system for those of us who are periodic visitors to better access the subway system or commuter rail could help move the New York area into the 21st century, as well as taking cars off the roads. NANCY BRAUS, PUTNEY, VT. To the Editor: So far I have seen no mention of motorcycles and scooters in discussions about congestion pricing. According to Sam Schwartz’s 2007 traffic study, a 20 percent mode shift from cars to two-wheeled vehicles would, among many other benefits, reduce city traffic delays by 4.6 million hours per year, “or nearly 100 working hours a person.” Excluding scooters and motorcycles from the proposed new tolls would encourage ridership of fuel-efficient, congestion-reducing vehicles. We should be viewed as part of the city’s traffic solution, not part of the problem. CHERYL STEWART, NEW YORK The writer is a founding member of the Sirens Women’s Motorcycle Club of New York City. To the Editor: I agree with your Jan. 23 editorial “Drive Into Manhattan? Pay Up” but would hope that the plan would accommodate the disabled who are unable to use public transportation and so must use services like Uber or taxis to get to the doctor and other appointments. Perhaps a specially designed transponder could be made available to those eligible that would eliminate or reduce the congestion fee. ARTHUR SIEGEL, NEW YORK",The New York Times
2018,A Congressman Suggests ‘Dreamers’ Be Arrested. Capitol Hill Rolls Its Eyes.,"WASHINGTON — Standing outside in the freezing cold, dressed in a new navy blue suit and red tie, Leonardo Reyes was feeling a little overwhelmed Tuesday afternoon as he headed to Capitol Hill for President Trump’s State of the Union address. He was the guest of his home-state senator, Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon. “It feels a little strange,” Mr. Reyes said. “It’s not just the suit. It’s the fact that we are in this space where people have the power to determine the outcome of your life.” Mr. Reyes, 27, is a so-called Dreamer, a young undocumented immigrant shielded from deportation under an Obama-era initiative that Mr. Trump rescinded. Democrats had invited several dozen of them to sit in the gallery overlooking the well of the House on Tuesday night to put a face on the roiling congressional debate over their future. That seemed like a good plan — until Representative Paul Gosar called the cops. Mr. Gosar, Republican of Arizona, who is known as an immigration hard-liner, provoked considerable eye-rolling on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when he wrote on Twitter that he had contacted the Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, “asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.” In a second post, he asked that those using “fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security” be arrested. And in case anyone missed his point, he followed with a third: “Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress,” Mr. Gosar tweeted. “Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.” Mr. Gosar’s fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, took to Twitter in response, “This is why we can’t have nice things.” To that, Mr. Gosar jabbed back, referencing Mr. Flake’s pending retirement at the end of the year, “This is why you got forced out of office.” The powers that be on Capitol Hill did not take appear to take Mr. Gosar as seriously as he took himself. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police did not return an email request for comment, and AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, dismissed Mr. Gosar’s suggestion with six succinct words. “Clearly, the speaker does not agree,” Ms. Strong said. But, this being Washington, Democrats did not miss an opportunity to pounce. “What he said is outside the circle of decency in terms of members of Congress,” Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, told reporters. She added: “We believe that we’re children of God, and we all have a spark of divinity in us, and for him to make that statement is to dishonor the God who made us. It’s just shameful.” Mr. Reyes came to the United States from Mexico when he was 10 with his mother, who was escaping an abusive relationship. She worked in canneries and in the fields, he said; today Mr. Reyes works as a “bilingual eligibility specialist,” helping elderly and disabled people figure out if they qualify for government services like Medicaid and food stamps. In his spare time, he is an immigration advocate. He never expected Congress to roll out the red carpet for him. But he did not expect anyone to suggest that he be arrested either. He has been in the United States legally since 2012, when he applied for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. “I refuse to be intimidated,’’ Mr. Reyes said, adding: “I’m not just here representing myself. I’m here representing my family back at home, representing my friends, individuals I’ve met along this journey whose life is in the balance, who are every day waking up with uncertainty.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Conservative Case for Identity Politics,"On Campus How should professors respond to the trend of identity politics that is now roiling American college campuses? Although I am a conservative professor, I recommend making a concession to it by explicitly assigning writers of different races and social backgrounds. Let me explain. When I was in college, I took a class in logic. There I learned that one should never reject an argument because of the characteristics of the person making it. Instead, one should assess the argument itself on its rational merits. And while I agree that the power of an argument should not depend on the person making it, nonetheless, it does. I learned that lesson during my first year as a visiting professor at Cornell University. I taught a course on American evangelicals, which attracted a mix of secular and religious students. When we discussed “The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,” a 1994 book by Mark A. Noll about anti-intellectualism in the evangelical tradition, my evangelical students were critical of it. But they were willing to take the book’s thesis seriously because the author was an evangelical. Perhaps Mr. Noll’s identity shouldn’t have mattered. His historical evidence and the power of his arguments would be worth considering even if he were Catholic, Jewish or secular. But his identity did matter. It mattered because my evangelical students could not simply assume bad faith on the author’s part. They knew Mr. Noll cared about evangelicals as a group of people. Instead of dismissing Mr. Noll as a bigot, my students thoughtfully engaged with his work. Since then, I have taken identity into account every time I have assigned new books for one of my courses. I currently teach a course called Black Intellectuals, which is focused on debates around racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. It tends to attract progressive students who, in analyzing racial inequality, are drawn to arguments that stress structural obstacles to equality and the enduring power of white racism, especially in our criminal justice system. The course features black authors who do defend that view, but I also teach the work of others who depart from it in some measure, including heterodox thinkers like Thomas Chatterton Williams and conservatives like Jason Riley. Much like my conservative evangelical students at Cornell, my progressive students at Claremont McKenna College are less likely to assume these contrarian black thinkers are acting in bad faith or are motivated by bigotry — even when the thinkers criticize hip-hop culture or defend white police officers. So the students engage the challenging arguments and ideas instead. As conservatives have long observed and psychologists have since confirmed, human beings are hive-minded animals whose moral judgments are shaped more by sentiments than by reason. Thus, when we are confronted by arguments we disagree with, we can easily find reasons to reject them. The search for disconfirming evidence, however, can sometimes be short-circuited, especially when we feel close to the person making an argument we disagree with. As the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt concluded in his 2012 book, “The Righteous Mind,” if we have “affection, admiration, or desire to please” other people, we lean toward them and attempt to “find the truth” in their arguments. Social proximity matters. If we want our students to consider the work of authors they’re inclined to disagree with, we professors must take the identity of those authors into account. This doesn’t mean scrubbing all white men from our syllabuses. But when we design an education for our students, we should remember that humans are partial, tribal beings — not rational automatons. Some readers — especially those on the right — may suspect that embracing identity in this way will only embolden campus radicals. But that objection ignores an important truth: Practicing the new identity politics in the right way can subvert the dogmas that drive its excesses. When students read books by a broad intellectual range of evangelical or female or black authors, for example, they learn that there is no single evangelical or female or black perspective. Disagreements about ideas transcend these social categories. The left has often placed too much faith in the power of human reason. Conservatives make the same error when they insist that the identities of intellectuals should never matter. The fact is, they do. And they would, even absent new movements on campus.",The New York Times

TRUMPOCRACY The Corruption of the American Republic By David Frum 301 pp. HarperCollins. $25.99. Donald Trump is the oddest president America has ever elected. He lived in a gilded tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue but nevertheless became the voice of the left-behind. He made his public reputation as a reality-TV star but nevertheless defeated one of the most experienced politicians in the land. Trump has done so many extraordinary things in his first year in office, from tweeting about nuclear war to conducting public business in sight of paying guests in a resort he owns, it’s easy to forget that, unless impeachment intervenes, he still has another three years — and perhaps seven — to go. Trump’s election has set off a furious competition among America’s pundits to explain what is going on: The most depressing political story of our time is also the most exciting. David Frum has usually been at or near the front of the pundit pack with a succession of articles in The Atlantic, where he is a senior editor. Most commentators are dyed-in-the-wool liberals who exhausted the language of fulmination during George W. Bush’s presidency. Frum worked for Bush and even had a hand in writing his “axis of evil” speech. Most commentators regard conservative America as an alien land inhabited by monsters. Frum has been writing sharp but sympathetic books on that land since his first, “Dead Right,” on the weaknesses of Reaganism, in 1994. The central theme in Frum’s excellent new book, “Trumpocracy,” which draws on his Atlantic articles, is what Trump’s career tells us about the deeper structural problems of America in general, and conservative America in particular. Frum argues that Trump’s greatest talent — his genius really — is spotting and exploiting weaknesses. The Republican establishment spent $100 million to put the crown on Prince Jeb Bush’s head. Trump incinerated Bush (and all that cash) with his gibe about “low energy.” He then proceeded to incinerate “little” Marco Rubio and “lyin’” Ted Cruz. Trump’s campaign against Hillary Clinton was in some ways a model of how not to run campaigns — he lurched from crisis to crisis and never bothered to enumerate any detailed policies. But he understood her great limitation: that she represented the nexus between meritocracy and plutocracy, indebted to Big Money and divorced from millions of heartland Americans. Trump’s political operatics worked because he understood deeper weaknesses in American society. The white working class is suffering from two great hammer blows. The first is to its economic well-being: A group that thrived during the golden years of the 1950s and 1960s has seen its incomes stagnate and its job security disappear. Great swaths of white America now suffer from maladies that are all too familiar to black America: broken homes, drug addiction, listlessness, early death. The second hammer blow is to its psychological well-being: Even as their economic position has declined, members of the white working class — particularly white working-class men — have seen themselves denounced, often by people who spend more on college education in one year than they earn shoveling dirt, as agents of privilege and oppression. What better way to respond to being defined as a problem than to vote for a man who promises to punch back? Trump grasped that America is suffering from an epistemological weakness as well as economic ones: The line between truth and falsehood is becoming dangerously blurred. Again, America’s knowledge elite is partly responsible for this: Armies of postmodern academics had prepared the way for Trump by arguing that truth is a construct of the power elite. But the biggest culprit is technological progress. Digitalization is not only creating a deafening cacophony of voices. It is also making it harder to finance real journalism while simultaneously making it easier to distribute tripe. A Manhattan-based playboy who has had life handed to him on a silver platter might look like a strange vehicle for the pain of the American heartland. But Trump is a winner with the soul of a loser: He is consumed by imagined slights to his fragile ego, hypersensitive to the pretensions of smarty-pants liberals, a man who spends many hours a day watching cable news and seething with anger. He is also an anti-intellectual with the soul of a postmodernist: He believes that reality is something that can be bent into any shape you choose provided that you have enough power. What does Trump want to do with all his power? The answer, Frum argues, certainly does not lie in helping the white working class that put him in the White House. His tax cuts will widen America’s already high levels of inequality. It lies instead in “the aggrandizement of one domineering man and his shamelessly grasping extended family.” The essence of Trumponomics is running a country just as you run your family business: appointing people with whom you have strong personal ties, ideally ties of DNA, directing business to your properties, using public resources to avenge private grudges. Trump’s appointments to the White House staff included his former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and a former contestant on “The Apprentice.” Perhaps the most telling moment in his first year was when he asked his daughter Ivanka to sit in his seat at a G-7 meeting, thereby reducing a great republic to the level of a family property. Frum thinks the combination of Trump’s drive for self-aggrandizement and America’s current weaknesses is nothing less than a threat to the democratic order. “The thing to fear from the Trump presidency is not the bold overthrow of the Constitution, but the stealthy paralysis of governance; not the open defiance of law, but an accumulating subversion of norms; not the deployment of state power to intimidate dissidents, but the incitement of private violence to radicalize supporters.” Any supposed solutions to Trump’s behavior, however, may be worse than the disease: American liberals have found themselves investing extraordinary hopes in the generals who now surround the president. Trump isn’t alone in the weakness-exploitation business. Some of the most eye-catching investors in his real estate empire since he won the Republican nomination hail from countries where there is a faint line between business and politics. And some of Trump’s biggest ideological backers have an almost apocalyptic sense that America needs to be purged in order to be saved. Hanging over everything is the figure of Vladimir Putin, a man who has devoted his career to accumulating information on weaknesses, both personal and political, and turning that information into power. Rather than Russia turning into America, as America’s policymakers argued in that great age of illusion, the 1990s, America seems to be turning into Russia. The immediate task facing the American republic is to limit the damage that Trump can cause: Here the checks and balances are already playing the role that the founders intended. But the bigger task is to eliminate the weaknesses that have produced Trumpism. Frum rightly points out that these are broad as well as deep. The travails of the white working class are symptoms of a bigger problem: the concentration of wealth in a narrow range of industries and companies. Likewise, the corruption embodied in Trump Inc. is the product of a broader corruption of America’s governing class, which has allowed Bill and Hillary Clinton to transform themselves into public-service millionaires and Barack and Michelle Obama to negotiate a reported $65 million book deal for their autobiographies. Getting tough on Trump is going to be a picnic compared with getting tough on the causes of Trumpism. OpinionRoss Douthat and David Frum",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | A Counter-Conspiracy, Debunked","David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It can get exhausting to keep track of all of the counter-conspiracy theories that keep coming from President Trump’s allies (many of them in the employ of Rupert Murdoch). But some of those theories get enough traction that they are worth debunking. To that end, the release of the transcript of Glenn Simpson’s Senate testimony yesterday is important. Republicans initially opposed the release, but Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, ultimately made it happen. The key part of Simpson’s testimony, as The Plum Line’s Greg Sargent notes: The F.B.I. was already investigating the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia when it received additional information from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer working with Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS. (Various Fox News commentators and others have tried to spin a tale in which the Clinton campaign effectively started the F.B.I. investigation, via Steele and Fusion.) We still don’t know how much of the information in Steele’s infamous Trump dossier is accurate. Either way, Steele and Fusion are only supporting players in this story. The main questions are about Trump’s campaign and Russia — not the people trying to figure out what was happening between the campaign and Russia. Related: In The Times, Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, defends its decision to publish the Steele dossier one year ago today. Perspective. The story of Russian collusion is devilishly complicated. Susan Hennessey — a legal expert whose work I’ve often cited in this newsletter — offered an especially clear summary in a recent podcast with Vox’s Ezra Klein. She described two scenarios — one more innocent, one less so. Here are the basics: The innocent explanation: Amateurish Trump officials unwittingly blundered into a campaign by Russia to influence American policy and create chaos. The Trump officials cooperated with Russian nationals because they didn’t know they shouldn’t. They then lied about their contacts because those contacts were embarrassing, not because they were part of a sophisticated conspiracy. As Hennessey puts it, “the cover up is worse than the crime.” The less-innocent explanation: Top Trump officials understood that they were doing something wrong. Perhaps they were trying to help their campaign with tactics they understood were wrong. Or perhaps they were working to advance the interests of a foreign power, because of financial entanglements between those officials — maybe including Trump — and Russia. These officials, and others who were aware of the entanglements, then lied about the contacts. In that case, Hennessey explains, “the decision making at the top of the executive branch is not in any meaningful way being guided by the best interests of the American people.” Last year, I walked through five possible motivations for the Trump team’s strange friendliness with Russia, including some of the possibilities mentioned here.

2018,Opinion | A Counterproductive Approach to a Broken Immigration System,"Op-Ed Contributors The decision by the Department of Homeland Security not to renew Temporary Protected Status, for almost 200,000 migrants from El Salvador is President Trump’s latest attempt to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. This comes on the heels of the same rulings last year regarding Haitians and Nicaraguans. Salvadorans, however, are by far the largest group of T.P.S. recipients — approximately two-thirds of the remaining beneficiaries. Just like the decision to end the DACA program for nearly 800,000 undocumented childhood arrivals, the T.P.S. announcement is politically motivated and is probably an attempt to satisfy President Trump’s anti-immigrant base. Although the choice to end a supposedly temporary program that has nonetheless lasted for 17 years may sound rational, the real-world consequences of such a wide-reaching move will be immediate and severe — and may even contribute to a new cycle of illegal immigration. Many, if not most, are unlikely to voluntarily return to a country that they no longer call home and instead may seek to stay illegally. The widespread fear instilled by this ruling, and the possible deportations to come, will tear apart families and communities. In effect, as of September 2019 there will be a group of newly unauthorized migrants living in the United States equivalent to the population of Salt Lake City. After almost two decades in the United States, Salvadoran T.P.S. recipients have built lives, communities and businesses. In many cities — above all Washington and Los Angeles — they are an important part of the economic and social fabric. They are parents to approximately 192,700 United States-born citizens. Ironically, if T.P.S. recipients are deported, a primary beneficiary will be one of President Trump’s most-stated enemies: the MS-13 gang, which he has accused of turning United States communities “into bloodstained killing fields.” The criminal organization, which is active in both the United States and El Salvador, traces its roots to instability after a wave of deportations from the United States in the 1990s, which El Salvador was ill equipped to receive. It didn’t take long for the resulting instability to bounce back to the United States in the form of increased criminal activity and illegal immigration. A similar pattern could repeat itself, as conditions are only marginally better today. The Salvadoran government is already strained in its battle against corruption, crime and violence — including one of the world’s highest homicide rates. MS-13 is almost certain to take advantage of the impending disruption as deportees arrive in El Salvador. Worse, young American citizens of Salvadoran origin will be left behind if their parents are expelled, making them more vulnerable to recruitment by criminal groups. This decision also has distinctly negative implications for El Salvador’s already sclerotic economy. According to the Inter-American Dialogue’s research, remittances account for 17 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and a staggering 80 percent of economic growth. Last year, T.P.S. recipients alone sent over $500 million back to El Salvador. While the Trump administration may be tempted to see this as a benefit — preventing money from leaving the country — a sharp reduction in remittances would cripple longer-term United States efforts to build security and prosperity in El Salvador, investing more than $4.4 billion over the past 50 years. An economic downturn will only encourage a new exodus, fueling the cycle of instability and illegal immigration. To be sure, as President Trump has noted, responsibility for the problems with the current situation lies with the T.P.S. program itself. The administration is correct that the designation was intended to be temporary relief after a pair of earthquakes in 2001. In practice, however, past presidents routinely extended the program in part because of longstanding political, economic and security conditions in the country — which would only be made worse by ending the protection. Extending T.P.S. was a way to kick the can down the road and avoid facing real policy choices. Consequently, program recipients became more integrated into United States society every year, progressively raising the human costs of termination. Already there has been pushback on the decision from Democratic-leaning cities, states, members of Congress and other critics hoping for a legislative solution — which is highly unlikely. Even so, in the future Congress should aim to blunt the negative effects of this decision and create a new, more permanent designation for certain migrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Temporary protection is an essential tool to respond to short-term crises and disasters, but in this case — as in Haiti and Honduras — T.P.S. has not been sufficiently adaptive toward longer-term state weakness. The Trump administration’s decision to pull the plug only creates more uncertainty and chaos. In doing so, the president has further eroded the United States’ standing in Latin America and sowed bad will in significant communities that have contributed so much to this country and clearly embrace its values.",The New York Times
2018,A Craftsman’s Passion: American Jeans,"Neighborhood Joint Flipping through piles of denim in a 550-square-foot, sun-drenched loft crammed with sewing tables, boxes of copper rivets and spools of thread hanging next to paintings and denim samples, Takayuki Echigoya looked up when the doorbell rang. He went to the terrace and yelled, “Please ring again!” Mr. Echigoya buzzed in Kyle Mosholder, the owner of d’emploi, a Bushwick accessories brand. He had come to get fitted for a pair of jeans. “I got a little extra money for the holidays, so I figured it was time,” said Mr. Mosholder, who said that he had wanted a pair of Bowery Blue Makers (Mr. Echigoya’s label) for a while. Mr. Echigoya was busy. The night before, a Tokyo buyer ordered 60 pairs. Normally it takes Mr. Echigoya, 52, eight hours to make a single pair of his handmade, vintage-style jeans in his home-factory-showroom in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. To mimic antique jeans, he has collected 11 black Singer sewing machines manufactured in New York between 1905 and 1945, each featuring a steel needle needed for his signature stitches. Another machine once used by Levi Strauss & Co. is used for hems; another for buttonholes, Mr. Echigoya said. Mr. Echigoya grew up in coastal Wakkanai, on the northern tip of Japan. In 1996, he moved to the Bowery area in New York to start a fashion line. He ultimately took that line to Japan where, in 2013, he learned, by plying Chinese factory workers with sweets, how to sew denim. In 2014, he returned to New York and two years later, he started Bowery Blue Makers. His native country still plays a part in the jeans-making process: Mr. Echigoya sends American cotton to Japan to be dyed; then it is returned to him to sew. Usually, Mr. Echigoya produces about 25 pairs a month, which sell for $480 and $580 each from his website, boweryblue.com, and for as much as $650 at shops in Brooklyn, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bangkok. “You said straight leg, right?” Mr. Echigoya asked Mr. Mosholder, handing him two pairs and leading him to a makeshift dressing room in a hallway. He pulled shut a gray curtain. “They’re really perfect,” said Mr. Mosholder, who came out wearing the jeans. “There’s so much twist,” he said, pointing to fabric near the cuff. The doorbell rang again. Pat Prasong Kanhasura, 45, entered with Bobby Narin Mungkay, 37. Mr. Kanhasura sported a pair of Bowery Blues that he said he wore “almost every day.” Mr. Kanhasura owns Bangklyn East Harlem, on Second Avenue between 105th and 106th Streets, a clothing store that sells Bowery Blue jeans and serves what he calls “Southeast Asian soul food.” The two came to talk business with Mr. Echigoya, who is looking for a Manhattan showroom for his line. “I think he is the best denim maker,” Mr. Kanhasura said. “If you look, the fabric isn’t straight, because of the machines he uses. It has more charm than the ones made with a computer.” “I cannot use new machines,” Mr. Echigoya said. “Cannot. The old machine makes denim more by hand, more uneven.” Mr. Mungkay leaned against a beam and pulled out his phone. He flipped through photos of himself in a dark mine shaft. Mr. Mungkay works for Mr. Kanhasura, but he started talking about his recent side gig with Brit Eaton, a vintage-denim hunter who is known in the trade as Indiana Jeans. Mr. Eaton traverses the American West looking for “Gold Rush” denim: actual jeans from the 1840s and 1850s. Mr. Mungkay would say only that the most recent expedition was in Colorado. “It’s kind of secret,” he explained. Mr. Echigoya aims to duplicate classic American jeans by using only American cotton, along with his own “unique cotton thread.” “Jeans are like humans,” Mr. Echigoya said. “They need their own character.”",The New York Times
2018,A Cuban Island That Has Played Both Paradise and Prison,"The Isle of Youth — which has been both a Communist Utopian getaway and home to a brutal prison that housed Castro for a time — is a world apart, even by Cuban standards. Sunrise on the shores of La Isla de la Juventud, or the Isle of Youth.CreditCreditFederico Rios Escobar for The New York Times There’s nothing like a total absence of safety measures to add a little excitement to a historical site. Within an hour of landing on La Isla de la Juventud, the Isle of Youth, I was clambering through an underground tunnel in the Presidio Modelo, or Model Prison, Cuba’s most dreaded pre-revolutionary prison, using my iPhone as a torch and trying not to slip on wooden planks and rubble. After squeezing up a rusty spiral staircase, I emerged atop a tower at the center of an enormous circular cell building that resembled a tropical Colosseum, where a single guard would once monitor more than 1,000 prisoners at a time. The scale was bewildering — it was one of four 1931 jail structures in the Model Prison, rising like sinister missile silos, with a mess hall at their center. Just as bewildering: the fact that nobody would stop me climbing five stories without handrails into cells with a 50-foot drop onto concrete. (One can only marvel at Cuban liability laws, or the lack thereof.) The whiff of danger helped bring the disturbing past of the Presidio, which functioned from the late 1920s to 1967, to vivid life. A small museum was filled with startling photos of the prison’s brutal inner life, when it was run by wild convict gangs with weapons crafted from iron spikes and nails. But the most striking sight of all came when I entered the former hospital ward, which in the 1950s was reserved for political prisoners. Posted on a wall was a mug shot of its most notorious inmate, Fidel Castro — without a beard. Like the few other visitors to the Presidio that day, I had to stop and stare at the clean-shaven, well-fed features of Prisoner 3859, who, instead of his famous Old Testament whiskers, sported a scraggly pencil mustache. It was a sudden step back into a barely remembered Cuba, when Fidel was not yet “Fidel.” Today, the image of the hirsute Castro in military khakis is so ingrained in the popular imagination that he seems to have sprung ready-made onto the world stage when the revolution succeeded in 1959. But almost nobody had heard of him six years earlier, in 1953, when, as a 27-year-old lawyer, he began his rebellious career with an attack on a military barracks in the city of Santiago. Castro had hoped this would spark an uprising around Cuba, but it failed dismally. Many of his 160 or so followers were tortured and executed and most of the rest hunted down. He was given a 15-year sentence and sent with 25 compañeros to La Isla. It was in this prison, improbably enough, that the Cuban revolution was effectively planned. The dictator Fulgencio Batista made the mistake of placing all the conspirators together in the hospital wing, and they proceeded to treat it as a revolutionary boot camp, congregating for daily lessons on politics and conducting secret communications with supporters around Cuba. “What a fantastic school this prison is!” Castro wrote gleefully in a letter. “From here I’m able to finish forging my vision of the world …"" After four months, he was removed to solitary, but even there he kept in touch with his men using messages written in lemon juice that were smuggled in cigars or mashed potatoes. He also secretly wrote a tract called “La Historia Me Absolverá” (“History Will Absolve Me”), a recreation of his trial defense speech that was spirited page by page to Havana and published as a rousing call to arms. By the time popular opinion led to the men’s release in 1955, after serving less than two years of their sentences, the once-disorganized rebel group had become a coherent political cell, with a support network and a clear plan for a guerrilla war. The Presidio was closed a few years after Castro’s victory in 1959, and is now maintained as a shrine to the revolution’s early struggle, with photos of each prisoner over his bed. It’s a tribute to the resilience of the young rebels who — whatever their later faults once they took power — took on the brutal Batista dictatorship at great personal risk. The aura of idealism becomes particularly poignant today, as Cuba’s revolutionary dream has become as battered as the corrugated iron ceiling of the Presidio itself — its gaping views of the sky letting in the beating sun, the tropical rain and chirping green parrots. As I discovered over the next three days, almost every corner of Isle of Youth — or simply La Isla, as it is referred to by residents — hides an equally eccentric saga. Located off the south coast of the main island, the largest of the nation’s 4,000-odd offshore cays and islands, it has been specializing in oddity ever since Christopher Columbus weighed anchor here to find provisions on his second voyage in 1494 and was mystified by its monstrous crocodiles and raucous bird life. Soon after, pirates hid in its coves, making it an inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Treasure Island.” The stories become even more outlandish in the 20th century. Following the Spanish-American War, the Isle of Pines (as it was then known) became an American territory in the early 1900s, and settlers with names like Chuck and Martha dug citrus orchards in townships called McKinley, Columbia and San Francisco Heights. It was on its return to Cuba in 1924 that the island entered its Devil’s Island phase, with the Model Prison built as a rare example of the notorious Panopticon — in which myriad inmates could be watched by a single guard — conceived by the 18th-century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Then, at the height of the revolution in 1978, Castro returned to the island as Maximum Leader and declared that it would become a unique Communist education center, where high school students from Third World countries could study in a sun-kissed paradise. Today, La Isla is embarking on yet another reinvention — as an ecotourism destination. A few entrepreneurs are making modest attempts to lure foreign travelers and their hard currency to its pristine beaches and offshore coral reefs, which are among the best preserved in the Caribbean. “What’s important to marine life is scale, and Cuba is so big,” said David E. Guggenheim, an American marine biologist who founded a nonprofit called Ocean Doctor, who I first met in Havana during a conference on marine protection. “Size matters! Reefs need large integrated ecosystems to survive.” Cuba is unique in the Western Hemisphere for its near-total lack of coastal development, he explained. Since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, Cuban farmers have had no access to pesticides or fertilizers, so there is none of the chemical flow-off that can devastate marine life. “Farmers on the Isle of Youth have been forced to practice organic agriculture,” Mr. Guggenheim said. “Most of them don’t even have tractors. It’s amazing that such a thing is possible in the 21st century.” Still, it’s an uphill battle to attract travelers, since La Isla is today so obscure that even most Cubans know nothing about it. I had only the haziest idea of what I might find there when I turned up at the Havana airport before dawn to catch a propeller plane. A half-hour later, we were banking over the comma-shaped island and landing at its only town, Nueva Gerona. I was relieved to find that La Isla had lost none of its oddity: We were met at the tiny airport by a nurse in white uniform who screened us all for fevers. While it’s no longer true to say that Havana is “stuck in the 1950s,” an argument can be made for La Isla — perhaps the 1850s. There are no streetlights in Nueva Gerona, no buildings taller than two stories, and almost the only traffic is horse-and-buggy. On its sleepy pedestrian boulevard, the main cultural attraction is a map of Cuba made from rusty horseshoes. At dusk, teenagers make out in the Park of the Heroic Guerrilla, while older couples promenade arm in arm and take romantic carriage rides holding hands. After dark, everyone converges on the boulevard to hear live salsa and dance, the only concession to the 21st century being a decent sound system. I checked into a casa particular, a private guesthouse, a cozy home decorated with ceramic fish and boasting a sunny billiards room. It was run by a voluble woman named Diami, who whipped up fortifying breakfasts of sweet black coffee, farm eggs and chunks of mango, the most succulent of the tropical fruits that grow like weeds on the fertile island. (“We call these American mangoes because they are plump and red,” she deadpanned.) The islanders spoke with cheery resignation about being forgotten by the world. “We suffer from double insularity,” a wiry, chain-smoking poet named Tony Ramírez said excitedly, when I met him at one of the few restaurants, El Galeón (which, as its name suggests, was shaped like a galleon). “We feel very far from the rest of Cuba, which is already cut off from the world.” Tony drew inspiration for his writing from being in un mundo aparte, a world apart, he said, but worried about the island’s vulnerability: “Communications are a problem. One puff of wind, let alone a cyclone, and we’re on our own.” Clearly, nobody comes to La Isla for the night life: By 9 p.m., Gerona was a ghost town. The next morning, I was ready to sally forth into the countryside, but there were only two jeeps for hire, I learned, and both were broken. Luckily, I found a taxi driver named Ray drowsing by the plaza in his battered blue Lada. Soon we were chugging along empty, palm-fringed roads past limestone protrusions called mogotes — the same sensuous rock formations that has turned the Cuban province of Pinar del Río into a busy tourist destination, but here stand solitary and unseen. Marble is quarried from their flanks in such great quantities that many peasant huts have the polished stone for their floors. On this island of broken dreams, the ruins of the revolutionary schools of the 1980s litter the landscape like giant Lego blocks. Castro traveled here to personally inaugurate the idealistic education program in 1978 and change the name of the Isle of Pines to Isle of Youth — which has a Communist Utopian ring but also evokes the mad quest of Ponce de León for the Fountain of Youth. (Confusingly, islanders are still called Pineros in Cuba.) Within a decade there were 61 schools on the island serving 35,000 students, mostly from Africa. After the Soviet Union crumbled, funding was cut and the students vanished as if they had never been here. A 2008 hurricane did the rest by gutting the schools. Although most of the Soviet-style structures are in poetic decay, three still function for locals. We called in at Escuela No. 8, the Clara Zetkin School, named after a German Marxist theorist and now filled with island children. The walls are still decorated with a Cold War mural, the Cuban version of “if you see something, say something”: A giant eye hovers over a map of the island with an illustrated list of dangers that pupils should report, including “enemy aircraft,” “enemy parachutists” and “dead animals.” But the most unexpected historical site is a peaceful field only a few miles from town. El Cementerio Americano, the American Cemetery, is the last ghostly reminder of the quarter century when the United States ran La Isla as a virtual colony. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, Cuba was put under United States military rule until 1902; in the treaties that followed, ownership of the Isle of Youth was left so vague that American companies bought up most of the arable land and opened it to settlers. To the fury of Cuban patriots, farmers from Iowa and California moved here assuming it would become an official part of the United States. (One pamphlet pushing for full annexation was called: “The Isle of Pines: American or What?”) Tourists traveled from New York to loll by its mineral pools; the poet Hart Crane stayed one summer and was fascinated to experience a hurricane, which inspired the poem “Eternity.” When Congress reluctantly gave La Isla back to Cuba in 1924, most settlers left in disappointment, but those who stayed are buried in the American Cemetery. I strolled with the bemused taxista Ray through the lonely field in golden light, reading names from overgrown gravestones — one shaped like a tree trunk — and pausing at a gazebo until the mosquitoes drove us out. It was time to head to the island’s wild south, a jigsaw of protected landscapes informally called the Siguanea Nature Reserve where caves are filled with pre-Colombian carvings, sea turtles lounge by the beaches and reptiles bask in the swamps. My plan was to visit the evocatively named village of Cocodrilo (crocodile) with Dr. Guggenheim, who since 2015 has worked with a local group there called Red Alerta to protect its pristine coral reefs. It is a singular Cuban-American joint venture. His Washington-based N.G.O., Ocean Doctor, provides equipment and trains villagers to work as guides instead of fishing illegally — a standard ecotourism model in other parts of the world, but a radical departure in Cuba, where the economy is still mostly state-run and grass-roots activism is discouraged. “As fearful as we are of thousands of Americans going down to Cuba and recreating the mass tourism model that destroyed much of the Caribbean,” he told me in Nueva Gerona, “tourism has to be part of the solution.” (Because it is research-based, the Red Alerta program has been unaffected by recent changes to travel for American citizens, but visits have to be arranged through an authorized travel agency or Ocean Doctor.) But La Isla has not shaken off its Cold War past. The Cuban military monitors the various southern nature reserves, and we soon discovered that the whole area had been declared off-limits — no explanation given. The word on the street in Nueva Gerona was that the military was conducting antidrug sweeps along the coast. True or not, there would be no Cocodrilo for us. Time for Plan B. We decided to head to El Colony, the island’s only real hotel, which had the misfortune to open the week before the revolution in 1959, and somehow managed to survive the following decades on the dribble of tourism to Cuba, mostly from the Eastern bloc. At the small marina there, we hired a boat to take us to the reserve’s limits. Soon we were motoring south with a dive master and a cook. Our first mission was to snorkel off a popular beach called Punto Francés, where two years ago Dr. Guggenheim had seen intact expanses of elkhorn coral, a barometer of reef health. Even an amateur like me could tell that all was not well below the waves. “That is a wonderful example of a reef that is 90 percent dead,” Dr. Guggenheim said with a sigh, as we dried off back on board. There had been some bleaching from climate change, he explained, but the main culprit was overfishing, which led to the coral being slowly covered in slimy green algae. “We treat fish like crops to be harvested,” he said, “but they have important jobs to do in the ecosystem. One of them is grazing on algae, which keeps reefs clean.” Things improved radically when we dove to a remote site named El Reino de la Sahara, the King of the Sahara. Rays of sunlight burst down on reefs that were surging with life like underwater cities, including brilliantly colored sea fans and flamingo tongues. A moray eel patrolled the shallows and there were expanses of thriving elkhorn coral. “That reef was 90 percent healthy, or better,” Dr. Guggenheim rejoiced. “But Cuba is in the balance. It could go either way. The good thing is that it has the legal protection,” he added, noting that 25 percent of Cuba’s waters are protected — a higher percentage than the United States, he said (Castro promoted marine protection after he met Jacques Cousteau in the 1980s and became an avid scuba diver). “But it doesn’t have enforcement.” As we motored back to El Colony, Dr. Guggenheim stared out at the sea meditatively. Even in this pristine location, we can only imagine what the Caribbean must have been like when the first Europeans saw it, he mused. “Only three percent of sea turtles are left today. But when Columbus arrived on his fourth expedition, his son wrote that they saw turtles in such vast numbers that they covered the sea.’ Man, I would like to have seen that.” All over La Isla, conversation always returned to Castro, the larger-than-life figure who had been its most notorious (if unwilling) resident, and whose grand plans in the 1970s created its golden age as a tropical youth camp. In one private restaurant, La Casa de Toti, the eponymous owner, known only as Toti, told me how his grandfather was sent to the Model Prison for murder and met Castro there in the 1950s. Along with many other inmates, he was freed a few months after the guerrillas rode into Havana in early 1959. “So my grandfather was always a big fan of Socialism,” he said with a wry laugh. The air of melancholy left by so many vanished dreams was present even when I decided to climb a remote mountain known as La Loma on my final morning, to get a glimpse of the island’s hard-to-visit south. To get there, I went to meet a farmer-turned-guide Arcadio Castro (no relation), who wore a tattered T-shirt and lived in a marble-floor shack roamed by livestock and piled high with home-bottled mango pulp. A summer heat wave was descending: By 9 a.m., it was already 95 degrees and 100 percent humidity when Arcadio started hacking the overgrown trail with his rusted machete. Yellow butterflies flitted around us as he fondly remembered the day Fidel Castro visited his high school in 1978. The children were all astonished to see the Maximum Leader bounce a basketball up the stairs to their playground and sink it without effort. (He had been a sports champ in his youth.) In the heyday of the revolution in the 1980s, Arcadio had also served in the Cuban army in Angola and he reminisced about the monstrous bugs he found in Africa. As we climbed, there were glimpses between the palms trees of empty green plains leading to distant mogotes. By the time we reached the summit, sweat was pouring from us in streams and I was half delirious. The view to the southern nature reserves turned out to be entirely overgrown; Arcadio admitted that he hadn’t taken anyone up here in months. I didn’t mind. It was oddly comforting to see these remote heights being reclaimed by the wild. The island’s man-made hopes have been repeatedly dashed, but hopefully nature will prove resilient. Getting There There are twice daily flights to the Isle of Youth from Havana on Cubana (cubana.cu), the national airline, but they can book up way in advance. Allow a night in Havana before and after the flight in case of cancellations. New travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration mean that American citizens traveling as tourists should go through an authorized travel agent to ensure compliance (although travel does not need to be in a group, and 12 other categories of travel, such as educational or professional research, are unaffected). Flights and tours can be booked through an international agency such as Cuba Travel Network (cubatravelnetwork.com) or the United States-based Cuba Educational Travel (cubaeducationaltravel.com). On the ground, the best island agency is Ecotur (53-46-32710; reservas.ij@occ.ecotur.tur.cu). Ocean Doctor is expecting to offer educational tours to the wild southern coast in spring (oceandoctor.org/cuba-travel-program/#upcoming; around $5,000 for seven- to 10-day trips.) Where to Stay l Colony (rates start at $63 for a single person with half board, hotelelcolony.com/en/) is a good base for divers but quite removed from other attractions — and being state-run, has wretched food. Far more satisfying is to stay in one of the casas particulares, private guesthouses, in the town of Nueva Gerona and make day trips. I stayed in the quaint and comfortable Villa Gerona, run by the feisty Diami, (53-4631-2962, villagerona.com; rooms starting at $23). Others can be found on Cuba Junky (cuba-junky.com). Where to Eat The best restaurants on the island are the Buena Vista (Calle 39 #2416A, 53-5503-2666), which has a patio overlooking the Boulevard, and the private paladar Casa de Toti (Calle 3ra #401 near the Presidio Modelo, 53-5277-5565). Tony Perrottet, the author of “Pagan Holiday,” is working on a book about the Cuban guerrilla war. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an international travel agency. It is Cuba Educational Travel, not Cuban Educational Travel. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a British philosopher. He is Jeremy Bentham, not Benthem. An earlier version of this article misstated Fidel Castro's prisoner number at Presidio Modelo. It was 3859, not 3895.",The New York Times
2018,A D-Day Plane Lost for Years Is About to Fly Again,"It took two eagle-eyed historians to track down the plane that led hundreds of Allied aircraft into Normandy during World War II. A few years ago, the historical treasure was languishing in an aircraft bone yard in Wisconsin. The plane, a twin-engine C-47 called “That’s All, Brother,” carried American paratroopers into German-occupied France on June 6, 1944, or D-Day. It led the main formation that dropped thousands of men into what became a bloody but decisive battle, paving the way for the liberation of northern France from the Nazis. [UPDATE: A D-Day Plane Is Flying Again; With Photos] Like many other World War II planes, “That’s All, Brother” was sold for private use after the fighting ended. It cycled through a series of owners and its historical significance was in danger of being forgotten. But in 2007, the two historians started following a paper trail. At the Air Force Historical Research Agency in Montgomery, Ala., Matt Scales, then a member of the Air National Guard, was researching John M. Donalson, who piloted the plane on the day it soared over the beaches of Normandy. Mr. Scales and another historian in the Air Force Reserve, Ken Tilley, found its tail number and used it to trace the C-47’s postwar path and see whether it had been dismantled. They were relieved to find that it had not. “It’s so rare to have a plane that was actually there and did what it did,” Mr. Scales said in a phone interview. “This airplane has been a fighter its entire life.” The historians discovered that it had ended up in Mesa, Ariz., with a new camouflage-inspired paint job. (The pattern called to mind C-47s that had flown in the Vietnam War, but during World War II, “That’s All, Brother” had stripes.) “We were amazed to find it in Arizona and that it was for sale,” Mr. Tilley said. “We immediately contacted every museum and major aircraft organization to try to save the plane, to no avail at the time.” But a couple of years later, Mr. Scales looked for the plane again and found it had been sold to a company in Oshkosh, Wis., where it was in danger of being taken apart. During World War II, C-47s, a military version of the civilian DC-3, transported cargo and troops. “It’s a rugged airplane, and a joy to fly once you’re in the air,” said Albert J. Parisi, an aviation writer and historian who has flown a C-47. The planes were indispensable on D-Day, he added, even though many were shot down. “They started encountering antiaircraft fire, and these aircraft are not armor-plated,” Mr. Parisi said. “There’s no protection. Think of a Coca-Cola can with wings.” Normandy was overcast on D-Day — terrible weather for the operation — but “That’s All, Brother” emerged largely unscathed. The name of the plane, inspired by a song performed by Mae West, was intended as a message for Hitler. It carried a chaplain (he was unarmed but determined to increase church attendance by parachuting into war with everyone else) and a dog (a Scottish terrier puppy that stayed on the plane and was, by all appearances, also unarmed). Both survived, and the plane made more runs over the course of the invasion before returning to the United States. After Mr. Scales discovered that the plane had made its way to Wisconsin, he contacted the new owner, Basler Turbo Conversions, to share what he knew about its history. Basler told the story to a blogger for Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, who wrote posts about it in 2013 and 2014. Those posts, in turn, were spotted by members of the Commemorative Air Force, an organization based in Dallas that collects and restores historical aircraft for flight. Experts there, including Keegan Chetwynd, the curator, were skeptical of the story. But one day he found a National Archives video showing “That’s All, Brother” about to take off for Normandy in 1944. Two minutes and 23 seconds in, he saw it: A tail number was visible in the black-and-white clip, and it matched the one on the plane in Oshkosh. “At that point, my jaw kind of hit the floor,” Mr. Chetwynd said. “I went darting down the hallway looking for the others to tell them we needed to go get the airplane.” Mr. Chetwynd was worried. For all he knew, this treasure might have already been dismantled for conversion into a more modern turboprop airplane — that, after all, is what Basler does. He made some calls and was happy to learn “That’s All, Brother” was intact and in need of a buyer. In 2015, Commemorative Air Force raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Kickstarter campaign to buy the aircraft and begin a restoration that would retain as much of its original structure as possible. Basler’s specialists are doing the restoration because they have dismantled plenty of old C-47s and technicians had many of the parts they needed. The plane had a successful engine test in December, and Commemorative Air Force hopes to see “That’s All, Brother” take flight in the coming days. Ultimately, Mr. Chetwynd said, the goal is to fly the plane over Normandy in 2019 to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Mr. Scales said that after years of keeping tabs on the old C-47, he was glad to see its historical value realized. “It’s so cool for me that this will be another way for the story to continue to be told,” he said. “It’ll hopefully continue the legacy of these guys and the sacrifice they made.”",The New York Times
2018,A DACA Question: Should Judges Use Local Cases to Halt National Orders?,"WASHINGTON — When a federal judge in California ordered a stop last week to a key plank of President Trump’s immigration agenda, he revived a debate that has simmered in this age of partisanship: the role of the impartial judiciary in American democracy. The judge, William Alsup of the Northern District of California in San Francisco, used a local case to impose a nationwide stop on Mr. Trump’s order to end a program that protects young undocumented immigrants in the United States. The tactic has gained popularity among federal judges as a tool to combat perceived executive overreach. But legal scholars say it is helping to erode the idea of an impartial judiciary, and Judge Alsup’s decision opened him to critiques that he overstepped his boundaries by applying national orders in a regional case. The possibility of obtaining a comprehensive injunction that impedes, or even thwarts, the opposition has legal scholars worried that more plaintiffs’ lawyers will take cases to sympathetic judges. The injunctions let judges who might have strong views impose them broadly, bypassing established tools like class-action lawsuits, said Samuel Bray, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who published an article last month advocating that federal judges no longer use nationwide injunctions. “How can a single judge decide a question for the whole country?” Mr. Bray said. The use of local cases to issue national orders occurred only a few times until President Barack Obama’s second term, when Republican state attorneys general turned to that strategy about half a dozen times to stop some of his major initiatives, Mr. Bray said. The tactic has grown more popular as voters become more polarized and Congress is historically unproductive. “If the legislature were solving problems and creating legislation, and if we didn’t have as much executive overreach, then these big national issues wouldn’t be going to the courts as much,” said Wendy R. Weiser, a director at the Brennan Center for Justice. Federal district court judges issued sweeping national injunctions in individual cases that stymied attempts by both Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama to change how the United States treats undocumented immigrants. Federal judges in Texas used them to stop Mr. Obama’s initiatives on rights for transgender citizens and overtime pay. Judges in California, Hawaii and other states have since used them to push back on Mr. Trump’s travel ban and immigration order. “Increasingly, legal scholars are concerned about the way national injunctions are transforming the relationship between the courts and the political branches,” Mr. Bray said. While the debate over national injunctions has so far been a quiet affair among scholars, those orders have forced the government and the court system into a public crisis mode. In 2014, Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Federal District Court in Brownsville, Tex., delayed an executive action drafted by Mr. Obama that gave as many as five million undocumented immigrants temporary protection from deportation and permitted them to work. Judge Hanen said that the program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, could not be enforced nationwide until litigation was resolved. Protests broke out across the country in response. The case ultimately went before the Supreme Court, whose justices were split, 4 to 4, effectively ending Mr. Obama’s program before it started. On Tuesday, Judge Alsup ordered the Trump administration to maintain the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which temporarily shields from deportation 800,000 young people who illegally entered the country as children. The judge’s order was criticized by the Justice Department. When appeals courts do not block these injunctions, the Supreme Court can be forced to intervene, as it did with the Obama-era immigration case. There is speculation that the Supreme Court will address universal injunctions in the coming year. “The justices don’t like the districts courts changing national policy overnight,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. The Supreme Court has typically heard cases after they have wound their way through the court system, giving the justices an opportunity to weigh multiple rulings from multiple judges. “When national injunctions accelerate decision making, the Supreme Court only gets views on one side of the argument,” Mr. Blackman said. “It’s forced to decide major constitutional questions with no trials, no contrary views and with less time.” In some cases, arguments for nationwide injunctions make sense, according to some legal scholars. If, for example, Mr. Trump’s order on DACA is rejected after immigrants are forced out of the country, the harm to them could be irreparable. Some scholars like Ms. Weiser say they believe that personal attacks on judges by the president and the recent nominations of judicial candidates who are young and ideologically extreme, some with little experience on the bench, are more serious issues than the use of nationwide injunctions. But even lawyers who have supported the use of national injunctions say their use should be curbed. Mr. Blackman, who filed briefs that supported a national injunction against Mr. Obama’s executive action on immigration, said they should not be used in cases of so-called sanctuary cities because each one deals with a different set of issues and punitive measures. “These injunctions are pushing to new frontiers,” Mr. Blackman said.",The New York Times
2018,A Death in Kosovo Stokes Fears and Threatens Peace,"MITROVICA, Kosovo — The challenge for President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia was steep: Visiting a neighboring country whose sovereignty he does not recognize, addressing a group of people deeply distrustful of his intentions and talking about an assassination that remains unsolved. In a hastily arranged visit that came on the heels of the daytime slaying of a moderate Serb politician, Oliver Ivanovic, Mr. Vucic vowed over the weekend to protect ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, a land still reeling from Balkan wars of the 1990s, even as he called for calm. Mr. Vucic, speaking on Saturday in front of a 14th-century Serbian Orthodox monastery on a snow-swept mountainside, urged the Serbian population not to give up on Kosovo, a majority ethnic Albanian sliver of land that they once dominated and fought a war over. The fighting in Kosovo ended in 1999 after the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia and only after a United States-led NATO bombing campaign over Serbia. Kosovo, revered by Serbs as a cradle of their nation and their Orthodox faith, declared independence in 2008, a move that divided the international community. “Serbs have to remain and survive in their homes in Kosovo,” Mr. Vucic told the skeptical audience of ethnic Serbs in the village of Banjska in northern Kosovo. “We cannot allow our numbers to dwindle in the land we’ve lived in since ancient time.” Still, he made clear that it was imperative that both sides act in good faith in the wake of Mr. Ivanovic’s killing in the northern city of Mitrovica, not far from the monastery. The investigation is an opportunity for the ethnic Albanian institutions to “show what they will do,” he said in a statement. On the Serb side, he said, “There will be no mercy for the perpetrators nor for those who ordered it, no matter whether their name is Serbian or Albanian.” The war ended nearly two decades ago, but tensions remain high and all sides are aware how quickly violent episodes in one ethnic community can morph into a conflict with another. Mr. Vucic’s arrival was precipitated by the death of Mr. Ivanovic, 64, who was shot five times in the chest on a street, his body splayed out on the sidewalk just steps from the office of the political party he led. As Mr. Vucic’s motorcade sped from the north to a Serbian enclave in the south of the country, hundreds of officers lined the highway, standing guard in a blinding snowstorm. The Serb leader tried to walk a fine line on his visit, working to satisfy different audiences — the Serbian people, and the Western leaders he is courting as he seeks to join the European Union. Mr. Vucic is a political descendant of the former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who rose to power on the backs of Kosovo Serbs in the late 1980s. As the leader of Serbia, both as prime minister and now as president, Mr. Vucic is taking a page from the Milosevic playbook, casting himself as the central figure in the lives of Serbs living in Kosovo. Mr. Vucic, who was greeted by high church officials with a loaf of bread and a thimble of salt on his arrival at the Banjska monastery, has also sought to keep close ties with the Serbian Orthodox Church and is thought to be the main patron of Serb politicians serving in the Kosovo Parliament. But unlike Mr. Milosevic, who defied and fought the West during his rule, Mr. Vucic has cast himself as pro-Western, declaring a break with his radical past as Serbia tries to join the European Union. Mr. Vucic, who has had almost unchallenged control of Serbia’s institutions and news media since his landslide victory in the presidential election in April, has been trying to convince Brussels that shedding his nationalist past is a sign that he is willing to make painful compromises. Thus far, however, Serbia has refused to recognize Kosovo’s independence. And while it must show a track record of improved relations with its neighbor in order to join the bloc, the ties have soured in recent years. In Serbia, the news media routinely lashes out against Albanians and Serbs who back any sort of compromise on Kosovo, using derogatory language to disseminate Mr. Vucic’s populist message against Kosovo’s independence, experts say. “Kosovo, and Serbs in Kosovo, have always been the central part of a nationalist and populist rule in Serbia,” said Dragan Popovic, a political analyst who leads the Policy Institute, an independent think tank in Belgrade. Mr. Vucic is no exception. If he wants to remain in power, Mr. Popovic said, he must keep Serbs in a constant state of fear, particularly in Kosovo, where he has tried to cast himself their protector and savior. “That was the reason he went there immediately after the death of a politician whom he accused of being a traitor,” Mr. Popovic said. After laying a wreath on the sidewalk where Mr. Ivanovic was killed, Mr. Vucic spoke with local leaders in Mitrovica and said that the murder had created an “awful atmosphere.” He knew his message was not one that many in the crowd wanted to hear. “People are scared and feeling attacked,” he said. But he said it was better to allow the investigation into the killing to play out and for political leaders to talk than for “any bullets to fly.” At the same time, Mr. Vucic said the talks with Kosovo officials on normalizing relations would not resume in Brussels until the murder was solved. Solving the crime under normal circumstances would be challenging. The shooter fled in a car that was later found to have been burned almost beyond recognition — probably destroying any forensic evidence — and there are few promising clues. And the situation in Kosovo complicates matters. In a statement issued just hours after Mr. Vucic’s travel plans were announced, the American ambassador in Kosovo, Greg Delawie, warned that “no one should take advantage of this crime for political ends.” He also warned the leaders of Kosovo — a country of 1.8 million people, predominantly ethnic Albanians — that it would be a mistake to pass a law suspending a war crimes court responsible for prosecuting former members of a Kosovo Albanian guerrilla group for atrocities during the war of independence. In his visit to Kosovo over the weekend, Mr. Vucic was met by skeptical and tense crowds. “President, help us all!” one person shouted. “We are all targeted, we are guilty of being Serbs.” “Please, can you guarantee safety on our own land?” another yelled. Mr. Vucic’s critics accuse him of stoking those fears because they are politically useful, but he has also been trying to keep them in check. While Mr. Vucic called on the authorities in the Kosovar capital, Pristina, to properly investigate the murder, he said the government in Belgrade was looking into ways to strengthen defenses of Serbs in Kosovo, including from threats originating in their own community — a bitter complaint that Mr. Ivanovic voiced as people’s main concern in Mitrovica and around the north. “What’s most important for us is to come up with additional mechanisms to fight crime and corruption within our own ranks,” Mr. Vucic said. But, no matter what, he said, “we will protect the Serbs.”",The New York Times

Morgan Babst 370 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $26.95. Following a grim hurricane season, C. Morgan Babst’s powerful debut novel, “The Floating World,” revives our memory of what seemed at the time like the mother of all storms. The novel follows the members of a New Orleans family immediately after Hurricane Katrina, alternating among their perspectives. There is Tess, a white doctor who comes from money, and her husband, Joe, a Creole artist. They have two grown daughters, the distressed Cora and the willful Del. Cora is the only one to stay for the storm; Del is away in New York and the others evacuate. Though Tess will eventually come to her daughter’s aid, and Del will return, Cora sees something in the 25 days she’s without her family that leaves her even more frazzled than before. Unlike Jesmyn Ward’s powerful Katrina novel, the National Book Award-winning “Salvage the Bones,” most of this story takes place after landfall. And with visions of the storm sneaking into even the most discordant scenes, inescapable loss permeates each page. At one point, the perfection of a Tollhouse cookie in the imperfect city brings tears to Tess’s eyes. At another, Del gets a “feeling in her chest like water straining against a door” when her friend-turned-lover says I love you. Sometimes — especially in Tess’s, Del’s and Joe’s sections — the sense of loss becomes almost oppressive. In reality the storm’s impact was unrelenting, no doubt, but Babst is most effective at conveying the emotional weight of the tragedy when she presents it alongside vibrant characters and story lines. One of the most vibrant is the family patriarch, Vincent, whom Babst brings to life in a portrayal that’s impressively unrestrained, even Faulknerian. Because of his memory limitations, we see his whole life stream forward as if in the present tense, outside of the storm’s temporal confines. We taste the stuffed crab and pocket pies he ate on a street the city has since replaced with an interstate he doesn’t remember. We feel the comfort of his mother’s rocking chair, the relief of his dog come back to assure him everything will be O.K. Babst also shines in her depiction of Cora. The book’s short middle section ingeniously tracks back to before the storm, and Cora glimmers on the page: a fragile, naïve yet thoughtful woman reminiscent of Laura in “The Glass Menagerie.” Any novel of the South has to grapple with race at least implicitly, and “The Floating World” doesn’t shy from the subject. Cora is romantically involved with Troy, an African-American restaurant worker whose sister, Reyna, is mentally ill. Though Joe identifies as Creole, and Cora and Del are biracial, they are economically privileged. So it was wise on Babst’s part to introduce the poorer Troy and Reyna to a book about Katrina — a storm that touched so many poor African-American lives, after all. Unfortunately, Reyna rarely rises above stereotype, either sentimentalized by Cora or demonized by Troy. And her fate is too often and too superficially linked to Cora’s story, without recognizing her independent significance as a mother of two, or just as a complex character. She feels like a missed opportunity to pay authentic attention to the plight of the people who arguably saw the worst of the storm. Still anyone who has experienced loss will be hard hit by Babst’s expert descriptions: “the innards of sofas strewn across lawns,” “the littered brown no-man’s-land that had once been grass,” details that seem infused with the city’s soul. When Del and her lover dance to Kermit Ruffins in the Quarter, a reader might even feel an urge to sing along: Do you know what it means, to miss New Orleans?",The New York Times
2018,"A Deep Dive Into the Brain, Hand-Drawn by the Father of Neuroscience","Art Review The breakthrough drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal are undeniable as art. “Cells in the retina of the eye” (1904), one of Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s most striking drawings at the Grey Art Gallery in Manhattan.CreditCreditCajal Institute, Madrid It’s not often that you look at an exhibition with the help of the very apparatus that is its subject. But so it is with “The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal” at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University, one of the most unusual, ravishing exhibitions of the season. It presents 80 small notebook renderings in shifting combinations of ink and pencil by the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934) that are considered among the world’s greatest scientific illustrations. Together they describe a fantastic netherworld of floating forms, linear networks, bristling nodes and torrential energies. They posit the thing between your ears as an immense cosmic universe, or at least one of the most intricate of all of nature’s creations. That the images are also undeniable as art only adds to the complexity of the experience. Cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience, as important in his field as Charles Darwin or Louis Pasteur are in theirs (though relatively unknown outside of it). His discoveries, made during the last dozen years of the 19th-century, concern the way neurons, the building blocks of the brain, spinal cord and nervous system, communicate with one another. His theory — immediately accepted by most, but not strictly proven until the 1950s — was that neurons are in touch without touching. They communicate across infinitesimal gaps known as synaptic clefts. Through a chemical and electrical transmission, the single-stemmed axon of one neuron talks to the branched root-like dendrite of another. This process of synaptic messaging between unconnected cells came to be called the Neuron Doctrine, and in 1906, it earned Cajal the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He shared it with the Italian histologist Camillo Golgi, who had devised a new method of staining tissue that singled out individual cells under the microscope instead of presenting tangled illegible masses. An irony of the joint prize (for revealing the structure of the nervous system) is that Golgi remained unconvinced by the Neuron Doctrine and true to reticular theory, which saw neurons as physically connected. In his research, Cajal’s two tools were the most powerful microscope he could find and one of the oldest art techniques known to mankind: drawing, for which he had great talent. Looking through the lens he saw with such acuity and drew so precisely (freehand) that some of his renderings still appear in text books. And yet he also drew with such delicacy and vivacity that his drawings stand on their own as wonders of graphic expression, both mysterious and familiar. The drawings are at once fairly hard-nosed fact if you know your science. If you don’t they are deep pools of suggestive motifs into which the imagination can dive. Their lines, forms and various textures of stippling, dashes and faint pencil circles would be the envy of any modern artist. That they connect with Surrealist drawing, biomorphic abstraction and exquisite doodling is only the half of it. These small works evoke enough things you already know — landscape, weather systems, trees, marine life — that they bring you back around to reality, implying the multiple purposes if not universality of certain natural structures. Root systems, functioning in different ways, are found in trees, turnips and the pyramidal neuron, which Cajal called “the noble and enigmatic cell of thought.” Born in Navarra, the son of a doctor, Cajal was a rebellious artistic child, with an innate distrust of authority and an obsessive-compulsive proclivity. At 8, according to the catalog, he drew everything around him and then set out to collect everything pertaining to birds. He taught himself photography, making carefully posed self-portraits throughout his life. And he trained as an artist, but his father cajoled him toward medicine by enlisting him to make anatomical drawings as teaching aids. The son then went to medical school and eventually found his calling in researching the extremely refined, nearly invisible workings of the brain. It was an exciting area of study at that time and it perfectly fused his various interests and talents. This show, the first exhibition of Cajal’s drawings in this country, originated at the University of Minnesota and continues in May to the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Mass. It was selected from the 2,900 or so drawings that Ramón y Cajal made in his lifetime; all come from the Cajal Institute in Madrid, which organized the show with the university’s Weisman Art Museum and three neuroscientists on its faculty — Eric A. Newman, Janet M. Dubinsky and Alfonso Araque. The catalog is an absolute treasure, jargon-free, with excellent reproductions and an illuminating biographical essay by Larry W. Swanson, a neurobiologist and author of “Brain Architecture” (2002). The outliers of the group are Lyndel King, director and chief curator of the Weisman and Eric Himmel, editor in chief at Abrams Books (the catalog’s publisher), who contribute a riveting essay detailing Cajal’s artistic sensibility and working processes. The drawings will elicit stupefied awe from art enthusiasts, who use their brains without knowing how they work, and excited chatter from visiting neuroscience types. I asked one loquacious, evidently knowledgeable viewer if “gray matter” was a colloquialism or a term of science. I learned that it’s a term of science that became a colloquialism: the brain has gray matter, which contains cells, and also white matter, which is fibrous. The 80 drawings here were made between 1890 and 1933, and are divided into four sections. “Cells of the Brain” presents some of the basics, beginning with pyramidal neurons, and including the pericellular nests that surround them like pointy hats, or Eva Hesse sculpture, and proceeding to the coral-like Purkinje neurons (from the human and pigeon cerebellum). In “Sensory Systems,” you’ll find several of the show’s masterpieces: “Cells in the retina of the eye,” a vertical stack of textures and intersecting lines and shapes, suggests a wall hanging by a very ambitious fiber artist of the 1950s. Drawings for the retina of the lizard and sparrow evoke espaliered trees. Blue ink added to the peninsular forms of “The labyrinth of the inner ear,” renders them solid. And the Wagnerian “Ending of the vestibular nerve” is swept with diagonal streams of lines and rising neurons. “Development and Pathology” is rife with strange aberrant forms and a sense of agitated circuitry; also several outstanding drawings in a purely visual sense. Cajal samples the brain cells of a drowned man and one suffering from paralysis and in “Tumor cells of the covering membranes of the brain,” he achieves tangled skeins that conjure William Blake and Louise Bourgeois. Things quiet down in “Neuronal Pathways,” which I recommend for the strange little landscape that is “Connections within the hippocampus.” “Seeing the Beautiful Brain Today,” a section on contemporary renderings usually in jolting bright colors, presents animations as well as detailed microscopic photographs that are juxtaposed with reproductions of Cajal drawings of the same subject. Nothing here compares to Cajal artistically, but the animations have their own kind of wonder and should not be missed.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Democratic Ticket for 2020?,"Letter To the Editor: Re “In Reply, a Bilingual Salvo From Kennedy” (news article, Jan. 31): What do Democrats desperately need? Young leaders. A writer on Salon.com noted that Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III’s rebuttal message “of unity, positivity and shared struggle are precisely what Democrats have lost since the early days of the presidency of Barack Obama.” Mr. Kennedy — like Justin Trudeau in Canada — is the young blood that the Democrats desperately need. If you pair Joe Kennedy up with one of the female Democratic politicians like Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill or Tammy Duckworth, the Democrats will have a winning ticket in 2020. JOE MCCAFFREY, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: Joseph Kennedy’s rebuttal to the State of the Union was spot on. But he’s not ready, or seasoned enough, to be the electable liberal savior. Democrats can’t get lazy and rely on shiny new object star power with sacred names to somehow coalesce the American people around the progressive values mission.

2018,"A Designer’s Healthy Answer to Bacon, Egg and Cheese","My Detox To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse — and refresh. “My wellness regimen has evolved over the years, although I’m not sure I would call it wellness,” says Wendy Mullin of the brand Built by Wendy, which clothed the mid-90s downtown scene and formally relaunched last year. “Between 1992 and 2007, my routine was something like: Wake up late, sometimes hung over, and walk my dog to the park, stopping at the deli on my way, where I’d pick up a coffee with milk and one sugar, and a bacon, egg and cheese on a roll with ketchup on it. Not on the side, so I didn’t have to deal with opening it and squeezing it out and all that.” She’d then read The Daily News and possibly head to the gym for an anxiety-ridden run on the treadmill, always in corduroy cutoffs (Mullin doesn’t “do workout clothes,” she says) and “gym shoes, in the elementary-school way.” As Mullin, 47, has settled into adulthood, she’s made some adjustments — she now regularly swims laps at the YMCA and practices yoga, both at home and in a studio. “I did, for the first time, self-consciously go to the grocery store with yoga clothing on — O.K., I covered my leggings with gauchos,” she says, “then I realized, everyone wears yoga clothes to the grocery store and nobody is looking at me, so get over it.” In terms of diet, Mullin’s bacon, egg and cheese has become a “Morning bruschetta.” She shares the recipe for that, as well as her version of a breakfast taco, below. ∙ 1 English muffin ∙ 1 hard-boiled egg ∙ 1 avocado ∙ a few cherry tomatoes ∙ a drizzle of olive oil ∙ a squeeze of lemon juice ∙ salt and pepper 1. Remove the egg yolk from the hard-boiled egg (and toss it to the dog begging below). Chop up the rest. 2. Chop up the avocado. 3. Halve the tomatoes. 4. Toss it all together — plus olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper — and stack it on toasted English muffin halves. Variant: For a Breakfast Taco, use Trader Joe’s corn & wheat tortillas fired over a stove’s flame instead of English muffins, and substitute lime for lemon.",The New York Times
2018,A Designer’s Plant-Based Chili Recipe for Cold Winter Days,"My Detox To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse — and refresh. “I was vegan-leaning early on,” says Aurora James. At age 10, the Toronto-born designer and founder of Brother Vellies gave up fish and eggs; when she left for college, she started to eschew meat and dairy as well. “I loved animals and wanted to be conscious,” she says. Cooking became a challenge, so she did what any 18-year-old living away from home for the first time might do: She called her mom. James’s mother, Randa, recommended that her daughter make a hearty plant-based chili, which she had cooked frequently with her artist friends in London in the 1970s. “They all lived in one giant apartment and had a communal chili pot that was always simmering on the stove,” says James, recounting her mother’s story. “Every day someone was responsible for getting a new vegetable and adding it to the pot. It spent so much time on low heat, and with multiple people adding different vegetables, that the flavors of the chili started blending together in a special way.” The recipe was packed with protein from chickpeas (rather than red meat) along with vitamins and fiber from the rustic vegetables. When feeling depleted, James says this cleaner, lighter version of the traditionally heavy dish makes her feel balanced and “more whole.” Having done a number of detoxes over the years, James realized that she would rather not eliminate foods from her diet. Instead, she says, “It’s not about stripping away — but adding in what you’re missing.” With its aromatic blend of spices, the chili was also a step above “takeout food and all that jazz, which I didn’t want.” Throughout her two years at Ryerson University, James adapted her mother’s chili recipe and kept a pot of it on the stove, or a container in the fridge, which her friends and roommates would huddle over. “It didn’t feel like college food,” she says. “It felt like a warm hug.” Now the 33-year-old James regularly makes the chili for an energizing winter fix. Though she is no longer a vegan, she explains, “It just makes you feel warm and enriched.” After recently moving into a new apartment in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, James has more space to share the chili with others — gatherings often include her boyfriend, the stylist Browne Andrews, the editor Elaine Welteroth and Adeline, the front woman of the band Escort. “It’s an easy crowd pleaser, and you can always infuse your own thing — take out the broccoli or add more corn to customize it,” she says. The dish takes about two and a half hours to make but James, who frequently travels to Ethiopia and South Africa to produce her line of sustainable shoes and bags, considers cooking a form of meditation. “We have to make time for ourselves and nourish ourselves — and this chili is pretty perfect for that.” Here, James shares the wholesome recipe, which she serves in vintage wooden bowls from her mother. She recommends making up a large batch, noting that the chili tastes even better the second day. “That’s when the flavors really come together.” · 3 tablespoons olive oil · 3 large yellow onions, chopped · 3 cloves garlic, chopped · 1 large green pepper, chopped · 1 large red pepper, chopped · 1 large yellow pepper, chopped · 3 tablespoons chile powder, divided · 1 cup broccoli florets · 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, divided · Pinch of chile-pepper flakes · 2 cans crushed tomatoes, divided · 8 cherry tomatoes, chopped or whole · ½ teaspoon salt · 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper · 1 can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed · 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed · 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed · 1 tablespoon of cinnamon · 1 teaspoon paprika · 1 teaspoon oregano · 1 tablespoon brown sugar or honey · 1 can tomato paste · 2 chiles chopped in adobo sauce, canned · 1 large zucchini, chopped · ½ cup fresh peas · ½ cup fresh corn · Optional toppings: scoop of grated Cheddar cheese, sour cream, sliced avocado 1.

2018,A Detroit Restaurant With Deep Local Roots,"Bites The food at Lady of the House, in the Corktown neighborhood, could be described as seasonal-voluptuous. There’s a world of hospitality contained in the tiny cups of black tea that greet you — along with a dainty plate of Welsh rarebit-flavored crackers — when you sit down to eat at Lady of the House, a nominally Irish, decidedly welcoming restaurant that opened last September in Detroit’s Corktown neighborhood. The lady in charge of this particular house is Kate Williams, a Detroit native whose family roots run deep in Corktown: her great-grandparents met at the neighborhood’s Gaelic League after emigrating from Ireland. Ms. Williams, who previously cooked at other restaurants around town, had long wanted to open her own in Detroit, where “as much as we can,” she said, her business is now “getting the money back into a city that needs to grow the tax base.” And, indeed, her focus is local: Much of Ms. Williams’ produce comes from urban farms, her house gin was created in collaboration with Detroit City Distillery and her tables and bar shelves were made by a local artist. A sense of resourcefulness pervades her cooking, which incorporates so-called ugly foods — ingredients that would have otherwise been discarded for purely aesthetic reasons — and whole-animal butchery. “Chef is passionate about no waste,” our server informed us. “You’ll notice at the end of the night that we only have one compost bucket.” We didn’t, largely because there was so much else that demanded our attention. Namely, there was the food, which is served on old-fashioned china and could be described as seasonal-voluptuous: roast chicken for four; mighty slabs of mushroom toast smeared with homemade ricotta; crisp-creamy roasted cauliflower served in a puddle of parmesan sauce; a trio of scallops, fat as tuffets, plopped on a bed of polenta cooked in whey; and a sardine tin full of lethally rich shrimp butter, tinted scarlet with a dusting of Aleppo pepper and accompanied by toasted rye-sourdough bread. That bread, not incidentally, is exceptional; it’s the work of Shelby Janisch, the restaurant’s 21-year-old baker who is also, our server said, “really good at puns.” Such cozy food asks for cozy surroundings, and Ms. Williams has obliged: the dining room has the low lights and polished dark-wood floors of a good pub, along with elegant banquettes upholstered in green velvet and caramel leather and a marble-topped bar. And there is the women’s restroom, where hospitality comes in the form of a machine dispensing free tampons and a bench whose fabric is printed with Ryan Gosling’s face. The bathroom is a subtle nod to female empowerment, said Ms. Williams, adding that the bench, which is bolted to the ground, “is the most photographed thing here.” Almost as popular are the restaurant’s potato doughnuts. “My dad is still passionate about the potato famine,” Ms. Williams said. “So I was like, I can’t open a restaurant without a white potato dessert.” Served with dried yogurt and a chamomile sauce, they are improbably airy, although we were so stuffed that we had to have them boxed up. They were just as good the next day — one last touch of hospitality taken to go. Lady of the House, 1426 Bagley Avenue; 313-818-0218; ladyofthehousedetroit.com.

2018,A Diary From a Gulag Meets Evil With Lightness,"MOSCOW — For nearly 70 years, Olga M. Ranitskaya’s exceptional palm-sized diary, bound in snakeskin, slumbered in obscurity. Combining whimsical drawings with clever rhyming couplets, the diary — more graphic novel than ordinary journal — portrays the physical and emotional hardships of a spirited stick figure, the author’s alter ego. What makes this diary unique is that Ms. Ranitskaya created it while incarcerated in the Gulag, the Soviet system of forced labor camps where, at its height, Joseph Stalin imprisoned millions of people from the 1930s to the 1950s. The Gulag inspired famous literary accounts, such as the works by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov, but they were all written after the authors were released. Ms. Ranitskaya’s diary is believed to be the only one written inside the camps to have survived. How the diary emerged reads like a detective story, with Zoya Eroshok, a prominent Russian journalist, spending years piecing together the identity of its author and her fate. The saga is the subject of the new exhibition “Evidence: Little Book,” which runs through Feb. 8 at the Gulag History Museum in Moscow. The exhibition arrives as Russia stands at a crossroads in its attitude toward the darker reaches of its recent history. The government just unveiled the first national monument to the victims of political repression, and the revitalized Gulag History Museum, which moved to a larger building in 2015, has been recording the recollections of remaining survivors. But attitudes toward Stalin and his terror have become far more tolerant, not least because the Kremlin has recast his time as head of the Soviet Union with a certain nostalgia. President Vladimir V. Putin does not deny Stalin’s repressions, but there has been a new emphasis on his legacy as an “efficient manager.” Organizers of the exhibition consider the diary so important because it puts a human face on past crimes. Getting caught with a pen and paper in the Gulag was sufficient grounds for execution. Keeping a diary was “particularly impossible,” said Irina S. Ostrovskaya, the senior archivist at Memorial, the Russian civil rights organization founded to establish a record of the victims of Soviet political repression. Ms. Ranitskaya persevered for almost two years, across 115 pages, drawing the small, spunky figure mostly in black and white. The author began the diary in 1941 — the date written on the first page — while she was working at a weather station that served the farming operations of the sprawling Karlag labor camp in Kazakhstan. The diary features the misadventures of camp life experienced by the stick figure called the “Little Weather Devil.” Drawn in the style of pre-revolutionary comics, each page depicts a theme, like hunger or fear, or illustrates specific, often emotional moments, from the tragedy of losing a coat in a harsh climate to the joy of finding a she-wolf for a pet. On some pages, the figure contemplates existential questions or the vagaries of fate. The diary frequently references Russian literature, including the poets Pushkin and Lermontov, as well as Latin axioms. The title of the diary, “Work and Days,” came from the epic poem of Hesiod, a Greek poet, from around 700 BC, which discussed corruption, honesty and justice. The couplets are difficult to translate, particularly the more philosophical musings. They are often word plays or otherwise ambiguous. “It reveals a very good knowledge of the language and literature, but it is often hard to tell what she means,” said Dmitri A. Belanovsky, who translated parts of the diary into English. He thinks the ambiguity was insurance in case the guards found the diary. The Gulag History Museum published a copy of the diary in a small, handsome volume that also includes reproductions of newspaper articles about its discovery, the record of Ms. Ranitskaya’s interrogation when she was arrested and some longer poems that she wrote later. It took some eight years to pull it all together. In February 2009, Ms. Eroshok, a founding editor of Novaya Gazeta, a liberal newspaper, received the diary from a woman in Siberia whose own mother had spirited it out of the camp in 1946. The only thing the woman remembered being told about the book was that it had been written by a woman named Olga, that she might have worked at the weather station and that she probably died in late 1942, when the diary ended. Ms. Eroshok found the diary stunning and wondered about its author. “She responded to this evil with something of quality, the quality of the drawing, the quality of the language and the quality of strong and positive feelings: her love for her son, her love of life, her love for people,” said Ms. Eroshok. “I had this deep sense of responsibility that I had to find something out about this woman, tell her story somehow.” The journalist thumbed through the tiny volume repeatedly, seeking clues. The author had dedicated the diary to her son, Sasha. Maybe he was still alive? The diary’s first entry shows the stick figure sitting atop a weather station, staring out over the fields. The words suggest the figure is yearning for distant Ukraine. Did Sasha live in Ukraine? Another page contained a list of six weather station employees. Only one was female, Ranitskaya. (In Russian, a surname often reveals a person’s gender.) Could that be Olga? Ms. Eroshok wrote to the archives of 15 different secret police agencies, courts and other organizations in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, requesting information about one Olga Ranitskaya. The central archives wrote back that they had no information. Her quest was a typical example of how difficult it can be to verify information about the victims of Soviet brutality. Frustrated, she wrote an article in Novaya Gazeta about her hunt, and clues trickled in. She got lucky. In Israel, Inna A. Nogotovich, a Russian immigrant occasionally nostalgic for home culture, read the article by chance and got in touch with Ms Eroshok. Ms. Nogotovich was Ms. Ranitskaya’s niece, and she filled in many blanks. Then Ms. Eroshok heard from an even more unexpected quarter. Vasily Khristoforov, then head of the notoriously secretive archives of the F.S.B., or Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the Soviet secret police, offered to help. He contacted several security agency archives, including one in Ukraine, and obtained the records of Ms. Ranitskaya’s interrogation after her arrest. From this, Ms. Eroshok was able to piece the story together. Ms. Ranitskaya was a Ukrainian Jew born in Kiev in 1905 to two professionals. The family name was Rabinovich, which she eventually changed. Ending her education early, she married a Communist Party official and had a son, Sasha, in 1925. She divorced and married another party official. She was arrested in 1937, during Stalin’s Great Purge, charged on the dubious grounds of spying for Poland and sentenced to five years in a labor camp. She ended up serving nine. Her first husband, who was also arrested, was executed. While his mother was in the camp, Sasha stayed with his grandmother. In 1942, at age 16, unable to bear the taunts from his schoolmates that his mother was a prisoner, he committed suicide. Ms. Eroshok believes that several blank, numbered pages at the end of the diary signal the author’s grief when she learned that her son was dead. Ms. Ranitskaya was forced to remain in exile like many former camp inmates until after Stalin’s death in 1953. She worked in a clinic and wrote a book of poetry before dying in Kiev in 1988. Some mysteries endure, and Ms. Eroshok’s work is not finished. Ms. Ranitskaya was reportedly an exceptional beauty, but Ms. Eroshok has never found a picture. “I think it’s very important when there’s this book, when there’s this life, that there be a face,” she said. She and Roman V. Romanov, the director of the Gulag History Museum, put a slightly different emphasis on the diary’s value. Mr. Romanov believes that Russia must get past the arguments over how many millions Stalin killed and focus instead on the fate of ordinary people. “This is a game with abstract terms,” he said, “What is important is to return to people’s fate and allow the viewers to be part of someone’s life.” For Ms. Eroshok, the book is testament to Ms. Ranitskaya outliving the system that sought to erase her. She has managed to rescue herself from oblivion, Ms. Eroshok said, and the diary is not just evidence, but a form of revenge against Stalin for all his victims. “He wanted them to be wiped off the face of the earth,” she said. “Well, now he is gone, but this book remains.”",The New York Times

Doctors today often complain of working in an occupational black hole in which patient encounters are compressed into smaller and smaller space and time. You can do a passable job in a 10-minute visit, they say, but it is impossible to appreciate the subtleties of patient care when you are rushing. Enter “Slow Medicine: The Way to Healing,” a wonderful new memoir by Dr. Victoria Sweet. The term “slow medicine” has different interpretations. For some it means spending more time with patients. For others it means taking the time to understand evidence so as to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For Sweet, it means “stepping back and seeing the patient in the context of his environment,” and providing medical care that is “slow, methodical and step-by-step.” At the beginning of her book, she relates how her 93-year-old father was mistreated after being hospitalized for a seizure. He is put in 4-point restraints and sedated. Bloody urine drains from his bladder because it has been injured by a catheter insertion. Worse, his rushed doctors don’t know that this isn’t his first seizure but rather the latest in a long line that can be managed at home. The steamroller of inpatient care takes over. Every day Sweet’s father sees a different doctor. He isn’t allowed to eat or get out of bed because he is on tranquilizers. He becomes septic. His symptoms are misdiagnosed as a stroke. Doctors eventually prepare to insert a feeding tube into his stomach because he cannot swallow. Sweet and her sisters get him out of the hospital just in time. When he gets home, he has a steak and a beer. Sweet writes, “If I, as a physician, couldn’t get appropriate care for a family member in a lovely community hospital with well-trained staff — who could?” She yearns for a different kind of medical care — one that is not “a commodity, bought and sold on Wall Street.” Sweet’s book pivots from this point into a memoir of her education as a doctor. In often lyrical stories, she recognizes ailments that elude her colleagues. After poring through charts to diagnose a patient with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer masquerading as schizophrenia, she writes that it is proof that being rushed in medicine is not only wasteful but dangerous. Sweet maintains a healthy respect for modern medicine, however. Dialysis, antibiotics and intensive care units save lives. She knows their power but their limitations, too, and this girds her subtle and insightful commentary. Sweet is an unlikely advocate for a kind of soft paternalism. For example, if not for Kathy, a determined nurse who browbeats a man with a tear in his aorta to return to the emergency room that has twice misdiagnosed him, the patient surely would have died. “Kathy showed me,” she writes, “that the best doctor diagnoses, prescribes, drives the patient to the ER, and then makes sure he gets the right treatment. By force, if necessary.” Such hardheadedness, in Sweet’s view, is also needed when patients insist on aggressive, possibly futile, end-of-life treatment. “ ‘Patient autonomy’ goes only so far,” she explains. “No patient, no family, can know what they are saying when they say, Do everything. Being a doctor means seeing things clearly, explaining things clearly, but in the end, if necessary, it means saying no.” One of the most compelling stories in the book is about Joey, a 3-year-old who is diagnosed with terminal lung disease after a near-drowning but against the odds makes it off the ventilator and out of the hospital. Sweet interprets Joey’s recovery in part as a victory for prayer. “Prayer worked,” she writes, “at least that once and maybe sometimes and maybe always.” I would see it differently: Joey was saved because a lung specialist slowly decreased airway pressure and tidal volume over several weeks in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. And, as Sweet points out, it was slow medicine that allowed that doctor to make the proper adjustments. Perhaps Sweet’s most depressing conclusion is that Joey would have died today. His doctors “would have been too busy entering health care data” that was required “according to all the mandated protocols.” Physicians would do well to learn this most important lesson about caring for patients from Sweet’s book: “Establishing the correct diagnoses and then getting them off all those unnecessary medications, with their side effects and adverse reactions, took a lot of time, but in the long run it saved way more money than it cost. It was slower but it was better.”",The New York Times
2018,A Drone Saves Two Swimmers in Australia,"SYDNEY, Australia — A practice session for Australian lifeguards who were testing a new drone turned into a real rescue when the drone helped save two swimmers at a beach in New South Wales. On Thursday morning, Jai Sheridan, a lifeguard supervisor who was operating the drone, was alerted to two young men caught in turbulent surf with 10-foot swells. Mr. Sheridan then steered the drone toward the swimmers. In video of the incident taken from the drone, it can be seen releasing a yellow “rescue pod” that inflates in the water. The two swimmers grabbed the pod, and with its support they made their way to shore. They were fatigued, but not hurt, Surf Life Saving New South Wales, a volunteer organization, said in a statement. The rescue took just 70 seconds. “On a normal day that would have taken our lifeguards a few minutes longer,” Mr. Sheridan said. The drone used for the rescue, known as a Little Ripper unmanned aerial vehicle, is also part of a shark-spotting program being rolled out across Australian beaches this summer. It uses an algorithm to automatically recognize sharks. “The applications in the water are just phenomenal,” said Michael Blumenstein, a professor at the University of Technology Sydney who oversaw the team that developed the shark-spotting software. “The amount of payload that these drones carry enable them to be really be versatile.” In cases involving rough surf, remote locations or natural disasters, where conditions may be hazardous and time is a factor, Professor Blumenstein said, drones are able to help operators assess a situation without endangering human lives. Farmers have also found practical applications for drones, using them to efficiently assess the health of their crops, for example. But in crowded urban areas, Professor Blumenstein said, security concerns may still be an issue. “People are still, I think, wary of low-hanging hovering objects, and rightfully so,” he said. In December, the state government of New South Wales announced that it would invest 430,000 Australian dollars, or $345,000, into drone technology as part of a trial on the state’s North Coast. John Barilaro, deputy premier of New South Wales, said after Thursday’s rescue that the investment had already paid off. “Never before has a drone, fitted with a flotation device, been used to rescue swimmers like this,” Mr. Barilaro said. The software developed by Professor Blumenstein’s team could soon become a vital tool for lifeguards. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t use it to automatically detect people in the water,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,A Family With Jamaican Roots Mourns 5 Relatives Killed in a Bronx Fire,"Five open coffins at a funeral home in Upper Manhattan held Ambrozine Stewart’s lost treasures. In the tiniest one, on the left, was her granddaughter Kylie Francis, 2. Beside the girl was the sister from whom she was inseparable, Kelesha, 7. In the middle, the girls’ mother, Karen Stewart-Francis, 37, was the only one dressed in black, her favorite color to wear. To the right lay her husband, Holt Francis, 27, and between them, their niece, Shawntay Young, 19. They were among 13 people killed last month in the deadliest fire in New York City in nearly three decades. At a viewing before the funeral for the five was held Monday at the R. G. Ortiz Funeral Home in Washington Heights, Ms. Stewart, 69, knelt before each coffin, faintly whispering her goodbyes. Leaning over Kylie, she moved aside the thin white veil covering her granddaughter’s face and put her hands on top of the girl’s. “Hey, baby girl,” she said as she moved closer. “I’m so, so sorry, baby girl. It seems like the Lord didn’t want you with me, baby girl. He wanted you with him, baby girl.” The Francis clan and Ms. Young were part of the Stewart family from Jamaica, a clan of more than a dozen that had become a familiar presence in a Bronx neighborhood filled with immigrants. They looked after each other for years as babysitters, hairdressers, cooks and whatever else they needed, in the century-old brick apartment building at 2363 Prospect Avenue in Belmont, just as their family had done back in Jamaica. But the world the Stewarts made for themselves here was shattered on Dec. 28, when a fire, which was started by a 3-year-old boy playing with a stove, raced through the brown-brick building. Of the five families who lost loved ones, by count, the Stewarts lost the most. The coffins inside the funeral home proved too much to bear for the relatives who filed in on Monday under an ominous sky. Loud cries and deep moans pierced the chill inside Chapel A, as relatives wondered how something so unfathomable could possibly be real. “God, what my children does do that you just wipe out the page, nothing left, not even a line?” Ms. Stewart pleaded. “Jesus, where do I go from here?” In the vestibule, her daughter Shevan Stewart, who lived on the first floor of the building, fainted, then woke up shouting, “The fire, the fire, the fire!” Her brother Rudolph said she was having flashbacks: “She tried to save them. She’s taking it very hard.” The funeral was a ritual that other families — the Donkors, the Sarkodies, the Mensahs — will endure over the coming weeks as they say goodbye to those who died in the fire. A funeral was held Sunday for the youngest victim of the fire, 7-month-old Amora Batiz, and her grandmother, Maria Batiz, 65. Andrene Paul, Ms. Stewart-Francis’s sister, set up a GoFundMe page to send the bodies back to Jamaica for burial. Ms. Stewart-Francis wanted to be buried with her father, with whom she was “joined at the hip,” Ms. Paul said. For the Stewarts, the outcome could have been even worse: They occupied five units in the Prospect Avenue building and everyone was home when the fire started. Ms. Young, who lived on the basement floor with her parents, had been visiting her aunt Karen’s fifth-floor apartment. The pair were known as the family divas, stylish and never ones to miss a nail appointment. They died with Kelesha and Kylie after being overcome by smoke in the bathroom where they sought shelter. Mr. Francis died last week after he was taken off life support. Ms. Young was “like a model,” Ms. Paul, her aunt, said, miming the way her niece walked, with a sassy swish in her hips. And Ms. Stewart-Francis, she said, behaved as if she were just as young as their niece. “She’s such a vibrant person,” Ms. Paul said. Kelesha, a student at P.S. 205 Fiorello LaGuardia in the Bronx “enjoyed playing make believe” and was “sweet and obedient,” according to an obituary. Kylie liked to make faces and was called to “the ‘happy feet’ baby that loved to shine.” Ms. Stewart-Francis was the youngest of her parents’ 13 children. Six brothers and four sisters remain. She was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, and immigrated to the United States with her father, Joseph, in 1998. Her mother had left for the United States in the 1980s, and more family followed in the 2000s. In recent years until her death, she worked as a housekeeper for a hotel in Manhattan, near the United Nations, Ms. Paul, her sister, said. Ms. Stewart-Francis met her husband while on vacation in Jamaica in 2012, according to her sister. Sparks flew and Mr. Francis later proposed to her. “She came to us and said, ‘Guess what, I’m gonna get married,’” Ms. Paul said. “She was so excited.” Kylie was born Sept. 26, 2015, and early the following year Mr. Francis and Kelesha, his daughter from a previous relationship, joined them in the Bronx after receiving a spousal visa. The couple married in May, Ms. Paul said. Mr. Francis found work hard to come by in Jamaica, his brother said, and he believed he would have better prospects in the United States — and at least he would be with his young family. His departure was bittersweet for his family, which included eight other brothers and eight sisters, his twin brother said. “We understood that he was going away for a better life, but we also didn’t want him to leave us,” Iholt Francis said. “It was a mixed feeling.” A few weeks before he died, Mr. Francis started a job sorting recyclables at Action Environmental Services, a waste-management company in the Bronx. But it was a means to an end, his brother said. Holt was saving money to go to vocational school to become an electrician. “He’s a hands-on person, so anything that involves using hands, building stuff, that’s what he was good at,” Iholt Francis said. During the funeral, he paid tribute to his brother and said that the loss left him struggling with suicidal thoughts. Mourners in the crowd pleaded, “There is hope, brother,” and “Mercy.” On Thursday, he went to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx to give doctors permission to let his brother, who had been declared brain dead, die. But before they took him off life support, Mr. Francis said he took a few moments alone with his twin. “I sat there,” Iholt Francis said. “I held his hand. I told him I loved him. Kissed him. And in that moment I just wished that it would be enough, that it would be the miracle that he needed to come back to this world. But I don’t think that he could have survived knowing his family had left this world.”",The New York Times

2018,A Few Questions for Our 52 Places Traveler,"52 Places to Go in 2018 How does Jada Yuan, who beat out 13,000 other applicants for the job, feel about spending the year traveling the globe? “Elated and terrified.” So, you are the new 52 Places to Go Traveler! How are you feeling heading into the trip? Elated and terrified — but I keep coming back to elated, which is a good thing. I’ve only been to five of the places on the list, and those are mostly in the United States. I’m so grateful to The Times for picking me to go on this crazy adventure. I’m sure I’m like a lot of people from middle- and working-class backgrounds in that I’d certainly dreamed of traveling around the world — I just never thought it would happen. I grew up in a part of New Mexico where herds of cattle would just wander into our backyard. I went straight from college to working as an editorial assistant at New York magazine, and at the time I was just throwing ideas at the wall, ready to take whatever job came my way. I never thought I’d spend 17 years falling in love with journalism and learning from some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. (Or that I’d get to hang out with Stevie Nicks.) But I also knew when I saw the 52 Places listing, that I’d found the one thing that I wouldn’t be able to turn down if I were lucky enough to get it. Tell us a little about how your professional background will be an asset. The initial job posting said The Times was looking for someone with “the ability to parachute into a place and distill its essence,” and I remember thinking, I’ve done that for years! (Had I known that 13,000 people were going to have the same reaction, I’m not sure I would have felt so confident, but it helped in the moment.) My first writing job at New York magazine was running our party coverage. That meant going to up to four events a night, walking into a strange room and trying to get interviews with whatever celebrities happened to be there. You have to think fast and you can’t have any kind of fear factor, which I hope will come in handy on the road. What tools — literal and online — are you using to prepare? As a great gift to my sanity, Kayak, the online travel aggregator, is working with The Times to handle the first draft of the itinerary, so at least I don’t have to worry about how I’m going to get everywhere or if I’m going to have a place to sleep once I do. That leaves me more time to obsess over packing and gearing up. I’ve been scouring the travel recommendations on The Wirecutter, which was my favorite consumer site before The New York Times acquired it, and The Strategist, which I’d also love even if it weren’t affiliated with New York magazine. I’ve found a lot of great blogs with recommendations, like TripSavvy, SmarterTravel, and Travel Fashion Girl, and have pulled ideas from articles by Ashlea Halpern and Paula Froelich, old work friends who both left media jobs like mine to travel the world. I’ve also had the brains of two foreign correspondent friends to pick: Heidi Vogt of The Wall Street Journal, who’s lived all over Africa and Afghanistan, and Jean Lee, who started The Associated Press’s North Korea bureau. I was just on a snowboarding trip with Jean and downloaded her brain for two hours (look out for that in a future article). What is your greatest hope for the trip? Is it too cheesy to say I hope to fall in love? It’s been a hard road as a single lady in New York and I’m basically going on the most romantic journey I could imagine. It not likely, given how little time I’ll be spending in most places, but I’m trying to head into this trip as open to whatever comes my way as possible, and I promise to write about it if it happens. I also think love could come in many unexpected forms: love of a place that I’ll want to return to once this is over; a renewed love for journalism in the expansive forms I’ll be trying; love for one’s self that comes when you’re stretched to your limits and can see your capabilities. What about your greatest fear? Other than incurring the wrath of Times commenters? Definitely getting sick and being miserable and waylaid for long enough that I mess up the whole project. Do you think you’ll make it to the final destination? Anyone who knows me would tell you that I will be there, even if I’m on crutches and harboring a tapeworm. Bring it on.",The New York Times
2018,A Film Has Inflamed Indians. But Moviegoers Mostly Say It’s Fine.,"JAIPUR, India — After months of controversy, weeks of threats and days of fiery protests, a contentious new Bollywood film hit the theaters in India on Thursday, and the reaction was: What’s the big deal? Moviegoers streamed out of heavily guarded movie theaters saying they liked the sets, the music and the grand Bollywood style of “Padmaavat,” a lavish saga about a legendary Hindu queen who may never have existed. But they couldn’t understand why so many people had violently objected to it. “It’s silly, it’s sad, it’s ironic because actually the movie presented the Rajputs in a very good light,” said Preeti Sharma, who saw the film with her husband in New Delhi on Thursday afternoon. The Rajputs, historically a caste of warriors, have been the ones most offended by the movie; Rajput activists said the movie was historically inaccurate and disrespectful. Hundreds of Rajput women even threatened to kill themselves over it (their elders eventually talked them down). On Thursday, protests erupted in different cities in India, with some tire-burning and stone-throwing, but nothing major. It seems that Rajput activists may have won this battle because their campaign of threats and intimidation succeeded in terrifying many cinema owners. In several states in northern India, which have large Rajput populations, no major cinemas dared to show the film. The controversy goes back to the 14th century — or 16th century, depending on who you ask. In 1540, the Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi wrote the epic “Padmavat” about a Hindu queen, Padmavati, so beautiful that a Muslim ruler besieges her entire kingdom to have her. Instead of submitting, Padmavati kills herself. The story was set in a Rajput kingdom in Rajasthan, in northwestern India, around 1302. But whether Padmavati actually existed is a big question. Scholars who have studied that era say they have found historical references to the Muslim ruler and the Hindu king in Jayasi’s epic — but no mention of Padmavati or a queen so beautiful that her looks started a war. That hasn’t stopped Rajput and Hindu extremists from turning “Padmaavat” into a rallying cry. Without even seeing the film, several Rajput activists complained that Padmavati’s clothes were too skimpy; a dream sequence between her and the Muslim invader was inappropriate; and the heroism of their revered queen had been cheapened. They attacked the crew of the film while it was in production and offered a bounty to behead the lead actress and director. They also threatened to cut off the actress’s nose. For weeks, anxiety over the film and a debate on artistic license has dominated Indian headlines and put the public on edge. Police officials around the country have been busing in reinforcements, and on Thursday, many cinemas were ringed by packs of officers wielding long wooden sticks, just in case there was trouble. Several schools closed on Thursday as a precaution. The day before, an angry mob of “Padmaavat” protesters, one of many across northern India, stoned a school bus full of children near New Delhi. No one was seriously hurt but video of the episode went viral, adding to the fears. On Thursday, the worst movie-related violence seemed to have erupted in Bihar, a poor state in northern India, where bands of angry young men attacked a theater, tore up posters and vandalized vehicles. Indian film critics weren’t much kinder. One called it “so superficial” and a “slog,” giving it two stars out of five. Still, “Padmaavat” had “taken an excellent opening,” according to a website that tracks box-office sales. In fact, in some places, the controversy might have even helped it gain an audience. “I was curious to see the movie because it was making lots of noise,” said K. C. Sharma, a retired army officer, who saw the movie at a theater in a shopping mall near New Delhi. He said he didn’t find anything offensive and that “all those people objecting to the film should see it.”",The New York Times
2018,A Firecracker of a Beef Rib and Other Surprises at Ferris,"Restaurant Review 10 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ferris manages to do a lot within the confines of its small space in the basement of the new Made hotel, south of Herald Square. At times it reminded me of one of those Leatherman tools that unfolds to reveal not just a knife and screwdriver but also a spoke wrench, fish scaler, eyelash curler, olive pitter, tuning fork and eel skinner. One recent night I sat at Ferris’s seven-seat kitchen counter. I didn’t realize that I was also sitting at Ferris’s bar until the bartender standing in front of me had measured my drink, strained it into a stem glass and set it on a napkin, all without moving more than one step to the right or left. She had whipped up a citrus-sheathed gin number with a rustle of Chartreuse called a 388 C, and it was about as cheerful a kickoff to the dinner hour as anything I’ve come across lately. In fact, almost all the drinks that Ferris’s bartenders stir up in about four square feet of space are smarter and more bracing than what typically comes out of a full-size bar, and often they are poured into vintage etched glasses that any neo-speakeasy would envy. The cocktails encapsulate Ferris’s most likable traits. It’s a modest restaurant that overdelivers, cares about little details and has a personal, handmade sensibility. It doesn’t quite give you the feeling of showing up at a friend’s place for dinner, but it comes closer than a lot of places where that’s the explicit aim. The illusion is aided by the carpentered interior. The single dining room, clad in raw two-by-eights, could be a suburban basement finished over the weekend by a couple with a table saw. A long cushioned bench built into one end of the room provides about half the seating, along with the stools at high tables and the counter. There’s no lobby or reception area to speak of. If you arrive by elevator you’re facing the kitchen, and if you take the stairs from the sidewalk you walk straight into the action in the dining room. Standing behind the counter and facing the customers is the chef, Greg Proechel. He is generally holding a knife and spends much of the night carving meat. His cooking has settled down since his last job, at Le Turtle, a deliberately odd French spot on Chrystie Street. There, he had some original ideas but didn’t always seem to know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones. At Ferris, his only bad idea so far is trying to make roasted sunchokes into a main course, and by the time I gave up on the plate, filled out with smoked cabbage and sauced with scallion miso, I’d decided that sunchokes themselves were more to blame than Mr. Proechel. He is on firmer ground with other vegetables: Okinawa sweet potatoes, their purple flesh mashed so it opens up to a splash of buttermilk and pumpkin mustard; or roasted beets with soft curls of fresh coconut, dressed in a dark tahini made from black sesame seeds; or charred stalks of broccolini with grapes and cashews (welcome back, cashews, we’ve missed you) scattered over a cushion of yogurt spiced with Timur pepper — a relative of the Sichuan peppercorn. Agnolotti with a buttery and nearly liquid carrot filling are one of Ferris’s more appealing main dishes; they’re tossed with braised lamb neck. Maybe they would be slightly better without chips of crunchy raw carrot on top; contrary to popular belief, not every dish needs what chefs like to call texture. Mr. Proechel has a keen sense for contrasting flavors, though. He uses red pepper and sticky grilled dates to make what has to be the most exciting blood sausage in town. A chunk of grilled mackerel that any izakaya could be proud of sits in ponzu with — surprise — plums and an egg yolk cooked so that it looks and spreads like lemon curd. If you have heard anything at all about Le Turtle, then you know about the Sasso chicken that came to the table on a bed of smoldering hay with its head and feet still attached; it tasted great even though it looked as if the fire department had arrived too late at a four-alarm blaze in a chicken coop. Nothing at Ferris makes heads swivel and nostrils twitch in quite the same way, but if it’s a table-annexing feast you want, then the côte de boeuf with “all the fixings” is the dish for you. Mr. Proechel has his own notions about “fixings.” I have never looked at a grilled beef rib and thought that what it really needed was a bowl of whipped buttermilk, but apparently he has, and I have to give him credit. Beating the buttermilk turns it into something between yogurt and whipped cream; mixing that with charred cipollini makes it into a particularly luxurious onion dip. There’s also a paste of black garlic to serve as a super-concentrated steak sauce, and a shaved brussels sprout salad for relief from the richness. The only false move here was the sodden dumplings in broth, and they were easy enough to ignore in all the excitement. The danger of putting a firecracker like that on the menu is that the half of the dining room that didn’t order it ends up staring glumly at the half that did. That was me, one night, looking at the women at the corner table who doted on their steak for an hour while I poked at my (perfectly all right) cod with clams and hazelnuts. When you are ready for something to drink with the côte de boeuf, you run into another surprise of this Swiss Army knife of a restaurant: the versatile wine list, overseen by Jenny Lakin. It’s not long, and it draws mainly from France and Italy, but it’s been carefully drafted to include relative values from expensive regions and out-and-out values from less traveled areas. Ferris doesn’t knock itself out for the dessert course. The few sweets are simple and pleasant, though, from the yuzu-lemon frozen yogurt to a dark chocolate mousse stuck with chips of jasmine meringue. Ms. Lakin’s list carries over into dessert territory with amari, absinthes, liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and other end-of-the-night shots. Where all these bottles are stored I never figured out.

2018,A Flurry of Courts Have Ruled on Election Maps. Here’s What They’ve Said.,"Updated on March 19. Judges in a number of states have recently thrown out election maps, saying that they have been gerrymandered to the point of being unconstitutional, effectively dooming one party to permanent underrepresentation. The decisions are certain to have drawn the Supreme Court’s interest as it mulls a resolution to the question of extreme partisan gerrymanders. The justices are expected to decide this spring whether the practice violates the Constitution, and if so, how to determine whether an electoral map is fairly drawn. Here are the basics of the major contested cases. How many seats does each party hold? Republican candidates received 54 percent of the vote in 2016, and won 13 of the state’s 18 seats. Democratic candidates received 46 percent of the votes and won five seats. What’s happened so far? The State Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 22 that the map “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the State Constitution and ordered the map redrawn. The Republicans who control the State Legislature asked the United States Supreme Court to block the state court’s order, but were turned down. The Republican leaders then drew a new map with less convoluted district lines than before, but Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, refused to approve it, saying it was just as severely gerrymandered for partisan advantage as the old map was. Without a new map approved by the Legislature and the governor, the court drew one of its own, which it released on Feb. 19, along with a new timetable for nominating petitions, so that the 2018 midterm elections could be conducted using the new map. Based on 2016 voting patterns, seven of the new districts would seem likely to elect Republicans, five would seem likely to elect Democrats and six appear to be competitive. Republicans tried to challenge the state court’s imposition of a new map in federal court. They were thwarted twice in a matter of hours on March 19 — first when a three-judge federal panel threw out one challenge, saying it lacked jurisdiction and the Republican state senators who brought the challenge lacked standing, and then when the United States Supreme Court rejected a separate request for it to intercede. What’s next? As things stand, the May 15 primary and Nov. 6 midterm general election for House seats will be held using the new map. The deadline for candidates to file nomination petitions for the primary is Tuesday. How many seats does each party hold? In the most recent general election, 52 percent of the votes were cast for Republican Assembly candidates, who won almost two-thirds of the seats — 64 out of 99. Democrats received 46 percent of the vote and won 35 seats. What’s happened so far? In November 2016, a panel of three judges ruled that the map was unconstitutionally drawn to favor Republicans, the first time a partisan gerrymander was struck down in federal court. The ruling was notable, according to experts, because it provided a clear mathematical formula to measure how partisan a district map is. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which took the case (known as Gill v. Whitford) and heard arguments in October 2017. What’s next? The Supreme Court is expected to rule in the spring, probably setting the course for the other cases in federal court as well. How many seats does each party hold? In 2016, Republican candidates received 53 percent of the votes cast, and won 10 of the state’s 13 seats; Democrats received 47 percent of the votes and won three seats. What’s happened so far? The map was thrown out and ordered redrawn by a panel of three federal judges on Jan. 9, who said that Republicans had drawn it most recently in 2016 in an attempt to gain a political advantage. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s order to redraw the map nine days later. What’s next? It’s unclear. The Supreme Court has not said whether it will schedule arguments in the case, known as Rucho v. Common Cause. The court may choose instead to let whatever ruling it issues in another gerrymandering case stand as its final word on the matter. Because of the temporary block, experts say the current North Carolina map will probably remain in effect for the midterm elections this fall. A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control. How many seats does each party hold? Statewide, Democrats hold seven of the state’s eight House seats, including the Sixth Congressional District, while Republicans hold one. What’s happened so far? The boundaries of the district have been the subject of legal challenges since they were drawn in 2011. In the current case, known as Benisek v. Lamone, Republicans were denied a preliminary injunction by a three-judge federal panel, and appealed that denial to the Supreme Court, which unexpectedly took the case. The plaintiffs argue that Democratic state lawmakers drew the map to place the Republican who had held the seat for 10 terms, Roscoe G. Bartlett, at a political disadvantage, violating the voters’ First Amendment rights. Mr. Bartlett was defeated in 2012. What’s next? The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case in late March. The map remains in effect for the time being.",The New York Times
2018,"Iranians, Like Their Leaders, See Foreign Hand in Protests","LONDON — Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has blamed unnamed foreign “enemies” for the antigovernment protests that have swept his country for the past week, putting the demonstrators at risk of being accused of espionage or treason. The accusation resonates for many Iranians, whose country has long been subject to foreign interference, from the American- and British-led coup in the 1950s to more recent efforts by the United States and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. President Trump’s public support for the protesters has only reinforced suspicions of a foreign hand at work. While there has been no evidence that foreign governments orchestrated the protests, several countries are now trying to decide how to support a goal they share with many of the demonstrators: a less corrupt, more democratic and more open Iranian government. The State Department urged Iran on Tuesday not to restrict access to social media services like Instagram and messaging platforms like Telegram, which the protesters have used to spread word of anti-government gatherings. It even encouraged Iranians to use virtual private networks to sidestep government censorship, advice Iranians see as interference. Diplomats and analysts said discussions were underway in the capitals of Britain, Israel and other countries on whether or how to support the demonstrators. American intelligence officials and Iran watchers say the protests appear to have started organically. The demonstrations, which are widespread and amorphous, do not match the playbook that Western intelligence agencies have used to mount covert operations in Iran — namely, sustained resource-intense operations that focus on the narrowly defined and measurable goal of sabotaging the alleged nuclear weapons program, they say. For now, they say, the evidence points to one catalyst of the unrest: widespread discontent with the government. “You don’t need Americans or Israeli or British intelligence to convince people in Iran that there is a small ruling elite that is controlling the country’s economy and ruining it,” says Meir Javedanfar, a lecturer on Iranian studies at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel. A former American intelligence official said it was implausible that a foreign agency could organize protests in dozens of cities without the Iranian government catching wind of it beforehand. Additionally, Western spy agencies are leery of operations that rely on mass demonstrations, which have a high risk of failure and cannot be easily controlled, the official said. “Certainly, the West doesn’t have the ground game to engage in that kind of activism, nor do Iran’s regional adversaries,” said Suzanne Maloney, the deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution and a former adviser to senior State Department officials on Iran. That logic has not stopped Iranian officials from pointing fingers outside their borders. On Wednesday, the government announced the arrest of an unidentified citizen of an unidentified European country who “had been trained by espionage organizations in Europe,” the Tasnim news agency reported. Iran has also accused Saudi Arabia, its main regional rival, of fomenting unrest. On Tuesday, the head of Iran’s National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, told a Lebanese television station that the Saudis were responsible for 27 percent of all anti-Iran hashtags on Twitter. “The hashtags and social media campaigns cornering the situation in Iran are all in fact being guided by Saudi Arabia, U.K., Israel and U.S.,” he said. Mr. Shamkhani offered no evidence to support his claim. Iran and Saudi Arabia are openly hostile to each other and are embroiled in opposite sides of regional power struggles in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Saudi Arabia has leveled similar accusations against Iran, accusing its Shiite Muslim government of stirring up Shiite dissidents in Sunni Muslim-governed Bahrain and in eastern Saudi Arabia. An American intelligence official disputed the Iranian claim of a Saudi hand in the protests, saying that it would be difficult for the Saudis, or their allies in the United Arab Emirates, to organize an uprising in Iran. Neither Arab country has a coterie of Persian speakers, links to a proxy opposition force, or the depth of personnel needed for such an operation, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Once protests begin, however, any number of countries could try to funnel aid to the protesters. Iranian fears of foreign intervention run deep, as far back as to Alexander the Great, who conquered what was then the Persian Empire around 330 B.C. Modern Iran’s security establishment has long held that the biggest threats to the country come from abroad; the belief that the United States wants a change in government is axiomatic. The evidence, as every Iranian schoolchild knows, is the 1953 plot by the Central Intelligence Agency, code-named Operation Ajax, that overthrew Iran’s prime minister and re-installed the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since at least 2006, the United States and its allies have undertaken a series of cyberattacks and more traditional strikes against Iranian targets to try to derail the nation’s nuclear program. The American operations, code-named Olympic Games and Nitro Zeus, succeeded in taking offline hundreds of Iranian centrifuges needed to purify uranium. In 2012, Iran’s most senior atomic energy official, Fereydoon Abbasi, said separate explosions, which he attributed to sabotage, had targeted power supplies to the country’s two main uranium enrichment facilities. Mr. Abbasi himself narrowly escaped what Iranian officials described as a foreign assassination attempt in 2010 when unidentified motorcyclists riding through downtown Tehran attached a bomb to his car. The attackers killed one scientist, a project manager for the country’s Atomic Energy Organization, Iran’s nuclear chief said at the time. Mr. Abbasi and his wife were wounded. Iran blamed the United States and Israel for those attacks. The United State denied responsibility, and Israel did not respond to the accusation. When Iran was confronted with its last major protest movement, the so-called Green Movement of 2009, the government arrested thousands of anti-government activists as well as political leaders, accusing many of them of being foreign spies. Security forces have applied the same charge to rebel groups. Jundullah, a Sunni Muslim group from Iran’s ethnic Baluch minority that has claimed responsibility for bombings that have killed dozens of people, has been accused of having ties to the Taliban, Al Qaeda and the United States. In 2010, Iranian state television broadcast a statement by a captured Jundullah leader who said he had been promised military support from the United States. The American government has denied having links with the group. The Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen Khalq, known as the MEK, leveraged its relationship with several former high-ranking Americans — such as R. James Woolsey and Porter J. Goss, former C.I.A. directors; Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director — to help overturn its listing by the State Department as a terrorist organization. Other American officials have called for Washington to support the group. Such statements fan the suspicion in Iran that any foreigner may be a spy. Dual nationals in particular have traveled to Iran to visit family members, conduct academic research or expand their businesses only to end up in jail on espionage charges. In 2017, Siamak Namazi, an oil executive, and his octogenarian Iranian-American father, Baquer, lost their appeal of a conviction for “collaborating with enemy states.” A Chinese-American student from Princeton University, Xiyue Wang, was arrested in 2016 and charged with “collaborating with foreign governments,” a charge he denies. Whether or not there is any truth to the charges, the consequences are quite real. Omid Memarian, an Iranian political analyst based in New York, says that labeling the protesters as foreign agitators and spies serves as a warning to the working-class and rural citizens who make up a large proportion of the demonstrators. “It sends the signal that it will be very costly for you to join,” he said. “It could mean years of prison, or worse.” “But it is naïve to put the blame on outside enemies,” he added. “The grievances are real. The protests are real. It shows that people have little left to lose.”",The New York Times
2018,A Garlicky Stir-Fry With Basil Leaves From Bangkok,"Eat Leela Punyaratabandhu grew up in Bangkok, in and out of her great-grandparents’ home. She didn’t live in it, not technically, but it’s where she and her cousins and uncles and aunts gathered throughout the week to eat, and read, and stay up late watching movies, so it often felt as if she did. As a child, she read books out loud in Thai while walking up and down the length of her grandmother’s back, to massage it, and her grandmother piped up occasionally to correct her pronunciation. On weekends, she walked with her grandfather to the newsstand to pick up a copy of The Bangkok Post so that they could each work on their own crossword puzzle. “I grew up surrounded by people who had that kind of mentality, that books were important, and that the preservation of tradition was important.” The kitchen was equipped with a tiny fridge, so to supplement the daily shopping, Punyaratabandhu carried a basket through the garden, picking out just enough food for the day from a tangle of edible shoots, leaves and tubers. There was neem and basil growing, chiles and mint, six kinds of eggplant, along with trees full of mangoes, bananas, papayas and jackfruit. The kitchen was traditional, which meant that it was outdoors, with a large clay stove built right into the ground. It was lit in the morning, when all the day’s cooking took place. A heavy wooden bench, about the size of a king bed, was where everyone gathered to prep the ingredients, grating coconut flesh, pounding aromatic pastes in a mortar and pestle and chopping. The kitchen belonged to Punyaratabandhu’s maternal great-grandmother, who grew up outside the city, in central Thailand. “When she married my great-grandfather, she brought a lot of traditions from up country,” said Punyaratabandhu, who sometimes found it a little embarrassing when her friends from school came over and saw the clunky, old-fashioned stove. When Punyaratabandhu broke with tradition and moved to Chicago to study philology, her mother shipped over a steady supply of Thai cookbooks, persuading friends and relatives who were making the trip to carry a few with them. “Part of her was afraid of losing her daughter, culturally,” Punyaratabandu said. “So she tried to lure me back to my roots using the thing she knew would be most powerful: food.” Over time, Punyaratabandhu became a food blogger, an author and an authority on Thai food, not only cooking but also tracing dishes through different eras, meticulously tracking their changes. What she found, time and time again, was that cooking wasn’t static. That it didn’t make sense to stubbornly romanticize a single past version. “There’s no such thing as authenticity, at least not as most people understand it,” she said. Instead, Punyaratabandhu thought of each dish as having a core set of ingredients that defined its identity, and even those sets could shift. Take, for example, the hot, garlicky stir-fry with wilted holy-basil leaves, known as phat ka-phrao. The modern Thai dish is so significant that it made the news when food vendors began packing it with vegetables, which was seen as an effort to spend a bit less on meat and increase profit margins. “It was a trending hashtag on Twitter for a long time, and everyone on my Facebook timeline was talking about it,” said Punyaratabandhu, who often cooks the stir-fry herself, at home, and never, ever adds vegetables. “You form a prototype in your mind, based on your first exposure, and anything that deviates from that is an abomination,” she said. Once, after Punyaratabandhu blogged about the stir-fry on her website, SheSimmers, readers living in Thailand wrote to her in confusion. Where was the baby corn? Where were the carrots? And where, for God’s sake, were the long beans? For many people, the set of ingredients that defined the dish had expanded. Last year, she published her version of phat ka-phrao in “Bangkok: Recipes and Stories From the Heart of Thailand.” She adapted the recipe from Soei, a family-run restaurant in the city that prepares it with sliced beef shanks and makrut lime leaves. To make it, she heats lard in a large pan and fries a paste of bird’s-eye chiles and garlic, not for long, less than a minute. Before the garlic even has a chance to brown, the meat goes in — fast-cooking tenderloin instead of shanks — and as the meat is shocked by the heat, turning glossy with fat, Punyaratabandhu adds a mix of fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce and a tiny bit of palm sugar, along with those fragrant makrut leaves, ripped into pieces. By the time she adds heaps of holy basil, which wilt almost immediately in the heat, the meat is just about cooked through, and the dish is ready to eat with hot jasmine rice, and the kitchen is filled with a cozy, familiar smell. As Punyaratabandhu points out, a lacy-edged fried egg with a soft yolk would be welcome, but there are no vegetables in sight. Recipe: Spicy Beef Stir-Fry With Basil cooking",The New York Times

RESERVOIR 13 By Jon McGregor 291 pp. Catapult. Paper, $16.95. The British novelist Jon McGregor is interested in the bystanders to public disasters — the people in the background of the television shot. He is interested not in how deeply they are affected by these events, but how slightly: how they will go on with their lives, preoccupied with their own burdens, which no one will ever see. McGregor’s fourth novel, “Reservoir 13,” begins with a telegenic tragedy: A 13-year-old girl disappears on the moor in an English village where she and her parents are vacationing for the New Year. Journalists swarm the town. The cameras capture the volunteers searching the hills, the divers searching the river. The police hold a news conference in the local pub. The girl is not found, and eventually the reporters leave. This is the only conventional plot the novel has, and it trails off quickly. But the rest of the novel asks the question: What would happen if the television cameras stayed? If they turned away from the supposedly newsworthy event, and instead zoomed in one by one on each house in the village and showed us the lives inside? Television would never do that, of course, but McGregor does. Over 13 chapters, each marking a year, he traces the lives of more than two dozen of the town’s inhabitants. There is birth, death, marriage, divorce, sex, romances kindled and snuffed out. And this is only half the action, because the turn of the seasons, the weather and the life cycles of plants and animals occupy almost as much of the narrative as the activities of the human characters do. McGregor is a beautiful, controlled writer, who can convey the pathos of a life in a few lines. Despite the large cast of characters, each feels specific and real, from the vicar, Jane Hughes, who is the closest thing this reticent town has to a therapist, to Gordon Jackson, the town’s Casanova, who, in a sympathetic twist, often seems more hopeful than his bedmates do about the possibility of a lasting relationship. McGregor captures a village culture that is simultaneously gossipy and reserved. We are frequently told a character “was seen” doing this or that, but not by whom. When a single mother moves to town with her children, we learn that “there were questions” — about her background and where the father is — “but nothing was said to her face.” When one character’s mentally ill sister is taken away in an ambulance, “nobody thought it appropriate to ask questions and he didn’t volunteer.” A widow, covered with bruises from her developmentally disabled son, flinches when anyone gently tries to probe what is going on. The only flaw in this unconventional but affecting novel is that its central metaphor — the girl’s disappearance — remains obscure. So does the symbolism of the village’s 13 reservoirs, which figure in the search and in the title, and are echoed in the girl’s age and the number of chapters. We learn that the reservoirs were created, many years before, by flooding valleys; at their bottoms are the ruins of old villages. Perhaps McGregor means for the drowned villages, like the missing girl, to represent the secrets beneath the surface of any life. Or perhaps he means for them to gesture toward the sweep of history, reminding us that the struggles that seem so momentous to one group of people will someday be forgotten. The book ends, quietly, at the close of the 13th year. A character who is bedridden by a stroke listens from his house to his neighbors singing “Silent Night” in the church, with his granddaughter performing a solo. The town takes a breath. Theirs is the calm not of life’s big questions having been answered, but of putting them temporarily aside.",The New York Times
2018,A Girl’s Killing Puts Germany’s Migration Policy on Trial,"KANDEL, Germany — It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart. The death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German. From the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year’s molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities. But the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe. Yet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe. Nevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing. Something has shifted in Germany. Not so long ago, the logistical challenge and cost of integrating new migrants still dominated the public debate. These days, the growing unease with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s migration policy has reached a new and febrile stage. “I am scared,” said Jana Weigel, a 24-year-old dental assistant, as she lit a candle outside the DM drugstore where the killing took place. Calls have multiplied for mandatory medical exams to determine the age of migrants claiming to be minors and for swifter deportations of those who — like the suspect — have been denied asylum. A preliminary coalition agreement between Ms. Merkel’s conservatives and the more liberal Social Democrats announced on Friday includes a cap of 220,000 refugees per year and strictly limits the number of family members allowed to join a refugee in Germany. Even in proudly tolerant and left-voting Kandel, the mood on the street has hardened. Many here took the killing personally. Before Mia broke up with Abdul, he had been welcomed into her family, Ms. Weigel pointed out, much like the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been welcomed to Germany. “It makes you think,” she said, “how many others will betray our hospitality.” Ms. Weigel’s sense of insecurity was reinforced by a widely publicized study showing that the number of reported crimes in the state of Lower Saxony had risen by more than 10 percent over the past two years and that the increase could be attributed overwhelmingly to cases involving refugees. Half of that increase is due to the fact that crimes involving migrants are twice as likely to be reported, the authors of the study said. Many of the people accused of crimes are young men under 30, a demographic that is most likely to commit crimes, even among Germans. Less publicized was the other major finding of the report: Over all, violent crime, including murder and rape, remains well below its 2007 peak. The number of young offenders has decreased by half since then. “The paradox is that Germany is still a very safe country, much safer than even a few years ago,” said Christian Pfeiffer, a criminologist and a co-author of the report, which was commissioned by the government and released last week. “But the perception is the opposite: People feel less safe. And when something like this murder happens, it confirms that feeling.” Ask the Germans paying their respects at the ad hoc memorial for the girl who was killed — a sea of candles and messages and photos of her with friends — and they will reel off a list of crimes committed by migrants: a German woman who was raped by a Sudanese migrant in the nearby town of Speyer a few days earlier, another woman who was raped and strangled by an Afghan in Freiburg just over a year ago. Ms. Weigel, who has a 2-year-old daughter, no longer leaves the house after dark. Last month, a terrorist attack was narrowly foiled at an ice rink in Karlsruhe, a 30-minute drive away. “It feels like we’ve lost control,” Ms. Weigel said. “The state has lost control.” Kandel is an orderly town of tastefully restored medieval houses and shops that close for lunch. It is also home to 125 refugees, most of them from Syria or Afghanistan. Until Mia was killed, “there was never a problem,” said Günther Tielebörger, Kandel’s mayor. He represents the Social Democrats, long the strongest party in the town. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, received less than 10 percent of the vote in the last election. Kandel has a long tradition of tolerance. Three centuries ago, it welcomed Huguenot refugees from France. Where other villages in the region built a wall inside their churches to keep Catholics and Protestants apart, Kandel ripped down its wall and shared the church. One of the best restaurants in town serving regional specialties like “pig’s stomach” is run by a Turk. But this tolerance is now being tested. Maja Mathias, 53, works in a local French bakery and has Turkish neighbors and a Croatian brother-in-law. “I have no problem with foreigners,” she said, standing behind a counter featuring freshly baked baguettes and pretzels. “But there is always the fear: What else is coming?” Beyond fear, the killing has stirred other resentments. “German retirees who have worked hard for 45 years get less than the refugees,” said Knoll Pede, 64, a town maintenance worker. He is no fan of President Trump, he said, “but I wouldn’t mind our politicians to do a bit of ‘Germany First.’” Such talk worries Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor. The benefits migrants receive are far less generous than Germans may believe, he said, and many of the migrants are barred from work until their asylum applications have been processed. But the optics matter. “Germans feel neglected,” Mr. Tielebörger said. “We need to wake up,” he said. Otherwise, he added, the left will lose votes to the right. One of Mr. Tielebörger’s former colleagues in local government is Heiko Wildberg, a former member of the liberal pro-immigration Greens party. Mr. Wildberg is now a lawmaker for the nationalist AfD in Berlin. For him, Mia’s killing was a “turning point.” “This is not Berlin or Cologne; we are in small-town Germany,” he said. “This murder shows that the reality of the migrant crisis has arrived in the German province.” The AfD was quick off the mark, organizing a silent march through Kandel two days after the killing. The more extremist National Party of Germany followed suit. Meanwhile, the local benefits office in Kandel had to barricade its doors because its employees had received so many threats. “Accomplices,” anonymous messages called them. Some here accuse the authorities of not doing enough to protect Mia. Abdul had stalked her online and in person and beaten up one of her classmates in a fit of jealousy. On Dec. 15, her parents had reported him to the police. Twelve days later, as she was shopping with friends, he stabbed her repeatedly with a knife he had bought in a supermarket next door. She later died of her wounds. After her father told the German tabloid Bild that her ex-boyfriend “was definitely not 15,” demands for medical exams to verify the claims of refugees who say they are minors have been revived. The ethics commission of the body representing Germany’s doctors has said that such tests — which include X-rays of hand, collar and jaw bones as well as genital exams — violate “bodily integrity” and can be inaccurate by up to two years. They have nonetheless become a rallying cry at the highest level of politics. “In all cases, where no official and real document is presented, we need to determine the age in another way, if needed through medical examinations,” said the conservative interior minister, Thomas de Maizière. When Abdul arrived in Germany in April 2016, he said he was 14, and apparently none of the officials registering him raised serious doubts about his age. As part of the court case against him, a series of medical exams will now seek to confirm his age. Austria, Sweden and the German state of Saarland are among the places conducting such exams regularly. There is an incentive for migrants to be listed as under 18. Government benefits, access to German lessons and job opportunities are better for minors. In Saarland, more than a third of the migrants who were tested appeared to be over 18. Most of the unaccompanied-minor migrants are integrating well, said Anne Spiegel, the integration minister for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which includes Kandel. “They are attending school, learning German and signing up for apprenticeships,” she said. Still, officials like Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor, say that every transgression by a migrant gets disproportionate attention, leading to the opposite impression. There was another shocking homicide in Kandel in recent weeks, he pointed out. A man killed his wife and two children. That one did not make the national news. “If the boy had been German,” Mr. Tielebörger said, “we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”",The New York Times
2018,A Glasses Menagerie,"Neighborhood Joint Clairmont Nichols Opticians had just opened its doors on a recent Monday and already the green-carpeted, airy flagship store in Midtown East was full of customers. Some were in to pick up their glasses, assembled in the back laboratory, while others needed to get their frames adjusted. As the phone continually rang (and was answered, until it rang again), four opticians tended to customers at cherry wood desks. Beulah Clarke, a 30-year employee, used a soft cloth to clean the hundreds of glasses on display. Opticians took turns at a stately marble reception desk near the front of the store to call customers about orders or appointments. In the days of Warby Parker modernity and ordering contacts online with little human interaction, this scene almost looks like it’s out of a period movie. Nicholas de Liagre, who lives nearby, walked over to the desk where the co-owner and optician Scott F. Malsin, 30, was sitting. Somewhat distressed, Mr. de Liagre relayed the story of how he accidentally sat on his glasses. “I wish I could blame somebody else for the fact that they’re bent, but I can’t,” he said. “Don’t worry — they’re very easy to fix,” Mr. Malsin assured him, before heading to the back lab with the frames. Five minutes later, he re-emerged with the glasses. “These fit perfectly,” Mr. de Liagre said. The fix was on the house. Clairmont Nichols patrons, even first-timers, generally aren’t charged for repairs or cleanings. “I come here because the customer service is impeccable, and they have integrity,” said Mr. de Liagre, who has been a regular for 20 years. The business has been around and thriving since 1885, when it was started by two optometrists, Clairmont and Nichols (their full names are a mystery, as is the original location). The store moved around Manhattan several times before landing at its current address, 1016 First Avenue, in the early 1960s. Here, three businessmen with no knowledge of eye care bought the enterprise and hired an optician, Mac Malsin, Mr. Malsin’s grandfather, to run the show. At the time, Mac’s son and Scott’s father, Lloyd A. Malsin, was working with a group of eye surgeons, but by 1980, he had saved up enough money to buy Clairmont Nichols from the three men. Today, Lloyd, who is now 61, and Scott Malsin own and oversee the business, and although they have two smaller locations, on Madison Avenue and in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., they’re both based at First Avenue. The flagship store also sells binoculars and telescopes, which is a remnant from an earlier era. Though this part of the business has grown smaller over the years, Scott said that some shoppers still request telescopes for their apartments or binoculars if they are going on a safari. Helping whoever enters the store, even if the person is not buying, is an ingrained part of the work ethic here. “We can have 10 interactions in a row that are not revenue generating,” Scott said. “Nobody works on commission.” As a tourist was leaving who had been given a replacement contact lens case after losing one, Babette Sommer, of Forest Hills, Queens, entered. She was greeted with a chorus of hellos from the staff. “When it comes to any of my eyeglass needs, this is the only place,” Ms. Sommer, a customer of four years, said. But it seemed as if she mostly wanted to chat, sharing the stories of her stressful kitchen repairs and the tooth she had recently lost. She visits regularly, she said, for eyeglass adjustments and other needs. But “I also come whenever I need cheering up.”",The New York Times
2018,A Go-To Grocery for Indian Cooks,"Neighborhood Joint Kavita and Prakash Rudra, of Bangalore, India, strolled the aisles of New Foods of India on a brisk winter afternoon, selecting the ingredients they would need for a home-cooked Indian meal. Tourists on a two-week vacation in the city, the Rudras suddenly had developed a craving for daal and lemon rice. They planned to cook in their rented Brooklyn apartment. “We had heard from friends and also read online that this was the grocery store to buy everything we needed to cook good Indian food,” Ms. Rudra said. As first-time shoppers at the store, located at Lexington Avenue and 28th Street — a small area in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan known as “Little India” — the Rudras were an anomaly; most customers are longtime regulars. Arun Sinha opened the store in 1972. Ever since, the business has had a strong base of loyal customers — an equal mix of Indian and non-Indian — who now depend on the niche products. At first, Mr. Sinha only sold a small selection of goods from India, such as lentils and spices, but he expanded his offerings over the years to include products from the Middle East and South Asia, as well as Mexico, England and Australia. By the time current co-owners Mohammed Alam, 52, and Hakim Khan, 64, bought New Foods of India from Mr. Sinha in 2012 (Mr. Sinha still owns the building), there were more than 50 kinds of teas from around the world, at least 10 varieties of basmati rice, including aged and extra-long, and well over 70 types of lentils. Several shelves in the front are filled with hot sauces and pickles, while others offer Indian toiletries such as sandalwood soap and coconut hair oil. There also sell homemade rotis, made by Indian women in Queens. Using their own kitchens, the women make the flatbreads daily — fenugreek, potato, plain and corn are among the options — and then deliver the rotis to the store. The same women also make Indian sweets, called mithais, which you can find behind the glass case near the door. Mr. Alam and his staff often insist that visitors enjoy a free treat like chocolate barfi, condensed milk mixed with chocolate, or jalebis, deep fried rice flour coated in a sugary syrup, while they shop. “I want my customers to feel welcome and offering mithai is a way to show hospitality,” Mr. Alam said. As the Rudras left with their free treats, M.D. Hossain, a Financial District resident and customer for more than five years, walked in. Sometimes Mr. Hossain stops in to pick up a sweet or specialty vegetable such as bitter gourd or okra, but today, he was doing his monthly shopping for basics like basmati rice, cardamom tea and lemon and mango chutney. Originally from Bangladesh, Mr. Hossain said that being in New Foods of India gives him a taste of home. “It’s not just a grocery store,” he said. “This place has a lot of warmth.” As the afternoon turned to evening, the store got busier. Several women — none of them Indian — came to buy kajal eye pencils, and at least a half dozen customers stocked up on packets of rotis. Nicola Harrison, a personal stylist who lives in the East Village, was in with her son, Christopher, 9, to buy products from her native England such as digestive biscuits, PG Tips tea and gravy granules. “This is where I come whenever I need English groceries,” she said. “It’s reliable and a fun trip for us to make.”",The New York Times
2018,A Golden Globes Draped in Black Addresses #MeToo,"Golden Globes Briefing • “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” won best movie drama, and “Lady Bird” won best comedy. Frances McDormand and Gary Oldman won the best acting prizes for drama; Saoirse Ronan and James Franco won for comedy. See all the Golden Globes winners. • Oprah Winfrey received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. Her speech focused on the #MeToo movement. • The show began with a monologue from Seth Meyers, the host, who took aim at Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and others. 56 Photos View Slide Show › BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — It took only four minutes for Harvey Weinstein to be booed on Sunday night at the 75th Golden Globes. From there, the Hollywood establishment, convening publicly for the first time since allegations of sexual misconduct toppled Mr. Weinstein, used the Globes to insist that it would reform itself — that the harassment of women would no longer be tolerated, that the culture of silence that aided and abetted men like Mr. Weinstein was over, that women and men would be paid equally. Seth Meyers, hosting the Globes, turned directly to what he called “the elephant not in the room” when he opened the NBC broadcast by saying, “Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.” “There’s a new era underway,” he continued, “and I can tell because it’s been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood.” Mr. Meyers prompted the booing of Mr. Weinstein with a joke about the deaths section of the Oscars telecast. “Harvey Weinstein isn’t here tonight because, well, I’ve heard rumors that he’s crazy and difficult to work with,” Mr. Meyers said. “But don’t worry, he’ll be back in 20 years when he becomes the first person ever booed during the ‘In Memoriam.’” The Globes soon moved on to celebrating films and television series about women. “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a mother (Frances McDormand) who takes her daughter’s murder investigation into her own hands, emerged as the movie to beat in the coming Oscar race, winning four Globes, including ones for best drama and Ms. McDormand’s acting. Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” a coming-of-age tale set in Sacramento, was honored with prizes for best comedy and Saoirse Ronan’s acting. The major TV winners were the HBO series “Big Little Lies,” which received four Globes, including awards for Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern; “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” a new Amazon series that collected two prizes, including best TV comedy; and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which received two Globes, including best TV drama. “A new day is on the horizon!” Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, shouted toward the end of her eight-minute speech, which focused mostly on the #MeToo movement, noting that it was brought forth by the “insatiable dedication” of journalists and women, like the recently deceased Recy Taylor, who have spoken up to tell their stories. “When that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men,” Ms. Winfrey said. She received multiple standing ovations — some people stayed standing as she spoke — and finished her comments with an assertion of hope, looking forward to “the day when nobody ever has to say ‘Me too’ again.” Here’s a guide to the Golden Globes nominees that are both streamable and worth your time from Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site. After Ms. Winfrey exited the stage, Natalie Portman arrived to present the award for best director. “Here are the all-male nominees,” Ms. Portman said. (Guillermo del Toro won for “The Shape of Water.”) For some people watching at home, the pronouncements struck a hypocritical note. Weren’t some of these people the same ones who had been silent about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior for decades? And Ms. Winfrey, of course, was accepting an award named for a man who had helped cement a culture of male domination in Hollywood. It was also notable that many of the men who won awards did not mention the current reckoning that Hollywood is undergoing regarding sexual harassment and the role of women in entertainment. The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, and that was the case on Sunday. Gary Oldman won best actor in a drama, for playing Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.” Pixar’s “Coco” was named best animated film. And the figure-skating dark comedy “I, Tonya” was recognized with Allison Janney’s win for best supporting actress. But several movies received nothing, most notably Steven Spielberg’s newspaper drama “The Post,” which was nominated for six prizes. “Call Me by Your Name,” “Get Out,” “Mudbound” and “All the Money in the World” were also ignored. James Franco won best actor in a comedy for “The Disaster Artist,” a biopic about Tommy Wiseau, an eccentric Hollywood figure best known for his cult film “The Room.” Mr. Wiseau, who had been sitting in the ballroom in wraparound blue sunglasses and looking at his phone, sauntered to the stage, where a hoarse Mr. Franco was espousing his love for his brother, Dave Franco, who also stars in “The Disaster Artist.” Standing nearby, the younger Franco got a little teary. The night’s first award went to Ms. Kidman, who won best actress in a television movie or limited series. “Power of women!” she said, holding up her Globe and name checking her female co-stars. Ms. Kidman won for her role in “Big Little Lies,” in which she plays a battered wife who summons the courage to leave her husband. Her co-star Alexander Skarsgard won for best supporting actor, and the show won for best limited series or TV movie. As expected, Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel about the repression of women, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” matched its best drama win last year at the Emmy Awards. Elisabeth Moss, who stars in that series, also repeated her Emmys win, collecting the trophy for best actress in a drama. The “This Is Us” star Sterling K. Brown was named best dramatic actor, the first time in Globes history that a black man had won that prize. “You wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,” Mr. Brown said in his speech, thanking the “This Is Us” creator, Dan Fogelman, for creating his part. “I am being seen for who I am, and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me.” (It was a reminder of how much has changed in Hollywood in recent months. Kevin Spacey won the category at the 72nd ceremony for his performance in “House of Cards,” a series that fired him late last year after men came forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances.) The Amazon series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a perfectionist 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic, won the Globe for best TV comedy, and its star, Rachel Brosnahan, collected the trophy for best actress in a comedy. “Their support was completely unwavering,” Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show’s creator, said of Amazon from the stage while wearing a top hat festooned with feathers. She made no mention of Roy Price, who had helped push forward the series before resigning in October following accusations of sexual harassment. The Globes were draped in black, quite literally, with actresses and some actors vowing to use their attire to make a statement about sexual harassment in Hollywood and other spheres. Winners were expected to use their moments of glory to rail against the systemic sexism and silence that allowed the behavior of men like Mr. Weinstein, James Toback, Louis C.K. and Mr. Spacey to fester for decades. On the red carpet, eight actresses walked hand in hand with activists who focus on sexual harassment and gender inequality. “We don’t want to create hierarchies — saying that women in Hollywood are more important than other women,” Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a British network of organizations dedicated to ending violence against black women, said on the E! arrivals special. “We have a platform, and we’re trying to use it in the best way we possibly can.” Ms. Larasi attended as Emma Watson’s guest. But the tone on the red carpet was not entirely serious. Smiles abounded. Along with discussion about women’s rights came lighthearted banter by nominees about butterflies (the stomach variety) and some of the usual fashion chitchat. Alexis Bledel carried a black crystal clutch from Onna Ehrlich; Gucci dressed Margot Robbie and Dakota Johnson. And inside the ballroom, the ceremony in many ways felt like business as usual. Stars, producers and studio executives schmoozed in frantic fashion during the commercial breaks and straight through some awards. The vibe even approached easygoing and carefree — as if Hollywood felt it had exculpated itself with all of the serious talk on the red carpet and the sharp-edged jokes Mr. Meyers cracked during his monologue.",The New York Times
2018,A Great Fear of Shallow Living,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — A crossword with this much wide-open white space might be intimidating to some solvers, but here’s a tip for forging ahead: Ignore the longer entries for now (unless you know them outright, of course), and focus on the shorter entries. Looking for a way in? Try BMI at 34A, clued as “Song royalties org.” It can’t be ASCAP, because we have only three squares. So salt that in. At 37A, the editors show us some mercy with “Standard & Poor’s.” That gave me BONITA and SMOOTHS. Skipping up to the top of the grid, I got ON TV, ODIST, ALKALIS (I knew to think of chemical bases primarily because of the question mark in the clue), and OTTER. You could also write in SITU at 39A, if you know that one. What surprises me about Alex Vratsanos’s grid is the amount of material that can be considered “older,” like the comic strip character Blondie’s maiden name (BOOPADOOP), Howdy Doody and other MARIONETTES. Even SISTER SOULJAH’s recording days — she continues to be a community activist — were more than 20 years ago. But that’s the thing about late week puzzles. You will dive deep into pop culture, history, science, theater and many other subjects. No need to worry about shallowness here. So, we have some good stuff in here — I liked BOOP A DOOP, BIG TICKET ITEM, MAJORITY RULES, TEXAS SIZE, PACHINKO, SISTER SOULJAH, BOSTON CREAM and PANNED OUT — and some very tough stuff in here. Mr. Vratsanos’s puzzle gave me quite a run for my money, but I stuck with it and eventually completed the puzzle. But it wasn’t easy. Did you stick with it, or are you putting it aside until you can reboot your brain? There is a lot of general knowledge in here today and that’s hard enough, but I’m going to go through the ones that really took me down. In my opinion, these were wordplay on crack. 14A: “Sly remarks?” is YOS, because Sly Stallone (“Yo, Adrienne!”) 21A: I will freely admit that I thought that “Pomeriggio” was some kind of cheese, because I am an idiot. You can imagine that I had no idea what to do with what “followed” the alleged cheese. It turns out that “pomeriggio” means “afternoon” in Italian, and SERA means “evening,” which follows afternoon. Live and learn. 11D: I’ve signed RELEASEs and I have signed WAIVERs. I have never signed a RELEASE WAIVER. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, mind you. But it sounds as if it comes from the Department of Redundancy Department. 19D: “Files away?” sounds as if someone is smoothing or planing something, but today all he or she is doing is throwing files away. The answer is DELETES. 46D: O.K., this one made me crazy. “Gray head?” is LEE, and before you go and Google a person named LEE Gray, allow me to remind you about General Robert E. LEE, who was the head of the Confederate Army. They wore gray uniforms. You’re welcome. Oh, sorry. Obligatory OTTER video: Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2018,"A Greener, More Healthful Place to Work","Entering the offices of CookFox architects in Manhattan, you can almost leave the city behind. The horseshoe-shaped work pods are plant-fringed havens, warmly lit by the late afternoon light. Terraces on three sides of the office are planted with native trees, vines and grasses and replete with bee apiaries that are tended by the employees, who are encouraged to work outdoors in season. This unusual Midtown workplace, at 250 West 57th Street, was designed to be a showcase for a new kind of green building inspired by what architects call “biophilic design.” The term, from the Greek for “love of living things,” was popularized by the Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson, who argues that humans are hard-wired by our evolutionary biology to be emotionally attracted to the natural world. Advocates of biophilic design say that to be called green, a building needs to do more than just use energy efficiently and have a minimal carbon footprint. Rather, it needs to be a health-promoting place for the people who live and work there. CookFox projects have included the iconic Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park, which incorporates features like planted green walls and a wealth of natural materials. But the point is not just to spruce up urban offices with splashes of green, says the firm’s co-founder, Richard Cook. It is to use principles of natural design to help bring the health benefits of the outdoors indoors. Americans spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors. Until recently, little was known about how this was impacting us. But evidence is now mounting that we are paying a physiological price for spending all those hours cooped up unnaturally within four walls. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol tend to be higher in enclosed spaces like office cubicles that are artificially lit and deprived of outside views. Poor ventilation — which is common in many older office buildings — raises the levels of carbon dioxide, which studies have shown can impair cognitive performance and dampen mood. Design that ignores the natural requirements of the human body is to blame, says Judith Heerwagen, an environmental psychologist who has studied workplaces and their impact around the United States. “More time and creativity has gone into designing natural habitats for zoo animals,” she observed in an online post, “than in creating comfortable office spaces for humans.” But that is changing. Dr. Heerwagen, who now works for the United States General Services Administration in Washington, has helped the agency plan government buildings that include green roofs and atriums, as well as day-lit offices with expansive views of the outdoors. It is also designing spaces that encourage employees to move around and engage with one another — adding healthy exercise to work days spent largely sitting behind a desk. Architecture with our biology in mind pays off in fewer sick days and better work performance, according to Mr. Cook. “We know that we lower absenteeism and what we call presenteeism — people showing up but not being there — by careful design,” he said. “As increasingly science backs this up, it will become very easy to get people to pay for it.” And the science of healthy buildings continues to advance. Research by an international team in 2014 showed that people who worked in offices with leafy green plants concentrated better and were 15 percent more productive than those who went about their day in spartan offices without them. And a study of hospitals by the architectural expert Roger Ulrich found that patients whose windows looked out on views of nature needed less pain medication and were released from the hospital on average about a day earlier than those whose rooms faced a bare brick wall. Another study of 21,000 elementary school students in several Western states conducted by an energy consultancy firm, the Heschong Mahone Group, found that children in naturally lit classrooms scored over 20 percent higher on tests than those in artificially lit rooms. Good light also helps keep office workers alert and healthy, said Mariana Figueiro, the director of the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Too many offices are like floodlit caves, illuminated from above to cast light on the work surface of the desk, Dr. Figueiro said. We also need light from the side striking the back of the eye — preferably from a natural source like a window — to entrain our body’s internal circadian clock. People who are deprived of this physiologically critical light can become lethargic during the daytime and experience sleep problems at night. Research has shown the disruption of our circadian system can contribute to illnesses like depression and, over the long term, increase the risk of heart disease and even breast cancer. Exposure to natural daylight is always best, says Dr. Figueiro. But when that is not available, good quality artificial light — bluish light in the morning, and warmer yellowish light in the afternoon — to simulate what is happening outdoors will do. Some indoor lighting systems can now be programmed to mimic this natural cycle, adjusting light color and intensity to the time of the day. Equally important as the right kind of light is fresh air, says Joseph Allen, the founder of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. Dr. Allen, who has conducted hundreds of forensic investigations on so-called “sick buildings,” says that 90 percent of these unhealthy places suffer from inadequate ventilation. In one study conducted by Dr. Allen and his colleagues, people in properly ventilated buildings did twice as well on tests of cognitive performance and decision-making as those in poorly ventilated buildings. “We all know what it’s like in a stuffy conference room,” Dr. Allen said. “People are tired and distracted. You can just feel it when the fresh air comes in, it’s incredibly rejuvenating.” He believes that the buildup of carbon dioxide levels indoors may depress certain brain functions, although research still needs to be done. The CookFox architectural studio has air monitors in its office, and fresh air is pumped into spaces when carbon dioxide and pollutant levels become too high. Lower-tech solutions like opening a window can also help. Efforts are currently underway to quantify the effects of biophilic design. Dr. Allen’s group is using virtual reality to test people’s heart rate variability and stress levels in a variety of simulated indoor environments. Researchers at Columbia University’s Cloud lab are planning to partner with the New York-based environmental consultancy firm Terrapin Bright Green in a study that will employ electroencephalography, or EEG machines, to monitor the neurological impact of green design on people in hotel lobbies. It is a paradox that modern technology is helping to return us to the wisdom of nature, Mr. Cook said. He cautioned, however, that, it’s easy to get excited about natural design and forget our moral and ethical obligation to address climate change. “We don’t just want more beautiful buildings and better health,” he said. “The health benefits and the energy reductions are going to need to go hand in hand.”",The New York Times

2018,A Gumbo of Crime: From the Bayou to Britain,"Crime James Lee Burke is what fellow writers call a wordsmith. He can make your eyes water with a lyrical description of tropical rain falling on a Louisiana bayou: “I love the mist hanging in the trees,” he tells us in ROBICHEAUX (Simon & Schuster, $27.99), “a hint of wraiths that would not let heavy stones weigh them down in their graves, the raindrops clicking on the lily pads, the fish rising as though in celebration.” But in the next breath, he’ll offer a comprehensive account of an excruciating death by torture: “The guy who did him took his time.” And to satisfy our appetite for Southern eccentricity, he’ll introduce us to great characters like Baby Cakes Babineau and Pookie the Possum Domingue. Dave Robicheaux, the narrator of this robust regional series, is an Iberia Parish sheriff’s detective with the melancholy air of a man who occasionally sees the hollow-eyed ghosts of the Confederate dead. Haunted by his own violent past, Robicheaux keeps trying to redeem himself through good works; but when he falls off the wagon, as he does here in a spectacular way, he thinks he might be capable of committing murder. But he’s not in the same class as a contract killer named Chester Wimple (“Sometimes people call me Smiley”). Like most of Burke’s plots, this one has roots in Louisiana history, a gumbo of “misogamy and racism and homophobia,” not to mention “demagoguery” and “self-congratulatory ignorance.” Mob figures like Fat Tony Nemo look tough, but they have nothing on up-and-coming politicians like Jimmy Nightingale, eager to follow in the footsteps of his flamboyantly crooked predecessors. Burke has no inclination to romanticize gangsters, no matter how well groomed: “They were brutal, stupid to the core, and had the visceral instincts of medieval peasants armed with pitchforks.” Rather, he pays homage to the fallen dead like Lt. Robert S. Broussard, a Civil War hero whose sword gets into the hands of a crime boss. In rescuing this artifact, Robicheaux bares his bleeding heart for “La Louisiane, the love of my life, the home of Jolie Blon and Evangeline and the Great Whore of Babylon, the place for which I would die.” ♦ Witty, stylish and a bit of a rogue — that’s what people said about Richard Nash, known as Beau, the notorious dandy who transformed the English city of Bath into “the 18th-century equivalent of Vegas.” The same might be said of Peter Lovesey, whose elegant mysteries pay tribute to the past glories of this beautiful city. In BEAU DEATH (Soho Crime, $27.95), a demolition crew unearths the remains of a bewigged gentleman in period dress, setting off gossip that Nash has been found — murdered. Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond accepts this theory until he discovers the desiccated corpse was wearing modern-day underwear. There’s always a whiff of Restoration comedy about Lovesey’s cunning plots, which make a point of featuring shrewd women like the drolly named Georgina Dallymore, whose ample comedic gifts make her a figure fit for a Congreve comedy and the perfect companion for Diamond. ♦ If you find it significant that tortellini can be easier to eat than linguine or fettuccine, THE BODY IN THE CASKET (Morrow, $25.99) is your kind of mystery. Katherine Hall Page, who has written almost two dozen culinary mysteries, has come up with another smart twist on her cozy formula featuring Faith Fairchild, a minister’s wife and keen-eyed amateur detective from suburban Massachusetts. Faith’s catering firm, Have Faith in Your Kitchen, has been hired for a weekend party by Max Dane, a once-famous Broadway producer celebrating his 70th birthday. But what he really wants to hire is Faith’s sleuthing talent, because he strongly suspects that one of his guests wants to kill him. The mechanics of the murder mystery are well set up and executed, but what you’re hungry for is what’s on the menu. This time, Faith is starting off with “Fallen Angel” cocktails, then moving along to deviled eggs and an apple-potato dish called “Himmel und Erde.” The main course, lobster pasta fra diavolo, is followed by an angel food cake, from a recipe that calls for “nine large eggs” and a mountain of sugar. Sounds divine. ♦ Where better to set a gangster novel than big, bad, brawling Chicago during Prohibition? The way Ray Celestin tells it in DEAD MAN’S BLUES (Pegasus Crime, $25.95), everyone in the city was corrupt, from the mayor, Big Bill Thompson, to the 25,000 soda shop owners who ran speakeasies in their back rooms. The most colorful characters were mobsters like Al Capone and his rival, Bugs Moran, so-called because he was certifiably “buggy, crazy, homicidally violent and not very clever.” As he did in his first novel, “The Axeman,” which was set in New Orleans, Celestin perfectly captures the jazzy street rhythms of this proudly pugnacious city and its peculiar characters. His authorial gaze encompasses everything from a flower-festooned gangster’s funeral (with “a casket costing more than most people’s houses”) to a golf game featuring Capone; his hit man, Machine Gun Jack McGurn; and the mayor of suburban Burnham. Which is a lot funnier than the funeral.",The New York Times
2018,A Gym Chain Is Banning Cable News. It’s for Your Health.,"Go to the gym and you will see them everywhere: the talking heads on CNN and Fox News, as ubiquitous as sports coverage in bars. But one fitness chain has cut them off, implying that cable news coverage is not conducive to a “healthy way of life.” Life Time, a Minnesota-based company with 130 locations in 27 states, decided recently to remove cable news — both left- and right-leaning stations, including CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — from the large-screen TVs in its gyms. The new policy took effect this month. The decision “was based on many member requests received over time across the country, and in keeping with our overall healthy way of life philosophy and commitment to provide family-oriented environments free of polarizing or politically charged content,” Natalie Bushaw, a Life Time spokeswoman, said in an email. She added that local news stations would still be shown. An official statement posted on Twitter last week drew a response as polarized as the political content on the discarded channels. Some people praised the removal of what they described as a source of “negativity,” and thanked Life Time for making it easier to use the gym as an escape from the world. But many others expressed anger and accused the company of censorship. Members who object to particular programming can simply choose not to watch the screens playing it, they said. Uchechi Egbuchulam, a gym member in Massachusetts, said in an interview on Tuesday that the move fit with Life Time’s brand, which emphasizes that health is about the mind as well as the body. The news can be upsetting and stressful, and “when you want to work on changing your mentality,” she said, “having that on 12 different televisions while you’re trying to run on the treadmill is not the most conducive.” “I think they’re looking out for everybody’s well-being and truly thinking about the words that they say as a brand,” Ms. Egbuchulam said. “They’re providing opportunities for people to take care of their whole self. This is one way that they’re choosing to do that as a company.” But Bryan Sieve, a member for more than 10 years, said the change hurt his ability to manage his time and had stirred up “a hornet’s nest” at the branch he goes to in Maple Grove, Minn. As a businessman with a full schedule, he said, it is important for him to multitask during his morning workout, and he enjoyed the large selection of channels on his gym’s TV screens. The company gave no public notice before making the change, he added. Mr. Sieve said that he would switch to a competitor if the cable news channels were not restored by the end of the month, and that he had told the Maple Grove manager as much. “I’ve never seen anybody complain about this, none ever in our club,” he said. “Who are these faceless people that all of a sudden have huge sway over changing a policy at Life Time Fitness without member input, consent or even fair warning?” Ms. Bushaw, the company spokeswoman, declined to say how many members had requested the change, but wrote: “Suffice it to say, this has been a growing issue over years, not weeks or months. Ultimately, we believe this change is consistent with the desires of the overall membership.” She noted that the channels in question were still available on smaller screens installed in some cardio machines — a feature she said was being added at more clubs. Members can also use their gym’s Wi-Fi to watch shows on personal devices, she said. Jennifer Berlanga, a Life Time member in Dallas, called that a reasonable balance. “I think giving members the choice to watch it on their cardio station or personal devices is a great way to compromise between those who want nonstop news and those who don’t,” Ms. Berlanga wrote on Twitter. For her, she said, “it will be nice to enter the cardio room without the barrage from both sides.” Asked about this option, Mr. Sieve called it “hogwash.” He does not want to carry his iPad or phone around the gym, he said, and none of the cardio machines at the Maple Grove facility have built-in screens. Even if they did, he added, those screens would not be useful when he lifts weights or uses noncardio machines. In a video message on Twitter, Irene Kistler, a school librarian in Texas, criticized the decision in much grander terms. “Don’t be afraid of democracy,” Ms. Kistler said. “Put the news back on. Banning the news is really kind of un-American.” Few, if any, other major fitness chains in the United States have taken similar steps. Representatives of several companies did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday afternoon. But McCall Gosselin, a spokeswoman for Planet Fitness, said the issue had “never come up.” No Planet Fitness members have complained about the presence of cable news in their gyms, she said.",The New York Times
2018,A Haven From Mexico’s Political Parties Hints at Their Decline,"The Interpreter Earlier this month, we published an article on Mexican towns and cities that are dealing with public corruption and record violence by effectively seceding from the state. But we wanted to elaborate more on this story, to recount what it was like to report on each town, which we visited last year, and offer our thoughts on its larger lessons for Mexico and the world. This is the second of a three-part series that originally appeared in our Interpreter newsletter. The third will publish later this month. So sign up the Interpreter newsletter here, and let us know what you think: interpreter@nytimes.com. When we talk to political scientists who study American democracy about what worries them most — and they worry about many things these days — their answer is often political parties. Whatever you think of President Trump, they argue, he has exposed the frailty of the Republican Party, which tried and failed to stop his nomination. The party has since bent on core issues, especially those related to the Russia investigation. Both the Republican and the Democratic parties, scholars argue, have grown dangerously weak, unable to play their informal but crucial role as institutional checks on power; as guardrails of democracy. That was on our minds when we arrived in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, a million-person suburb of Mexico City, which has effectively seceded from Mexico’s party system. Neza, as it is known, is gritty and working class, a sprawl of short concrete buildings. But it is a quiet success story. As crime and corruption skyrocket nationally, especially in surrounding areas, they’ve remained stable or even declined here. When we asked Neza locals and officials how they did it, they pointed to Jorge Amador, the police chief who looks and talks as if he wandered into the job after getting lost on his way to a faculty meeting. Mr. Amador, whose background is in sociology and water management, imposed policy changes that, sweeping and sometimes eccentric, might be impossible elsewhere. He set up literature programs and chess classes. He restructured the force to emphasize community engagement. He fired 100-plus officers suspected of corruption or brutality. So was Mr. Amador the key to Neza’s success? After some time in Neza (and a lot of time with Mexican academics), we came to a different conclusion. Or, at least, a broader one. Neza’s secret was breaking from the Mexican party system, which is what made Mr. Amador’s hiring and reforms possible. Mexico’s establishment political parties are beyond troubled. They are a dangerous combination of superstrong — they are tightly controlled institutions that have few career civil servants — and super-weak. They are riven with corruption, patronage and nepotism. They have the power to enforce internal loyalty but not to perform basic institutional functions. “You don’t have any institution or agency that is capable of forcing the parties to cooperate and forcing them to be honest and fair. And that is a huge problem,” said Joy Langston, a political scientist at the CIDE, a Mexico City university. “They are very much able to negotiate reforms that make them even stronger and give them even more distance from voters,” she said, adding that this means parties have shrinking incentive to think about policies that will help voters, or to think about policy at all. Neza is different; it is run by the left-wing P.R.D. party, rather than either of the establishment parties. Most P.R.D. holds are not like Neza. They, too, see upticks in crime and corruption. But because the P.R.D. exists outside of the mainstream party system, an official like Mr. Amador is at least freer to root out corruption or experiment with unorthodox reforms. At the same time, however, he cannot turn for help or policy expertise from state or federal institutions. So he is walking a tightrope without a net. And not all of his policies have worked. After years of relatively undisturbed experimentation, Neza has become something like an open-air experiment in social engineering. The goal is to so enamor the police of their civic responsibility that they will decide to refuse the money they could make extorting civilians or aiding drug gangs, as is common in much of Mexico. In August, we attended one of the twice-annual awards ceremonies that Mr. Amador holds for the police. Of the 700 officers in attendance, half would receive some sort of prize and cash reward. Family members in the audience waved supportive signs. In an Oprah-style twist, and to cheers even she might envy, six officers were each granted bonuses worth four months pay. It felt like a pep rally. “At the beginning, people don’t trust you, they are very defensive,” said Diana Hernandez, one of the community officers assigned to monitor a small patch of streets — another experiment. She understands, she said. Growing up, her family rarely called the police, seeing them as bound to bring more trouble. Now, she said, “People recognize me on the street. That they know me really makes me feel good about this.” Neighborhood watch groups, set up to coordinate with police, are provided with police cameras, alarm systems and direct lines to the patrol cars. But their longer-term purpose, Mr. Amador said, is to create public buy-in for his reforms “so that it doesn’t matter who’s in the mayor’s office.” In a way, he is seeking to replicate the functions of a political party: grass-roots mobilization, civil society allies and institutionalized policies. It’s a big idea, but a reminder that trying to reform the police and society without real institutional support is a bit like writing in the sand. “It’s fragile, this experiment,” Guillermo Valdés, a former head of the national intelligence agency, said. Establishing it “has been a long process and a slow one,” requiring time and freedom that doesn’t exist for most Mexican officials constrained by the party system. Policing experts we spoke to generally gave Neza high marks, as did Mr. Valdés. Juan Salgado, also with the CIDE, said the city had achieved “great successes,” in part by sidestepping civil society organizations, which, like so much in Mexico, tend to dominated by the establishment parties. Still, not everyone has been sold. Antia Mendoza, a Mexico City-based security expert, said Neza’s officials had not proven a link between Mr. Amador’s reforms and the crime rate. And she saw little proof the community networks were working. And Neza is hardly an oasis of safety. The day before the police awards, our photographer visited Neza to find the main traffic circle shut down by a public brawl. When we spent some time in the police command center, which includes dozens of new-looking TV screens displaying feeds from hundreds of street cameras, the officers watched helplessly as a car chase zipped across the screens. Still, in a way, the most important thing may not be how well Mr. Amador’s reforms worked but the fact that he had space to try them at all, and for years at a time. That level of freedom, particularly to purge corruption, is rare in Mexican policymaking. It’s a major problem for Mexico, constricting officials in a time of national crisis. That, for us, was Neza’s lesson: not the presence of reforms, but the absence of party-imposed constraints. It made us look differently at the rest of Mexico, where those constraints can be suffocating. It made us think about Europe’s mainstream parties, which are the least popular they’ve been in years, giving rise to smaller and less professionalized fringe parties. It made us think about the global rise in populist parties, which often reject policy expertise and institutions as untrustworthy “deep state” elites. And it made us think about American parties that have been hollowed out by polarization and other factors. Mexico’s political parties are, in many ways, particular to Mexico and its history. They are legacies of the country’s revolutionary past and its recent emergence from single-party rule. The degree to which they are failing is exceptional. But the ways that they are failing are not.",The New York Times
2018,A Heart Risk Factor Even Doctors Know Little About,"To millions of Americans, Bob Harper was the picture of health, a celebrity fitness trainer who whipped people into shape each week on the hit TV show “The Biggest Loser.” But last February, Mr. Harper, 52, suffered a massive heart attack at a New York City gym and went into cardiac arrest. He was saved by a bystander who administered CPR and a team of paramedics who rushed him to a hospital, where he spent two days in a coma. When he awoke, Mr. Harper was baffled, as were his doctors. His annual medical checkups had indicated he was in excellent health. How could this have happened to someone seemingly so healthy? The culprit, in turned out, was a fatty particle in the blood called lipoprotein(a). While doctors routinely test for other lipoproteins like HDL and LDL cholesterol, few test for lipoprotein(a), also known as lp(a), high levels of which triple the risk of having a heart attack or stroke at an early age. For most people, lp(a) is nothing to worry about. Levels are strongly determined by genetics and the majority of people produce very little of it. But up to one in five Americans, including Mr. Harper, have perilously high levels of it in their blood. Studies show that diet and exercise have almost no impact on lp(a), and cholesterol-lowering drugs only modestly lower it. “People don’t know about it, physicians don’t know about it, and we have to get an education program out there, but that’s expensive,” said Dr. Henry N. Ginsberg, the Irving Professor of Medicine at Columbia University and a leading expert on lp(a). “I would say that somewhere between 15 to 20 percent of the population would clearly benefit from knowing that this is their problem.” Lp(a) was discovered in 1963 by a Norwegian scientist, Kare Berg, who noticed that it was especially common among people with coronary heart disease. No one knows precisely what purpose lp(a) serves in the body, though some scientists speculate that it may have a beneficial role such as helping to repair injured cells or preventing infections by binding to pathogens in the blood. But the downside of excessive lp(a) is clear: It accelerates the formation of plaque in the arteries, and it promotes blood clots. “It’s sort of a double whammy,” said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a cardiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine who helped write the American Heart Association’s cholesterol guidelines. “Biologically, lp(a) both gets into the artery wall and causes damage there more easily.” Studies suggest that the threshold for high lp(a) begins around 30 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Heart disease risk jumps for those in the 80th percentile, with lp(a) levels above 60, and climbs sharply for the 5 percent of the population with lp(a) levels between 150 and 300, according to Dr. Ginsberg at Columbia. “Those people can be disasters in terms of cardiovascular risk,” he said. Yet many people at high risk do not fit the typical profile of a person with heart disease. Sandra Revill Tremulis was a health-conscious medical device executive who moonlighted as an aerobics instructor, followed a strict diet, and maintained 16 percent body fat, equivalent to that of an elite athlete. Her LDL and total cholesterol levels were low, and at age 39, her Framingham risk score, which gauges heart disease risk, put her odds of having a heart attack in her 40s at just 1 percent. But when she started experiencing extreme fatigue and struggled to finish her workouts, she went to an interventional cardiologist and asked for a thorough work-up — which revealed that she had a 95 percent blockage in one of her coronary arteries. “I was imminent to have a widow-maker heart attack at age 39,” she said. Further testing showed she had high lp(a), which she believes she inherited from her father, who died of a heart attack at age 50. Determined to raise awareness, Ms. Revill Tremulis started a nonprofit, the Lipoprotein(a) Foundation, and now travels the globe advocating for wider testing. “Only a small percentage of physicians know about this,” she said. “The biggest challenge for patients is finding knowledgeable physicians who know about this and can help them.” Dr. Lloyd-Jones at Northwestern said that testing for lp(a) should be considered for people with early-onset cardiovascular disease — which means younger than age 50 for men and age 60 for women — or a strong family history of it. Since high lp(a) is hereditary, those who have it often have a parent, sibling or grandparent who suffered a premature heart attack or stroke. When one person has it, it’s important to test other family members too. “It’s what we call cascade screening, looking for affected first-degree relatives,” Dr. Lloyd-Jones said. Once high lp(a) is identified, doctors try to mitigate its effects by controlling other risk factors. They aggressively lower patients’ LDL cholesterol, optimize their blood pressure and blood sugar, and strongly encourage healthy diet and exercise habits. Two medications, niacin and a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, have been shown to modestly reduce lp(a) levels. But niacin, a B vitamin, has many side effects, and PCSK9 inhibitors, which are not approved for lp(a) lowering, are not usually covered by insurance for that purpose and can cost as much as $14,000 a year. At least one drug company, Akcea Therapeutics, a spinoff of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is developing a drug specifically to combat lp(a), but the drug is still in mid-stage testing and it could be years before it reaches the market. Since his heart attack, Mr. Harper of “The Biggest Loser” has embarked on a newfound mission to raise awareness about heart disease and to urge people to get tested for lp(a). His days no longer revolve around intense and grueling workouts, he said. Instead he believes the key to being healthy is managing stress, getting proper sleep, eating a balanced diet and enjoying life because it could end at any moment, an approach he has outlined in his new book, “The Super Carb Diet.” “Being healthy is not about what you can do in the gym,” Mr. Harper said. “It’s not about what you can do on the outside. It’s what’s going on in the inside. I really needed to find out what was going on with me, and that’s what this did. It woke me up.”",The New York Times
2018,A Hissing Radiator and Sleepless Nights,"Ask Real Estate Q. I recently moved into a renovated apartment in Hell’s Kitchen that is heated with steam. The valve on the radiator wakes me up most nights, intermittently making one of the loudest hissing sounds I have ever heard. Think of a teakettle whistling so loud that the noise interrupts conversations in the living room when my bedroom door is closed. I contacted my landlord, who sent a plumber, but the plumber said there were no solutions. Is there any way to fix this? And, if not, what are my options? I am desperate for a good night’s sleep. A. Radiators can be noisy things that clang and hiss as steam heats a room. But one that functions properly should not sound like a wailing teakettle. Your radiator may have a problem with an air valve. Air valves, also known as air vents, open and close as steam flows through the radiator. (Unlike a control valve, you cannot turn an air valve on or off.) These valves come in different sizes and are easily replaceable. “You could probably put a different type of air valve on the radiator that expels the air a little slower,” said Philip Kraus, the president of Fred Smith Plumbing and Heating in Manhattan. “It’s not complicated at all. You just unscrew it and put another one on.” Assuming this is the problem, your landlord should address it. “The landlord is shirking his or her legal obligations here,” said Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. Because the condition violates the warranty of habitability, a state law that protects tenants, you are entitled to a rent abatement and if the problem cannot be fixed, may be allowed to terminate your lease, Mr. Ferrara said. You could write the landlord a letter, including these points, sent by certified mail, demanding that the problem be addressed. You could also call 311 to report the matter. Your fastest route to a good night’s sleep, however, may be through your superintendent. Ask the super to replace the valve, something that Mr. Kraus said a handyman could do. While you should not have to pay for such work, offering a tip may get the job done faster.",The New York Times
2018,A Homecoming 50 Years in the Making,"In 1967, 6-year-old David Santiago and his family were forced out of their tenement apartment on Delancey Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to make way for what was supposed to be a massive urban renewal project. At the time, they were promised when the new buildings were finished they would be able to return. Last month, after 50 years in which the land sat empty as factions battled over what the neighborhood should look like, Mr. Santiago, now 57, finally opened the door of his promised new home, on the eighth floor in the first of nine buildings in a complex called Essex Crossing, on the south side of Delancey, near the entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge. There were tears in his eyes when he walked in, he said. “It’s weird,” Mr. Santiago said as he looked at the glassy condominiums to the north and the changing face of the neighborhood. “When I walk down the street I don’t see the new buildings out there. I see the marble pillars of the old Seventh Precinct, the shop on Delancey that was known for the best cuchifritos, Ratner’s restaurant, the Apollo Theater, and The Spot, a bar where the Jewish gangsters hung out and I shined shoes.” Close to 1,800 families, most of them Puerto Ricans, lost their homes all those years ago. Between the first and second building — a total of 310 apartments — at Essex Crossing, 14 families with ties to the neighborhood dating to 1967 will be moving back. Others may come as the remaining 769 apartments are completed. Officially, the grand opening of Mr. Santiago’s building — 14 stories at 175 Delancey Street with 99 subsidized apartments for people older than 55 — is Tuesday. In a ceremony that will include officials from the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, community activists and the developers (a consortium of L & M Development Partners, Taconic Investment Partners, BFC, Goldman Sachs’ Urban Investment Group and Grand Street Settlement), the building will be named after a longtime activist, Frances Goldin, from a neighborhood that has long resisted gentrification. Six of nine sites are currently under construction. The $1.5 billion Essex Crossing project will eventually include a 14-screen movie theater, a Trader Joe’s, the International Center for Photography and 1,079 apartments, 561 of them permanently designated for low-, moderate- and middle-income families. Starting in the late 1950s, Robert Moses, then head of the city’s Committee on Slum Clearance, sought to demolish the tenements south of Delancey Street, many of them built before 1900, and transform a neighborhood that was home to a mix of Puerto Ricans, African-Americans, Italians, Asians and Jews. The tenements came down, but the fight over what to do next continued. Many Latinos and housing activists like Ms. Goldin demanded that the city build low-income housing on what was known as the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, while the predominantly Jewish residents of some nearby co-ops, backed by the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty and the former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, argued for retail or office space, instead of low-income housing. Proposals from a succession of mayors — John V. Lindsay, Edward I. Koch, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg — all succumbed to the battling. Then, more than five years ago, the Bloomberg administration took the unusual step of beginning a bottom-up development plan for what had become the largest city-owned site south of 96th Street. Representatives from the local community board and various groups in this disparate neighborhood met, over time, drawing up a set of development objectives that included affordable housing, an emphasis on local retailers and budding entrepreneurs, rather than chains and big-box stores, parks, office space and a new home for the historic Essex Street Market. The city selected the development team in 2013 from among competing builders, which included the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group, which made its largest investment ever in a project: $400 million in equity and a $100 million loan. Ron Moelis, chairman of L & M Development Partners, has tangled with community groups in the past. “There’s so much acrimony in New York City today over overdevelopment and gentrification,” said Mr. Moelis. “This is a better way to do it: community, public and private-sector involvement.” “We weren’t always in agreement, but we came to a compromise,” said Edward Delgado, known as Tito, who became an activist after his family was evicted in 1967. “I’m glad some poor folks got in. But it still bothers me that it took 50 years to get some affordable housing.” To make good on the 50-year-old promise, the city’s Department of Housing compiled records of tenants who lived in the tenements demolished in the late 1960s and early 1970s, supplemented by names from former residents like Mr. Delgado. The final list contained about 500 names, although some may make too much or too little money to qualify for some of the subsidized apartments, while others may not want to move back. After losing their apartment, Mr. Santiago’s mother, Dolores Guzman, and his father, a numbers runner, moved the family to Avenue D, “a war zone in those days,” Mr. Santiago said. At 16, he joined the Marines. He spent 36 years in California, turning his love of food in his polyglot neighborhood into a career as a chef and restaurant consultant, featuring fusion themes: Spanish-Italian and Tapas-Sushi. Mr. Santiago, who has had health problems in recent years, moved back to New York to take care of his mother, sleeping on her sofa, until he moved into his new apartment. Mr. Santiago’s building includes a N.Y.U. Langone ambulatory care center and a cafe GrandLo, which will serve tenants and neighborhood residents and be a job-training center for youth who have dropped out of high school and are not working. The building is operated by Grand Street Settlement, a partner in the project. “It’s a victory unto itself because something is finally happening after 50 years,” said Harriet Cohen, who heads the Seward Park Redevelopment Coalition. “We got permanent affordability and the Essex Street Market. The real question is, what happens with gentrification? Does it slow down or speed up.” Jose Ossorio was 11 when he and his parents — a seamstress and a construction worker — were forced to move to public housing, where he played stick ball in the streets. He now works as a care coordinator at a Mount Sinai Clinic. Mr. Ossorio, now 61, also recently moved into 175 Delancey. “It felt good, coming back into the neighborhood,” Mr. Ossorio said. “What it used to be and what it is becoming. It was a good thing to see the changes, the prosperity and the diversity of the neighborhood.”",The New York Times

2018,"A Hoya Again, Patrick Ewing Learns Value of Knowing When to Pivot","WASHINGTON — Patrick Ewing does not stalk the sideline as much as he looms over it. No longer the lithe 7-footer who dominated the paint and beyond for much of his 15 seasons with the Knicks in a 17-year Hall of Fame N.B.A. career, he now strikes a pose as a 55-year-old rookie head coach that is visually not unlike that of John Thompson, who recruited Ewing to Georgetown in 1981 and advised him to return last spring as a replacement for Thompson’s son John III. Much like the elder Thompson, Ewing is a bespectacled bear of a man. Bullish, not bombastic. In a pre-New Year’s home matchup against a more highly regarded Butler team — Ewing’s debut as a coach in the Big East Conference — he watched calmly and contentedly as his team played its finest 20 minutes of the young season, building an 18-point halftime lead. Standing for all but a few seconds, Ewing called plays with an array of hand signals, occasionally barking out orders to “swing the ball,” or “push it” up court. He wasn’t shy in scolding players during timeouts; a recent video of him tearing into forward Marcus Derrickson for questionable shot selection has made the internet rounds. “Step back one-legged — what kind of shot is that?” Ewing demanded. “Have you ever shot that shot? Do you work on that shot?” But with the ball in play against Butler, Ewing did not dramatically stamp his feet or pompously pump his fists like many of his more demonstrative peers. “I do celebrate or get angry, but I try not to overly do it,” he said the day after the Butler game. “I don’t want to embarrass anyone or embarrass myself.” No surprise there. As a player, Ewing was never the type to pontificate or preen, to dwell on much more than the moment at hand. Hard work was his M.O., his brand of quiet leadership. A lasting image is of him on the Knicks’ bench during timeouts, in a seat closest to a box of tissue wipes, sweating as if in a steam room. Some have speculated that Ewing’s playing-career-long aversion to publicity, an insulation he supposedly developed as a defense against racism encountered in high school around the Boston area, hindered his yearslong pursuit of a head coaching job in the N.B.A. His playing scowl ultimately dissolved into a more sanguine public face across 14 years as an assistant or associate head coach in four league cities, but John Thompson — known around D.C. parts as Big John — never subscribed to the personality theory in the first place. “I think it was more that there’s a stereotype about centers,” he said, alluding to the rare giants who have wound up in coaching. “People tend to attribute thinking on the basketball court to guards. It’s a fallacy because, you know, there have been a lot of dumb guards.” In recent years, Thompson said, with the pro game more perimeter-dominant than ever, Ewing’s case became even harder. As he did when John III coached the Hoyas, Thompson attends Georgetown home games at the downtown Capital One Arena. But as Ewing’s team ran off a string of victories against lower-profile programs to begin the season, Thompson largely stayed out of sight and reporters’ range, giving his protégé space. For the Butler game, though, Thompson occupied a baseline seat that was only a firm bounce pass away from the Georgetown bench, indicating he thought Ewing had aced his initiation. Approached at halftime, he snapped, “What do you want?” Then he offered an adjacent seat and said, “If I wasn’t mean, you wouldn’t know it was me, would you?” This veneer of crankiness was a playful reference to the early-to-mid-1980s, when the Ewing-powered Hoyas reached three Final Fours and Thompson’s program had an air of unapproachability that even had a name: Hoya Paranoia. “A lot of things we did was attributed to paranoia, but it wasn’t,” Thompson said. “It was the decisions we made as an educational institution. And in Patrick’s case, it was because of his talent and the demand being so much higher on him. Listen, Patrick has never been an antisocial person — he’s been a private person. He’s always been very unselfish, and a lot of those times he didn’t want to do things it was because he wanted other people to get some attention.” Thompson made the initial call to Ewing after his son’s dismissal last year, suggesting he declare his candidacy to the university’s administration, though Thompson bristled at the notion of extended family nepotism. “It wasn’t as much as keeping it in the family as much as it was getting a guy who we all thought would be pretty damn good as a coach and who would work hard,” he said. “The surprising thing to me is people’s reactions to the fact that he is doing a good job. The man coached for a lot of years, and you’d have to be an idiot to think he wasn’t prepared for this.” Ewing had fancied himself ready and deserving, but only for a pro head job. News of the Georgetown vacancy initially had him concerned about his own son, Patrick Jr., who had been on John III’s staff. (A university nepotism rule has prevented Ewing from retaining him.) He told Thompson he would sleep on the possibility of shelving his pro coaching dream. Then he called, among other people, Chris Mullin, his friend and old Big East rival, who two years earlier had transitioned from an N.B.A. executive’s life to head coach at his alma mater, St. John’s. In a telephone interview, Mullin said he and Ewing had spoken in detail “about how the N.B.A. is not that different unless you’re coaching one of those veteran teams, and how some of my players at St. John’s have been older than a lot of the guys in the N.B.A. — which means you essentially work on the same fundamental things.” Mullin stressed to Ewing that opportunities like theirs would become increasingly rare: N.B.A. stars who had stayed long enough at a university to establish a lasting relationship. When Ewing and Mullin went at it as four-year collegians, Georgetown-St. John’s games reflected a conference that had risen fast soon after formation in 1979. The reconfigured Big East grouping of so-called basketball schools has also quickly earned respect, along with the 2016 national championship won by Villanova. But St. John’s and Georgetown, which once ruled the league, have lagged behind. The Hoyas made the Final Four in 2007 under John Thompson III, and they were fairly consistent winners until the last two seasons, when they lost 18 games in each. One persistent problem is that Georgetown, like St. John’s, has struggled to attract premier homegrown talent. When Ewing and Mullin collide for the first time as coaches on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, they will be the primary attractions, battling for supremacy in a building both consider home. “Chris knows that it’s my house,” Ewing said, laughing. “It was his in college and then it was mine with the Knicks, and he’s trying to take it back again.” To which Mullin, a native Brooklynite, said: “I grew up there and came back. Patrick was put there by the N.B.A.” The Big East has embraced the story line and views the game as a national marketing event, said Stu Jackson, the conference’s associate commissioner and Ewing’s onetime coach with the Knicks. Jackson took in the Georgetown-Butler game, sitting near Thompson. “It will feel like a classic Big East battle,” he said of the Ewing-Mullin showdown. Alas, St. John’s (10-6) and Georgetown both now sit in the bottom half of the league standings. The Hoyas (11-4, mostly thanks to their forgiving early season schedule) lost their top two scorers from last season and are young, especially in the backcourt — an unfortunate irony for Ewing, who waited in vain his entire Knicks career for a backcourt co-star. In the second half against Butler, the Bulldogs’ Kelan Martin and Kamar Baldwin mercilessly attacked the paint as their team steadily climbed back into the game. Butler tied it on a tap-in at the buzzer of regulation, did so again with two free throws late in overtime, and finally escaped with a 91-89 double-overtime victory. It was a second gut-wrenching defeat for Ewing, the Hoyas having lost another upset bid in overtime against Syracuse in mid-December. After the game, he answered reporters’ questions wearily — and warily. Chairs on both sides of him, reserved for Georgetown players, remained empty. Call it a case of Ewing being protective of his players, as Thompson was for him. Or consider it a re-enactment of Hoya Paranoia. The methodology endures. The next day, Ewing called a midday practice that was scheduled to end around 1 but lasted 90 minutes longer. The gymnasium walls could not contain his dissatisfied voice. But a smiling Ewing ambled out afterward, affectionately greeting one of the reporters he had treated with a chronic indifference for a decade and a half in New York. He was told that the foul call that had saved Butler in overtime was questionable at best. “Don’t get me started on that,” he said. Yes, head coaching could be cruel; he knew that long before he ever thought it might be for him, which wasn’t until Michael Jordan invited him to join the Washington Wizards’ staff soon after Ewing’s retirement as a player. “Try coaching,” Jordan said. “If you don’t like it, we’ll move you to the front office.” “So I tried coaching,” Ewing said, “and fell in love with it.” He was asked if, before accepting the Georgetown job, he had needed to state his terms of independence, understanding how much of a presence Big John had remained at Georgetown, where the new practice facility bears the Thompson name, and a bronze statue of the iconic coach greets visitors in the lobby. “I’m a grown man, been living my life, doing things my way for all these years,” Ewing said. “Coach Thompson is a great figure in my life, and if I have a problem I’ll always pick up the phone. But at the end of the day, the decision to do anything is mine.” What would it mean to him to restore Georgetown to what it was, given his roots there? He considered the question, then pointed a finger: “I can’t put that in writing — you’re trying to get me fired!” But with a hearty laugh, the veneer of Hoya Paranoia vanished. “One of the things I’ve tried to tell people is that this is not going to happen overnight — it’s a step-by-step process,” Ewing said. “It’s not Patrick Ewing the player walking through the door. But you can say my goal here is to be as successful as Coach Thompson.” Having said a mouthful, he stood up tall and announced it was time to go see a potential high school recruit who was in Washington for a holiday tournament. Sending an unwitting message to Mullin, he said, “A New York kid at that.”",The New York Times
2018,A Journey Into Iraqi Kurdistan,"Explorer Ancient fortresses, crisp mountain streams, curious people and healing cities: Travelers are discovering the Kurdish region of Iraq, a place of great beauty, haunted by war. An ancient city gate in Amadiya, in the Kurdish region of Iraq.CreditCreditMark Edward Harris The Mar Mattai monastery clings to the side of a steep mountain, and on a clear day a visitor can stand against its fortresslike walls and discern far below the winsome farmlands of Upper Mesopotamia. Here, in the cradle of civilization, the building is one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world. From this peaceful perch, it is difficult to imagine the horror. One hazy morning last spring, Harry Schute, a retired Army colonel in his 50s with a Cheshire grin, walked through the monastery’s heavy doors and along its shaded arcades. A boy played with a soccer ball in the courtyard, the boom of each kick cracking off the stone walls. At its peak in the 9th century, the monastery housed as many as 7,000 monks. Today it has five, a bishop, this boy and his family — all survivors of the Islamic State. We were on the western fringes of Kurdistan, a Netherlands-size, semiautonomous region in the north of Iraq that is home to 5.2 million of the world’s estimated 30 million Kurds, a stateless people who populate the border regions between Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria. The fact that the monastery still stood; that this Christian boy and his family were still alive; that a small group of North Americans now felt safe enough to travel here — all of it seemed like a miracle. Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, one of the most dangerous cities in the world, sat 20 miles southwest. In June 2014, ISIS overran it and the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, stood inside its Great Mosque of al-Nuri and named himself caliph of the terrifying regime. By August 2014, ISIS’ ominous black flags snapped just three miles from where I now stood. Under the cover of night, the monastery’s manager, a priest named Yousif Ibrahim, whose brother had already been murdered by the militants, spirited away scores of ancient documents, the last of the monastery’s once magnificent library, and even a discolored hand bone fragment believed to have belonged to St. Matthew the Hermit, who founded the monastery in 363 A.D. He was certain the monastery would be lost. But then the airstrikes began and the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi Army turned the tide on the ground. The caliphate began to crumble. It was now May 2017 and most of the artifacts had been returned to the monastery. This was one of the first times that Mr. Schute had brought travelers here since ISIS had come so close. Today Mr. Schute believes that Kurdistan could be one of the world’s great travel destinations if people would only stop confusing it with the Iraq they see in the news. To be sure, Kurdistan is nothing like the Iraq of Mosul but a Middle Eastern Montana with ruins: a cooler, welcoming tableau of crisp mountain streams and scrappy peaks. A traveler can ski at a new resort serviced by gondolas or wander through the sun-roasted walls of the deepest canyon in the Middle East. You can drink city water from the taps and stroll around Erbil, the regional capital, concerned with only how to decline, politely, invitations to drink tea. “Hello, my friend, have some bread.” “Come, sit.” “Please, mister, enjoy my country.” For now, the war with ISIS was still winding down. Soon we would watch a 500-pound coalition bomb erupt over the militants’ last stronghold in Mosul and send a huge mushroom cloud curling over the city. The concussion, heavy and round, would ring for miles. Here at the monastery, though, on this pleasant spring day, birdsong ricocheted off the cliffs and the only thing to explode were the poppies. As a West Point history major with a soft spot for heavy metal, Mr. Schute had been a state trooper in New Jersey before being called to Iraq in April 2003 to command a United States Army Reserve civil affairs battalion. “Those are the guys who help get people and things out of the way so the Army can come in and break stuff,” he said. Soon he became something of a celebrity as the senior American officer in Kurdistan; to this day, the Kurds — who view Americans as their liberators for ousting Saddam Hussein — recognize him on the street and ask for photographs with him. As his tour drew to a close, Mr. Schute began to feel anxious. “It was like there was a hole in me,” he said. “I felt I was in the middle of contributing worthwhile things and I wanted to continue to contribute. I wanted to stay.” The Kurdistan Regional Government eventually offered him a job in Erbil, about 225 miles north of Baghdad. For a history buff, Kurdistan was a dream. He could hear swords ringing on grassy fields where ancient armies collided. He ran his hands along the ramparts of forgotten fortresses and felt the dampness in the crypt-like passages of mystical shrines. He learned Kurdish and married a Kurd. In 2003 at a Kurdish investment seminar in Erbil, Mr. Schute met Douglas Layton, an American who came to Kurdistan in 1992. Mr. Layton, whose round spectacles and woolen cap lend him the air of a paperback spy, had survived a $1 million bounty on his head, courtesy of Saddam Hussein. After the dictator’s capture and execution, Mr. Layton journeyed to Hussein’s palace in Baghdad, where he found his outlandish throne and sat in it. “You’re gone,” Mr. Layton whispered to Saddam’s ghost, “and I’m still here.” Mr. Schute and Mr. Layton, who had been working for the Meridian Health Foundation, both knew of Kurdistan’s cultural riches and friendly people, so they joined forces to create what eventually became Kurdistan Iraq Tours, the only inbound tourism operator in Kurdistan. The idea seemed absurd. “Everyone said no one will come to Iraq, and I said but they’ll come to ‘the other Iraq!’” Mr. Layton recalled. “I believed, and I still believe, that tourism is the future.” For their main local guide, they hired and trained Balin Zrar, a charismatic, chain-smoking Kurd. Mr. Zrar had spent seven years running an Italian restaurant in London after he smuggled himself to Europe — an epic tale that involved time in an Iranian prison camp and riding for days curled atop a spare tire under a tractor-trailer. After the London bombings, Mr. Zrar returned to Kurdistan to dabble in real estate. For the guide-position interview, Mr. Layton asked him if he liked history. “I hate history,” replied Mr. Zrar, now in his early 40s, and the candor landed him the job. No one believed he’d be busy. In 2008, though, things took off. The company landed a contract with California-based Distant Horizons to run its Kurdistan cultural trips and soon others followed. Momentum built. By 2011 The New York Times put Iraqi Kurdistan on its annual list of places to go. National Geographic Traveler did the same. “Top Gear,” the British television show, filmed a special there. In 2012 tourism arrivals surged 30 percent, year-over-year, to about 2.2 million visitors. Copycat inbound companies sprang to life. Starwood, Kempinski and Marriott lined up to manage new luxury hotels. By spring 2014, Kurdistan Iraq Tours had 15-person groups booking 11-day itineraries and was actually making some money. Then, ISIS showed up. The militants steamrolled down the Tigris and pushed into Kurdistan. They got so close to Erbil’s city gates that even Mr. Schute was worried. Tourism companies shut down. Seventy hotels closed. Many flights ceased. “We were the last guys standing,” Mr. Layton said. But all through those awful years the men worked behind the scenes, speaking to lawmakers and publishing a gorgeous, comprehensive guidebook to the region. As soon as ISIS was gone they knew travelers would come wandering back. THE RED-EYE FROM AMMAN touched down just before dawn in Erbil where Mr. Zrar waited. He had a slim build and black hair flecked with gray. He fidgeted, as most Kurdish men do, with a string of beads called a tasbih. Outside the air was hazy and cool. Our contingent of five North Americans had pretty much spent a lifetime traveling. Even so, only one of us, the head of an adventure travel trade association, had visited Kurdistan before. This time he’d brought along his son, who’d turn 17 on the trip. A Canadian expat living in Hong Kong and a photographer from Los Angeles who had been to North Korea 10 times rounded out our group. We piled into a mini bus and rolled into the city. Rows of half-finished skyscrapers rose from the earth like the picked-over rib cage of a great steely beast. Barbershops, bookstores, mosques and carts laden with wild cucumbers and cigarettes scrolled by the window. Unlike Iraqi Arabs, few Kurdish women wore head scarves. If you ignored the road signs pointing to Baghdad, you could mistake this for Turkey. The plan was to spend a week traveling in a clockwise loop that started and ended in Erbil, taking in cities like Duhok and Sulaymaniyah along the way. We’d hike in the Zagros Mountains, paddle kayaks on Lake Dukan, and eat kebabs and flatbread. Often we’d pause over sugary tea outside noisy bazaars and linger in museums highlighting Kurdish traditions and history. Mr. Layton, who now lives in Connecticut, could not join us, but Mr. Schute, still in Erbil, would spend time with us. Immediately it became clear that this would be unlike any other trip. Mr. Schute also serves as a senior security adviser to the Kurdish interior ministry and works closely with the Peshmerga, which means “those who face death.” More than 100,000 of these Kurdish soldiers — our allies against Saddam Hussein and ISIS — manned a nearly impenetrable front riddled with tank ditches and checkpoints that has kept Kurdistan an enclave of comparative security while much of the rest of Iraq remains too dangerous for tourists. The Peshmerga, coalition forces and the Iraqis had cornered the last of ISIS’s fighters in Mosul’s old city along the Tigris. The effort to root them out for good was being coordinated through the Zerevani Peshmerga headquarters outside Erbil. Mr. Schute arranged to take us there. C-17s roared overhead as we arrived. In the distance you could see a dome that the South Koreans had built for a gym and several squat metal buildings. Guards led us into a room with a long table set with bananas and apricots and cold cans of Pepsi. United States Army Lt. Col. Darin E. Huss, the center’s director, and Iraqi and Kurdish generals, came in to answer our questions about the fight. “In 10 days it will be finished, inshallah,” Staff Major Gen. Saad Khalid Yasin told me. (It would be more like six weeks.) Most eye-opening of all, though, was the base’s Mad Max junkyard of captured ISIS vehicles. The militants had welded thick armored plates around old Soviet personnel carriers and attached grids of rebar along their sides to disperse incoming rocket blasts. Some rigs had heavy metal prows to better ram a checkpoint. Others had been reduced to mangled heaps of metal. I climbed inside one that had been scorched beyond all recognition. On the floor lay a chalky white bone. Lamb. Someone’s lunch had ended poorly. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS we took in more mainstream sites. We strolled around Erbil’s citadel, a fortress on a mound, that dates to 6000 B.C., and mingled with Arab Iraqis from the south who seemed overjoyed to friend an American on Facebook. I stuck my nose in sacks of za’atar and sumac in the city’s frenetic bazaar and watched two teen lovebirds — she in a hijab, he in jeans — kiss behind a tree in a park where no one could see but God. The next morning our driver headed north toward the Mar Mattai monastery. We slipped past wheat fields, gas stations with knockoff names like “Shall” and “Nobil,” and a refinery — a reminder of Kurdistan’s agricultural economy and the fact that Iraq controls some of the richest oil fields in the world, a quarter of which lie in Kurdistan. Kids played on the banks of the Greater Zab River where earthen bunkers once shielded Iraqi tanks during the 2003 invasion. This was the Green Line, the point behind which Saddam withdrew his forces after the creation of a no-fly zone over Kurdistan following his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War. The air turned hair-dryer hot as we wrapped up our time at the monastery. From there we drove to a field just outside a village called Amian. A lone cow stood in the grass. A kid in a yellow shirt rode by, waving, on a bike. In the distance rose a gumdrop-shape dollop of earth. It was a tell, or a man-made hill formed when ancient villages are built and rebuilt atop one another over thousands of years until they’re abandoned and the grass reclaims them. Kurdistan is littered with these. Very few of them have been excavated, Hashim Hama Abdullah, the director of the Slemani Museum in Sulaymaniyah, would tell me later after I’d spent a morning studying the museum’s ancient stelae, tablets and other artifacts. “No excavating happened at all under Saddam,” he said. “Now teams are coming in.” Kurdistan has no real budget for tourism projects, which means few attractions have basic things like interpretive signs. This field, which also has never been excavated, would be just a field without Mr. Schute to explain it. In 331 B.C. the Persian king Darius III picked this now peaceful place to face Alexander the Great of Macedonia once and for all. The ensuing fight, the Battle of Gaugamela, saw Darius’s far greater force suffer such horrific losses that soon the Macedon kingdom would stretch from Greece to Pakistan. The battle counts as one of the most important military victories of all time, Mr. Schute said. “Can you feel it?” he asked, as he imagined the war elephants, the scythed chariots and the tens of thousands of soldiers lining up to hack each other to bits. “I get here and I can feel it.” We pressed on toward Duhok, a city tucked between the Shandukha and Spi mountains, just as rain began to fall. We stopped to take a short hike to see carvings of Assyrian kings left in a hillside and grabbed a lunch of nesik, a lentil soup, and sawer, a bulgur dish served with pickled squash. Murals on walls said “respect the Peshmerga.” Of all the people that ISIS fought, the militants were particularly vicious toward the Yazidi, one of Iraq’s most mysterious religious minorities, who were massacred by the thousands. The Yazidi allow no outsiders to convert to Yazidism and the contents of their holy text, the Meshef Resh or Black Book, are only for other Yazidi. In the most general of terms, they believe in one god and that the angel cast from heaven in Christian faiths is now the reconciled leader of all angels, and takes the form of a peacock. Some Yazidi don’t wear blue. The faith holds that every Yazidi should take a pilgrimage to the center of their world, or Lalish, a lovely mountain village about 30 miles southeast of Duhok. The Yazidi believe that Noah’s Ark came to rest here after a snake used its body to plug a hole in the boat, thus saving all of creation. Yazidi kids gathered around us as we walked toward temples tucked against scruffy hillsides. The village had stone buildings and narrow streets, and families sat together on carpets inside courtyards and on patios. Everyone, like us, was barefoot. Shoes aren’t allowed in Lalish. “Where you from?” asked a boy in sunglasses. Another, a teen with immaculate hair, wanted to take a selfie with us. Soon everyone wanted a selfie with us. They followed us toward a shrine with a conical roof. Sheik Adi, a man as holy to the Yazidi as Jesus is to Christians, was buried inside. “Step through the door!” a boy told me, meaning I shouldn’t step on the threshold. Angels rest in doorways. Inside the air was cool and moist. A woman pressed her forehead against a threshold, kissed it and mumbled. Others walked around Adi’s tomb, chanting; holy water burbled up from deep within the mountain. In one room I found two holes in the floor. One went to heaven, the other to hell, but no one would tell me which was which. That seemed to be a fitting image for the rest of the trip, which oscillated between breathtaking beauty and heartbreaking anguish. We visited the spectacular town of Amadiya, perched on a butte, perhaps home to the three wise men, and toured refugee centers where children had posted notes for dead parents. We danced in shin-deep water at the Ali Begg waterfall with giggling Arab Iraqi men, then visited Halabja where Saddam murdered thousands of Kurds in chemical gas attacks. I gazed over endless peaks that stretched toward Turkey, while standing in the blown-up husk of one of Saddam’s once-lavish palaces. Never once did I feel unsafe. Even so: “I don’t know what the future is,” Mr. Zrar told me. “It’s not wise to be hopeful.” And yet all across the Middle East you get the sense that something deep is afoot and that adventure travel stands at the center. Jordan has a new trans-country trail. Palestinians and Egyptians are learning to rock climb. You can run marathons in Oman. “The act of getting outside and taking a step forward is seen as an act of empowerment,” David Landis, an American who helped coordinate the rise of the Abraham Path, a trail network currently underway from Egypt to Iran, told me. Near the end of the trip we met Rekan Rasool, 25, who started a hiking and kayaking club for Kurds. In 2010 his Rock Your Bones group had a handful of members. Today it has more than 6,000. Standing along the Lesser Zab River, he told me how he dreams of opening an outdoor shop in Erbil, of hiking across Kurdistan through the mountains, of getting more women involved in the outdoors. Like Mr. Schute and Mr. Layton, he sees something in Kurdistan that would be obvious were it not for the news. “When there is no war in my country, Kurdistan is the best place,” he said. He stuffed inflatable kayaks, coolers and tents into his S.U.V. for a long weekend of adventure with his girlfriend. We said goodbye. Then he drove down a road that arced out of sight. The Kurds voted in September to declare independence from Iraq, a move that triggered Baghdad into placing a punitive ban on international flights into the region. Talks in mid-January hinted that the ban might soon be lifted. The Kurdish news agency Rudaw has an English website and has been covering the flight ban regularly. Until it is lifted, travelers have two options for getting into Kurdistan. The first is to go overland through Turkey. To do that you would fly to Sirnak or Diyarbakir, both in southeastern Turkey, then cross into Iraqi Kurdistan via the Habur-Ibrahim Khalil border crossing. You’ll need a Turkish visa. The second way is to connect on a domestic flight through Baghdad. To do that, you’ll need an Iraqi visa. Visa rules for Kurdistan may change as Kurd and Iraqi authorities negotiate the results of the independence vote. For now, passport holders from the United States, Britain, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Japan can get a free 30-day Kurdistan visa at the border crossing and, presumably, upon arrival at the Erbil airport in Kurdistan once flights resume. Again, that may all change. Check the Kurdistan Regional Government website for more information. As of press time the K.R.G.’s Department of Foreign Relations website had removed its webpage related to Kurdish visas. For these reasons, it’s recommended that would-be travelers find a reputable company to organize their trips and to keep them up-to-date on visa requirements. Kurdistan Iraq Tours (info@kurdistaniraqtours) offers custom trips that can range from single-day excursions to two-week itineraries or more for up to 15 people. Prices are all-inclusive (without flights) and vary depending on the group size, hotels and the exact itinerary. Expect to pay from $2,000 to $9,000. (Note: Kurdistan is a cash economy. You can use a credit card at major hotels but Kurdistan Iraq Tours can only take cash.) Kurdistan Iraq Tours works with outfitters based in Britain and the United States, such as Steppes Travel, Native Eye Travel, Undiscovered Destinations, Young Pioneer Tours and Spiekermann Travel. Mountain Travel Sobek plans to offer a Kurdistan trip in 2019. Wild Frontiers Travel may add it again in the future. The State Department strongly advises against traveling to Iraq and it didn’t support the Kurdish referendum. Travel insurance is a must. Companies like World Nomads and First Allied offer coverage in Iraq. It’s also a good idea for United States citizens to register with the State Department through its Smart Traveler Enrollment Program before going. Kurdistan Iraq Tour’s high-level contacts within the Kurdish government allow for a more nuanced and real-time understanding of what’s safe and what isn’t. Situations can change, of course, but I, and other members in my group, never once felt unsafe.",The New York Times
2018,A Leg Injury Takes Rafael Nadal Out of the Australian Open,"MELBOURNE, Australia — The injuries continued for the elite of men’s tennis on Tuesday, as top-ranked Rafael Nadal retired down by 0-2 in the fifth set of his Australian Open quarterfinal with Marin Cilic. Nadal took a two-set-to-one lead after winning a third-set tiebreaker in typically combative fashion, pumping both arms and shouting after completing the task. But down by 1-4 in the fourth set, he took a medical timeout and was treated on court while lying on his back. The trainer Per Bastholt worked on Nadal’s upper right leg. At one point, Nadal placed a towel over his face as he grimaced in pain. He returned to the court and, after losing the fourth set, began hobbling between points as Cilic, the powerful sixth-seeded Croatian who played boldly throughout the match, continued to take big and often effective risks with his groundstrokes. Nadal was restricted in his movement but did what he could for the next two games. After Cilic hit a forehand passing shot winner to break his serve in the second game of the final set, Nadal took off his headband, walked to the other side of the net and informed the chair umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore and Cilic that he was retiring with Cilic leading by 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 2-0. Nadal’s team announced on Wednesday that a magnetic resonance imaging exam indicated that he had strained the iliopsoas, an inner hip muscle, on his right side. Nadal still plans to follow his planned schedule, his team said, by playing a hardcourt event in Acapulco, Mexico, which begins on Feb. 26, followed by events in Indian Wells and Miami. That would give Nadal more than a month to recover (he already had announced he would not play in the Davis Cup next week when Spain faces Britain). In the semifinals, Cilic will face Kyle Edmund, an unseeded surprise from Britain who upset the No. 3 seed Grigor Dimitrov, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, earlier in the day in Rod Laver Arena. It has been a tournament of big surprises. In her first Australian Open, the unseeded Elise Mertens of Belgium has reached the semifinals in women’s singles. In his first Australian Open, 97th-ranked American Tennys Sandgren has reached the quarterfinals in men’s singles. Nadal’s retirement means there will be no rematch with Roger Federer in this year’s final. Federer beat Nadal in a five-set thriller in 2017 to win the Australian Open, but Federer, who will face Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, is now the only member of the so-called Big Five who is still in contention at Melbourne Park. The years of competing at the highest level are taking their toll on that elite group. Andy Murray, 30, underwent hip surgery this month in Australia after withdrawing from this tournament. Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka managed to play after taking six-month breaks from competition because of injuries, but they were diminished in Melbourne. Wawrinka, returning from knee surgery at age 32, lost in the second round to Sandgren. In a fourth-round loss to the 21-year-old South Korean Hyeon Chung, Djokovic, now 30, was frequently wincing in pain, his right elbow still not sufficiently healed after his extended break. Djokovic has acknowledged that elbow surgery is a possibility. Sandgren and Chung will play each other for a spot in the semifinals on Wednesday. Nadal expressed concern about the series of injuries to leading players in the last year. “It’s not the right moment to say for me, but somebody who is running the tour should think a little bit about what’s going on,” he said. “Too many people getting injured.” Nadal, 31, said tennis authorities need to think about the long-term health of the players. “There is life after tennis, so I don’t know if we keep playing in these very, very hard surfaces, what is going to happen in the future with our lives,” he said. Throughout Nadal’s remarkable career, as he has won 16 Grand Slam singles titles and two Olympic gold medals, he has often lobbied for more tournaments to be played on natural surfaces like grass and clay — his best surface. Nadal has a spectacular but punishing playing style, full of abrupt changes of direction as he covers court like few men in the long history of tennis. When he was part of the ATP Player Council, he pushed unsuccessfully to base the ranking system on two years of results instead of one. In an interview in September, he complained that the top players had mandatory tournament commitments that stretched from January to November, although veteran players become exempt from some mandatory events as they accrue years of service. Chris Kermode, the executive chairman and president of the ATP, has said that the tour has conducted research that shows the overall injury rate is not climbing for all players but only for the elite, which could be explained by the fact that much of that group is aging. Federer, the oldest of the Big Five by far at age 36, has long argued that it is important to take long breaks within the season. And though Cilic, 29, was sympathetic to Nadal’s injury, he was not ready to ring the alarm bells as loudly. “In the end, it’s on all of us to try to take care of our bodies, to try to pick the right schedule, to listen to our body, how it feels,” said Cilic, the 2014 United States Open champion and the only man outside the Big Five to win a Grand Slam singles title since the beginning of 2010. Nadal had a triumphant 2017 season, winning his 10th French Open and third United States Open. But his knee troubles returned by season’s end, forcing him to withdraw from the Paris Masters and depart the ATP World Tour Finals after one match. Recovery was slower than Nadal hoped or expected, and at the start of 2018 he withdrew from a planned exhibition event in Abu Dhabi and an official tournament in Brisbane, Australia. This was the first time Nadal had arrived at the Australian Open without playing a warm-up event, but he successfully navigated the first week, dropping just one set, to Diego Schwartzman in the fourth round. “I worked hard to be here,” Nadal said. “We did all the things that we believed were the right things to do to be ready. I think I was ready. I was playing O.K.” But his body — his strength and his weakness — began to break down again in the third set Tuesday. “Start to feel the muscle a little bit tired in the third, but playing normal, no limits, no limitation,” Nadal said. “Then in the fourth at one movement, one drop shot I think, I felt something. At that moment, I thought something happened, but I didn’t realize how bad.” It would soon become clear, and the capacity crowd in Laver Arena began to groan and gasp as they watched him hobble and miss routine shots. “You never want to accept it. You want to wait and see if something happens that helps it go away and get better,” said Nadal, who took anti-inflammatory medication during the match. “I was waiting to see if that had any effect and improved anything. But I couldn’t move, and without being able to move, I’m not going to win. I couldn’t keep going because I was totally lame, and I didn’t know either if I continued like that whether I would do more damage.” Injuries have spoiled Nadal’s chances at the Australian Open before. He has retired from matches at eight tour events during his career but only two at the Grand Slam level, both at Melbourne Park. (He also withdrew from the 2016 French Open before the third round because of a wrist injury.) In 2010, Nadal stopped his Australian Open quarterfinal against Murray because of a knee problem. In 2011, when Nadal was trying to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four straight major singles titles, he sustained a hamstring injury in the opening set of his quarterfinal against his Spanish compatriot David Ferrer and lost in straight sets. In the 2014 final here, Nadal lost to Wawrinka in four sets when hampered by a back problem. Despite his retirement on Tuesday, Nadal will retain the No. 1 ranking after the tournament. But — as with Djokovic — it is unclear when Nadal will be able to play again. “I’m sad because once again I’ve had a problem in my career,” he said. “But in the end, when these things happen, you have to look in the mirror and see all the good things that have happened, too. It’s true that I’ve perhaps had more injuries than most of my competitors, but it’s also true that I’ve won more than nearly all of them.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Lifetime in Peru’s Glaciers, Slowly Melting Away","The Saturday Profile HUARAZ, Peru AT 50, Americo González Caldua has lived a life that coincided with the retreat of the glaciers of the high Andes. With each passing year, as the cold mountain temperatures rise, the ice moves uphill another 20 yards. In the dry season, when the storms break and the research season begins, Mr. González heads to the icy heights of the nearby peaks with survey prisms and markers. He brings heavy drilling augers that bore core samples deep below the surface of the glaciers and reveal a picture of the atmosphere from a century ago. He knows the ice sheet as well as anyone. Yet, Mr. González is neither a mountaineer nor a scientist: He’s the man most often found trailing behind them, carrying their equipment. Mount Everest has the Sherpas. The Cordillera Blanca, a snowy mountain range in northern Peru, has the ayudantes de campo, or field helpers, in Spanish. They are the mountain men, mainly indigenous, who have watched a huge expanse of ice that was known to them for centuries shrink drastically in the space of one generation. “Before, we saw our glaciers as beautiful, our mountain range covered in a white sheet that was stunning,” Mr. González said on a recent day at a small mountain-climber’s hostel near the base of an 18,000-foot peak. “But today, we don’t see that anymore on our glacier, which we’re losing more of every day. Instead of white, we are seeing stone.” Of all the glaciers in retreat throughout the world, those in this part of South America are the most likely to disappear first. Scientists call them the tropical glaciers, ice caps found in places as warm as Ecuador and Indonesia, where high mountain peaks have shielded them for thousands of years from the heat of the jungle below. Yet now, even these high perches have become precarious. Climate scientists say the ice cap here has been reduced by nearly a quarter in the past 40 years because of rising temperatures. With the rate of melting increasing each year, some scientists predict that within 50 years many of the peaks here will no longer have glaciers. “It’s not Antarctica, where you have a rupture of a mile and everyone notices,” said Justiniano Alejo Cochachin, a glaciologist who works for the Peruvian government. “It’s 19 meters a year; it is bit by bit.” On his many journeys, Mr. González has spent decades looking over the shoulders of scientists like Mr. Cochachin, shaping his own intimate view of a landscape altered by climate change. He watched the expanding rocky fields around the Pastoruri Glacier, where the melting ice uncovered fossils that had not seen daylight in ages, including those of ferns and other plants. He has seen rivers turn red as other glaciers melted and exposed heavy metals that poison the water downstream. “If there is no water, there is no life,” Mr. González said. His work begins early, well before sunrise, when he packs crampons used to walk atop the glaciers, large boring drills and topographical instruments, helmets, gloves and the gear to build a shelter, all in a backpack nearly as large as he is. The food often goes on a mule — provided the mule can make the climb. If not, Mr. González carries that, too, on several trips in and out of the camp over the course of several days. Mr. González said the path on a recent climb to a glacier called Yanamarey would not be so taxing, by his standards — a round-trip journey of 10 hours. And so we headed out one morning with Rolando Cruz, a researcher in the nearby town of Huaraz who came to take some measurements at the base of the glacier. The long hours up are often quiet ones, where Mr. González searches for what he calls the “perfect route” through the unmarked boggy landscape of mist and fog where jagged peaks rise up on either side and hawks soar above. Vast plains stretch for miles, former lake beds from the ice age, where cows graze. “The cows weren’t here before,” noted Mr. González, saying they now graze at higher altitudes than before, as they follow the grasses as the temperatures have warmed. The route was one that Mr. González has crossed countless times over the decades, since he first visited the Yanamarey glacier in the early 1990s. His descriptions of it from that time vary. At times he evokes a building — it had “blue walls,” he said. Sometimes he spoke of the glacier’s “beautiful long tongue,” and it sounded more like an animal. “Yes, it is alive,” he said, describing the glacier’s slow movement below his feet. In the 1990s, the hikes could be an escape from the conflicts taking place below, when the Shining Path, the Maoist rebel group that terrorized Peru for decades, attacked politicians in Huaraz and planted three car bombs. Despite the unrest, American researchers would come each year, and Mr. González would lead them up as the ice sheet continued to melt. “When you go out into the field, your mind clears,” he said. It was the sound of the cracking, heard on nearly every ice sheet the scientists came to study, that bothered him most. “Tac,” he said, “like a huge sound.” And every year he came, Yanamarey was farther away than it had been the last time. Our climb continued. The landscape turned into a rocky stretch of boulders. Then the glacier came into view. It looked very different that day from the place Mr. González had described. The ice sheet, having once spilled into the lake below it, had retreated halfway up a rocky mountainside, a small spit peeking behind the rocks. There were no “blue walls,” no “tongue,” just a thin coat of ice over a bare rocky stretch. “It looks gray, like the color of lead,” Mr. González said several times. Mr. Cruz climbed up, took his measurements in the distance and returned some time later. The two men looked at each other with the same resigned glance, then headed back down the hill. At his age, Mr. González knows these journeys will not continue forever. His knees have begun to give out, particularly as he walks downhill with large amounts of gear. “You don’t have the same strength,” he said. Mr. González looked over at his son Álvaro, an 18-year-old who had joined us that afternoon back at the hostel in Huaraz. The boy told me he would soon study climate science in college, inspired by his father who had taken him to see the ice sheet for the first time some years ago. Who had shown Mr. González the glaciers first? It was his mother, he said, on a chilly day when the two were looking out at the peaks from a nearby farm. “You could see those white glaciers in the distance,” he said. “And our mother pointed to them and said in her language ‘raju,’ which is the Quechua word, which means ice.” Back then, the ice seemed as permanent as the mountains themselves. “No, I never imagined this,” said Mr. González, describing the ice today. “As a child, you can never picture the things which might happen.”",The New York Times
2018,A Listening Ear for Musicians in Need,"CARDIFF, Wales — At 11 p.m. here one recent Monday, Rob Aston, a 23-year-old former drum-and-bass M.C., was four hours into a shift at one of the world’s first mental health help lines for musicians. Started in December by the nonprofit Help Musicians U.K., the help line, Music Minds Matter, aims to provide a caring ear to the large proportion of people in the music industry with mental health problems. Callers can connect with therapists and can receive advice on issues like debt and Britian’s welfare services. Help Musicians U.K. is investing nearly 1 million pounds, or around $1.4 million, in the help line. Mr. Aston’s previous shift was busy. A struggling band manager had called first. “She just felt lost and needed someone to talk to,” he said. An older musician then phoned, saying he was going to kill himself. Mr. Aston talked him into giving his address and sent an ambulance. He said he had to go out for a cigarette after the call, “just to get my head together a little bit.” A few hours later, another musician rang. They seemed successful, Mr. Aston said, with tours booked. But they felt huge pressure, as if something could go wrong any minute. They wanted help, counseling, but did not see how they could get it while on tour. The Monday shift was in stark contrast. The phone was silent. Mr. Aston browsed the internet to pass the time, made cups of tea, stretched. But then, around 11:30 p.m., an email arrived. It was from an electronic musician experiencing a host of problems, including anxiety and depression. “It’s a huge step for someone just to send that,” Mr. Aston said. “They clearly need to talk.” He quickly wrote a reply, saying, among other things, they could call anytime. Four hours later, the phone still hadn’t rung. The help line received an average of 25 inquiries a week in December. Some nights are busy, others quiet. Mental health is a high-profile issue in the music industry, with stars like Zayn Malik talking about anxiety and the suicides of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park. Yet the Music Minds help line is one of few public initiatives trying to improve matters. Richard Robinson, Help Musicians’ chief executive, said the idea had been brewing for several years. The “final shove,” he said, came in 2016, when the group commissioned the University of Westminster in London to research mental health issues in the industry. Of the roughly 2,200 people who participated in the survey, from aspiring violinists to folk singers, 71 percent said they had experienced anxiety or panic, and 68.5 percent depression. That compares with a nationwide average of 17 percent of people ages 16 or over having anxiety or depression in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics. More than half of those in the music industry said they had found it difficult to get help. The report on the survey results is blunt: “Music making is therapeutic, but making a career out of music is destructive.” Other studies have shown similar numbers. In 2016, researchers in Norway found that musicians there were three times more likely to be in therapy than the general work force. “I think it’s a unique environment,” Mr. Robinson said. “Someone who’s putting their creative brain on show is saying, ‘Look, I can either succeed or fail here.’ And it’s horrific.” The daily calls to the help line show it is needed, he added. Calls from electronic musicians, composers and people in music theater have dominated so far. It is easy to find musicians who welcome such efforts. “I’m totally fine to admit I’ve rung Samaritans before,” said Matthew Johnson, the frontman of the Leeds-based rock band Hookworms, referring to Britain’s best-known suicide-prevention hotline. “The problem I’ve had is, when I’ve tried to explain my problems, and I’ve had it with therapists too, they say, ‘Oh, your life must be wonderful.’ They don’t particularly understand the pressures you might be under.” Mr. Johnson has had depression, on and off, since he was a teenager. Being a musician has sometimes made things worse, he said, even though Hookworms has released two critically acclaimed albums. The profession comes with financial precariousness, but he said he also hated being onstage, and found coping with reviews and online sniping difficult. “I found myself the other day looking through YouTube comments, and I found one — one! — where someone said they didn’t like it,” Mr. Johnson said, referring to their latest single. “That’s the one I’ll take to heart. I’ll ignore all the ones saying it’s brilliant.” The artist says he feels lucky that his band signed with Domino, a London-based label that he said had been supportive. “When I feel bad, they always reach out to check I’m O.K. They’ve gone out of their way to move stuff, cancel stuff.” “If our record absolutely tanked, I don’t think they’d stop supporting us,” he added. “I’ve seen it with friends who’ve made one record on a big label then been dropped, and they’ve totally spiraled to a terrible place.” None of the large record labels contacted for this article would comment on the industry’s actions on mental health. “The help line is great, but it is not the total solution in any shape or form,” said Sally Gross of the University of Westminster, who conducted the survey for Help Musicians. “Mental health is very much a hot topic, and everyone’s saying they’re doing something about it. I don’t know what that is though.” It is not just the music industry that needs to act, she added. Mental health services require increased government funding, she said, and there is a need for better education on the realities of life as a musician. Musicians themselves are calling for more action. “Football clubs have someone attached to them to deal with all forms of health of their players,” said Neil Barnes, better known as Leftfield, a dance act who have had several platinum albums. “I think that record companies should employ therapists as part of their payroll, to offer that service to bands.” Mr. Barnes has long had depression, and found it worsened after the band split up, in 2002, and later when he was under pressure to write new music. He was lucky to be able to afford private therapy, he added. The help lines, though, are an important first step. Mr. Robinson, the Help Musicians chief executive, urged the global music industry to support the Music Minds Matter endeavor or replicate it. “Mental health is clearly becoming a much talked about subject, but we need to make sure it doesn’t become a cause célèbre or a fad,” he said. “We are losing people.” OpinionRobert J.

2018,A Literary Journey Underground,"Newsbook In his annual State of the State address today, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, of New York, spoke about New York City’s transit crisis. Here are three books in which writers explore the politics and complications involved in building the nation’s first subways and provide suggestions for improving public transportation in the United States overall. THE RACE UNDERGROUNDBoston, New York, and the Incredible Rivalry That Built America’s First SubwayBy Doug Most416 pp. St. Martin’s Press. (2014) In this Gilded Age saga, Most recounts the politics, engineering challenges and competition behind the creation of the United States’ first subway systems in Boston and New York. His narrative centers on two brothers, Henry and William Whitney, who were instrumental in the construction of both systems. The idea of a subterranean train was first floated in the late 1800s by the then publisher of Scientific American, Alfred Beach, but it was dismissed. It would take decades for more politicians and engineers to get on board. This book delivers a lively account of a transformational time in American history. MOVEPutting America’s Infrastructure Back in the LeadBy Rosabeth Moss Kanter325 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. (2015) For a broader view, you might consider Kanter’s book, which tackles the country’s transportation system as a whole, including its collapsing bridges and ailing roads, as well as the congestion they cause. Following a 20-month survey, Kanter finds that the United States has leaned on past successes while ignoring mounting problems. She recommends local leaders take decisive action where Congress won’t, and suggests public-private partnerships as a way to accelerate infrastructural improvements. Yet her aim is grander, wrote our reviewer: she wants the country’s citizens “to hop on a bike or take mass transit, to find ways to reduce our dependence on cars.” THIS SIDE OF BRIGHTNESSBy Colum McCann292 pp. Metropolitan Books/ Henry Holt & Company. (1998) This novel follows a homeless man named Clarence Nathan Walker (but called Treefrog), who lives underneath Manhattan in the subway tunnels. Throughout the book, Treefrog weaves together the story of his family and the life he lost. His grandfather, Nathan Walker, a black man, had worked on the construction of those very tunnels, where he found the “equality of darkness” he lacked on the streets above. “McCann’s descriptions of the tunnels and the people who live in them can be surreal,” wrote our reviewer, adding that he paints “a disturbingly beautiful portrait of a family whose dreams are never quite able to stave off the painful reality of their circumstances.”",The New York Times
2018,A Literary Portrait of Richard Avedon Causes Controversy,"Books News The photographer Richard Avedon used to joke that if he ever wrote an autobiography, he would title it “Here Lies Richard Avedon” — a self-referential dig at his tendency to exaggerate and fabricate stories about his past. Norma Stevens, Avedon’s longtime studio director and business manager, recounts this joke early on in “Avedon: Something Personal,” a blend of biography, memoir and oral history that she wrote with Steven M. L. Aronson, a former book editor. It’s both a telling anecdote about her wily subject, and something of a red flag for readers — a sign that some details in the book may have originated from Mr. Avedon’s imagination rather than reality. But exactly how much did Avedon, and perhaps by extension Ms. Stevens, blur fact and fiction? That question has flared up in a dispute over the accuracy of the biography. Last week, the Richard Avedon Foundation called on Ms. Stevens’s publisher, Spiegel & Grau, a Random House imprint, to withdraw the book, arguing that her account is full of errors and falsehoods and could harm the legacy of the legendary fashion and portrait photographer, who died in 2004 at age 81. Spiegel & Grau says it will do no such thing, but will correct errors in future editions. The feud has cast a pall over what was billed as an intimate and revelatory tell-all. Ms. Stevens drew on her own conversations with Avedon over the decades, and interviewed many of his prominent friends and collaborators, including Calvin Klein, David Remnick, Twyla Tharp, Donatella Versace, Jann Wenner and Isabella Rossellini. Some of Ms. Stevens’s revelations about Avedon’s personal life are so juicy that they leaked to the gossip pages in advance of the book’s release on Nov. 21: (The New York Post’s Page Six reported on the book’s description of Avedon’s secret affair with the director Mike Nichols and his sometimes withering views of his colleagues and the celebrities he photographed.) In a release issued on Dec. 20, the foundation compiled a list of factual errors from the book, among them, Ms. Stevens’s claim that she was by Avedon’s side when he died (he was attended only by his family when he died in San Antonio, while Ms. Stevens was in New York City at the time, according to the foundation); that Avedon was paid $1 million a year to join Vogue as a fashion photographer (he signed a contract with Condé Nast that awarded him $1 million over 20 years); and that Avedon photographed his terminally ill father “relentlessly,” taking 50 portraits of him during “fraught” sittings (according to foundation, there were just six portrait sessions). The foundation also claims that Ms. Stevens based parts of the book on an unfinished, semiautobiographical novel that Avedon was working on for years before his death, in which he blended elements of his past with fiction. “Stevens appears to be lifting various stories out of this fictional work, lightly editing and rewriting them, and then presenting them as both her own work and as biographical fact,” James Martin, the executive director of the Richard Avedon Foundation, said in a statement. Mr. Martin said he read parts of Avedon’s novel in progress after his death, when he was sorting through his files and packing them up. He said he asked Ms. Stevens what she wanted him to do with the manuscript, and she said she would take care of it, and took the box and put it under her desk. (When asked to provide examples of overlapping passages from the novel and the biography, the foundation declined to do so.) Spiegel & Grau rebutted the foundation’s claim. “Norma Stevens did not copy or use a Richard Avedon novel in any way in writing “Avedon: Something Personal,” the company said in a statement. “The Avedon Foundation has made loose, unsubstantiated allegations of copyright infringement without presenting any documented instances of substantial similarity between our book and another work.” Ms. Stevens was not available to comment for this article, a spokeswoman for Spiegel & Grau said, but the publisher defended the work: “The book is an important and meaningful account by the person who was in a privileged position to observe and know Richard Avedon as well as anybody else and to reflect on him.” Ms. Stevens worked with Avedon closely for nearly 30 years, and had a front-row view of his celebrated, glamorous career. Before he died, Avedon indicated that he wanted to name Ms. Stevens as the executive director of his foundation, and she ran it for five years. Ms. Stevens notes in the book that Mr. Avedon often urged her to write about him, and to make it an honest and unsparing portrait. “The best portrait is always the truth. Make me into an Avedon,” she said he told her. In a career that spanned nearly six decades, Avedon revolutionized fashion photography and took revealing portraits of some of the biggest cultural giants of the modern era, including Ezra Pound, Charlie Chaplin, Bob Dylan, Marilyn Monroe and Allen Ginsberg. His works were exhibited in museums around the world and collected in books and exhibition catalogs, including “Observations,” which featured text by Truman Capote, and “Nothing Personal,” with text by James Baldwin. But while his portraits of others were often shockingly intimate, Avedon himself kept much of his private life, including questions about his sexuality, shielded from public view. His archives are closely held by the foundation, and 13 years after his death, no one had published a significant book about his life before Ms. Stevens and Mr. Aronson. Some of Avedon’s close friends, family members and collaborators have expressed doubt that Avedon urged Ms. Stevens, who is not an author, to write about him and include scandalous revelations about his private life. “I think he’d be horrified,” the actor and director Andre Gregory, a close friend of Avedon, said in an interview. “He was one of the most discreet men I’ve ever met.” John Avedon, the photographer’s son, called the biography a “collection of either half-truths, or outright falsehoods, embellished into often salacious stories,” and cited two specific passages in which he is referred to — including a macabre one in which he prepared a meal containing his deceased father’s ashes, mistaken for oregano — as false. He said that his father, who was famously controlling over the way his work was presented, had never seemed keen on the idea of a biography. “On the one occasion in which I raised the topic my father made it abundantly clear that he had no desire to participate in, or be the subject of, a biography,” Mr. Avedon said in an email. “The whole idea was anathema. My father wanted to be remembered for his life’s work — his photographs.” Other friends of Avedon were livid at how their relationship with him was portrayed. Nicole Wisniak, the founder and editor of the French-language magazine Egoiste, said in an email that Ms. Stevens “has chosen to completely lie about the nature of my relationship with Dick.” Adam Gopnik, a writer for The New Yorker and a close friend of Avedon who was interviewed by Ms. Stevens and Mr. Aronson, said that Ms. Stevens “misrepresented” her project and told him that she was writing an oral history of the Avedon studio, not a biography. He also said that the words attributed to Avedon in the book sound out of character for him. “It would be a source of grief to Dick to find himself the subject of a posthumous tell all, a genre he loudly, and often, despised,” Mr. Gopnik said in an email. The most reliable source on whether Avedon would have approved of the book is, of course, no longer alive. But Avedon addressed questions of truth, fiction and accuracy when discussing his own photographs, in ways that suggest he was skeptical that any art form, even photography, could fully capture its subject. “There is no such thing as inaccuracy in a photograph. All photographs are accurate,” he said. “None of them is the truth.”",The New York Times
2018,A Long-Lost Composer Is Raised From the Dead,"Critic’s Notebook Near the end of a performance on Sunday evening, nine people emerged from the audience to join the four pianists playing. Arranging themselves a few to each piano, these interlopers began to press the keys, too, for a climactic effect that eventually matched the rich, chaotic peal of a full carillon of church bells. It took a village to complete the work, “Crazy Nigger,” one of the brooding late-1970s pieces to which the composer Julius Eastman gave bluntly confrontational titles. And it has taken a village to raise Eastman (1940-90) from the dead, where he and his music languished for years, unheard. The performance on Sunday, at the Knockdown Center in Queens, was part of the essential festival Julius Eastman: That Which Is Fundamental. Organized by the artist Tiona Nekkia McClodden and by Dustin Hurt of Bowerbird, a Philadelphia arts organization, along with members of the curatorial team at the Kitchen in Chelsea, it is the latest marker in the ongoing restoration of a crucial artist. It continues. Go, on Tuesday at the Kitchen, to an evening exploring Eastman’s dance collaborations. And on Saturday there, for the reincarnation of his unruly “Trumpet” and the intense “Holy Presence of Joan D’Arc,” for 10 cellos. See, until Feb. 10, an exhibition blending archival riches and contemporary reverberations. Not so long ago, such a dense revival of Eastman’s work would have been impossible. Destitute and mentally ill in the late 1980s, he fled New York City and made his way to Buffalo, his former home, where he died in a hospital of causes that remain vague. By then he was so distant from the artistic scene of which he was once a vibrant member that it was only when The Village Voice published an obituary in January 1991, eight months later, that his old friends and collaborators found out he was gone. His scores had years before been destroyed or vanished; recordings of them were more or less nonexistent, and none released commercially. A vital career seemed entirely lost. First in Buffalo, whose state university campus was a new-music hotbed, and then in another hotbed, the downtown New York of the ’70s, Eastman had been the charismatic center of the party — sweet-natured, arrogant, exuberantly provocative. His compositions radiated confidence; his solo-piano improvisations balanced conviction and meditation; his bass voice, in music by Meredith Monk, Peter Maxwell Davies and Frederic Rzewski, was a formidable mixture of reverberation and clarity. All that was stilled, long before he died. It was because of the determination of a small circle of advocates — particularly the composer and performer Mary Jane Leach, who had worked with Eastman in the 1980s — that material began to reaccumulate. Archival recordings and scores were discovered and released; transcriptions were created. The past decade has seen a trickle, and then a relative flood, of performances. Younger composers of what could be called a Post-Post-Minimalist bent, like Nico Muhly, have recognized Eastman’s importance; John Adams has included his works in concerts with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. That a major American symphony orchestra would be programming “Evil Nigger” — it’s in Los Angeles on Feb. 20 — would, I think, have delighted Eastman, who certainly never relished obscurity. Had he not died, his brother, Gerry, told the audience at the Kitchen on Saturday, performances of his works would need Carnegie Hall or Yankee Stadium to fit all those who would want to hear them. It doesn’t fill Carnegie — yet — but this music found alert and enthusiastic audiences over the past few days. Clangorous and forlorn, forceful then suddenly tender, it makes the ears ring and the heart ache. Eastman’s best works — sprawling; seething but slow-shifting — seem to press beyond formal structures and become almost immersive environments. In mood, his work is almost always ambiguous: The loudest moments in “Joy Boy,” mostly a delicate pitter-patter of a piece, might just as easily be cries of pain as joy. Those incendiary-titled late-’70s works rage, but they also grin, plainly proud of a virtuosic pianistic exuberance that recalls Liszt and Rachmaninoff. These performances didn’t sanitize Eastman, but they occasionally smoothed him. “Thruway,” on Saturday, was not the demented happening reported by The Buffalo Evening News in 1970, with “the chorus wandering through the audience as though blind.” At the Kitchen, the chorus of the Arcana New Music Ensemble remained in place for whooshing evocations of wind and waves of babble. A combination of sobriety and cacophony, it had the flavor of a riotous religious service, a reminder that Eastman had his start as a performer singing as a boy in church choirs. It was preceded by the brief “Buddha,” one of Eastman’s final works and one whose instrumentation is unspecified. Here it was recast for a small ensemble and a black, billowing cloud of a choir, an ominous drone with tinges of Romanticism. It showed how much experimentation can still be done with Eastman, as did an arrangement of “Gay Guerrilla” on Sunday for 11 electric guitars instead of the usual four pianos. I wasn’t entirely persuaded — the larger forces tended to diffuse the piece’s tension — but the version brought out the punk, metal and psychedelia in the music. I most relished the return of “Femenine,” a 1974 masterpiece whose anchor is the ceaseless, machine-driven shake of sleigh bells. A vibraphone rhythm keeps calling out, a perpetual annunciation; the ensemble surges and recedes, again and again, moored to a mellow piano; a flute line soars, a kind of benediction. Over 70 minutes, it all makes a teeming, wintry pastoral. At first, I found myself disliking the performance on Thursday by the S.E.M. Ensemble, which long collaborated with Eastman. The sleigh bells were too loud, I thought, the vibraphone not crystalline enough. It was, in other words, different than the recording released in 2016, the way I’d grown passionately to love the piece. But if Eastman’s work is to truly live on, it will be in its divergence from — as much as its fidelity to — the archival evidence. And on Thursday, little by little, “Femenine” surely cast its spell: A community — one made not of unanimity but of communication, negotiation, advance and retreat — formed, and remained.",The New York Times
2018,"A Long-Lost Score, Rebuilt With the Help of a Photo","The death of the composer and performer Julius Eastman in 1990 went largely unobserved, even in the artistic circles he had long traveled in. By then, after a string of misfortunes, documentary evidence of his music had withered nearly to nothing. For those who cherished the work of this inventive firebrand — a conceptualist steeped in dance, Minimalism and jazz-informed improvisation — a restoration seemed deeply implausible. Yet that is what has transpired. The diligent research of scholars like Mary Jane Leach has resulted in the discovery and release of multiple recordings, as well as a 2015 collection of essays called “Gay Guerrilla,” after one of Eastman’s politically pointed pieces. More is still being uncovered. The Kitchen in Chelsea, where Eastman had important performances, has begun a three-week festival, “Julius Eastman: That Which Is Fundamental.” Modeled after a similar presentation in Philadelphia last year, it is organized by the artist Tiona Nekkia McClodden and by Dustin Hurt of Bowerbird, a Philadelphia arts organization, along with members of the Kitchen’s curatorial team. Along with newly unearthed biographical material from the Kitchen’s archives, the festival will also include a performance of a riotous Eastman work, “Trumpet” — written in the early 1970s for seven trumpeters (ideally), or (barring that) seven soprano instruments. While the library at the State University of New York at Buffalo has a recording of a 1971 performance, no part of the score was thought to have survived. But the recent discovery of the first two pages of “Trumpet,” along with a transcription of the Buffalo performance by Chris McIntyre, has made possible what he calls a “realization” of the work, which will be presented at the Kitchen on Feb. 3 by the ensemble TILT Brass. Here are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. McIntyre about the reconstitution. How did the first pages of the score fall into your hands? This gentlemen, Ron Hammond, attended a concert of “Trumpet” at a church in Buffalo. He’s a photographer, and he took photographs throughout the event. He then requested a couple pages of the score. And he just photographed it and superimposed it [over a portrait of Eastman]. Then last year, he saw a profile [of Eastman] in The New Yorker, and it was like, “Oh, wait a minute, I know who that is.” And he went back into his archives, and found that photograph. By then, you were already working on a transcription of the 1971 recording. How had that been going? The plan was just to reverse-engineer, as best as possible, what I’m hearing in my ears. There’s often seven completely different performances happening at once. It was scary. I do assume always with Julius’s work — and it’s certainly audible — that there are improvisational moments for sure. That being said, there are also clearly things that are not improvised. And so in the midst of the chaos, differentiating between those was going to be an almost impossible task. Before I had those pages, I would have said it’s going to take me a year, just to really try and suss it out. But with those score pages, it gave me a much tighter focus. Eastman wrote out seven different opening lines, one for each player. But then, at an early hinge point, the players are supposed to choose one of the first three of those lines to repeat, 10 times. Does that give you clues about the relationship between free choice and scripted requirement in the rest of the score? That amount of freedom kind of winnows and expands throughout the piece. It snaps back and forth between those two perspectives. [In the opening] the pitch material is pretty limited, but it’s really dense. You sort of gather that it is meant to be this kaleidoscopic thing. You have a background in both modern-classical and jazz performance. What goes through your mind when you see Eastman’s indication in the score that “Trumpet” should be played with a “jazzlike” feel? For a long time, I didn’t register the “jazzlike” indication! But “jazzlike,” I think, would probably tell someone new to it that it was supposed to be kind of loose and free and have a certain verve to it. There are jazz players on the recording. They actually do kind of swing a little bit. Your ensemble will have members of TILT Brass and also guests like Jaimie Branch. How did you decide which player takes which part? This is one of those facts of musical life, especially in improvisation: People matter. There’s definitely things I’ve put on Jaimie’s plate, just because it’s Jaimie. When it’s really a [jazz-style] “blowing” moment, you’re going to go to the person in the band whose working method that is. How important is it for everyone to be exactly in sync at the changeovers from one section to the next? My instruction is going to be: Don’t worry about others around you at all. Don’t make it sound like you’re purposely not trying to start with them — but don’t try and start with them. It’s an eschewing of hierarchy. That was really the zeitgeist. Yes, there are certainly melodic fragments here. And people pop out when they play those things. But it’s not really, “Now it’s my turn to shine.” It’s more, “I’m adding to the flow of what we’re all doing.”",The New York Times
2018,A Look Behind the Scenes at the Detroit Auto Show,"The cars get all the attention, but it takes a lot of muscle to make one of the world’s biggest car shows happen. A Dodge display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.CreditCredit The shiny new cars get all the attention. But behind the scenes at the Detroit auto show — officially called the North American International Auto Show — a small army prepares the city’s Cobo Center for the invasion of vehicles and their fans. From the front door to the velvet rope, workers are responsible for setting the stage and dressing the models. Sometimes, that means a fresh coat of mud. Quilted fabric protects fragile items and pristine paint jobs from damage as workers began the task of turning piles of parts into welcoming displays. Once the cars come out from under wraps, they must be primped for the occasion. An artist applied fake mud to a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle to enhance its rugged vibe. Visual appeal is a must, whether a visitor is in Lexus’s lounge area or buying a hooded sweatshirt from the Ram booth. Mercedes-Benz may have dirtied up a G-Class to illustrate its off-road prowess, but it still insisted on a clean floor. The sports cars were not the only thing worthy of being polished by hand. Many hands may make for light work, but the auto industry’s heavy hitters demand that their displays are just so. And once everything was in place, Detroit was ready to unveil the fruit of its labor.",The New York Times
2018,A Look Inside a Rescuer’s Struggle to Save Migrants from Sinking Dinghy,"The footage shows dozens of people clinging to a rubber dinghy as they struggle to stay afloat. After a group of migrants’ overcrowded vessel sank off the coast of Libya on Saturday — an episode in which at least 64 of them drowned in the Mediterranean Sea — the rescue operation was recorded by a member of the Italian Coast Guard as the first responders scrambled to save lives. The group in the dinghy, which migration officials said was aided by smugglers and bound for Italy, became the latest casualties in a continuing crisis. More than 3,000 refugees and migrants died in the Mediterranean last year while trying to make their way to Europe. The deaths on Saturday focused attention on the dangerous central Mediterranean crossing between Libya and Italy, where most of those deaths took place, and prompted calls from the United Nations migration agency for a comprehensive policy to address the humanitarian crisis. “This is the beginning of the year, and this is quite dramatic after only eight days,” said Flavio Di Giacomo, an agency spokesman. According to survivor accounts collected by the United Nations agency, smugglers had packed more than 150 people onto a flimsy rubber dinghy on the Libyan coast. The vessel began to take on water after eight or nine hours at sea. People panicked and fell into the water. When the Italian Coast Guard arrived, it rescued 86 people from the water and retrieved eight bodies. Dozens more remain unaccounted for and are presumed dead. Mr. Di Giacomo said smugglers must be held accountable for their role in the deaths. “If you let an unseaworthy dinghy with 150 people sail, that could never handle all of these people,” Mr. Di Giacomo said. “With this sea, in January, it’s not an incident anymore, this is a crime. The smugglers are committing a crime.” Most of those aboard the vessel were from sub-Saharan Africa and included people from Cameroon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. The survivors were transported to Catania, a port city on the east coast of Sicily, on Monday. At least five children between 2 to 6 years old drowned. There were also four children, ages 2, 3, 9 and 10, among the survivors, one of whom lost her mother. The episode was not the only one to take place in the area over the weekend. On Sunday, 270 other migrants were rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard, probably from more than one dinghy, according to Mr. Di Giacomo. The rescue crew recovered 12 bodies. “This is not an emergency in terms of numbers, but this is a humanitarian emergency,” Mr. Di Giacomo said. He said the only way to halt the continuing deaths in the Mediterranean was to organize a comprehensive rescue operation and provide alternative ways for migrants to travel to Europe. “There are no regular ways to come to Europe,” he said, “so the only ways for migrants to come is to rely on these unscrupulous smugglers and traffickers.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Loving Cup Comes Home, to the 92nd Street Y","In 1900, the Manhattan philanthropist Jacob H. Schiff received a surprise gift from some people he had helped: a silver trophy the size of a punch bowl. Officially known as a loving cup, it is inscribed with text in ruffled and blocky typefaces, thanking him for financing the Young Men’s Hebrew Association building on Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street. In 2016, the trophy surfaced unexpectedly at M.S. Rau Antiques in New Orleans, and in March, it will go on public view in a mirrored hall at the facility Mr. Schiff helped found, now known as the 92nd Street Y. Jo Frances Brown, who runs the 92nd Street Y’s programs for seniors, spotted the trophy at the store, and the Y bought it for about $25,000. One side is etched with an image of the original four-story Neoclassical building, which was razed and replaced with the current structure in 1928. Henry Timms, the executive director of the 92nd Street Y, said the upcoming display of the object is timed for celebrations of a fund-raising campaign for $180 million worth of renovations, additions and other upgrades. No one knows who designed or made the trophy; the only prominent mark on its base is a cryptic “3154.” Joseph P. Brady, a silver historian and appraiser in Atlanta, said he suspects the maker was the Whiting Manufacturing Company, a New York business known for applying elaborate fonts on custom vessels. He added that it is not unusual for forgotten trophies emerging on the market to be repatriated by the families or institutions that had originally commissioned them. “They do end up back where they belong,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,A Maine Racetrack Didn’t Lure Amazon. Multiply That Disappointment by 218.,"SAN FRANCISCO — There were 218 communities whose proposals did not reach the second round in Amazon’s well-publicized search for its second headquarters. For those ambitious but unlucky folks, there were no “thanks for entering” gift baskets or any consolation prizes. Tom Hall, town manager of Scarborough, Me., had just returned from a meeting about the clam harvest when he heard the bad news from a reporter. He took it philosophically. The town’s proposal to convert a 500-acre harness racing track in the center of Scarborough was, he knew, “the longest of long shots.” In Oklahoma, there were more regrets. “I’m certainly disappointed,” said Scott Phillips, who ran a development team called Day 1 that promoted a proposal to build an entirely new 50-square-mile city for Amazon between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, equidistant from each. “Amazon missed an opportunity to include more out-of-the-box thinking in their list of finalists from proposals like ours,” he added. For the cities that were not one of Amazon’s 20 finalists, that D-word kept coming up. Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said he was “disappointed” twice in a brief interview, adding that the whole process was “great publicity” for Amazon. “This news is certainly disappointing,” the team that promoted Buffalo and Rochester said in a statement. “Very disappointed,” said the Bay Area Council, which had submitted a bid on behalf of San Francisco and four neighboring cities. Amazon’s obsessive desire to please its customers has created a fearsome retail juggernaut and made its founder, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new. Yet it was perhaps inevitable after the way Amazon turned its search for a second headquarters, which it announced in a blaze of publicity in September, into such a beauty contest. Even with unemployment low, the stock market booming and the economy chugging along, the prospect of landing as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs from Amazon aroused the excitement of politicians everywhere. “When they rolled this idea out, the narrow description they used really only defined about 30 cities,” said Mr. Phillips of Day 1, referring to how Amazon had said it was looking for a metropolitan area in North America with at least a million people, among other criteria. “Maybe they truly thought only 30 cities would apply. The fact that 238 did probably caught them off-guard.” Scarborough, for instance, was probably not on Amazon’s radar. It is on the Northeast coast, just south of Portland, and has a population of about 20,000. The simplicity of the application process, which involved answering nine questions, providing data and touting the city, “encouraged us and several hundred others who did not have a viable chance to make the strongest possible argument why it should be us,” said Mr. Hall, the town manager. “There’s value in thinking and articulating that.” Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up? “This new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,” Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging. Mr. Hall said he had received “no word whatsoever” from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, “All the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls.” (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.) Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk. Jason Lary, the mayor of Stonecrest, Ga., who had offered to create a town named Amazon and make Mr. Bezos “the mayor, C.E.O., king, whatever they want to call it,” did not return calls. A spokeswoman for Tucson, which had also applied, said, “We are in an all-day off-site meeting,” adding that she could not be interviewed. The letdown followed a rush of antics by cities across North America to entice the retailer with tax breaks and publicity stunts. Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus. The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon’s public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos’ growing wealth and power. For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process — which will continue for months — is “reality show” theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said. Amazon, he said, “wants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids.” “From a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,” Mr. Rolnick added. “From a national perspective, it makes no sense.” Some elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done. “It was like ‘The Apprentice,’” the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa’s mayor, G. T. Bynum. “I loved the process. Amazon, to their credit, made it a public and transparent one. Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don’t even know what company is interested.” Not all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that. One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point. However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something. Apple, which has been criticized for doing most of its production in China, announced this week that it would open a new domestic campus. (Apple did not mention a location.) Taking advantage of the new Republican tax plan, which allows a one-time repatriation of cash, Apple signaled it would bring back most of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and add 20,000 new jobs in the United States. “Second headquarters are the thing of the future — the companies are getting too big for a single market,” said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon’s second headquarters. Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation. “If Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba” — the Chinese internet retailer — “is willing,” said Mr. Phillips. His efforts to build a corporate city, he said, will continue. There is, however, the problem of the name. “Day 1” is a pet expression of Mr. Bezos, symbolizing how his company’s opportunities are always right in front of it. “We’ll probably look for a better brand,” Mr. Phillips said, and then reconsidered. “If someone wants to take on Amazon, maybe keeping it ‘Day 1’ will offer the added ability to mess with Bezos’ head a little.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Mayor, a Governor, and the Feud That Keeps New York Down","About New York All of a sudden, in the midst of three days of existential struggle with the governor over the transit system, Mayor Bill de Blasio turned up in the subway on Monday evening. Perhaps it was merely for the purpose of getting from one place to the other, and if so, the use of mass transit rather than the customary mayoral S.U.V. does not seem to have done him any harm. If it was for political reasons, it does not seem to have done him much good. All Tuesday, surrogates for Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo spoke to reporters, kicking the blame ball back and forth in a game that gets more pointless by the day. Last week, the governor floated two ideas that would amount to profound changes in the city without consulting the people actually elected to run it. Both of the proposals, it should be said, have a lot going for them. One is a fee on vehicles in the busiest parts of Manhattan, and the other is the creation of special tax districts on property around new transit projects. The mayor and his surrogates have more or less been stamping their feet and saying this amounted to usurpation of local taxing power, the city already pays a big share, the governor’s forces do not speak with them, and besides, the transit system blows a lot of money on wasteful projects. These points have some truth in them. So does the rebuttal from the governor’s camp: that the mayor already has the power to veto big transit spending. Still, does the governor really need to micromanage the streets of Manhattan when he already has under his jurisdiction 55,000 square miles of New York State, from the Canadian border to the tip of Montauk? Is any public good served by not talking to the mayor when you want to change taxes and transportation in the city? The governor’s command of detail has given him a portfolio of accomplishments throughout his public life. But micromanaging can curdle. It turns out that last summer, the governor’s office fiddled with statistics on the reasons for transit delays, as Dan Rivoli reported in The Daily News. In a cache of emails, senior officials struggled to blame more delays on Con Edison than the utility was genuinely responsible for, which an analyst had put at 3,422 annually. “How would you massage that language?” a press secretary for the governor wrote to a transit official. “Could we say ‘power-related issues caused more than 32,000 delays?’” Sure, you could say that. It would be no less than 99 percent dishonest, but you could say it. If someone fell or jumped on the track and the power was turned off, the trains that could not run on time would be categorized as “power-related delays.” If a piece of track equipment failed and the power had to be shut off while repairing it, that, too, could be counted as a “power-related delay” — and not the fault of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. By this logic, people who kick out the cord to the television in their living rooms could curse Con Edison, rather than blame their own clumsiness. Thanks to this abuse of language and arithmetic, the figure of 3,422 Con Edison delays was swollen beyond recognition when the governor walked the tracks and spoke to reporters on Aug. 9 in the Columbus Circle station. “We’re looking at the largest single cluster of delays, which are 32,000 power-related delays,” Mr. Cuomo said that day. “What people tend to forget is the M.T.A. runs on power.” Asked about this on Monday, after The News’s exposé, Mr. Cuomo said he had relied on figures sent to him by the M.T.A. Thereafter, transit officials did back flips trying to say that the naked manipulation of data was not naked manipulation of data. It was. It is. Andy Byford, the new president of the subway system, declined to endorse the counting techniques used by his agency. When Mr. Byford was introduced as the transit leader in November, I asked him what he thought about the governor’s practice of bypassing the chain of command to directly call superintendents within the system. “That’s the governor’s prerogative,” Mr. Byford said. “He’s the governor.” But he’s not the mayor. New York City’s wealth, and its role as an economic engine for the state and the nation, depend on mobility. A show of hands, please, from all those who believe that it is possible to improve, or at least passably fix, New York’s transit system if the governor and the mayor cannot figure out how to work together.

2018,A Mega-Dealer Expands: David Zwirner Plans a New Art Gallery,"On a cold weekday afternoon on an upper floor of one of his Chelsea galleries, the art dealer David Zwirner pointed out the window at a corner lot on West 21st Street that is under demolition. That, Mr. Zwirner said, is the site of what in the fall of 2020 will become the new heart of his New York operation: a five-story, $50 million gallery designed by Renzo Piano. Mr. Zwirner is announcing this plan for the future even as he is looking at the past — with a 25th-anniversary exhibition featuring the artists who have shaped the gallery’s program since its founding. He is also celebrating the present with the inauguration this month of his first Asia gallery in Central Hong Kong. “As fortune favors the brave, we are looking back exactly when we’re opening in Hong Kong and looking forward,” Mr. Zwirner said. At a time when many small and midsize galleries are being priced out of the business because of the costs of prime real estate and proliferating art fairs, Mr. Zwirner’s expansion is bound to elicit grousing about mega-dealers’ taking over the world. To be sure, watching Mr. Zwirner gaze out at the property that will soon give him a third gallery in Chelsea, his fourth in New York City and seventh in the world inevitably conjures a general surveying his spreading empire (an image helped by what The New Yorker once described as his “Caesar haircut”). But though the tall, clean-cut Mr. Zwirner, 53, has established himself as an ambitious entrepreneur — second only to Larry Gagosian’s operation in size and prestige — he has also made clear that he is a savvy businessman. His gallery brings in well over half a billion dollars a year with 165 employees, including many who have worked for him for years, and a growing stable of over 50 artists and estates. Some in the often-backbiting art world undoubtedly resent his success, particularly since he has managed to draw some artists and estates from other galleries. Among Zwirner’s recent conquests are the artists William Eggleston and Felix Gonzalez-Torres (whom he shares with Andrea Rosen), as well as the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation. Yet even many of Mr. Zwirner’s competitors also concede that they like and respect him. “He’s managed to do it with quality and style,” the longtime dealer Robert Mnuchin said. “That’s hard to do sometimes when you’re aggressive.” Mr. Zwirner said he is aware of the pitfalls of overexpansion. As a result, when he opens the new gallery, he is likely to close his West 19th Street location, a rented space. He will keep his other Chelsea gallery, on West 20th Street, but “the center of gravity will move over to 21st Street,” he said. (He will also keep his gallery on the Upper East Side.) “I feel very acutely that there is a too-much that’s possible,” Mr. Zwirner said. “You water down what you do.” At the same time, he said he is conscious of trying to achieve that elusive balance of any big dealer these days: being attentive to the artists — with personal contact and regular communication — as well as ambitious for them, placing their work with leading museums and top collectors (who won’t just turn around and try to sell it for profit) and providing international exposure. “Artists want you to stay small; they hate when stuff changes,” said Mr. Zwirner, who was born in Cologne, Germany, and speaks with a slight accent. “How do you keep it intimate while being able to compete in the increasingly competitive art market?” “On the other hand, if you don’t move, some artists will feel you’re not doing enough for their careers,” he continued. “They want to have intimacy, but they also want to have the reach.” Lisa Yuskavage, who joined the gallery in 2006, said that she was at first “surprised and disappointed” when Mr. Zwirner said her primary contact person would be one of his directors — Hanna Schouwink — rather than Mr. Zwirner himself. But she found Ms. Schouwink to be “nurturing and competent.” “I call him the Wizard of Oz,” Ms. Yuskavage said. “He does have all of these people running Oz.” For prominent artists and estates like those in Mr. Zwirner’s fold — Dan Flavin, Donald Judd — that means having a presence in the most important art centers, which increasingly includes Asia. And it also means having the most impressive headquarters in New York, which is what Mr. Zwirner seems to be going for with his new building by Mr. Piano — the architect’s first commercial gallery. “It will upgrade the quality of my spaces, and that is something attractive for all these people that I need in my life — the artists and the people who work here,” Mr. Zwirner said. The new gallery will be at 540 west 21st Street, part of a project that is being developed by the investor Uri Chaitchik of Casco Development. The gallery will be connected to Casco’s residential tower, but it will be a separate structure, with three floors of galleries. The precise design has yet to be determined — Mr. Piano is in the early stages of the process. But it is likely to have a similarly spare aesthetic to Mr. Zwirner’s current spaces, by Annabelle Selldorf. Although he loves his Selldorf spaces — and the architect is a friend — he went with Mr. Piano on this project, Mr. Zwirner said, because he was the developer’s choice. So far, Mr. Zwirner said, he has enjoyed working with Mr. Piano, whom he described as “one of my great heroes,” having admired his designs for museums like the Menil Collection in Houston, the Morgan Library & Museum renovation and the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Because this is Mr. Piano’s first commercial gallery, Mr. Zwirner said, “I have to remind him we don’t need coat checks, we don’t need ticket booths and the size of the lobby doesn’t have to be quite that large.” In a telephone interview, Mr. Piano said he will seek to establish “a visual psychological connection between the building and the street,” as he did with the Whitney Museum of American Art in the meatpacking district. “There is a porosity,” Mr. Piano said. “In this building, it will be the same thing. Its very important.” Mr. Piano’s museums have been acclaimed for balancing a focus on the art with architectural distinction. “You kill art by making just white boxes, so you need to integrate emotion in some way,” he said. “You cannot be neutral, because otherwise you disappear.” Groundbreaking is to take place this spring. Meanwhile, to celebrate its quarter-century, Zwirner Gallery has invited all of its artists to contribute a work for an exhibition that will open on Saturday. The show will occupy all the gallery spaces in Chelsea. The show will include new work by established artists like Richard Serra and On Kawara, as well as work by artists like Gordon Matta-Clark. Some pieces are being lent from museums and much of it will not be for sale. Mr. Zwirner said his favorite in the show is a diagonal slash of fluorescent by the lighting artist Mr. Flavin, which the dealer described as “an icon of minimalism.” To watch Mr. Zwirner flip through a binder holding images of the works is to travel through the last 25 years of modern and contemporary art, accompanied by quick bits on their historical importance from Mr. Zwirner, whose father, Rudolf Zwirner, was a prominent European dealer. To critics who question the corporate nature of Mr. Zwirner’s operation, Mr. Zwirner said they have only to look to the art — namely the acclaimed exhibitions the gallery has presented in just the last year — like the show of Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Rooms that had people lining up around the block in the cold; the exhibition of Alice Neel’s paintings and drawings; and the quirky installations of Mr. Gonzalez-Torres. “The reputation is in the quality of the shows that we put up,” Mr. Zwirner said. “You can say a lot of things about the gallery, but what do you say about the shows?” Mr. Zwirner can’t help but look back fondly on starting out with 1,600 square feet on Greene Street in SoHo, where he opened in 1993, with the sculpture of Franz West, whose heirs recently decided to return to Zwirner. There was a Friedrich air-conditioner in the window and barely any heat. “There was a simplicity in the early days that was charming,” Mr. Zwirner said. “The transition from what was classically a mom-and-pop operation to a global business — it’s much more complicated.” An earlier version of this article misstated the opening day of Zwirner’s 25th-anniversary exhibition. It is Saturday, not Friday.",The New York Times
2018,"A Memory Shortcut, With a Little Help From Friends","Humans formed social networks long before social media, so why not put them to use? “Always remember everything,” my mother is fond of saying. Of course, as she knows, this is impossible, even with advanced memory techniques. That’s why we take notes and use calendars. These are components of our external memory, which are parts of our extended minds. That your mind may not be entirely housed within your skull may be difficult to grasp. In their seminal paper, the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers made the case that some functions we perform with other objects should be considered on par with thought that occurs in our brains. Using pen and paper to help perform a calculation is one example. Many people, myself included, manipulate words on a page (or the digital equivalent) to figure out what they think about a topic or to develop an argument. That the communication channels between paper (or screen) and brain involve vision and the movement of fingers rather than only the firing of neurons makes not a whit of difference, Mr. Clark and Mr. Chalmers argue. The end result is the same as if we had done the entire calculation or written the entire essay in our heads. “What matters is not where stuff is encoded, or in what medium, but the uses to which it can readily be put,” Mr. Clark said. Working on a computer offers an analogy. “It doesn’t really matter whether some piece of information is stored on your hard drive or in the cloud, as long as it’s usually ready for access when the need is there.” This leads to memory extension, which is more cut and dried. To enhance biological memory, everybody consults external media and objects. We take — and later, revisit — pictures to remember vacations, weddings and other events. We store the memory about what to wear tomorrow by laying out our clothes tonight. We make grocery lists. You may protest that the things in which this information is stored — photos, the location of clothing, a scrap of paper — are not very mindlike. Perhaps on those grounds you object to calling that which they convey to us “memories.” Maybe only minds can remember things, and the rest are merely recall aids. But this argument breaks down when considering the vast amount of information we don’t store in our heads, but is easily and reliably retrieved from elsewhere. For example, we may not know, and never remember in our heads, the cast of “Game of Thrones,” but we know how to find out. And we need not commit it to (our biological) memory because we can always look it up. When we do so, we’re not using the information source to remind ourselves what’s already in our heads. The information isn’t there, and it may never be. Yet, as if it were, we can retrieve it whenever we like by other means. That’s memory extension. We’ve gotten so used to relying on external memory on our smartphones that we store less in our heads than we otherwise might. One study showed that we are less able to recall information we expect to be able to search for on the web — and instead have better recall for how to find it online. Another study found that people who took pictures of artwork in a museum were less able to recall the artwork and their locations than those who visited the museum without snapping photos. Those of us old enough to remember life before smartphones used to memorize important phone numbers. Few do so now or even try. We could, but why bother? There’s another type of memory extension that is even more mindlike. We routinely extend our memories by using other people’s minds, and our minds serve as memory extenders for others. Anyone with children is constantly remembering things for them — what time they need to be at soccer practice, where it is, what they need to bring. My children know the names of many other children and their parents, a resource I draw on regularly at family social events because I often forget — or never knew — them. Paying close attention to this kind of external memory is of some professional value. A few years ago, my work demands began to overwhelm my ability to remember important information. Using some mental tricks helped, but I still couldn’t keep up. So I switched strategies. Recognizing that there was some redundancy in remembering certain things that others knew, I gave up trying. Instead, I made more of an effort to keep track of the areas in which each of my colleagues was expert. If they have the information stored in their minds, and if I can access those minds relatively easily — for instance with a quick email or even a tweet — there’s no need for me to remember that information. For example, if I need to know about which nutrition studies to trust, I could simply ask my colleague Aaron Carroll, who just wrote a book on the topic. But what if I encounter a colleague using the same approach, and we both think the other is doing the remembering? When I worry that might be the case, I ask: “Am I keeping track of this or you?” That settles it. In fact, I end many meetings or email exchanges at work just this way. Once a plan of action or a solution to a problem is worked out, I make it clear who has ownership of it and will make sure crucial information isn’t lost. At home, my wife and I are explicit about who is handling which follow-up to the myriad demands associated with my children’s school and extracurricular activities. Whatever is on her plate (i.e., in her head), I largely forget about. Whatever is on mine, I better remember! Humans have been using this kind of mind extension forever. Passage of information from brain to brain orally was the norm well before writing. We’re social animals and formed social networks long before social media. We’re accustomed to relying on one another for information as much as anything else. So remembering who said what or who knows what comes naturally. Harnessing this to strategically store and retrieve memories from other people’s minds is not a big leap. It relieves you from trying to do what you can’t do anyway: always remember everything.",The New York Times
2018,A Minneapolis Hotel With Northwoods Style (and Flavor),"CHECK-IN The Hewing Hotel has the spirit of the state, from the loons in the wallpaper to the cedar sauna on the roof. Doubles start at $159. The handsome red brick warehouses that cluster north of downtown Minneapolis near the Mississippi River speak to peak 19th-century commercial traffic on the waterway and nearby rail lines. Many have more recently been reclaimed by some of the city’s most buzzed-about restaurants (including the Bachelor Farmer) and stylish shops (MartinPatrick3). Now the Hewing Hotel, opened in 2016 in a prominent warehouse that once stored farm equipment, pays homage to one of those trades — logging — in six stories of wood-framing, flooring and paneling. Channeling the spirit of an urban lumberjack, massive, rough-hewed posts picket the sunny lobby filled with low-slung leather couches. Patterned wallpaper featuring fish and moose and retro accessories on library shelves including vintage hockey gloves mirror Minnesota’s affinity for the outdoors. Minnesotans have returned the love, crowding the hotel’s ground-floor restaurant and bar Tullibee, which champions the bounty of the region with a Scandinavian accent. Fittingly, there’s a sizable sauna and outdoor hot tub on the rooftop, as well as a bar. The Hewing resides in the gentrifying North Loop neighborhood, part of the Minneapolis Warehouse Historic District. Target Field, home to the Minnesota Twins, is within a few blocks. The Guthrie Theater, just over a mile downriver, is a quick Uber ride away. The MetroTransit Blue Line nearby links the neighborhood to the airport and the Mall of America beyond. The hotel’s 124 rooms benefit from the building’s warehouse origins with high ceilings, generous windows and exposed brick walls. Visible duct work lends an industrial edge, softened by full length drapes, a leather library chair stationed beside a floor lamp, plaid throw blankets from the regional Faribault Woolen Mill Co. and the occasional use of Minnesota-motif wallpaper featuring deer, loons and boat oars in a pattern suggestive of Scandinavian folk art. Darkly stained wooden bedside tables with leather pulls repeated the organic theme, while a desk with open shelves veers in a modern direction. Mini bars deal local products including Tattersall Gin, Spruce Soda and Thumbs Cookies. While there is no coffee maker in the room, management provides free SpyHouse Coffee every morning in the lobby. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile and rectangular porcelain sinks brighten the bathroom, though an ax, framed behind glass and apparently quoting the timber theme, made me think of emergency fire equipment. My ADA-compliant room, number 228, had a generous walk-in shower and a rain-forest shower head. Toiletries come from the grape-seed-based 29 by Lydia Mondavi. Guests are well-advised to make a dinner reservation at Tullibee when they reserve their room. The Nordic restaurant occupies half of the hotel lobby and the cocktail crowd sipping old-fashioneds commonly spills into the other half. Its chef Bradley Day, a native of Australia, seems to embrace the northwoods larder at Tullibee, named for a rare fish found in Minnesota’s deep lakes. The menu changes often but regularly features foraged and fermented ingredients as well as house-butchered meats. Recently, he gave Caesar salad a regional spin with aged Gouda and smoked smelt dressing, made his own lamb sausage and baked both bread and ginger cake in tiny Bundt pans, a salute to the local Nordic Ware cookware company that developed the popular ring pans. The restaurant is open for breakfast too; try house-made lefse, a traditional Norwegian flatbread, with cured ham. The top-floor hot tub, bar and 24-person cedar wood sauna are part of the Rooftop social club, open to members and guests who pay a fee. The pool and sauna are restricted, but the public can patronize the indoor/outdoor rooftop lounge in the evenings. For a different kind of sweat, there’s a fitness center and separate yoga room in the basement. The backwoods goes big city at the Hewing Hotel, where woody interiors and rustic décor warm the industrial setting, and dishes like pork wild rice sausage at its restaurant Tullibee feed the lumberjack spirit.

2018,Opinion | A Minor Miracle on Ice at the Olympic Games?,"Sporting I make my living as a hockey writer. I’m also as big a fan of the sport as there is, and I love Olympic hockey. But now that N.H.L. players won’t represent their countries in the Pyeongchang Games, will I even watch? For hockey fans, the N.H.L.’s decision to send its players to the Winter Olympics beginning in 1998 was a dream come true. There had been major international tournaments, but never with these sorts of stakes on this big a stage. Finally, fans would get a true best-on-best Olympic tournament played in front of a worldwide audience, with dream rosters and genuine suspense over who would win the gold. Through five Olympics, fans witnessed some of hockey’s most memorable moments, from Dominik Hasek’s brilliance in Nagano, Japan, to Sidney Crosby’s golden goal in Vancouver. When the N.H.L. said it would not send players to the 2018 Games, many of us assumed it was a bluff. Surely some sort of last-minute deal would be found? But it wasn’t a bluff. Fans were furious; players were furious. After the anger, the question: Is it worth watching? I’ve struggled with that question. I’m old enough to remember Olympics tournaments from the days before N.H.L. players arrived; they were fun, unpredictable and often wildly dramatic. The 1980 “Miracle on Ice” victory by the United States over the Soviet Union still ranks as one of the most famous moments in the sports history. To this day, kids on ponds around the world still try to pull off Peter Forsberg’s one-handed shootout move from the 1994 Sweden-Canada gold-medal game. On the other hand, once you’ve had the best, going back to something else feels underwhelming. It’s tempting to write the whole thing off. But I don’t think I will. This year’s tournament won’t feature the best, but there are plenty of fascinating stories to follow. Few of them ever expected to have an Olympic opportunity, and for most, this will be their one and only shot. Team U.S.A. will come in with heavy hearts but plenty of inspiration after the team’s general manager, Jim Johannson, the longtime national program executive, died unexpectedly on Sunday at age 53. And while the roster he built isn’t quite the ragtag squad of underdogs that won the hearts of Americans in 1980, they’re not far off. The captain is 39-year-old Brian Gionta, the diminutive forward last seen finishing out his N.H.L. career on some miserable Sabres teams. There’s Chris Bourque, son of the Hall of Fame Bruins defenseman Ray, and several college players, including Boston University’s Jordan Greenway, who’ll become the first African-American to represent the United States in Olympic hockey. And there’s Bobby Butler, a minor leaguer and former N.H.L. winger who warmed hearts when a video of him telling his dad he would be playing for Team U.S.A. went viral. That’s not Auston Matthews or Patrick Kane. But maybe it doesn’t have to be. Team Canada fans hoping to see Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid will have to settle for names like former N.H.L.ers Derek Roy and Mason Raymond. Or they can root for the defenseman Chay Genoway: An undrafted long shot, he dreamed of making the N.H.L., and he did — for just a single game, in 2012. That’s one better than Mat Robinson, who never made it at all, and neither did the team’s oldest player, 37-year-old Chris Lee. Then there’s goaltender Ben Scrivens, an undrafted Cornell graduate who spent almost his entire five-year N.H.L. career playing in three of Canada’s most high-pressure markets — Toronto, Edmonton and Montreal. He built a devoted fan base through a thoughtful social media presence, and his wife, Jenny, was a goaltender for the New York Riveters of the National Women’s Hockey League. Unlike the members of previous Team Canada rosters, these guys don’t have N.H.L. playoff races to return to when it’s over. Instead, they’ll be playing in easily the most important games of their careers. In a way, that feels like what the Olympics should be. The Czech team will be captained by Martin Erat, a veteran forward who played almost 900 N.H.L. games. But he’s probably best remembered by the league’s fans for something he had no control over — a disastrous 2013 trade in which the Washington Capitals gave up their best prospect to acquire him. That prospect, Filip Forsberg (no relation to Peter), is now one of the league’s best young forwards, while Erat has been out of the league for almost three years. As a 24-year-old in 2006, Erat was on the last Czech team to win a medal. Now, at 36, he gets one last bid for glory. And if you really can’t get excited about Olympic hockey without the presence of genuine N.H.L. star power, there’s always Team Sweden. Their roster will feature the teenage phenom Rasmus Dahlin, a ridiculously skilled defenseman expected to go first overall in the next N.H.L. draft. At 17 years old, he’ll be the fifth youngest player to ever appear in the men’s Olympic tournament. There’s no point pretending that any of it will feel like Matthews vs. McDavid, or Crosby bearing down on Henrik Lundqvist with a gold medal on the line. But the N.H.L.’s decision to pack up its pucks and go home has left both a void and an opportunity. The players looking to fill it aren’t the best in the world or even all that close; many of them will make less over the course of their careers than Crosby or Kane take home in a month. It won’t be the same, and we know that. But it might be two weeks of triumph and heartbreak and yes, maybe even a minor miracle or two. That should be enough. I’ll be watching to find out.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Modest Immigration Proposal: Ban Jews,"Bret Stephens Until his dying day, my dad’s Uncle Bern was a communist sympathizer. I remember him as an affable old man with a gracious wife who made a modest living selling antique lace. He probably wouldn’t have hurt a fly. Yet he found much to admire in the most murderous ideology of the 20th century, responsible for tens of millions of deaths from the killing fields of Cambodia to the gulags of Murmansk. If you’re Jewish in America, chances are there’s at least one Uncle Bern somewhere in your family tree. As the scholar Ruth Wisse noted last year in Tablet magazine, Jewish intellectual life in the 1930s and 40s was largely defined by one’s stance toward one thing: The Party. Historians reckon that Jews accounted for nearly half the Communist Party’s total membership in those years, while many other Jews were close fellow travelers. Most of these people, like my great-uncle, were deeply misguided idealists who otherwise led quiet and decent lives. A tiny handful of others — including atomic spies Julius Rosenberg, David Greenglass, Harry Gold and Morton Sobell — betrayed America’s most important military secrets to Stalinist Russia and did incalculable damage to the country and the world. Here’s a thought experiment: Would the United States have been better off if it had banned Jewish immigration sometime in the late 19th century, so that the immigrant parents of Rosenberg and Sobell had never set foot here? The question is worth asking, because so many of the same arguments made against African, Latin-American and Muslim immigrants today might have easily been applied to Jews just over a century ago. Consider some of the parallels. Crime? In 1908, the New York City police commissioner, Theodore Bingham, caused a public uproar (for which he later apologized) when he claimed that half the city’s criminals were Jews. The truth was closer to the opposite: Jewish crime rates, at about 16 percent, were considerably lower than their roughly 25 percent share of New York’s overall population. The same goes today, when, contrary to much Trumpian propaganda, incarceration rates for immigrants are nearly half what they are for native-born Americans. Racial desirability? Just as Donald Trump wants more Norwegian immigrants and none from “s-hole countries,” the early 20th-century eugenicist, conservationist and immigration restrictionist Madison Grant was obsessed with protecting the “Nordic” races against those he termed “social discards” — including “the Slovak, the Italian, the Syrian and the Jew.” Assimilation? This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked, in an interview with Fox News, “What good does it do to bring in somebody who’s illiterate in their own country, has no skills and is going to struggle in our country and not be successful?” That seems to be the general way of thinking in this administration. Now compare that to a 1907 article in McClure’s magazine, titled “The Great Jewish Invasion,” which observed of Russian Jews, “no people have had a more inadequate preparation, educational and economic, for American citizenship.” Henry Adams, the great American patrician, wrote of “furtive Yacoob or Ysaac still reeking of the ghetto, snarling a weird Yiddish.” In 1914, Edward Alsworth Ross, the famous progressive sociologist from the University of Wisconsin, called Jews “moral cripples” whose “tribal spirit intensified by social isolation prompts them to rush to the rescue of the caught rascal of their own race.” Subversion? During the campaign, Donald Trump said at a New Hampshire rally that Syrian refugees “could make the Trojan horse look like peanuts.” His campaign then infamously called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” Similar charges have long been leveled at Jews. Henry Ford accused Jews of causing the First World War. A generation later, famed aviator Charles Lindbergh charged Jews with trying to inveigle the United States into war. Lindbergh was the leading champion in his day of “America First.” Still later, Jewish “neocons” somehow became the shadowy instigators of America’s wars in the Middle East. O.K., you get the idea. And it’s worth acknowledging there are often kernels of anecdotal or statistical truth for nearly every ethnic stereotype. Jews were indeed overrepresented in radical political circles. Jewish gangsters — a.k.a. the “Kosher Nostra” — were nearly as notorious as their Irish and Italian peers in the early 20th century. There were Jewish students who rallied against the draft during the First World War, just as many more would rally against it over Vietnam. Yet imagine if the United States had followed the advice of the immigration restrictionists in the late 19th century and banned Jewish immigrants, at least from Central Europe and Russia, on what they perceived to be some genetic inferiority. What, in terms of enterprise, genius, imagination, and philanthropy would have been lost to America as a country? And what, in terms of human tragedy, would have ultimately weighed on our conscience? Today, American Jews are widely considered the model minority, so thoroughly assimilated that organizational Jewish energies are now largely devoted to protecting our religious and cultural distinctiveness. Someone might ask Jeff Sessions and other eternal bigots what makes an El Salvadoran, Iranian or Haitian any different.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Monument the Old South Would Like to Ignore,"Margaret Renkl NASHVILLE — In 1978, the city of Nashville leased 18 acres of a Civil War monument to a local businessman who wanted to start a new baseball franchise — the Nashville Sounds, then a Double A expansion team for the Southern League — and needed a place for his team to play. It was a ludicrous arrangement from the start: a privately owned ball field built on public land. And not just any public land. Greer Stadium was built at the base of St. Cloud Hill, where the Union Army erected a stronghold after taking control of the city in 1862. Fort Negley was an investment designed to protect the Union’s hold on Nashville and its strategic access to roads, railroad lines and the Cumberland River. Fort Negley Park is not a Civil War monument in the South that celebrates the heroism of the Confederacy, in other words. Fort Negley Park is a Civil War monument in the South that celebrates the preservation of the United States of America. The question of what will happen to it has roiled Nashville for more than a year. In part, that’s because it’s a crucial site for African-American history as well. During the war, the grounds surrounding Fort Negley served as a de facto refugee camp for escaped slaves. In an irony lost on no one today, the Union Army immediately forced those refugees into service; under brutal conditions, some 2,700 of them built Fort Negley itself. Many lost their lives and are believed to be buried at Fort Negley Park. When the South surrendered, the survivors — joined by other freed slaves — settled there. Today the area is gentrifying, home to new art galleries and coffee shops, but it is still populated largely by low-income African-Americans. In their midst now lies one badly overgrown and dilapidated minor-league ball field. Greer Stadium has sat empty since the Nashville Sounds departed at the end of the 2014 season. As part of a preserved Civil War site, the stadium’s location has long been designated as public parkland, going back to 1928, when the city bought it from the descendants of John Overton, a longtime crony of President Andrew Jackson. That parcel was always meant to revert to parkland once the Sounds decamped. The actual fort at Fort Negley Park was dismantled after the Union Army withdrew in 1867, but history set its hand on the site a second time during the Depression, when a facsimile of the fort was rebuilt there by 800 laborers funded by the Works Progress Administration. That reproduction ultimately fell into ruin and for decades was closed to the public, but 1996 brought a plan to restore the site again. Fort Negley reopened in 2004, on the 140th anniversary of the Battle of Nashville. The next year it was designated a National Historic Landmark District. Three years after the Sounds left, Mayor Megan Barry released a request for proposals related to the site of the old stadium. The request was not for Metro Parks to create a plan for desperately needed green space in an already overpaved urban core. The request was not for the Metro Historical Commission to create a plan to preserve the legacy of African-Americans who gave their lives to preserve the Union. It was not a request for the Friends of Fort Negley, an advocacy group, to create a plan to expand the educational reach of the site. The plans the mayor requested were for private development under a land-lease arrangement much like the one that allowed Greer Stadium to be built there in the first place. Let’s call what happened next the second Battle of Nashville. For years this city has been undergoing rapid, unchecked growth, and it desperately needs affordable housing and subsidized work spaces for artists and innovators. That much everyone agrees on. When the mayor’s office approved a plan by the Cloud Hill partnership, headed by the developer Bert Mathews and the music producer T Bone Burnett, for a mixed-use private development that would include music and art studios, retail space and housing at three price points — affordable, work force and market rate — it made a kind of sense. But an army of green-space advocates and historic preservationists quickly mobilized to point out what would seem to be obvious: Nashville owns a lot of land, and there is no good reason to allow for-profit development in a park with huge historic significance. For an entire year, Betsy Phillips, a local historian, published article after article in The Nashville Scene, looking at every possible angle for understanding the importance of Fort Negley, particularly its significance to African-American history. The bottom line, she wrote in December, is that we preserve historic sites for future generations because “we don’t know what the future might need from the past.” The best-selling historical novelist Robert Hicks, an advocate for preserving Civil War historic sites, entered the fray. A Nashville council member sued Metro government, arguing that the mayor’s office didn’t follow city rules in granting the development contract. The country music legend Kix Brooks took to Facebook to plead for preserving the integrity of the park. Historic Nashville Inc., a nonprofit that each year releases a list of the nine most endangered historical sites in the city, took the unprecedented step in 2017 of naming only one: Fort Negley. The Friends of Fort Negley, led by the historian Clay Bailey, took a multipronged approach to raising the site’s national profile. It petitioned the Tennessee Historical Commission to designate Fort Negley Park a “historical memorial,” a label that under state law means a site cannot be altered without a waiver from the commission itself. With help from Nashville’s N.A.A.C.P. chapter, it submitted a proposal for Fort Negley to be included in Unesco’s slave route registry — the first United States site to be nominated for this international recognition. The group produced a website and a video summarizing the issues for a public that was finally tuning in: In its annual Open Season on Open Spaces report, the Cultural Landscape Foundation in Washington recognized Fort Negley as one of 13 nationally significant landscapes in need of protection. And all this was happening against the backdrop of a national debate about Civil War monuments. Defenders of monuments to Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate generals most often at the heart of these contentions, are fond of pointing out that such statues weren’t erected to celebrate the institution of slavery; they were erected to celebrate Southern history. The anti-monument contingent rolls its eyes at this argument: If not for antislavery sentiment in the North, the South would never have seceded. It’s important to note that Southern attitudes to Civil War monuments are not uniform, though the pro-con divide typically follows the rural-urban divide. In 2015, Nashville’s Metro Council voted to petition the Tennessee Department of Transportation to plant obscuring vegetation in front of a truly hideous statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest on I-65. The giant statue is visible from the highway to anyone entering the city from the south, but it stands on private land, and for that reason the department declined to intervene. Never mind that the T.D.O.T. itself removed the obscuring vegetation back in 1998, when the statue was first erected. Last month activists took matters into their own hands and painted the statue pussy-hat pink. The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act was passed in 2013 and updated in 2016 with what seemed to be an express intent to prevent municipalities in Tennessee from taking down Confederate memorials. (Yes, this is the same act currently being invoked to protect Fort Negley.) Last month city leaders in Memphis found a novel way around the state’s intrusion into municipal decisions: They sold two city parks to a nonprofit. Within hours of the sale, statues of Nathan Bedford Forrest and Jefferson Davis had been removed. On Jan. 12, back in Nashville, the development controversy finally came to a close when an archaeological survey commissioned by the city found it “highly likely” that the former slaves who built Fort Negley are still buried there. Cloud Hill formally withdrew its development proposal, and it’s not clear what will happen to the Greer parcel now. Nashville’s 2018 parks budget does not include funding for bulldozing Greer Stadium and returning it to parkland, but Mayor Barry recently acknowledged that the presence of slave graves changes the way the old baseball stadium should be approached. “The likelihood of graves means that we should reassess plans for this site so as to better honor and preserve the history of the men and women who died in the construction of a fort that helped save the Union,” she wrote in a statement. “As we move forward, I want to see that whatever happens with the Greer Stadium site will honor that history, while bringing the community together around a shared vision. I have faith in the ability of all stakeholders to work together to identify and coalesce around this vision.” It’s fair to assume that the supporters of other Civil War monuments around the state of Tennessee will not be coalescing around this vision to preserve a site that celebrates a different kind of history, but the Friends of Fort Negley is moving ahead with plans of its own. Last Thursday it announced that Kix Brooks will serve on a new committee. Its goal: to unite Nashville around a plan — and funding — for a reunified Fort Negley Park.",The New York Times
2018,A Mother’s Determination Withstands Years of Tumult,"The Neediest Cases Fund Franklin Matthias took his first steps, with the aid of a walker, when he was 3 years old. His mother, Clementine Matthias, was too stunned, too elated, to photograph the moment. She had been told that her son would most likely never walk on his own, and so his solitary paces came with much celebration. His premature birth had yielded myriad complications, including cerebral palsy and autism. Yet on a recent afternoon in the Bronx, walking home from school, Franklin, 14, moved with such brisk, determined strides that his mother and 9-year-old sister, Nevaeh, lagged yards behind. He stopped at every street corner, never leaving his mother’s gaze. The scene of unity followed some tumultuous years for the family, which experienced a period of homelessness and was briefly fractured by a jail sentence for Ms. Matthias. Being apart from her children for those months propelled a commitment to conquer the harmful, longtime compulsion that put her in that situation. Ms. Matthias’s parenting is a tribute to her own mother, whom Ms. Matthias leaned on heavily for wisdom and support all her life, especially when she learned she was going to be a mother herself. Her son was named after her father, who died in his early 30s. “Frankie was Frankie from the time I started believing there was a baby inside of me,” said Ms. Matthias, 50. “Girl, boy — it was going to be Frankie.” In June 2003, Ms. Matthias went to a Bronx hospital after she began spotting at 23 weeks. She suddenly went into labor. Five minutes after her water broke, Franklin arrived. He was 11 inches long and weighed barely more than a pound. “They went right to work on him,” Ms. Matthias said. “Now I’m not the patient. Franklin’s the patient.” Doctors were panic-stricken, and nurses were crying, Ms. Matthias said. She recalled the callousness of some of the staff members, who tried to reassure her that she could try again if Franklin did not survive. Her family, including Franklin’s father, kept constant vigil in the neonatal intensive care unit. Ms. Matthias wrote in a journal every day her son was there. The most brutal entry came on Day 12, when Ms. Matthias was told her son was unlikely to survive the night. The family gathered in the hospital chapel to pray, with one exception. Ms. Matthias’s mother paid a private visit to Franklin, telling him: “Your mother’s waited a long time for you. If you pull through for her, she’s going to stick with you.” Franklin survived the night. And after more than 100 days in the hospital, 73 of them on an incubator, he was released on Sept. 24 and taken home with his parents. “We got Frankie,” Ms. Matthias said. “There’s nothing and nobody that can take him away from us now. It’s a matter of just keeping him healthy, as healthy as possible.” Ms. Matthias remains a ceaselessly doting mother to Franklin, who is largely nonverbal and legally blind. His various disabilities are the source of many challenges, and in the years after his birth, Ms. Matthias also endured two miscarriages. In 2008, Ms. Matthias learned she was pregnant again, this time with Nevaeh, which came with its own conflicting emotions. “I thought I was being selfish to take any time or any more of my heart away from Franklin and give it to somebody else,” she said. Nevaeh was brought home from the hospital five years to the day from Franklin’s discharge date. Ms. Matthias gushes about her daughter’s compassionate, spunky soul, calling her the “ultimate big sister” to Franklin, despite her younger age. “She’s my glue,” Ms. Matthias said. On the walk from school, Nevaeh displayed equal care for Franklin, at one point lifting his book bag back onto his shoulders after its straps slipped down, loosely binding his arms behind him. Hardship struck in late 2013. The family lost their Section 8 apartment, forcing Ms. Matthias, her children and their father into a homeless shelter. The unfamiliar surroundings affected Franklin’s mental health, causing him great anxiety. Ms. Matthias feared that Nevaeh felt ashamed. And the stress reignited a dormant vice for Ms. Matthias: shoplifting. “It gave me a high that I couldn’t find anywhere else,” she said. “When you’re doing it, you just think you’re being mischievous.” Whenever Ms. Matthias stole, she said, the item was frivolous, the action done solely for a momentary rush. In spring 2014, the habit sent the family careening into disarray. After a court appearance related to a shoplifting charge, Ms. Matthias bought a birthday present for her nephew and then went to a Walmart, where she stole baby formula, which she had no need for. She was arrested on the spot. When she returned to court, she was charged with petty larceny. The judge accused her of endangering her children, which sent Ms. Matthias into hysterics. The city’s Administration for Children’s Services took Franklin and Nevaeh into custody. “I was mush,” Ms. Matthias recalled. “For the first time, I felt totally helpless.” She served 56 days in Westchester County Correction, during which she missed Franklin’s birthday and Nevaeh’s kindergarten graduation. Her guilt and shame were so overwhelming that she refused to have her children visit. After Ms. Matthias’s release, she sought immediate help from Children’s Aid, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Social workers helped her regain custody of the children less than two months after her release. Ms. Matthias and her children’s father separated around the same time, though he is still involved in their lives. She and the children re-entered the shelter system. In late 2014, Ms. Matthias began attending Cleptomaniacs and Shoplifters Anonymous meetings. Receiving Nevaeh’s forgiveness was a huge boost to her willpower, she said, but the meetings were vital to understanding that she was not the only one battling such a compulsion. They also pushed her to stay mindful of her actions’ consequences. “I know the right direction is to always look for the help that I need,” Ms. Matthias said. “If I don’t know what direction I’m going, I know where to go to get the help.” Ms. Matthias’s support network has a hole since her mother, who used to call Ms. Matthias and her children every day, died in March 2016. “I miss that lady,” Ms. Matthias said in a pained whisper. In late 2016, the family secured a new apartment in the Bronx. Finances remain tight. Ms. Matthias, who does not work, receives $735 in Social Security disability for Franklin, $100 in welfare and $180 in food stamps each month. Social workers at Children’s Aid used $1,500 in Neediest Cases funds to buy the family new furniture. Ms. Matthias says Nevaeh is thriving in school. Franklin recently transitioned into a specialized high school, and Ms. Matthias says she has few worries about his development. When she cries, the tears she sheds are for her mother. She knows one day her children will face the same loss and takes comfort in her belief that Nevaeh will never leave her brother’s side. “I know she’s going to be there for him,” Ms. Matthias said. “When I’m gone, they got each other.”",The New York Times
2018,A Mummified Child’s Remains Show Signs of a Modern Scourge,"Trilobites Speckled with lesions across its dried, ghastly face, the nearly 500-year-old child mummy buried in a church in Naples, Italy, was long thought to be the earliest evidence of smallpox during the Italian Renaissance period. But decades after researchers first examined it, a group of scientists has taken another look at the toddler’s remains and discovered that it most likely suffered from a different scourge: the hepatitis B virus. The finding, published Thursday in the journal PLOS Pathogens, provides further evidence that the hepatitis B virus has afflicted humans for centuries. Today more than 250 million people live with the virus worldwide and it killed nearly 900,000 people in 2015, mostly through liver disease, according to the World Health Organization. “This very common and nasty bug has been with us at least 500 years, and I suspect it may have been here many, many thousands of years,” said Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Sydney and an author on the paper. The mummified child, who died at two years old, was buried in the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples during the 16th century. The researchers who have worked there acknowledge some of the emotional challenges to studying the toddler’s remains. “There’s this hollowness yet this ghostlike pain still there which is fascinating from a scientific perspective but horrific from a parental perspective,” said Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University in Ontario and an author of the recent paper. In the crypt, the child’s coffin rests near dozens of other wooden burial boxes, some of which held the bodies of Aragonese princes and Neapolitan nobles. Their corpses were clothed in decorated woven fabrics and precious silk. Many were embalmed but some were naturally mummified by the dry conditions of the basilica. “The mummies of San Domenico Maggiore are unique in Italy not only for the antiquity and excellent state of preservation of the bodies,” Gino Fornaciari, a paleopathologist at the University of Pisa and an author of the paper, said in an email, “but also for the fame of the personages, whose lives and causes of death are well known.” Dr. Fornaciari first studied the child mummy in the 1980s. Using an electron microscope he found what he thought were traces of smallpox, also known as variola virus, in its remains. Since then the child has served as a quintessential example of early European smallpox. That made it a prime target for Dr. Holmes and his colleagues who have tried to map out the timeline and diversity of the smallpox virus. In 2016, Dr. Holmes and his team had found traces of smallpox in a 17th century Lithuanian mummy. By re-examining the Naples mummy with molecular tools, they expected to push back the timeline of smallpox in Europe another hundred years. “That was the hope, that this would be a slam dunk,” Dr. Poinar said. “But it’s never a slam dunk when you think it’s a slam dunk.” Instead, when they sequenced the genome of the child mummy and performed their molecular analysis they found no trace of the smallpox virus. But they did find evidence of the hepatitis B virus. At first they did not pay much attention to the finding. Then they realized that a symptom of hepatitis B infection in children is a facial rash called Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. They thought perhaps the hepatitis B virus caused the dots on the child’s mummified face. They performed another molecular analysis and found that the genetic information they extracted from the ancient hepatitis B virus resembled that of a modern-day hepatitis B virus genome. To the researchers, that was a red flag for contamination. They spent the next year and a half trying to figure out whether they had actually found traces of ancient hepatitis B virus, or whether instead the virus they found was a contaminant from one of the researchers who uncovered the mummy in the 1980s. As hepatitis B infections were common in Italy at that time, Dr. Poinar said it was possible that the virus signals they saw were from contamination. Further analysis showed that the genetic material from the hepatitis B virus they found on the mummy was damaged in much the same way that genetic information from the mummy itself was damaged. That indicated that it was similarly as old. But to further corroborate their hunch, the team performed an evolutionary analysis using several other old strains of hepatitis B virus, and found that the virus itself evolves very slowly. That suggests that in a period of about 500 years, the hepatitis B virus has not changed much. Dr. Poinar and Dr. Holmes said they are confident that they found perhaps the earliest evidence of hepatitis B infection in Italy, but would not completely rule out the possibility of contamination. “I’m 80-20 at this point, or maybe 90-10, that it’s not contamination,” Dr. Poinar said.",The New York Times
2018,A Museum’s Fresh Take on the Whole Megillah,"Art Review The Jewish Museum is housed in one of New York’s most ornate mansions: a French chateau sitting right on Fifth Avenue. Yet if you walk into its new permanent collection displays — airy, spotless, with light gray walls and freshly poured concrete floors — you may find yourself wondering if you’ve been teleported to Chelsea. Earlier this month the museum reopened its permanent collection galleries on the third floor of its extravagant home, which after 25 years had become dowdy and cramped. Working with the architect Calvin Tsao of the firm Tsao & McKown, the museum has undertaken a surgical renovation, excising a staircase and exposing clerestory windows onto Central Park. Stuffy wall texts have been replaced by short panels in a zippy sans-serif typeface, part of a larger rebranding by Sagmeister & Walsh. Up here the building feels freer and friskier, and the collection presentation does too. Where the previous permanent collection display aimed to narrate 4,000 years of Jewish history, in roughly chronological order, the new one, “Scenes From the Collection,” takes a fractured, impressionistic tack. Artworks and artifacts are freely intermingled in broad groupings, with no regard for the timeline. It’s an adventurous revision, and follows a vogue for nonchronological hangs that privilege thematic links over historical progression. The trend dates at least to the opening of Tate Modern in London in 2000, and institutions such as the Brooklyn Museum and Atlanta’s High Museum followed suit. When it works, such anachronism can reveal unexpected connections across time. Just as often, this approach (especially in the Tate’s case) can favor superficial similarities over historical rigor. We’ll see how the Jewish Museum plays it going forward. “Scenes From the Collection” will be rethought and refreshed every six months. What we can say now is that the display puts visual art, not just Jewish history, at the museum’s heart. It also assumes a fair amount of familiarity with Judaism; unlike the previous presentation, it declines to enumerate basic facts about the religion, from the nature of monotheism to the demographics of the diaspora. Walking away from a “master narrative,” in favor of discrete “scenes” (as an introductory text here states), the Jewish Museum now offers a nimbler and lighter perspective on art and faith. In places, this feels exciting; in others, the curators may have scrapped too much and added too little. In “Constellations,” a grab bag of an opening gallery, artworks and Jewish ceremonial objects play off one another in aesthetically pleasing, if historically nebulous, counterpoint. A papier-mâché costume of a golem (a mythical creature brought to life from clay) designed by Robert Wilson for a stage production stands next to an ornate dress of the sort worn by Sephardic brides in 19th-century Morocco, garlanded with gold ribbons and passementerie. A vitrine of chanukkiyot, or nine-stemmed menorahs, is smaller and more judiciously curated than one from the previous collection display, and includes examples from baroque Germany, 18th-century Venice and big-hair Los Angeles of the 1980s, where the Memphis designer Peter Shire crafted a cantilevered candelabra of pastel steel. Early paintings by Mark Rothko and Eva Hesse reveal two young refugees, one from imperial Russia and one fleeing Nazi Germany, feeling their way to new visual languages. There are fluffed notes. A Torah ark from Sioux City, Iowa, dating to 1899 and featuring a profusion of carved lions, eagles and flora, stands next to an equally ornate but far more rigid portrait of an Ethiopian Israeli by Kehinde Wiley that, as so often in this painter’s work, drowns complex political and historical circumstances in formulaic ornament. This is an example of what nonchronological hangs get wrong: favoring easy visual rhymes — in this case carved wood and floral embellishments — over deep engagement with time, place and method. Beyond the ruptured timeline, this is actually quite a conservative way of displaying art — closer to a 17th-century princely collection than a modern scientific museum. Century-spanning juxtapositions have a more illuminating impact in a section of the show called “Personas,” in which you’ll find portraits from three centuries, by Jewish artists and of Jewish sitters. The earliest is a self-portrait from 1814-16 by the German neoclassicist Moritz Daniel Oppenheim, holding a painter’s palette and thrusting his hips in luxurious contrapposto. It hangs alongside Louise Nevelson’s morbid vision of herself, and Lee Krasner’s studious one, both painted more than a century later. In these self-portraits, the challenge of representing oneself also must account for roadblocks that elite art institutions put in front of Jewish artists, and particularly Jewish women. Photographic self-studies by Man Ray, Nan Goldin and Cindy Sherman (raised Episcopalian, and done up here as a bearded magus from a B-list biblical movie), and paintings by Deborah Kass and Ross Bleckner, further explode the notion of a unified Jewish identity. “Scenes From a Collection” works best when it uses anachronism as an interpretive tool, and not just a visual style. That’s especially clear in the excellent gallery called “Signs and Symbols,” which focuses on the Star of David — which, we learn, was initially a pan-religious mystical symbol, and first took on Jewish significance in 17th-century Prague. A marble fragment of a Palestinian tombstone features the familiar hexagram and would have decorated a Muslim grave. The familiar yet still horrifying yellow fabric stars, with the word “Jew” in German or French, appear along side postwar paintings by Morris Louis and Nancy Spero that treat the star as an emblem of both Jewish mourning and universal suffering. A section called “Masterpieces and Curiosities” focuses on a single object: currently, an extraordinary charm bracelet made by Greta Perlman in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, whose modest bangles (a bullet, a lice comb, a miniature ladle) testify to the endurance of individual creation in the face of barbarity. “Taxonomies” follows, a Judaica display that is essentially a cabinet of curiosities, with dozens of shofars, groggers, and Torah breastplates and finials. Elsewhere, television clips from “Transparent” and “Orange Is the New Black” map the influence of Jewish culture in a diverse America, and the endurance of Jewish humor in the streaming age. The museum now credits the reinstallation to “the Jewish Museum curatorial team,” but an earlier news release, from November, named two lead curators. One was Susan L. Braunstein, a senior curator and Judaica specialist who has been with the museum since 1980. The other was Jens Hoffmann, the museum’s former deputy director and a contemporary art specialist, whose relationship with the museum was terminated on Dec. 17 after a review of allegations of sexual harassment. The pair had previously collaborated on a 2015 show, “Repetition and Difference,” that displayed contemporary art alongside archaeological and spiritual materials. “Scenes from the Collection” is a heftier continuation of that project, and expands on its free exchange of art and liturgical objects. Contemporary art, in particular, has a much larger presence than in the old permanent collection showcase. Candida Höfer, the German photographer known for her precise images of interiors, captures the sweeping, angular architecture of a synagogue in Philadelphia designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Nicole Eisenman, the witty and sometimes scabrous New York painter, is represented by a macabre painting of a Passover Seder, in which a young child stabs her gefilte fish with a serial killer’s élan. Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze, an exciting Nigerian-American artist and the youngest represented here, recently entered the museum’s collection with a tender drawing based on a ketubah, or Jewish marriage contract. The drawing integrates Hebrew and English pledges of love with an interpolation of George Hoyningen-Huene’s famous 1930 photograph “Divers.” The woman here wears her hair in elaborate braids, a traditional Ibo hairstyle. (Many Ibo believe they are descended from one of the “lost tribes” of Israel, and several thousand practice Judaism.) As this display recalls, the Jewish Museum gave early exhibitions to leaders of the postwar avant-garde, including Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and presented innovative group exhibitions like “Primary Structures,” curated by Kynaston McShine, who died earlier this month. Yet it rarely integrated art from those groundbreaking shows into its permanent collection. It’s heartening to see the museum’s current leadership taking an early interest in artists like Ms. Onyinyechi Amanze. A supporting player now, she may be a lead actor in this museum’s subsequent scenes.",The New York Times
2018,A Nashville Restaurant That Tastes as Good as It Looks,"Bites Henrietta Red may have an envy-inducing aesthetic — but it also lives up to its image as a place you actually want to be. Henrietta Red, a restaurant in the Germantown neighborhood of Nashville that opened last February, has many of the telltale trappings of Instagram clickbait. While there’s no millennial pink, the black sandwich board and expanse of marble at the bar, coupled with the wishbone chairs and tile-framed wood-burning oven in the dining room, fit a certain envy-inducing aesthetic. But unlike other places that hit those idealized notes, Henrietta Red lives up to its image as a place you actually want to be. Start your meal with something fun — a craft cocktail Jell-O shot, perhaps. The potent, jiggly cubes offer reassurance that, despite the restaurant’s cool interior, it’s O.K. to relax. They come are offered in flavors like Fernet and Coke, are served skewered, and, like liquid cocktails, come with a garnish. Next up are more things to slurp. One of the goals of Julia Sullivan, the chef and an owner, who opened the restaurant with the general manager and sommelier Allie Poindexter, was to fill the void in Nashville’s oysterscape. A small, perfectly nice selection hailing from both coasts, Canada and the Gulf, comes with a seasonal mignonette (in our case, juicy watermelon) in addition to the usual condiments. The best oysters, though, come out of the wood-burning oven, slathered with a grassy pesto-like green curry then cooked until custardy. But the sleeper hit of the raw bar was the snapper tartare, a symphony of textures and pastels — gumdrop-tender fish the shade of rose quartz, crunchy lavender daikon and pale green compressed cucumber, punctuated with serrano chile, toasted nori and crispy quinoa. Ms. Sullivan, a Nashville native who previously worked at Michelin-starred spots Blue Hill and Per Se in New York, has a special talent for making humble foods the heroes of a meal. The anchovy butter that comes with the order of warm flatbread is pungent, smoky and irresistibly salty, like the perfect marriage of garlic butter and lox cream cheese. The red leaf lettuce salad, tossed with olives, toasted almonds, Asian pear and pickled turnips, is dressed with a mouthwatering mustard vinaigrette that hooks you anew with every bite. An entree of sausage and beans is in fact a delightfully garlicky, loosely packed pork link made in-house, served with pleasingly firm black-eyed peas and mustard greens, slicked with that same dressing. Desserts, from the pastry chef Caitlyn Jarvis, are a bit more elaborate. A refreshing vegan coconut pudding with melon-y cucumber sorbet, coconut chips, mint “snow” and bits of coconut is one of many superb animal-free options on the menu. “It’s a point of pride for us,” said Ms. Sullivan, whose pistachio-crusted cauliflower steak has been a best seller (currently, there’s a turnip steak in its place). “My mom is vegan, so I knew I had to be prepared.” For fans of more intense desserts, the “malted chocolate” offers up malted chocolate ice cream with whey caramel, crunchy hazelnut-chocolate nuggets and blondie cubes that are fudgier than the finest brownie. It photographs fine. But the food here is best experienced in person. Henrietta Red, 1200 4th Avenue North; 615-490-8042; henriettared.com.

2018,A New Coalition With Merkel? Not So Fast,"ESSEN, Germany — The mood among the comrades was restive. Two dozen members of the local chapter of the Social Democratic Party patiently sat through the order of the day — public toilets, the closure of a slaughterhouse — until discussion finally turned to agenda item No. 8. It was the question all were waiting for: Should their proud but ailing party join Chancellor Angela Merkel in another coalition government — despite having categorically ruled it out for most of last year? “Comrades,” Matthias Vollstedt, the jovial bow-tie-wearing leader of the local party chapter, asked the eclectic group of workers, students, civil servants and pensioners, age 22 to 82, “is there anyone in the room who actually wants this?” Not a single hand went up. Therein lies a potentially major stumbling block not only for Ms. Merkel, but for all of Europe, which has been waiting for Germany to form a government for three and a half months since its inconclusive September election. This Sunday, 600 Social Democratic Party delegates will vote on whether to go ahead with coalition talks. A no vote could send Germans back to elections, potentially signal the political demise of Ms. Merkel, and portend months more uncertainty. Even a yes vote would be no guarantee: Any final coalition agreement will also need the approval of a majority of party members. For the Social Democrats, the issue is not tactical, however. It is existential. The party has lived in the shadow of Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, its traditional rivals, as coalition partners for eight out of the past 12 years. Those governments have been admirably capacious, straddling the political spectrum, but they have also left increasing numbers of Germans feeling that they have been denied a true political opposition. In that time, the Social Democrats have watched their share of support dwindle. When Ms. Merkel took office in 2005, the Social Democrats got 34 percent of the vote. By last September, that share had shrunk to 20.5 percent, their lowest since 1933. Instead, many voters defected to the extremes on left and right: The populist Alternative for Germany broke into the Parliament for the first time, finishing third. Throughout the campaign, the Social Democratic leader, Martin Schulz, seemed aware of the trap for his party, and vowed “never” to go into coalition with Ms. Merkel again. But he has spectacularly changed his mind. Party members like those in the Essen, in Germany’s old industrial heartland, not only feel betrayed. They feel their party’s survival is on the line. “It would be the end of social democracy in Germany,” one said darkly. “Like lemmings jumping of the cliff,” sighed another. “I don’t trust the party leadership anymore, why should voters?” a third added. “We are losing people to the far right,” warned a fourth. And as if on cue, Norbert Radtke, a retired autoworker and party member for 35 years, announced: “If they do this, I’ll quit.” In a rebellious if symbolic vote, Social Democrats in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt have already voted against talks. The Berlin chapter swiftly followed suit. Senior Social Democrats frantically toured the country this week, trying to sway their restive base. Leading mayors and prominent lawmakers from the party’s left wing also urged the party’s rank-and-file to back another coalition, promising a review of any new government two years down the line. The biggest number of delegates — 144 — comes from North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state and home to old steel and mining towns like Essen, where the Social Democrats long had a solid voter base. But that base has been crumbling. “If we don’t find our way back to a social democracy that sets itself apart then not much will be left of this party,” said Arno Bischof, who also attended the meeting in Essen. He is one of five delegates the city will send to Bonn on Sunday. He reckons all five will vote against coalition talks. The last time the party went into a coalition with the conservatives in 2013, members were skeptical, too, but in the end three in four backed it. The pressure to safeguard stability in Germany and Europe weighs heavily again. But many now see a stint in opposition as the only credible hope for the party to reinvent itself and address a much deeper identity crisis that faces the left across the western world. “We still think in old industries,” said Mr. Vollstedt, an infrastructure expert. “We need to think about worker rights in the gig economy and precarious jobs, that’s where we’re needed.” Having rallied behind the neoliberal policies of their center-right rivals for the past two decades, center-left parties have been obliterated from the Netherlands to Poland. But it is the example of Austria that comes up most: There, a longstanding coalition between conservatives and Social Democrats recently gave way to a coalition of the conservatives with the far right. “This is not just about the future of our party, it’s about the future of our political culture,” said Lucien Luckau, a member of the Social Democratic youth movement in Essen. Another grand coalition in Germany would make the AfD the biggest opposition party in Parliament. In parts of eastern Germany, it has already overtaken the Social Democrats as the second-biggest party. “When there is a shift to the right in the country, is it really a good idea to make the far right the main opposition party?” asked Britta Altenkamp, a lawmaker in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. In Essen, the concern about working-class voters switching to the far right is not an academic one. Even Germans with Turkish roots are defecting, said Deniz Ibis, a 30-year-old security worker. Surprised at the AfD’s strong showing in his own heavily Turkish neighborhood, he had asked around. “All of my neighbors voted for the AfD,” he said. Last year, a local Social Democratic city politician and member of 26 years, Guido Reil, defected to the AfD and took a lot of votes with him. An active miner like his father and grandfather before him, he comes from a family of Social Democrats. “I’m still a social democrat,” Mr. Reil said over a nonalcoholic beer in his local bar this week, “only inside the AfD.” He quit the Social Democratic Party over migration policy and a sense that the leadership had “completely lost touch with working people.” The migration issue is front and center for many working-class voters here. Karlheinz Endruschat represents the Social Democrats in the struggling and ethnically mixed north of Essen, which has received disproportionate amounts of asylum seekers since 2015 compared with the wealthier south of the city. “People care about migration, crime, worker rights and pensions,” Mr. Endruschat said. “But let’s not fool ourselves: Migration comes first.” “The way the people in my district talk about refugees, they say things for which you’d get thrown out of the party,” he said. “This is not something they read about in the paper, it’s their daily experience.” There are periodic street battles between local Lebanese clans. The police have had to cordon off the main street several times. Petty crime in the neighborhood, an old miner’s settlement, has crept up, too, locals report. Many women on Mr. Endruschat’s street, his wife included, have applied for a small arms license after being harassed on the street by young migrants. Two years ago, three local Social Democratic politicians caused a stir when they planned a protest demanding a stop on refugees sent to the north. Their slogan was: “The north is full.” The party leadership banned them from holding the protest. In the end they canceled because the extremist Nationalist Party of Germany was planning to join. If another Grand Coalition happens, Mr. Reil, the AfD defector, is certain: “The Social Democrats are finished and the AfD will become the second-biggest force in German politics.” But he does not think the members of his former party will let it happen. Which is why the AfD is already drawing up party lists for new elections. OpinionJochen Bittner OpinionAlexander Görlach",The New York Times
2018,A New Gay Opera: The 8 Best Classical Music Moments of the Week on YouTube,"that decisive moment Our critics and reporters offer a glimpse of what’s moved and delighted them on YouTube. Read the rest of our classical music coverage here. AT 2 MINUTES 44 SECONDS The first sex scene in Gregory Spears and Greg Pierce’s opera “Fellow Travelers,” which had its New York premiere last weekend, begins with vacation plans. “I should take you to Bermuda,” Hawk, a State Department employee in Washington, D.C., says to Tim, an idealistic newcomer from New York. As the men slowly remove their clothes, Hawk (the baritone Joseph Lattanzi) describes tree groves and “sand as white as milk” and repeatedly tells Tim (the tenor Aaron Blake) “I’ll show you.” Once they are finally in bed together, the music swells as they sing “Bermuda!” The music here is beautiful, if a bit wistful. This is a gay romance in the time of McCarthy and the “lavender scare,” and they know that their paradise is “as far away as it sounds.” JOSHUA BARONE Read our review of “Fellow Travelers.” at 4 minutes 15 seconds In his personal, boldly quirky score for “Fellow Travelers,” Gregory Spears combines two seemingly disparate musical styles: American Minimalism and the courtly melismatic singing of medieval troubadours. His fascination with early music permeates an earlier work, his strangely mystical Requiem. Composed in 2010, it’s written for six solo voice and an unusual complement of old and new instruments: pedal harp, medieval troubadour harp, recorder, viola, chimes and electric organ. In some sections, like the eclectic opening of the Requiem Aeternam, you also hear echoes of Minimalism, especially the insistent riffs in the harps, which soon provoke the voices into agitated sputtering. ANTHONY TOMMASINI At 27 seconds On the closing night of this year’s Winter Jazzfest, I caught Maroon Cloud, a group led by the veteran flutist and composer Nicole Mitchell. (She will also have a recent chamber piece presented by the International Contemporary Ensemble this Sunday.) The concert served as yet more confirmation of the cellist Tomeka Reid’s exciting adaptability. Occasionally Ms. Reid spun graceful lines underneath some of the vocalist Fay Victor’s potent improvisations. Later, Ms. Reid offered more harshly striated textures during sections led by the pianist Aruan Ortiz. Early in “Leaving Livorno” — a track from the collaborative string trio Hear in Now, which counts her as a member — it’s the cello that announces a steady, repeating motif. Even when Ms. Reid takes leave of the melodic cell for a contemplative solo, a memory of the earlier groove inhabits her sound. SETH COLTER WALLS AT 8 MINUTES 14 SECONDS “Stromab” (“Downstream”) — a new piece by the Austrian composer Johannes Maria Staud, which the Cleveland Orchestra performed recently at its home in Severance Hall and will repeat on Tuesday at Carnegie Hall — takes inspiration from a horror story, “The Willows,” by Algernon Blackwood. The tale tells of two youths canoeing down the Danube, increasingly overtaken by an ominous, eerie atmosphere and what Mr. Staud calls “a strangely circling sound.” Although he insists that he is not writing program music, an uncanny depiction of lapping, eddying water comes to the fore midway through the piece. François-Xavier Roth conducts the Vienna Symphony in this performance from October. JAMES R. OESTREICH AT 50 SECONDS Concerto Köln’s intermissionless Vivaldi concert at Alice Tully Hall next Wednesday could go by very quickly. If you search out the first movement of “Summer” from its Berlin Classics live version of “The Four Seasons” (with its concertmaster, Shunske Sato, as soloist), you may well find the Allegro non molto tempo too fast at times, however colorfully characterized and undeniably exciting. But it would be hard to argue that the hailstorm of this finale is not Presto — indeed, Presto impetuoso, as it is typically rendered — especially when Mr. Sato tears into his solos. Don’t blink. JAMES R. OESTREICH at 1 minute 56 seconds François-Xavier Roth was back on the podium at the Boston Symphony Orchestra last week, with a program that was practically experimental in these parts: Stravinsky’s “Firebird”; Bartok’s Piano Concerto No. 1, feistily played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard; and, would you believe, Webern. Well, Webern of a sort, at least: his early “Passacaglia,” his first published work and the first piece he finished after concluding lessons with Schoenberg. Mr. Roth took the decadent route through this latest of late Romanticism, with glamour in the sound and a certain pathos throughout. For an alternative, here is Claudio Abbado’s recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, which always sounds to me as if it’s being torn apart at the bar lines. DAVID ALLEN at 2 minutes It seems the star tenor Jonas Kaufmann will actually, finally show up in New York and perform: Having last appeared at the Metropolitan Opera four years ago, on Saturday he will sing Schubert’s song cycle “Die Schöne Müllerin” with the pianist Helmut Deutsch at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Kaufmann sings German lieder elegantly, while still bringing burnished, heroic colorings to his sound. Yet in Siegmund’s melting “Winterstürme” from Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” he does sort of the opposite, singing the opening phrases like a Schubert lied, with lyrical grace and mellow sound. Even when the music shifts mood as Siegmund is overcome with longing, Mr. Kaufmann eases gently up to the ardent high notes. ANTHONY TOMMASINI AT 1 MINUTE Music is impossible to escape at Walt Disney World. Hidden speakers abound, providing a constant soundtrack that changes throughout the parks. Each country in the World Showcase at Epcot gets its own musical shorthand. Germany’s, at least while I was there this week, was a muzak version of the Serenade from Schubert’s song cycle “Schwanengesang.” It was an odd fit for the batch of medieval buildings that represent the country, though perhaps Schubert is easier to swallow than muzak “Meistersinger.” The Serenade lingered in the background but was impossible to ignore whenever the music was at its most sadly beautiful. You can hear one of those moments in this recording, when Ian Bostridge, accompanied by Antonio Pappano, sings, “Des Verräters feindlich Lauschen/Fürchte, Holde, nicht.” JOSHUA BARONE An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a piece being played by the Cleveland Orchestra. It is “Stromab,” not “Abstrom.”",The New York Times
2018,A New Leader for a Troubled New Jersey Transit,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — Kevin Corbett is about to step into what may be the hardest job in New Jersey. On Tuesday, Mr. Corbett, a top executive at Aecom, a global construction and engineering firm, was introduced by Gov. Philip D. Murphy as the next executive director of New Jersey Transit, whose cascade of problems and rampant delays has turned a once model transportation agency into one of the worst commuter railroads in the country. “It’s a phenomenal challenge, but it’s one that is solvable,” Mr. Corbett, 62, said in an interview. “There was a lot of stuff that was done right early on — without getting into why it deteriorated — clearly where it is now, the ability to bring it back is there. It’s leadership.” Nearly 15 months after New Jersey Transit promised an overhaul following a fatal crash in Hoboken, the railroad, the third largest transit system in the United States, is by some measures actually doing worse. Despite being in a state that relies heavily on public transportation for commuters traveling to New York City, New Jersey Transit’s rail ridership decreased last year by 2.3 million trips, or 2.3 percent, from 2016, while its bus ridership decreased by 5.4 million trips, or 3.4 percent. In addition to fewer riders, the list of problems the agency faces is long. On-time performance has sagged. A budget shortfall could top $60 million. It has the second-worst record for mechanical failures in the nation. It has struggled to retain top talent and many key positions were filled with political appointees with no railroad expertise. And, in what some say reflects a troubling culture, the agency has paid more than $10 million in harassment and discrimination settlements since 2012. New Jersey Transit also most likely will fail to meet a federal deadline for installing a modern system to control trains and improve safety. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat who took office this month, has called the railroad a “national disgrace’’ and has made reversing its fortunes a top priority. “Starting today we will begin to measure success by actually getting better, not because New Jersey Transit didn’t actually get any worse,” Mr. Murphy said as he introduced Mr. Corbett at the train station here, adding that the agency was the “linchpin” to greater economic prosperity. But as he stood next to his two choices to fix the state’s infrastructure — Mr. Corbett and Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, his choice to lead the Department of Transportation — Mr. Murphy noted that New Jersey Transit would not be turned around overnight. “I ask for your patience as we start to rebuild this agency,” he said. In an interview, Mr. Corbett said that since word of his nomination leaked last week, he has been hearing from friends wishing him well, but also sharing their grievances. “I’ve had people calling me that’s just like a therapy session,” he said, promising that once he takes charge, “the right kind of people are going to feel like they just had a heavy backpack taken off their back.” Mr. Corbett, whose nomination needs to be approved by the transit agency’s board of directors, said his immediate focus would be on hiring and safety. The deadly crash at the Hoboken Terminal, which killed a woman and injured over 100 people, brought attention to New Jersey Transit’s delay in installing positive train control, an emergency-braking system that Congress said had to be completed by 2015 (the railroad was later granted a three-year extension). But as of last September, only 7 percent of the hardware necessary for new system had been installed, just 125 of the 2,200 components. And of the 1,100 workers who need to be certified for the new system only 137 had completed the process, according to the Federal Railroad Administration The likelihood that the agency can finish everything by the end of this year seems remote. The agency was already fined $12,000 this month for failing to meet deadlines. Even the agency’s tortoise-like progress in introducing the new braking system has proved a challenge — many of the upgraded engines have failed initial testing and have been pulled from service, resulting in canceled trains and furious commuters. Nonetheless, the agency says it is committed to meeting the deadline. “This important safety technology remains a priority, and we work every day to keep it moving forward,’’ said Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for the agency. “At the same time, we are holding our prime contractor, Parsons Transportation Group, accountable to keep the project progressing.” While Mr. Corbett cautioned that there was no “magic wand” to address many of the problems, he believed that with the governor’s support, chronic issues could be addressed. “Phil Murphy is a very pleasant guy to deal with on a human level, but he wasn’t successful at Goldman Sachs by letting people take their sweet time,” Mr. Corbett said of the governor’s previous employer. For riders, delays have become a near-daily frustration. In 2017, one out of every five trains traveling into New York City during morning commuting hours was delayed, a problem exacerbated by summer repairs at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, according to a report filed this month by New Jersey Transit’s outgoing executive director, Steven H. Santoro. New Jersey Transit trains also break down frequently. The most recent data show that the agency had 236 major mechanical failures in 2016, or roughly two mechanical failures every three days, similar to the 240 reported in 2015. When it comes to delays, Mr. Corbett said he can commiserate with commuters — he has been riding New Jersey Transit for more than 20 years. “Every day we felt like it was like fricking Dunkirk,” he said of the commute last summer from his home in Mendham, N.J. “Maybe your train got there, maybe it didn’t.” Mr. Corbett has never run a commuter rail system, but he said that his work at Aecom, which has many contracts with the state, and his role as a member of the board of directors at the Regional Plan Association give him strong familiarity with the infrastructure. Mr. Corbett is hoping to leverage some of that experience, particularly in expediting procurement practices. “Five-hundred days to get a change order through? Contracts?” he said. “Even the people at Amtrak will say, ‘Geez, I thought we were bad, and we take three months.’ ” He recalled a recent visit to a maintenance complex where cars are repaired. He said many cars there had their doors open, exposed to the elements and potentially draining their batteries. “That kind of thing, that’s inexcusable,” he said. “That’s the kind stuff that has to stop as soon as you get in.” The agency has also been hampered by personnel problems. Since 2012, 146 internal complaints involving racial or sexual discrimination have been filed against the agency, leading to 21 findings of probable cause. Thirty-eight cases are pending, and 87 were withdrawn or closed because of a lack of probable cause, according to a document obtained by The New York Times. The agency has also paid more than $10 million in settlements since 2012. Mr. Murphy’s predecessor, Chris Christie, a Republican, placed allies with no transit experience in high-ranking positions, a practice that Mr. Corbett wants to end. “Politics is not my strength,” he said, adding: “If somebody at N.J.T. really is political in nature, good, run for office. You don’t belong in N.J.T.” But whatever improvements Mr. Corbett can make will not necessarily make a difference to riders unless officials in New Jersey and New York can persuade the Trump administration to finance a new tunnel under the Hudson River. The current tunnel, which carries trains for New Jersey Transit and Amtrak, is over a century old, needs to be repaired and cannot handle the demand. Mr. Corbett said he intended to push for a more equitable seat at the negotiating table. “It’s sort of like if you’re going into a casino, if you want to be in the back room with the big boys with the big chips, you can’t go in and say, ‘Well, I only have five cents but I want a seat at the table,’” he said. “You have to pony up.” As for fares, Mr. Corbett said, “that is not my prerogative to promise, I leave that to the board and the governor,” but as a rider he feels an increase would be unfair. “Fares have gone up a lot and you’ve seen a decrease in service, so how do you go back asking for more?” he said.",The New York Times
2018,A New Report on the Las Vegas Gunman Was Released. Here Are Some Takeaways.,"The Las Vegas police took the unusual step on Friday of releasing key details about the continuing investigation into the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news conference that while he was confident that Stephen Paddock was the only gunman, there was another person under investigation who is likely to be charged in the next two months. No charges will be filed against Mr. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, Sheriff Lombardo said. He also said there was still no motive known for the attack. Investigators have uncovered extensive details about the internet search history on Mr. Paddock’s computer, including child pornography, guidance on ballistics and information about SWAT team practices. Law enforcement officials believe Mr. Paddock had recently lost a “significant amount of wealth,” and that may have led him to open fire from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. The police published an 81-page preliminary investigative report detailing Mr. Paddock’s actions in the two weeks leading up to the attack as well as his plans to carry it out. Federal court documents unsealed last week made it clear that Mr. Paddock was meticulously prepared for the operation, the worst mass shooting in modern American history. According to the report released Friday, 851 people were injured in the shooting, including 422 by gunfire. It was the first time Sheriff Lombardo had spoken publicly about the case in more than two months. He said investigators had reviewed more than 2,000 leads and 21,000 hours of video. “I am going against normal protocols,” Sheriff Lombardo said, adding that he hoped the preliminary report would “quell the zest for information.” The report offers extensive details about Mr. Paddock’s actions and planning in the time leading up to the attack. Here are some of the key takeaways: • Mr. Paddock “lived a seemingly normal life,” the investigators wrote, based on numerous interviews with relatives and acquaintances. He began traveling internationally — usually alone — in 2012, going to Europe, Asia and South America, and he took cruises to the Bahamas, Mexico and Alaska. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on Friday released its preliminary report into the killing of 58 people by a gunman opened fire on a crowd from a hotel room in October. • Mr. Paddock complained often to friends and family members about pain and fatigue. But the doctor who had been his primary care physician since 2009 said that the only major ailment he had was from a slip and fall at a casino in 2013, when he tore a muscle. The doctor told investigators that Mr. Paddock was “odd” and showed “little emotion.” While he believed Mr. Paddock may have had bipolar disorder, Mr. Paddock refused to discuss it or take antidepressants, though he did accept anti-anxiety medication. Mr. Paddock often refused to take medication, he said. • Over more than three decades — from 1982 through the fall of 2016 — Mr. Paddock bought 29 firearms, including handguns, shotguns and one rifle. Such purchases accelerated beginning in October 2016: He bought more than 55 firearms in less than a year, mostly rifles. He also bought more than 100 firearm-related items such as scopes, ammunition and bump stocks in the year before the attack. • Ms. Danley told investigators that Mr. Paddock’s demeanor changed during the last year — he became “distant” and “their relationship was no longer intimate.” He became “germaphobic” and had strong reactions to smells. During a stay at the Mandalay Bay in early September, Ms. Danley said he had behaved strangely, and constantly looked out the windows of the room and at the concert venue below from different angles. • Mr. Paddock appeared to begin thinking about a mass shooting last May, searching on Google for “summer concerts 2017” and “biggest open air concert venues in USA.” In early September he searched for “Las Vegas high rise condos rent” and “life is beautiful expected attendance,” a reference to another large outdoor concert in Las Vegas that month. Two weeks later, he looked for “swat weapons,” “ballistics chart 308,” “SWAT Las Vegas,” and “do police use explosives.” • Mr. Paddock stayed in a room at the Ogden condominium complex on Sept. 17, during the Life is Beautiful music festival, requesting rooms that overlooked the downtown outdoor venue there. In video surveillance, Mr. Paddock could be seen taking several suitcases from his vehicle to his rooms. He was always alone and investigators so far “have been unable to determine if Paddock intended an attack during this festival or if he used it as a means to plan a future attack,” the report said. • On Sept. 25, Mr. Paddock checked into room 32-135 at the Mandalay Bay and checked into the room next door four days later, under Ms. Danley’s name. • On his first night at the hotel, Mr. Paddock had dinner at a sushi restaurant inside the hotel and returned to the front desk with five suitcases. The next day, he took seven more suitcases up to his room with the bellman. • On Sept. 27, Mr. Paddock spent the entire night gambling, not stopping until 7 the next morning. The next day, he went to Mesquite and purchased a .308 bolt-action rifle, deposited $14,000 into a Wells Fargo account and transferred $50,000 to an account in the Philippines. He stopped at a gun range before going back to the hotel. He gambled through the night again. On Sept. 30, he brought four more suitcases to his room just before 6 a.m. and two additional one at 3:20 p.m. • On Oct 1., at about 10 p.m., a hotel security guard named Jesus Campos arrived on the 32nd floor to respond to an alarm set off by an open door to another room. He was shot a few minutes later, just after Mr. Paddock opened fire on the crowd below. video",The New York Times
2018,A New School of Pastry Chefs Got Its Start in Architecture,"At C. Ellet’s, a restaurant in Atlanta, an apple strudel arrives at the table. But it doesn’t exactly look like an apple strudel. There are no large chunks of fruit oozing rustically out of a thick band of pastry, no errant raisins or drips of sugary apple juice dotting the plate. The dough is laced with cardamom sugar, oat streusel, apple compote and clarified butter, but from the outside all that’s visible is thin, delicate pastry, rising in a crinkled, cylindrical whirl. When a spoon makes contact, the structure shatters pleasantly, revealing a wayward interior spiral, whose layers encase perfect proportions of fruit to pastry to streusel. The dish is the calling card of C. Ellet’s pastry chef, Jennifer Yee, who makes desserts that are not only visually arresting but purposeful — where every shape and cut serves to build an ideal bite, to create a sense of wonder and surprise. Ms. Yee, who oversees pastry for all the restaurants in the Resurgens Hospitality Group, used to be an architect, and she designs desserts the way she once did building interiors: meticulously sketching every element, testing many prototypes. And these days she has plenty of company: Many of the country’s top pastry chefs have practiced or studied architecture. They include Ron Paprocki of Gotham Bar and Grill, a New York restaurant that since the 1980s has taken a structural approach to dishes, like its signature soaring chocolate cake; Rachel Gibeley of Rosebud American Kitchen & Bar in Boston, who oversees a celebrated pie program with creative flavors like grapefruit-caramel meringue; and Brandi Henderson, formerly of Delancey in Seattle, who now runs the adjacent cooking school and community kitchen, the Pantry. The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer. The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Carême wrote “Le Patissier Royal,” a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients. But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram. “You have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,” lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. “Instagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there’s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it’s not totally visually driven.” Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting — and immediately gratifying — than designing a building. Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls “a real job.” She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments. Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett. She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. “Being an architect is not all about the structure,” she said. “It’s about the intent. How will this improve someone’s life?” “Desserts are also about thoughtfulness,” she added. “What are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what’s grown here? It’s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.” Consider the éclair, Ms. Yee’s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016. Éclairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked. But precision, for her, is only one priority. “I wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,” she said. “When I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.” That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area. “Having studied architecture,” she said, “I can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition — the need for balance and a focal point.” The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee’s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, “so that if a server wasn’t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.” The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability. “It’s a perfect example of balance,” Ms. Lu said. “The shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.” To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don’t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet. Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook “BraveTart,” sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice. “My worry,” she added, “is always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.” Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia. “The usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,” she said. “You can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art — or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn’t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.” But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically. Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: “A and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can’t wing it.” In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, “just like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won’t fall down.” One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there’s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel — all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet. Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. “At first, you’re like, ‘I can’t believe this is a building,’ because the outside looks like a tornado,” he said. “But when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.” At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle’s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background. Since 2015, the second half of the school’s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called “Elements of Design” to the school’s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert. Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. “They have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,” he said. “Pastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.” Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education — tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete. Not everyone endorses this approach, though. “Architecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,” said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. “You are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You’re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.” Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy. Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip. “It resembled a red velvet cake,” he said, “but it didn’t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn’t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That’s the problem with social media. You lose context. Architects are the opposite — we’re invested in the process.” Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

THE MANNEQUIN MAKERS By Craig Cliff 325 pp. Milkweed Editions. Paper, $16. Much has been written and sung about the way distance and the isolation it breeds have shaped the identities of those Europeans who settled in New Zealand. From the music of Split Enz to Eleanor Catton’s novel “The Luminaries,” stories of colonizers who crossed perilous seas to carve out a facsimile of an old society in a strange land are more than familiar. In his debut novel, the New Zealand writer Craig Cliff adds to the canon, but with such ambition, creativity and sheer energy that he shows there’s still something new to say about a national narrative that can seem, at times, to hold no surprises. In “The Mannequin Makers,” Cliff makes real a desolate, windswept country at the turn of the early 20th century and beyond, a place populated by men and women who have learned that life is hard, and that it can be borne only by keeping one’s feelings carefully trammeled. It is the preoccupation of many a New Zealand novel and at the beginning of this one, things seem to fall into a familiar pattern. In the small town of Marumaru on the North Island’s east coast, Colton Kemp’s wife dies while pregnant and, unable to acknowledge what has happened, he goes about his business in town that day without divulging the news to anyone, pretending she is still alive. But there is already an inkling that this will be more than another story about a quiet man: Kemp is a carver of department store mannequins, and not an especially good one. In another establishment across town, his rival, known as The Carpenter, does not have Kemp’s imagination, but his mannequins are startlingly lifelike, incurring Kemp’s bitter jealousy. From there, the tale takes flight in a way that comes close to magic realism, with the characters and events falling into a gothic swoon. In his grief over the loss of his wife, Kemp commits an act so heinous that it sets in motion a story almost Shakespearean in scope. To divulge more would spoil a rollicking plot, but it isn’t revealing too much to say that Cliff’s background as a short story writer gives him a rare skill with the minutiae of structure and characterization. The book is split into four entwined narratives, each from a different point of view, with Kemp’s just the first. A headstrong teenage girl and a man who cannot speak are rich standouts of the book’s second and third acts; Cliff paints the 16-year-old girl as kind and resilient while never overplaying her innocence. It’s one of several tightropes he steps onto with quiet assurance. Later, in mute, elderly Gabriel Doig, the reader is delivered an immensely satisfying account of shipwreck and survival. That the tale is conveyed in writing to another character, because Doig cannot speak, and that it arrives obviously laden with Cliff’s own research of the historical context, could easily have resulted in unwieldy storytelling. Instead, the book soars. In the final section, another change of narrator and a jump forward to 1970s Australia bring about the denouement. This is the only place Cliff seems to falter; he has much to reveal about his new storyteller while also needing to wrangle a sprawling plot. Events unspool perhaps a little slowly in the beginning of this section and then rather too quickly toward the end, leaving the characters’ motivations, and the truths we are eager to learn, somewhat occluded. But this seems a small quibble in a book that makes grand promises and delivers on most of them. At its heart, for all its talk of sailing ships and barren crags, the distance Cliff explores best is the at times unbreachable one that divides people. In Kemp’s mannequins, Cliff illuminates the difference between human beings, dummies of carved wood and the wretches caught in between: people of flesh and blood who look and behave as if they were made of stone.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Non-Gendered Pronoun,"Letters To the Editor: Jennifer Finney Boylan (“That’s What Ze Said,” Op-Ed, Jan. 10) argues that English needs a non-gender-specific pronoun, and that we should therefore accede to any person’s demand to be called by any personal pronoun of choice, as she does for her students at Barnard. I can accept the first part of this argument, but not the second. English, an evolving language, can accommodate a new, standard, non-gendered personal pronoun, and is capable of settling on one after a period of experimental usage, as it did with “Ms.” But to accept anyone’s requested vanity pronoun is to invite chaos, strain the limits of memory and elevate narcissism above consensus communication. It is also to normalize something more dangerous: the deployment of extreme individualism in the service of political power over institutional and linguistic conventions. JESSE LARNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: In a 1947 reader competition, published in the magazine Alphabet and Image, Ian Fleming proposed the idea of a 27th letter of the alphabet. Given today’s gender and identity fluidity, perhaps it’s time to reopen the notion, so that the letter would represent those who eschew “he” or “she,” or as Jennifer Finney Boylan might add, “hir,” “ze” or “xem.” JEFFREY J.

2018,"A Novel That Asks, What if Abortion Were Again Illegal?","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. RED CLOCKS By Leni Zumas 356 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $26. Grace Paley’s collection of nonfiction writings “Just as I Thought” contains a brief memoir of what it was like to live in the United States back when abortions were illegal. Her essay “The Illegal Days” is precise and vivid on the way that criminalizing abortion affected the life of every woman, young or old, pregnant or not, sexually active or celibate. No woman over 10 or under 60 could expect to receive good health care, especially if she arrived at an emergency room with menstrual problems or uterine hemorrhage. When Paley herself was experiencing a miscarriage, the doctor she telephoned begged her: “No! Don’t come,” lest he be suspected of having induced a termination. When a friend arrived at the emergency room of a Catholic hospital, she was told she couldn’t be treated until a test confirmed she wasn’t pregnant; the test would take two days. Eventually the cause of the friend’s bleeding was discovered: not a pregnancy, but a tumor in her womb. Paley writes, “Your life, a woman’s life, was simply not the first thing that hospital had on its mind at all.” How far are we now from all that? Vice President Mike Pence, a man who has already shown his eagerness to restrict abortion provisions, is one impeachment away from the presidency. The possibility that America might return to those repressive days has been rising like a whiff of nightmare, the stench growing stronger and stronger. Leni Zumas’s new novel, “Red Clocks,” imagines a near future in which this country’s laws have changed — by federal decree, abortion is illegal in all 50 states. Unwilling to risk alienating a major trading partner, Canada has agreed to shore up “the Pink Wall” of its southern border, and arrest and extradite women trying to enter the country to have an abortion. In vitro fertilization has also been outlawed, and soon to take effect is new legislation, entitled “Every Child Needs Two,” that will prevent single women from adopting children. Zumas has a perfectly tuned ear for the way measures to restrict women’s lives and enforce social conformity are couched in the moralizing sentimentalism of children’s imagined needs. The new laws’ twin purposes — to force women to have babies they don’t want, and then to stigmatize and undermine the resulting single mothers — are such a clear and well-constructed extrapolation of the current debate that I doubt any reader will need to suspend disbelief for even a moment. “Red Clocks” follows four women living in a small town in Oregon as they grapple with this new reality. Mattie is a gifted teenage student at the local school; a few brief liaisons with her inept boyfriend lead to the inevitable outcome, and to Mattie’s counting her weeks of pregnancy and sifting through her meager options. Her teacher Ro is in her early 40s and trying to get pregnant via artificial insemination. Ro counts days and weeks too, hoping for good news, while working on a book about a 19th-century female polar explorer. Mattie and Ro both have their reasons to consult Gin, an herbalist who lives in the woods and whose tinctures and ointments might offer them a solution — although, as these treatments are illegal, Gin’s clock might also be running out. Ro’s friend Susan has everything Ro wants — two children, a rent-free home given to her by her wealthy parents, the seeming stability of a long-term relationship. But Susan is also marking the days on her own calendar, wondering how long she can last in an angry, bitterful marriage. The friendship/hateship between Susan and Ro, the ways in which each experiences the mere existence of the other as both a reproach and a criticism, is one of the great delights of this lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women’s lives. Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan’s offhand remark that “you don’t truly become an adult until you have kids.” Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro’s questioning her reasons for changing her surname: “How come nobody’s allowed to criticize a woman’s decision to give up her name for a man’s name? Just because it’s her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that—.” Both women keep lists: Ro’s is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it’s a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan’s is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: “Herd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls,” and on and on. Susan’s resentment of Ro’s rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can’t empathize with the single teacher’s loneliness. But Ro’s corresponding resentment of Susan’s full family life means she can’t empathize, either, with her friend’s boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender. If there is a criticism to be made of this highly absorbing novel, it is that it feels perhaps a shade too contemporary, and never quite reveals the horrors that would surely follow if the pre-Roe v. Wade days were to repeat themselves. The one disaster that has occurred — to Mattie’s friend Yasmine — is elided from the action of the novel, and rendered soft-focus and ambiguous. The reader is left to wonder what it would be like to be a pregnant teenager of color under these new laws. Mattie’s journey to try to terminate her pregnancy is far less demeaning and terrifying than the hardships endured by some women living in states with few legal, safe abortion clinics. Gin stands trial, but it’s clear from early on that the forces conspiring against her would have seen her accused of a crime with or without the new laws. Having read one’s Paley, one feels while reading Zumas’s book that yes, this imagined dystopia is terrible, but the reality would be far worse. Maybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming — how like a woman! — hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it’s difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another’s stories. It’s a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women’s lives — for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us. Floating over the narrative of “Red Clocks,” too, is the figure of Eivor Minervudottir, the subject of Ro’s biography. This Arctic explorer’s fierce yet cool interest in the natural world provides Zumas’s suggested answer to the question: What is a woman when she is by herself? If, as Virginia Woolf posited, “a woman must have … a room of her own” — and, one is tempted to add, a womb of her own — to be able to create, then why are we so fearful of what nonsexual, nonreproductive passions could emerge from female solitude? And, if Minervudottir’s tale never quite coheres, never quite touches the rest of the book, then her very ice-floe remoteness becomes a stark reminder of our society’s detachment from a world in which a woman could simply and happily be left alone.",The New York Times
2018,"A Novel That Echoes Naipaul, Exploring the Limits of Freedom","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A STATE OF FREEDOM By Neel Mukherjee 278 pp. W.W. Norton. $25.95 Neel Mukherjee likes to keep his titles a bit abstract, suggesting a mood or even an ethical choice, but conveying nothing about a book’s characters or setting or plot. His first novel, “A Life Apart,” published in 2010, could be about almost anything; in practice it begins with an Indian student at Oxford and then moves in on the London sex trade. His 2014 novel, “The Lives of Others,” shares its name with an earlier Oscar-winning German film, but those words fit beautifully onto its complex story of political and familial turmoil in Bengal. Both books have a 19th-century plenitude of detail, but it’s the 19th century of Zola rather than Dickens. They’re works of rub-your-nose-in-it naturalism, unforgiving and emotionally draining, books that make you squirm, and think. That’s especially true of his latest novel, “A State of Freedom.” Except this title is less open-ended than it seems, and in using it Mukherjee has something very specific in mind: He has his eye on one crucial literary predecessor. V. S. Naipaul’s “In a Free State” won the Booker Prize in 1971, just a few years after it was established to recognize the year’s best fiction from Britain and its former colonies. The award has had a better record than most: Many of its winners have stood the test of time and their tally includes remarkably few embarrassments. But “In a Free State” stands out, even in a list that includes “Disgrace” and “Possession,” “Midnight’s Children” and “Wolf Hall.” It is dark and bitter and grand, and its prose mixes despair with a sense of majesty. Naipaul divides the book into five sections, each about people in motion from one continent to another, and frames its different narratives with a prologue and an epilogue whose cadences match his own autobiographical writing. No character reappears from one part to the next, but the book is unified by its sense of freedom as a disruptive force, as though its people were unmoored in something other than a physical sense. Calcutta-born and London-based, Mukherjee has twice been a finalist for the now-renamed Man Booker Prize, and this new novel stands as an echo of Naipaul’s great work. The first of its five semi-independent sections concerns an expatriate Indian academic, a man bent on showing the Moghul remains of northern India to his American son: the Taj Mahal over lunch and then an hour’s drive to the abandoned 16th-century capital of Fatehpur Sikri. He’s a worried father, concerned that he “might have imposed too much on a 6-year-old,” but he drags the boy along just the same, and grows irritated at his inattentiveness. He’s also horrified at their driver’s breakneck pace and dismayed by the beggars and touts, for whom his guidebook marks him as prey. America has made him soft; he’s lost “the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants.” In other hands this might be comic, but Mukherjee begins on a foreboding note, and so as we read we wait for something to happen, something bad. On the way back from Fatehpur Sikri the car passes a fox-faced man with “a mustache that seemed alive,” leading a trained bear along the roadside. While Mukherjee’s unhappy professor will vanish from the book, the bear’s owner, Lakshman, reappears in its third section, as though the novelist had decided to imagine a life for a man glimpsed from the window of a moving car. Lakshman finds the cub near his village in the mountains and saves it from the cruelty of the local children, only to inflict a further cruelty of his own. The keepers of dancing bears are traditionally Muslims, known as “qalandars”; Lakshman, a Hindu, doesn’t so much train the animal as beat it into submission, having first gotten its canines knocked out. Nevertheless the bear soon acquires a name, Raju, and a character, and when Lakshman runs away from the cares of village life, from his family and his debts, Raju becomes his only companion. This is the hardest of Mukherjee’s narratives to read, but it’s also the most original and the most beautifully written. (On a morning when “the heat is beginning to bare its teeth,” the man and his bear must “cleave to the shaded areas.”) Nothing beyond a description of Lakshman’s face makes an explicit connection between these two sections, but the second and fourth parts of this book have a closer relation. In the second, an unnamed narrator returns from London to spend a month in his parents’ Bombay apartment and finds that his conversations with the family’s cook, Renu, make his mother profoundly uncomfortable. It’s a story about the social insulation afforded by relative wealth. The later narrative dives into the life of the family’s other servant, Milly, tracking the difficult course that has brought her, over many years, into something close to safety. But not everyone is so lucky, and Mukherjee also spares a glance at the rural violence Milly has left behind, in a way that recalls “The Lives of Others.” All this gives “A State of Freedom” more visible stitching than Naipual employed with “In a Free State,” and the book’s essential unity is underlined by the last and boldest of Mukherjee’s five narratives. Lakshman’s brother has also run away from their village and is now rumored to work on building sites in the plains. Here a construction worker in Agra mounts a rickety scaffold, moving along “the pliable bamboo ribs inch by inch on his bare feet the world spread out far below and so much air between him and the world.” Safety precautions are nonexistent on this job, no matter what the law says, and Mukherjee’s description makes it clear that the man’s earlier work has given him asbestosis. Only alcohol numbs his pain. And what Mukherjee does is to step inside him, offering an unpunctuated stream-of-consciousness that’s clearly meant to recall Molly Bloom’s soliloquy at the end of “Ulysses.” Molly’s unforgettable last word is “Yes”; Mukherjee finishes with “at last,” and in doing so returns us both to Lakshman’s story and to what had seemed a minor incident in this book’s almost forgotten beginning. “A State of Freedom” requires those of us who live comfortably to imagine a world in which almost no one ever does, a world in which the novel’s very title seems like a bad joke. Indeed, the Londoner who narrates the book’s second part makes just such an effort, in effect modeling what Mukherjee asks of his readers. This would suggest that this novel carries a more obvious ethical burden than anything Naipaul might allow himself, and it’s correspondingly less concerned with awakening a sense of wonder, with providing what the Trinidadian master himself described as a “cause for yearning.” A book that begins in homage remains then a bit narrow when set against its model. But it’s a mark of Neel Mukherjee’s range and force and ambition that any lesser comparison would seem an injustice.",The New York Times
2018,"A Novel of 1918 New Orleans, With Murder and All That Jazz","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. KING ZENO By Nathaniel Rich386 pp. MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28. A street preacher, perhaps the most minor of characters in Nathaniel Rich’s ambitious and metaphorically dense third novel, “King Zeno,” hangs moralistic signs on the back of his church wagon. One is about John Barleycorn. Another — we’re in New Orleans in 1918 — reads, “JAZZ KILLS.” This is a tiny, atmospheric touch, viewed through the window of a police captain’s office while prominent characters discuss an investigation into serial ax murders, but like nearly every detail in this novel of digging and questing, it has figurative resonance. The novel makes clear that jazz does indeed kill — not by its decadence, as the proselytist suggests, but by its novelty, its ingenuity. Jazz kills the old art forms, rag and swing. Jazz enacts violence on a song — one band is shown “teasing apart the ‘Tiger Rag’ like an old sweater until it unraveled into something unrecognizable and frightening.” And jazz assaults the listener — “Slaughter me dead!” one audience member screams during a show. In its diabolical innovation jazz is dangerous, and as such it is an ideal subject for a novel that roils with the inseparable energies of creation and destruction. Jazz is but one of numerous intricate subjects that Rich admits into the novel. Others include World War I, the Spanish flu epidemic, serial murder, police procedures, race relations, the New Orleans Mafia, and the construction of the Industrial Canal, which links Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River (and whose catastrophic breach during Hurricane Katrina looms meaningfully over the book: PROGRESS KILLS). Rich, a resident of New Orleans, throws his arms wide open to history and to the city, and “King Zeno,” particularly in its first half, is as unruly and laterally active as a big urban novel ought to be. And the novel, like a city, somehow coheres, as Rich never loses control of the riotous raw material. The close third-person point of view rotates among three central figures, providing pattern and the promise of convergence; the mysterious ax murders serve as a narrative through-line; the canal exerts centripetal and allegorical force; and the extraordinary American yearning of the characters, as in Stephen Millhauser’s “Martin Dressler” or E. L. Doctorow’s “The Waterworks,” is a constantly propulsive force. Despite his large canvas, Rich is a gifted portraitist of his three main characters. One is William Bastrop, a detective in the New Orleans Police Department who is haunted by recent experiences in the war. Bastrop has not been forthright to his wife, Maisie, nor to himself, about what happened in a besieged dugout in France, where many of his fellow soldiers died. One of the ghosts from his past turns out to be real — an eye-patched, trench-coated fellow soldier seeking revenge for Bastrop’s cowardice — and Bastrop must escape harm and then confront his own trauma and fraudulence. Maisie (or Maze), after learning the truth about France, moves out. To save his marriage and to regain a sense of purpose and integrity, Bastrop decides, roughly midway through the novel, that he must solve the ax murder case. “This was no longer police work, at least not only police work. By solving this unsolvable case, he would solve Maze. He would prove his courage, regain his confidence.” At this point his character achieves velocity and direction — he becomes a dramatic vector, a supersleuth. The second central character is a Creole musician named Isadore Zeno. Isadore is a startlingly original cornet player who longs to be the king of New Orleans jazz, to make a new music that “would live forever, flowing from one generation to the next down the river of time into the sea of immortality.” But listeners are not quite ready for Isadore’s sound, and he is frustrated by his lack of good gigs. Zeno has a pregnant wife and he needs steady work. He dabbles in armed robbery, but ultimately goes straight, working as a canal digger and a cooper. For a time he forsakes the cornet, but eventually he resolves, roughly midway through the novel, to be both a family man and a jazzman. (As the son of a trumpet player, I was perhaps inordinately curious about how Zeno achieves and maintains his brilliance without seeming to practice.) When the hysteria surrounding the Axman gives Zeno an odd opportunity to take the stage, he very creatively capitalizes on the widespread fear. This daring and desperate move — somewhat convenient, dramatically speaking — furthers Zeno’s music career, and also puts him on a dangerous course toward both the Axman and Bastrop. The third character is Beatrice Vizzini, a Mafia matriarch, widow and mother. Her company, Hercules Construction, is in charge of excavating the canal, and Beatrice hopes that this respectable, high-profile venture will lead her out of the “shadow business” of racketeering. Like Zeno, she is obsessed with immortality; she takes baths in potions designed to prolong life. (Immortality baths, by the way, do not work.) Beatrice becomes progressively agitated by the ticking of her enormous grandfather clock, by the canal project — where workers have begun finding severed body parts — and by her colossal son, Giorgio, whose behavior has become increasingly sinister and secretive as he tries to prove himself worthy of inheriting the dark family business. Having done what she can to spur the incompetent and lazy Giorgio into professional action, Beatrice eventually loses control of him altogether. She then becomes a detective, investigating her own son. Thus all three characters are in compelling motion, propelled by deeply rooted desires, as well as by the exigencies of plot. The Spanish flu, meanwhile, is ravaging the city, countervailing the vibrant, creative forces of music and public works, the striving, the dreams of longevity. This is a novel with a high body count, but it has far too much energy ever to feel morbid. The canal, connecting lake to river, also connects these three characters, as does the murder investigation. (“King Zeno” is not properly a whodunit — readers know the identity of the Axman long before Bastrop does.) All three characters converge, as I suppose they must, in a final climactic scene, Rich’s complex and capacious universe narrowing to a pair of coordinates, lit by the headlights of the vehicles that brought them all there. This scene feels cinematic in all the best and worst ways. There are weapons and blood, there is a riposte that no screenwriter or script doctor could improve. The resolution is exciting and tense, and yet after all of the novel’s artful chaos, it feels like a diminution. Rich delivers what the structure promises — that is the good news and the bad. Novels expand, then contract. The contraction is compulsory, the application of narrative form on the messy and entropic world the novel is attempting to represent. Elegant contrivance is necessary in the novel, and it has its own pleasures; yet I’ve always been a fan of the accretion phase. When I think of “The Great Gatsby” — another Jazz Age tale — I think of that puppy at Tom and Myrtle’s apartment, or Daisy crying about Gatsby’s shirts, or the mysterious energy in the list of attendees at Gatsby’s parties. It’s always a mild surprise to remember that the novel culminates in vehicular manslaughter and a murder-suicide. Mistaken identity, jealous husband, poolside gunfire. Narrative kills.",The New York Times

THE NOTHINGBy Hanif Kureishi 167 pp. Faber & Faber. $22. “One night, when I am old, sick, right out of semen, and don’t need things to get any worse, I hear the noises again,” is the arresting first sentence of Hanif Kureishi’s new novel, “The Nothing.” The man hearing noises is Waldo, a Bafta-winning filmmaker now staring down his 80s, in a wheelchair and in terminal physical decline, who sits at the window of his Victoria flat, like Jimmy Stewart in “Rear Window,” observing the goings-on of his neighbors through binoculars. “There is a world within this London mansion block,” he notes, and later: “Dinner parties are more riveting than wars, and are always an occasion for a close-up. But there’s no sex.” Hang on. I thought you said this was a Hanif Kureishi book? I want my money back. Kureishi is the Londoner (of Pakistani descent) who wrote the 1985 Daniel Day Lewis film “My Beautiful Laundrette” and arrived on the literary scene with the 1990 novel “The Buddha of Suburbia,” a bi-curious picaresque whose wily mixed-race hero bed-hopped his way out of the London suburbs. “Always put your penis first,” a wise old writer tells the main character in “The Last Word” (2014), a directive every Kureishi protagonist has done his best to heed, with Waldo no exception. A once studly young buck in flares, love beads, shoulder-length black hair and “an ass you’d pay to bite,” he now lives with his wife, Zee, 22 years his junior, who feeds and washes his failing body. “I am, I’ve realized at last, the sort of fool who wants to be loved exclusively,” he says. But Waldo’s imagination is not going quietly into the night. Convinced Zee is having an affair with a longtime pal of his, a down-at-the-heels film critic and Soho gadfly called Eddie who spends nights at their flat under the pretext of helping Zee with her nursing duties, Waldo goes to bed, feigns sleep, turns up his hearing aid and lets his mind run wild: “Working with sound and my imagination, I envisage the angles and cuts, making the only substantial films I can manage these days, mind movies.” The idea of a celibate Hanif Kureishi hero tormented by the very urges he once indulged is an excellent one — think Philip Roth in a chastity belt. Given the current cultural and political climate, in fact, that idea may have even more than usual appeal. The unfettered license that male writers have enjoyed when it comes to holding up every stain in the sheets as a palimpsest of their smarting, solipsistic souls is due for an overhaul. Sexual jealousy has produced many a major and minor classic, from Saul Bellow’s “Herzog” to Patrick Hamilton’s “Hangover Square” and Julian Barnes’s “Before She Met Me,” but the trick of these books lies in the skill with which the writer evokes, through the heat haze of the protagonist’s obsession, the bobbing horizon line of reality, however fleetingly glimpsed. There must be more to “Lolita” than just Humbert Humbert’s lust. Here, Kureishi runs into trouble. There’s really nobody in the book besides Waldo, the other characters existing mostly to ferry congratulatory bouquets to his much-garlanded imagination. “Waldo, you’ve got the filthiest mind of anyone I’ve met,” says Zee, who nevertheless supplies him with sordid stories of Eddie’s past involving sodomy and rape. “Your mind resembles a roaring wind tunnel,” admonishes his movie star friend Anita, but she too brings him reports of Eddie’s affairs, peccadilloes and (as Zee puts it) “orgies in his school uniform with important people.” But what a stroke of luck! The world is exactly as florid as the fantasist first imagined it to be. The book is a little like one of those fake knots that, once pulled, turn out to be just a piece of string. Even paranoiacs can be plotted against, of course, but there’s a word for the kind of writing in which too neat a sense of reality is made to line up with loamy sexual fantasy: pornography. I suspect Kureishi knows this. That pre-emptive shrug of a title almost defies us to take his book seriously. “As a reader I’m done with literature,” Waldo declares as he asks Anita to read him one of his favorite detective stories again. “I only want fun.” But fun for a writer and fun for a reader are different things, and while it may have been fun for Kureishi to record the most gleefully obscene details of Waldo’s recollected sex life with Zee, it is rather more arduous work for readers to square that with the devoted nurse they had been picturing a few pages previously: one minute a Florence Nightingale, the next a lithe vixen who slaps Waldo and attempts to smother him with a pillow. The behavior that might have driven her to such an act is carefully elided, if not hard to imagine. For all his self-obsession, Waldo shows little instinct for the chilly self-appraisal to which Bellow subjected Moses Herzog: “To his parents, he had been an ungrateful child. To his country, an indifferent citizen. To his brothers and his sister, affectionate but remote. With his friends, an egotist. With love, lazy. With brightness, dull. With power, passive. With his own soul, evasive. Satisfied with his own severity, positively enjoying the hardness and factual rigor of his judgment, he lay on his sofa. …” That final sentence is a killer, with Bellow dinging Herzog for the complacency and self-congratulation even accurate self-knowledge can breed. Ouch. Compared with that, Kureishi is still on the beginner’s slopes, practicing his snowplow. Whether you enjoy this book is very much down to how much of a jolt you can get from its epigrams, most of them loitering in the 25-watt range: “the libido, like Elvis and jealousy, never dies”; “a saint is only someone who has been under-researched”; “boring people are always popular. They never do anything unexpected.” All of which have the requisite cynical snarl but collapse at the gentlest inquiry. “The imagination is the most dangerous place on earth,” Waldo asserts, but Kureishi has supplied him with the safest possible paddock in which to roam: a world carefully Waldoized, confirming his every suspicion and offering his steamy imaginings the least possible pushback.

2018,Opinion | A Nuclear Plan in Dangerous Times,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Pentagon Plan Would Expand Nuclear Policy” (front page, Jan. 17): As we expand the circumstances that could precipitate nuclear war, the importance of a prudent, experienced president and government officials who influence his decisions becomes more apparent. We should heed the warning of Andrew C. Weber, an assistant defense secretary in the Obama administration, who is quoted as saying, “Almost everything about this radical new policy will blur the line between nuclear and conventional.” If adopted, he said, the new policy “will make nuclear war a lot more likely.” In the past, miscalculation has brought us to the precipice of war, as with the Cuban missile crisis, or actual war, as with the events that led up to World War I. The recent false alarms in Hawaii and Japan should cause greater concern that misjudgment or rash judgment could result in nuclear catastrophe. JOHN A. VITERITTI, LAUREL, N.Y. To the Editor: “Raising the Risk of Nuclear War” (editorial, Jan. 14) comes on the heels of yet another nuclear mistake with a false alarm in Hawaii, highlighting how luck remains our principal security policy. If President Trump, with his “bigger button,” had chosen to launch an attack on North Korea in response to this false alarm, and if North Korea, detecting such a launch, decided to launch its entire arsenal so as not to lose it, we would today be waiting for the inevitable climate change that would follow, placing millions, if not billions, at risk and dwarfing the first bomb carnage. This incident joins at least seven near-misses where either Moscow or Washington began the process of launching nuclear weapons in the mistaken belief that it was under attack. These near-misses, coupled with the United States’ plan to start a new arms race with new low-yield weapons, make the probability of nuclear war even more likely as other countries follow suit. The only way to be secure from nuclear attack is by the complete abolition of these weapons as required in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Otherwise, it is only a matter of time before our luck runs out. ROBERT DODGE, OJAI, CALIF. The writer is president of Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles. To the Editor: Your editorial analysis of the dangers of the Trump administration’s nuclear policy indicates that it can lead only to higher risks of nuclear calamities, with global instability and proliferation of even more weapons of mass destruction. President Trump’s new and clearly unbalanced and mystifying nuclear policy seems of a piece with much of his words, thinking and his acts as president. They are not based on any objective analysis of what is in the true security interest of the United States or, for that matter, the rest of the world. Mr. Trump seems to be enthralled with destruction of peacemaking and diplomatic options and sees, at home and abroad, destructive acts as his credo. His strategy (if that is even the word) — from his opposition to the vital Iran nuclear deal, which is helping stabilize a region of conflict, to his approach to North Korea — is clearly aimed at increasing tension. He is almost gleefully and recklessly courting a major military cataclysm. Trump nuclear policies recklessly encourage others to act in the same way, leading to even more calamitous outcomes. Now more than ever, we need a strategy that aims at diplomatic and multilateral solutions. That means a reasonable posture of preventive acts or sanctions against aggression with a search for win-win peaceful outcomes. The arms control and nonproliferation efforts of the past, which Mr. Trump abhors, remain a critical tool for lowering our risks and creating the space for more cooperation. HARRY C. BLANEY III, WASHINGTON The writer, a retired Foreign Service officer, is a senior fellow at the Center on International Policy.",The New York Times
2018,A Pan-American Dance Sampler at the Joyce,"Critic’s Notebook Multiple dance forms of the United States were on view last week at the Joyce Theater. As a rule, this dance theater presents one company a week — but here it featured eight, in four programs, under the aegis of American Dance Platform, an annual fixture and part of the big early-January dance splurge across New York, with presenters coming in from around the country to sample as many troupes as possible. For New Yorkers, it’s also a valuable opportunity to sample new or unfamiliar dance. It proved a truly American platform, too, with idioms including Hawaiian hula, Irish footwork, Spanish dance, tap, Lindy, ballet and modern. I saw six of the Platform’s eight companies. Good dancers abounded; good programming was rarer. Every troupe took me somewhere I hadn’t been before, though not all had the secret of making me feel they had more to offer than what they had performed. Best of all was a dancer-choreographer I’d seen before, Caleb Teicher: His spell keeps growing. Lean and lithe, he’s immediately memorable for the Diaghilev/Susan-Sontag streak of white hair amid his black locks, but his looks soon become less striking than his character. I used to find him sly, but what is far more striking now is his impulsive, elusive eccentricity. He’s engaging, and yet you watch him with perpetual curiosity: Who and what is he? He’s a tap dancer who is equally at home in other American folk forms — jazz, soft-shoe, the Lindy — and he’s funny, charming, elusive, seeming always to resist categorization. In “Variations,” he and two colleagues, Brittany DeStefano and Gabe Winns Ortiz, bring off marvels to excerpts from Bach’s Goldberg Variations, mostly tying a footfall to every keyboard note and yet always revealing fresh resources of pressure, idiom, physicality. In “Meet Ella,” Nathan Bugh and Mr. Teicher bring a wider lexicon to several of Ella Fitzgerald’s most crazy live improvisations; her inspired lunacy brings out the same in them. The more I see of Mr. Teicher & Company, the more I want to see. I’d also seen Philadanco before. One of several important troupes in Philadelphia, it has terrific performers, with high energy and marvelous fullness of physical texture. A pity then that the two items the group danced here — Francisco Gella’s “Between the Lines” and Ray Mercer’s “Super B!” — were just formulaic modern soft-shoe ballet. Good to see that several of these Joyce troupes exemplified ethnic genres. The Hawaiian group Halau o Kekuhi kept extending the potential of its genre — hula — throughout its performance of “Hi’iakaikapoliopele.” Rhythm, music, formation and body language kept changing, and so did the sense of both ritual and charm. Ensemble Español Spanish Dance Theater, from Chicago, tackles a range of Spanish material. The second of its three items, “Duende Gitana (Gypsy Soul)” — a flamenco trio for the dancer Irma Suarez Ruiz, the percussionist Javier Saume-Mazzei and the singer Paco Fonta — exemplified the merits of live music, so had a freshness lacking elsewhere. The first, “Iroko,” made interesting connections between Spain, Africa and the Americas, but to music by Manuel Parrilla (taped) that made the experiment feel ersatz. These were New York premieres, as was its 25-year-old production of Ravel’s “Bolero,” choreographed by the troupe’s founder Libby Komaiko. Though this is a hard score to bring off in dance terms, Ms. Komaiko’s choreography manages remarkably well, principally by its use of counter-rhythms. Alas, the final few minutes suddenly added an absurd excess of big theatrical effects (cloaks, fans) — though, like every “Bolero” staging I’ve ever seen, it wowed the audience. Trinity Irish Dance Company, in a quintuple bill, took the virtuoso footwork of Irish step dancing and led it in multiple directions. Step dancing often brings its performers remarkably high on the toes. Here, pointwork was not uncommon — though it thrilled less, with a largely percussive downward emphasis, than the élan of other footwork, in which the springing instep seems to connect wonderfully with the outward action of the entire leg. You could have appraised it just in term of gender studies: Several dances were all-female; some included two men, as if on the women’s terms. And just as I was feeling that, for all the wonderful speed of this genre, everything was too metrically regular, a number of solos confounded me, with effects of complexity and syncopation that astounded. Charm and individuality weren’t enough to carry the Los Angeles company Bodytraffic through its three items; and in Hofesh Shechter’s “Dust” they weren’t even useful. (Too many of Mr. Schechter’s works are exercises in post-apocalyptic gloom.) The most varied and appealing piece was Matthew Neenan’s “A Million Voices,” set to Peggy Lee songs. This was a preview of a work that is likely to be extended when it has its official premiere in May. It exemplifies the dramatic skill Mr. Neenan — who makes dances for small companies all over the States — has in highlighting soloists within the group, and the felicitous American naturalness he so often shows when using popular American song. So far it lacks the poignancy that can be Mr. Neenan’s best asset; but it closed the Bodytraffic event on a relative high.",The New York Times
2018,A Paper Tears Apart in a City That Never Quite Came Together,"LOS ANGELES — When an ambitious Civil War colonel from Ohio seized control of a fledgling daily newspaper here in the late 19th century, Los Angeles was a rough-hewed frontier town with no paved streets and a population of a few thousand people. The newspaper was four pages and cost a penny. The ambitions of that colonel, Harrison Gray Otis, became the city’s ambitions, and the newspaper, soon to be called The Los Angeles Times, was put in the service of transforming Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today. The turmoil at The Times in recent months — with upheaval in the editorial ranks and a publisher suspended over sexual harassment allegations — is a reminder of the slow decline of a newspaper that had long been a cohesive force in Los Angeles civic life. But more than that, it is symptomatic of something that this community has struggled with for nearly half a century: the absence of strong institutions to bind it together. “This seems like a three-alarm fire to me,” said Donna Bojarsky, a second-generation Los Angeles native who two years ago created an organization of community leaders here to deal with the civic vacuum. “I don’t think you can have a dynamic, efficacious city without any kind of L.A.-centric media or press.” “It says something that we are in this position,” Ms. Bojarsky added. “You don’t see any public outrage, and I think you would in other cities.” For all its successes, Los Angeles has not developed the political, cultural and philanthropic institutions that have proved critical in other American cities. The turmoil at The Times comes just months after Eli Broad, who has been the city’s biggest philanthropist, announced he was retiring. There are many reasons for this problem. Los Angeles County is made up of 88 different cities, including the City of Los Angeles, rolling across 4,571 square miles that stretch from the ocean to the desert. People here are more likely to identify themselves with the city or neighborhood where they live — be it Glendale, Compton, Beverly Hills or Whittier — rather than Los Angeles. The worsening traffic has encouraged people to stay close to the places where they live and work. “It’s so vast,” said William Deverell, a historian of California at the University of Southern California. “L.A. was self-consciously designed to be a decentralized place. What we call sprawl in the 21st century was part and parcel of the decentralized nature of the place.” There has been an exodus of Fortune 500 companies to other parts of the country from Los Angeles over the past 20 years — among them, Occidental Petroleum, which moved to Houston in 2014 — and with it the loss of business leaders who in other cities fill key civic roles. There were three Fortune 500 companies here in 2017, compared with seven in the City of Los Angeles in 1987. Many Hollywood executives and actors have homes in other parts of the country, and with some notable exceptions, have not played a major role in civic life here. The region has become increasingly economically and ethnically diverse, a challenge for any political or civic leader looking to unify a community. And this is a relatively young city, filled with recent arrivals who do not have the history of the kind of old-line families who have defined civic foundations in established cities like Boston and Philadelphia. The overlapping maze of governments works against the emergence of a single powerful political leader, such as an Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York City. The mayor here has little control over the school board or the health system. Unlike New York, which has two feisty daily tabloids and a 24-hours news station devoted only to New York news, The Los Angeles Times has stood increasingly alone as other news organizations have gone out of business, such as The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which closed in 1989. That has meant the absence of different voices and the kind of competition that can ensure a live civic debate, particularly since Los Angeles does not have the prodding that comes with an aggressive tabloid culture. Marylouise Oates, who was an influential society columnist for The Times in the 1980s, writing closely followed columns that covered every aspect of life here — politics, Hollywood, culture, along with events in the Jewish, Latino and African-American community — said she was distressed that there were few journalistic voices in the community today. “This city is so silo-ized,” Ms. Oates said. “I covered everything. At the time it was all one city. Otis Chandler made that possible. He decided it was a good thing to do.” Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor, said the lack of these kinds of forces was a constant obstacle to accomplishing anything ambitious when he was in City Hall. “Rallying the city around big challenges becomes more difficult when you don’t have the broad cross-section of institutional players,” said Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is running for governor. “We don’t have anything like that here. We’ve been struggling for 50 years with weakened institutions.” But he said he thought that was changing. “We are a global city,” he said. “We need to see ourselves as a global city.” The other factor is the lack of philanthropy. There is no shortage of wealth in Los Angeles, but leaders of cultural institutions have long struggled to raise money or solicit contributions of art. Los Angeles ranked 14th in charitable giving in 2017, according to The Charity Navigator; San Diego ranked first. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, by any measure a landmark work of architecture in this city and the world, almost did not get completed; Richard Riordan, a former mayor, made a personal plea to Mr. Broad to help come up with the needed financing. Mr. Broad said he was not worried that no one would step up to fill the shoes he has left since retirement. For example, he suggested, David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul who lives in Beverly Hills and New York, pledged $150 million last year for the construction of a new Los Angeles County Museum of Art building. “It’s a changing city,” Mr. Broad said. “It’s a younger city. We’re growing up.” Geography may be seen as an impediment to strong institutions, but it is also a central piece of Angeleno identity — a landscape of beaches, mountains, valleys, open skies and clusters of buildings. “Geography is part of our values,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of the county board of supervisors and a professor at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We don’t want to live on top of each other, like in New York or Philadelphia.” Southern Californians, he said, “want to be independent.” Bill Boyarsky, a former editor at The Los Angeles Times and the author of “Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times,” a book on the newspaper, described the idea that people in Los Angeles “can’t see beyond their block” as an East Coast stereotype. “I always thought geography was an unusual but true way of binding the city together,” he said. The developments come as Los Angeles — by many other measures — is on an upswing. The economy is humming. Its youthful mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, is traveling the country, a potential presidential candidate in 2020, which in some circles provokes eye-rolling, but is also a source of pride, particularly at a time when political activism in this relatively apolitical city has risen since the election of President Trump. The city now has two professional football teams — after 20 years when there were none — and was chosen as the site of the 2028 Olympic Games. And a raft of new museums are opening or are being renovated, including one financed by the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and another by George Lucas in downtown Los Angeles. “We are a trendsetting city,” Ms. Bojarsky said. “And we look much more like what cities of the future are going to look like. We have the diversity of the economy, the diversity of the people. There are no all-white cities or single-economy cities anymore.” Still, the absence of progress on big issues — homelessness, education and battered streets, to name a few — is a source of frustration and embarrassment for many civic leaders. “Los Angeles plays small ball really well,” said Austin Beutner, a former deputy mayor who served briefly as the publisher of The Times. “What’s missing oftentimes is the ability to bring the entire community together on behalf of issues or opportunities that will benefit the community as a whole.” The contrast with the era when Otis was a power at his newspaper and in the city is striking. Upon arriving here, Otis, through subterfuge, conspired to steal water from the Owens Valley and bring it to Los Angeles, making rapid growth possible. The newspaper’s power helped secure funding for a new harbor, opening the city to global trade. With special sections, the newspaper marketed Los Angeles to the rest of the country, attracting waves of striving migrants with the promise of sunshine, cheap land and abundant opportunity. In politics, the newspaper bent City Hall to its will, and along the way propelled the rise of favored leaders, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The Chandlers sold the family-controlled Times Mirror Company to the Tribune Company in 2000. The newspaper developed from being less a political player and more a civic leader — a paper with international prestige that helped set the conversation every morning here. “It proved to be the golden age for an organization like The L.A. Times to engage citizens of Los Angeles,” Mr. Beutner said. “With everything going on here today you’d expect it to be a leader in the conversation. Meanwhile, it is being pummeled from above.”",The New York Times
2018,A Partial Win for Prosecutors Who Targeted Fraternity After Student’s Death,"STROUDSBURG, Pa. — For days, the pledges from Baruch College joining Pi Delta Psi had been ordered around by fraternity members and deprived of sleep. And after they left New York City for a rental house in the Poconos in December 2013, they faced yet another test, a final gauntlet known as the “glass ceiling,” a ritual meant to represent their plight as Asian-American men. Other pledges had already crossed the frozen yard, blindfolded and wearing a backpack weighed down with sand, as fraternity members confronted them. But the last to go, Chun Hsien Deng, an 18-year-old freshman also known as Michael, had not been doing what he was told, and the other members responded aggressively. He was lifted up and dropped to the ground and tackled before he fell unconscious, prosecutors said. After he was taken to a hospital, doctors found he had sustained severe head trauma and his body was covered in bruises. Nearly two years after Mr. Deng’s death, officials here in Monroe County announced dozens of criminal charges — assault, hindering apprehension, hazing. Five men were charged with third-degree murder. But prosecutors also took an unusual measure: they charged Pi Delta Psi itself with criminal counts that included third-degree murder, aggravated assault and conspiracy. The fraternity has argued that members were acting on their own, defying the organization’s rules forbidding hazing. But prosecutors contended that the rituals were actually intrinsic to the fraternity’s culture, a series of tests meant to humiliate prospective members as well as inculcate them with an understanding of their heritage as Asian-Americans and the adversity faced by their ancestors. It was a process, as prosecutors claimed in court records, that had been “followed and repeated semester after semester for every colony or chapter.” The case, in which 37 people were charged, has been cited as evidence of prosecutors across the country becoming more aggressive in pursuing criminal charges when college students are killed from hazing. But by charging the fraternity, prosecutors here took what legal experts described as a rare step, one that has had limited success but stands to bring about more stringent and far-reaching consequences. Episodes involving students dying from hazing rituals have drawn increasing attention, driving universities and student organizations to respond by instituting educational programs and tightening rules surrounding the practice. But as students continue to die or get injured, anti-hazing advocates say more drastic action is vital and argue that criminal prosecutions, especially against the fraternities, could have a meaningful influence. “This may actually send a message to the fraternities that they need to do more,” said David W. Bianchi, a lawyer in Miami who, for two decades, has represented parents in lawsuits after their children were killed. In Mr. Deng’s case, prosecutors have had some success: In November, a jury acquitted Pi Delta Psi of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, but did find it guilty of other charges, including aggravated assault, involuntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. The sentencing for the fraternity, as well as several of the men charged, is scheduled for Monday; the fraternity faces fines ranging from $2,000 to $25,000 for each charge, prosecutors said. (Baruch has permanently barred Pi Delta Psi). “The fraternity has been held responsible for the senseless and completely avoidable death of a strong, smart, promising college freshman,” Kimberly A. Metzger, the assistant district attorney who led the prosecution, said in a statement following the verdict. “There is nothing that will ever lift the burden of Michael’s tragic death from the hearts of his mother and father and their entire family,” she added. “But in speaking with Michael’s mother following the verdict, she reiterated for us what she has consistently wished from this case — that another young person isn’t subjected to such perverse conduct merely for wanting to belong.” One of the earliest and highest-profile cases of prosecutors charging a fraternity came after the death, in 1997, of Scott Krueger, an 18-year-old freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was pledging to join the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He fell into a coma after binge drinking, his blood-alcohol level reaching 0.40, five times the legal limit to drive, prosecutors said. The fraternity was indicted on homicide and hazing charges, while no individual members were charged. The case fell apart after the fraternity dissolved its chapter at M.I.T. Another fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was found guilty in 2012 of hazing and other charges after George Desdunes, a Cornell University sophomore from Brooklyn, died after drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. However, in that case, the fraternity did not present a defense; three students who were charged were acquitted. Prosecutors routinely pursue criminal cases against institutions, often for white-collar crimes involving allegations of corporate malfeasance. Charges alleging violent offenses are less common. Legal experts said the situation with fraternities is analogous to workplace cases, such as in mines or on construction sites, where prosecutors believe an employer’s negligence or wrongdoing contributed to a worker’s injury or death. In such cases, prosecutors have to show that the death was “much more than pure possibility,” said David LaBahn, the president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. “This was a death that was preventable.” In the Baruch case, Pi Delta Psi has contended that the initiation rituals were unsanctioned. During the trial, the fraternity claimed that prosecutors had unfairly conflated the students’ actions with organization’s in a way that was “misleading and directly prejudices the national fraternity.” “A corporation can only act through a person,” the fraternity argued in court documents, adding that there was “no evidence presented” showing that the national fraternity had representatives at the retreat, was involved in its planning or “exhibited an intent to cause the tragic result.” That weekend in 2013, fraternity members from Baruch, a commuter school in Manhattan whose Pi Delta Psi colony was only about three years old, gathered in a large rental house in Tunkhannock Township, Pa. Early on a frigid morning, Mr. Deng followed the other pledges in putting on a blindfold and backpack. According to a grand jury report released in 2015, other fraternity members pushed him around; one of them ran into him from 15 feet away, with his head lowered, the report said. Mr. Deng was carried inside, unconscious, his body feeling like “dead weight,” the report said. Instead of immediately seeking medical aid, the authorities said, the other members changed his clothes and used their phones to search phrases like “concussion can’t wake up.” After about an hour, he was driven by fraternity members to a hospital, where he died the next day. Four of the men who initially faced murder charges pleaded guilty in May to voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. In a statement, Mr. Deng’s family has called for a “punishment severe enough to forever remind them of the pain and grief we will carry for the rest of our lives as a result of their misconduct.” Mr. Bianchi said the significance of the jury’s decision was the broader implications it could have, including alerting fraternities to the potential of being prosecuted. “There has to be a consequence for this conviction,” Mr. Bianchi said, noting the possibility of fines and other penalties. “You can’t put the institution in jail.”",The New York Times
2018,A Pass. A Catch. A Missed Tackle. What Went Wrong for the Saints?,"It is a play that will haunt the New Orleans Saints and their fans for a long time. They needed one stop against the Minnesota Vikings. They needed to tackle a defenseless wide receiver in bounds. Do that, and they would be headed to the N.F.C. Championship. But caught up in the moment, a rookie missed a tackle, and it cost his team everything. Here is what went wrong: It was 3rd-and-10 at Minnesota’s 39-yard line. There were 10 seconds remaining, the Vikings had no timeouts, and New Orleans was clinging to a one-point lead. A play of any kind that did not get out of bounds would almost certainly end the game, since the Vikings would not be able to stop the clock in time to try a game-winning field goal. “We knew that all we needed was a field goal,” receiver Adam Thielen said. “Obviously, we knew it was going to be tough because all they had to do was stay back and not give up the big play. I don’t think anybody in the huddle was down. We were just trying to make a play.” As the play, called “Seven Heaven,” unfolded, the Vikings had Adam Thielen, their most consistent receiver, lined up on the left side of the field, while Stefon Diggs, Jarius Wright and Kyle Rudolph were lined up on the right. This caused a matchup nightmare for the New Orleans secondary. P.J. Williams covered Rudolph, Ken Crawley covered Wright, and Marshon Lattimore was on the opposite side of the field covering Thielen. That left safety Marcus Williams dropping back deep to do his best against the speedy Diggs. Case Keenum, in the shotgun, got some time to set up and launched a pass that traveled about 35 yards in the air. Marcus Williams, who had dropped back deep on the play, was seemingly in good position to bring Diggs down in the event of a catch without letting him get out of bounds. But with no defenders behind him, the margin for error was slim. Diggs had to use every bit of his vertical leap to get the ball, exposing himself for a big tackle. Williams, who was likely trying to avoid an interference penalty, made the decision to dive instead of waiting to wrap up Diggs when he landed. Before the ball had even touched Diggs’s hands, Williams lowered his head, led with his shoulder, and launched himself at Diggs’s legs. “I felt the guy brush past me,” Diggs said after the game, adding, “There was only one guy there. If he slipped, I’m going to try to stay up.” Instead of striking Diggs, Williams sailed under and past him. Diggs caught the ball, and if that was not bad enough, Williams’s momentum carried him into Crawley, who was the last defender in the vicinity of Diggs. The collision sent both defenders sprawling, and Diggs galloped down the sideline. “I was preparing for somebody to contact me so I could get out of bounds but nobody touched me,” Diggs said. “I lost my footing a little bit and then I just tried to gather myself and my hand never let me go. The rest is history.” Diggs came down on his left foot, awkwardly turned around while somehow maintaining his balance, and then was off to the races, with no one on the Saints defense having a prayer of catching him. Williams collapsed on the field after the play, and was reportedly in tears at his locker as he and his teammates tried to make sense of the shocking play that had ended their season. Coach Sean Payton, calling the play “a timing decision,” deflected some of the blame from Williams, saying, “He’d like to have that back, but he’s been a good player for us all year.” Williams was hard on himself after the game, but answered reporters’ questions: “I'm going to take it upon myself to do all that I can to never let that happen again,” he said.

2018,Opinion | A Perfect Marriage: Evangelicals and Conservatives in Latin America,"Op-Ed Contributor AMHERST, Mass. — Evangelical churches today can be found in almost every neighborhood in Latin America — and they are transforming politics like no other force. They are giving conservative causes, and especially political parties, new strength and new constituencies. In Latin America, Christianity used to be associated with Roman Catholicism. The church held a near monopoly on religion until the 1980s. The only challenge to Catholicism was anticlericalism and atheism. There has never been another religion. Until now. Evangelicals today account for almost 20 percent of the population in Latin America, up from 3 percent three decades ago. In a few Central American countries, evangelicals are near majorities. Evangelical pastors embrace varied ideologies, but when it comes to gender and sexuality, their values are typically conservative, patriarchal and homophobic. They expect women to be completely submissive to their evangelical husbands. And in every country in the region, they have taken the strongest stands against gay rights. The rise of evangelicalism is politically worrisome. Evangelicals are fueling a new form of populism. They are supplying conservative parties with nonelite voters, which is good for democracy, but these voters tend to be intransigent on issues of sexuality, which feeds cultural polarization. Intolerant inclusion, which is the classic Latin American populist formula, is being reinvented by evangelical pastors. Brazil is a prime example of the rising evangelical power in Latin America. The 90 or so evangelical members of Congress have thwarted L.G.B.T.-oriented legislative actions, played a role in impeaching the leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, and shut down museum shows. An evangelical pastor has been elected mayor of Rio de Janeiro, one of the world’s most gay-friendly cities. So grand are their successes that evangelical pastors elsewhere say they want to imitate “the Brazilian model.” And that model is spreading. With the help of Catholics, evangelicals have also organized anti-gay marches in Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Peru and Mexico. In Paraguay and Colombia, they compelled the ministries of education to ban books dealing with sexuality. In Colombia, they even mobilized to defeat a referendum on a peace accord with the FARC, the largest guerrilla group in Latin America, arguing that the accords pushed feminism and L.G.B.T. rights too far. How have evangelicals become so politically powerful? After all, evangelicals, even in Brazil, are still a minority, and in most countries, irreligiosity is also rising. The answer has to do with their new political tactics. No tactic has been more transformative than the decision by evangelicals to forge alliances with political parties on the right. Historically, right-wing parties in Latin America tended to gravitate toward the Catholic Church and disdain Protestantism, while evangelicals stayed out of politics. Not anymore. Conservative parties and evangelicals are joining forces. Chile’s presidential election in 2017 provided a perfect example of this union of pastors and party. The two center-right candidates, Sebastián Piñera and José Antonio Kast, courted evangelicals. Mr. Piñera, who won, even had four evangelical bishops as campaign advisers. There is a reason conservative politicians are embracing conservative evangelicalism. Evangelicals are solving the most serious political handicap that right-wing parties have in Latin America: their lack of ties with nonelites. As the political scientist Ed Gibson noted, parties of the right used to draw their core constituency from the upper strata. This made them electorally weak. Evangelicals are changing that. They are bringing in voters from all walks of life, but mostly the poor. They are turning right-wing parties into people’s parties. This marriage of pastors and parties is not a Latin American invention. It’s has been happening in the United States since the 1980s, as the Christian right gradually became arguably the most reliable constituency in the Republican Party. Even Donald Trump — who many see as the antithesis of biblical values — ran on an evangelical platform. He chose his running mate, Mike Pence, precisely for his staunch evangelicalism. That there is convergence between the United States and Latin American on evangelical politics is no accident. American evangelicals coach their counterparts in Latin America on how to court parties, become lobbyists and fight gay marriage. Few other civic groups enjoy stronger external ties. In addition to forming alliances with parties, Latin American evangelicals have learned to make peace with their historic rival, the Catholic Church. At least on the issue of sexuality, pastors and priests have found new common ground. The latest example of cooperation has been in framing — the language political actors use to describe their causes. For social scientists, the more actors manage to frame an issue to resonate for multiple constituencies, not just the core constituency, the more likely they are to influence politics. In Latin America, both Catholic and evangelical clergymen have come up with an effective frame for their conservatism: opposition to what they have baptized the “ideology of gender.” This term is used to label any effort to promote acceptance of sexual and gender diversity. When experts argue that sexual diversity is real and gender identity is a construct, evangelical and Catholic clergies respond that this is just ideology, not science. Evangelicals are keen on stressing the word “ideology” because this gives them the right, they argue, to protect themselves, and especially their children, from exposure to these ideas. Ideology of gender allows them to call for the protection of children as cover for homophobia. The political beauty of “ideology of gender” is that it has given clergymen a way to recast their religious stand in secular terms: as parents’ rights. In Latin America, the new Christian slogan is, “Don’t mess with my kids.” It is one of the results of this evangelical-Catholic collaboration. Politically, we may be witnessing a historic truce between Protestants and Catholics in the region: Evangelicals agree to embrace the Catholic Church’s strong condemnation of abortion, the Catholic Church embraces evangelicals’ strong condemnation of sexual diversity, and together, they can confront rising secularism. This truce poses a dilemma for Pope Francis, now on tour in Latin America. On the one hand, he has expressed rejection of extremism, and a desire to connect with the most modern, even liberal groups in the church. On the other hand, this pope has made “Christian encounters” a hallmark of his papacy, and he himself is not entirely allergic to the cultural conservatism of evangelicals. As a political actor, the pope worries too about the church’s waning influence in politics, so an alliance with evangelicals seems like the perfect antidote against its political decline. A pressing question the pope needs to ponder is whether he is willing to pay the price of greater conservatism to rekindle Christian power in Latin America. Evangelicalism is transforming parties and possibly the Catholic Church. Conservative parties used to think of themselves as the region’s essential check against populism. That pitch is no longer credible. These parties are realizing that going along with pastors generates voter excitement, even if only among churchgoers, and excitement equals power.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Perfect Storm Is Coming to Mexico,"Jorge G. Castañeda MEXICO CITY — Countries don’t disappear, it has been said, but sometimes they do encounter perfect storms. These do not threaten their existence, yet they can represent major challenges to their welfare and integrity. Mexico may be on the verge of such a perfect storm as it enters a new year fraught with multiple perils and few opportunities. Three dark clouds threaten Mexico’s future in 2018: Donald Trump’s tax overhaul, the possible end of Nafta and a presidential election that may introduce an era of turmoil and uncertainty for the economy and Mexican society at large. The first threat has little to do with Mexico’s policies or control of its destiny. Whatever one thinks of the new tax regime in the United States, there is little question that it belongs strictly to the American domestic policy realm, unlike immigration policy, which has been the subject of several agreements between the United States and, among others, Mexico and Cuba. Nonetheless, with regard to tax policy, the problem for the United States’ neighbors lies in the consequences it may have on their domestic economies. This is a typical internal economic policy issue of the United States, like raising or lowering interest rates, with major international repercussions. For Mexico, it is quite likely, economists say, that Trump’s tax reform entails three significant downsides. First, Mexican conglomerates may decide to move their headquarters and legal residence to the United States to take advantage of a now much lower corporate tax rate (30 percent in Mexico versus 21 percent in the United States). While this would not necessarily transfer jobs from one country to the other, it may discourage foreign, or even national, investment in Mexico. If big Mexican multinationals such as Cemex, Bimbo, Televisa or Mexichem were to relocate north of the border, why shouldn’t smaller companies, or potential newcomers, do the same? Second, American corporations with large investments in Mexico might decide to take advantage of other favorable provisions aside from the tax rate differential in the tax overhaul and repatriate money and jobs to the United States. Finally, the tax package could easily dissuade American firms from investing in Mexico — which is partly what it was meant to do, even if it ultimately did not include a border tax or a value-added tax. As it is, direct foreign investment in Mexico has been either stagnant or dropping (especially as a share of gross domestic product) over the past couple of years; this might bring on a drastic reduction. Theoretically, Mexico could counter all this with its own Trump-like tax changes — except that the blow to government revenues would be devastating. As it is, Mexico has one of the lowest tax rates among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Lowering them would create a severe fiscal problem. Especially since south of the border, few serious people believe that cutting taxes raises revenues. The second ominous possibility lurking on Mexico’s horizon is the end of Nafta, or, at best, the indefinite postponement of renegotiation, perpetuating uncertainty. Talks are scheduled through March or April. But given Mexican presidential elections on July 1, and a United States midterm vote in November, it would be impossible for a hypothetical agreement to be ratified by both Congresses, and perhaps the Canadian Parliament, before early 2019. This would deter foreign investment at least until the new rules are determined and also allow the Trump administration to continue to threaten a Nafta blowup to obtain concessions from Mexico on other issues. “Hypothetical” is a big word. Such little progress has been made on America’s stringent demands that there is no agreement in sight. The Trump administration wants the so-called rules of origin renegotiated, requiring, for example, that at least 50 percent of a Nafta-produced car be made of American parts. Washington also wants disputes settled in American courts (and not in the more neutral arbitration bodies set up by the treaty), limits on the export of some agricultural products from Mexico to the United States, and the entire agreement revisited every five years. With these sticking points hanging over the talks, President Trump’s negotiators may any day invoke Nafta’s Article 2205, which provides for a signatory’s exit from the treaty in six months. While Mexico will survive without Nafta, the impact on foreign investment, much more than on trade, would be devastating for the first few years. This is not good news for an economy that is expected to grow less than 2 percent in 2018, and has expanded recently at an average rate of barely 2 percent per year. Lower growth means less employment, which, among other things, could prompt greater emigration from Mexico to the United States. The third squall ahead lies in the presidential election. This will be the fifth consecutive democratic vote for Mexico: a first in its history. That in itself is a major achievement. And the election promises to be fundamentally free and fair: another accomplishment. But the outcome, at least according to most current polls, promises to be problematic. The reason is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the left-wing politician and presidential candidate better known as AMLO. The issue is not so much whether Mr. López Obrador, the former mayor of Mexico City, will win — he is a clear front-runner — but rather whether the domestic and foreign business communities believe he will. They appear to, and are already acting in consequence, generating the beginnings of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Similarly, predictions of his being another Hugo Chávez or Luis Echeverría (Mexico’s populist president of the 1970s) may or may not be valid; the question is whether investors trust those forecasts. They seem to, and are either delaying projects in the pipeline or postponing new ones until after the election. Many expect that Mr. López Obrador will indeed attempt to keep many of his promises. These range from a de facto reversal of energy reform and canceling construction of a new airport in Mexico City to higher (necessary) spending on fighting poverty. One of his most intriguing recent commitments, amnesty for drug-cultivating peasants and engaging in conversations with cartel kingpins, while innovative and bold, might be considered anathema in Washington. Again, these promises may be red herrings, so to speak, but if enough decision-makers subscribe to them, their effect is the same as if they came true. What these three clouds imply for Mexico is a protracted period of insignificant growth after a long period of mediocre growth. They probably entail more drug production, migration and violence. Poverty and inequality, which have both shrunk slightly over the past 15 years, will rise again. None of this is good news for Mexico. Under ideal international circumstances, that would be formidable challenge; with Donald Trump in the White House, it can be a nightmare. Other than believing in miracles — the United States economy, as opposed to Wall Street, is on the cusp of an extraordinary boom; China will come to Mexico’s rescue; eradicating corruption in Mexico will solve all problems — there are no credible alternatives. A pity that Mexico proved unable to take advantage of its last 25 years of good fortune in dealing with the United States. Now only God and the Virgin of Guadalupe can help.",The New York Times
2018,"A Philadelphia Theater Heading, and Sweating, in a New Direction","PHILADELPHIA — Blanka Zizka, the artistic director of the Wilma Theater here, had reached a breaking point. About seven years ago, she was putting on a new play featuring actors from New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, and “the room was filled with egos and fears,” Ms. Zizka said. It felt all too familiar: “starting a production trying to get the fear out of people.” “It takes a long time to build trust,” explained Ms. Zizka, who defected from Czechoslovakia in 1976 with her husband, Jiri, and joined the fledgling Wilma three years later. “That sense of discontinuity was really painful. I thought, if that’s what theater means in the United States, I don’t want to do it. One possibility was to retire, and the other was to change things.” Ms. Zizka did not retire — she went rogue. The Wilma now has a three-year-old resident acting company and welcomes shows whose daring aesthetics depart from the factory-setting naturalism of most American stages, especially regional ones. In November, for instance, the Hungarian director Csaba Horvath’s adventurous production of Federico García Lorca’s “Blood Wedding,” from 1932, started with high-energy Eastern European folk dancing. The rest of the show was similarly devoid of stereotypical Spanish signposts, betting instead on visceral physicality and complex tableaux. It looked like the kind of stylish Euro import one would see at the Brooklyn Academy of Music or the Park Avenue Armory. When a theater company drastically changes course, it’s usually because a new leader has taken the reins, emboldened by ambitious dreams and the willingness to ruffle a few feathers. But Ms. Zizka, 63, has been at the head of the Wilma since 1981, first as co-artistic director with her husband, and on her own since 2010. (Mr. Zizka died in 2012.) The Zizkas turned the Philadelphia theater, which started in 1973 as a feminist and avant-garde project, into a local institution, with a modern 296-seat auditorium on the city’s bustling Avenue of the Arts. The fellow Czech émigré Tom Stoppard is the Wilma’s signature playwright. Ms. Zizka could easily have stayed on cruise control; instead, she decided to “bring fresh air into the city,” as she put it. Frustrated by her experience on that play a few years back, she put on her scouting hat. “I started to reconnect with my European origins and went back to Berlin, to festivals in Amsterdam and Antwerp,” she said. “I admired the fearlessness of some of the European company actors, which I did not — do not — see in productions in the United States.” Among her first moves was to organize acting workshops led by Jean-René Toussaint, a French coach and actor who emphasizes a vocal training he dubs “primitive voice.” Ms. Zizka also trawled YouTube for inspiration and in 2011 discovered a video of the Greek director Theodoros Terzopoulos, from the Attis Theater in Athens, teaching an acting class in Poland. A few years later, she brought him over to present his production of “Ajax, the Madness” at Philadelphia’s FringeArts festival. He also conducted a four-day workshop that would plant the seed of HotHouse, the Wilma’s “artistic incubator” and acting company, and a key element in Ms. Zizka’s plan. While many regional theaters once had resident companies, that model has evaporated over the past two decades or so. Trinity Repertory Company, in Providence, R.I., has a 16-member troupe and is one of the few theaters left to guarantee its group between 30 and 40 weeks’ worth of work a year. Yet Curt Columbus, Trinity’s artistic director, is optimistic — perhaps overly so, considering long-term trends — that change may be on the horizon. He uses the locavore food movement for comparison. “What you’re seeing is a little bit of a return to the land, where people look around and go, ‘What are we doing for our local community?’” Mr. Columbus said by telephone. “If I’m bringing in actors from New York or Los Angeles, they don’t have any investment in the people who are here.” Of course, with seven productions per season and an annual budget just over $9 million, Trinity Rep has more breathing room than the Wilma, which usually puts on four shows on an annual budget of $3.7 million. (There were only three in 2017-18 because the Wilma presented Opera Philadelphia’s “We Shall Not Be Moved” in the fall slot, and also worked on a new lobby cafe around that time.) The Wilma must also be aware of the ominous shadow cast by the neighboring Philadelphia Theater Company, which had to repurchase its own venue after the bank foreclosed and severely curtailed its 2017-18 season to pay off debt. So for now, at least, the Wilma’s effort remains financially modest: The HotHouse actors get paid when they are cast in a show, and they receive a stipend for attending the communal training Ms. Zizka has instituted to build esprit de corps. Three Mondays out of the month between September and June, the 12 company members participate in five-hour sessions filled with exercises drawn from Mr. Terzopoulos’s techniques. They did not go down easily at first. “There is a rigorous collectivity to this work that is strenuously un-American in a way that is both exciting and disturbing,” said Ross Beschler, a HotHouse member. At first, he questioned the idea. “It pushed my ideas of myself and what I could do in terms of my flexibility, my depth, my strength. But after a day thinking about that, I was, ‘Oh that’s a good thing!’ ” Training takes place at the Wilma’s studio, in a slightly grungier neighborhood a half-hour walk from the theater. Before entering the space, the participants leave their shoes at the door, along with their inhibitions and self-consciousness. Mr. Terzopoulos’s approach emphasizes breathing, with the diaphragm the gateway to feeling, and it starts with an extended vocal and physical warm-up. “This is the idea of the vertical voice, in which you find emotions inside your body,” the wiry, soft-spoken Ms. Zizka said. “People are blocked in their bodies, so this is a way to generate emotions by opening up the back of the bodies. You want to have emotion, body, voice, all in a fluid expression.” The process then moves on to a “deconstruction” stage. “It’s about, How do I take apart the function of the breath, and how do I look at different parts of the body?” said Justin Jain, among the handful of HotHouse actors who have traveled to Greece to train at Attis. “It’s all in service of excavating what Terzopoulos calls the capital-B Body. That includes not only your physicality but your memory, your history, your imagination — everything about the human experience.” That phase can last three or four hours, according to Mr. Jain. Next comes “the infinite improvisation,” he said, when “you start to marry a text or a concept or an idea to that form.” This requires the actors to be comfortable with themselves and with one another — at a November session, some cried, others got into a trance-like state. “It’s better than therapy,” Ms. Zizka said, chuckling. As her experiment evolves, Ms. Zizka must balance artistic daring with pragmatic considerations that American nonprofit institutions inevitably face. One question mark is the future of WynTix, which keeps tickets for a show’s initial run at an affordable $30 ($10 for students). A grant from the Wyncote Foundation in Philadelphia funded the initiative, which was extended by one year and is now slated to conclude at the end of the season; the Wilma is exploring ways to continue it. Meanwhile, on Jan. 10, the Wilma begins five-week run of the Stew and Heidi Rodewald musical “Passing Strange,” which will mix HotHouse members and others. The Wilma had to partner with a commercial producer to bring the Tony-nominated show’s revival to fruition. That show’s director, Tea Alagic, has worked with HotHouse and attended the strenuous Monday sessions. So has Kate Tarker, who has been commissioned to write a play in the Wilma’s 2018-19 season. “They have a warm-up ritual that they do on Mondays where it’s like they’re excavating this sadness from their bones,” Ms. Tarker reported. “So I wrote them a piece that’s a tragedy but also kind of a comedy about tragedy. I was interested in bringing them a challenge.”",The New York Times

2018,A Pianist’s Big Prize: The 8 Best Classical Music Moments of the Week on YouTube,"that decisive moment Our critics and reporters offer a glimpse of what’s moved and delighted them on YouTube. Read the rest of our classical music coverage here. at 24 seconds Igor Levit — who won one of the most prestigious prizes in music this week, the $300,000 Gilmore Artist Award — allows his politics to inform his artistry to an extent that is rare in the classical world. At the first night of the BBC Proms last summer, in a London consumed by Brexit, Mr. Levit made a pointed statement with his encore, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” the anthem of the European Union, a point he underlined with the E.U. pin he wore. But the power of the gesture came from his musicianship — the way his left hand drew out the ominous undertones of Liszt’s transcription, making the familiar, joyful melody seem hard-won when it finally rings out clearly. MICHAEL COOPER Read our profile of Mr. Levit, and watch a 360-degree video featuring his piano flying above the streets of Berlin. Read our review of Mr. Levit’s New York recital debut in 2014. Read our review of “Goldberg,” Mr. Levit’s 2015 collaboration with Marina Abramovic. Read our review of Mr. Levit’s debut recital at Carnegie Hall last year. AT 1 MINUTE 10 SECONDS In his first appearance after winning the Gilmore, a celebratory talk and recital at the Greene Space on Thursday night, Igor Levit opened with understated virtuosity: the Chaconne from Bach’s Partita No. 2 for violin, transcribed for the left hand by Brahms. The piece takes place mostly in the piano’s lower range, which is notoriously muddy, but not in Mr. Levit’s hands — er, hand. Many critics have noted his phenomenal precision, and you can hear why in this recording of Frederic Rzewski’s 1975 variations on “The People United Will Never Be Defeated!” In the final movement, the theme returns as hammered chords (marked with accents on top of a forte) played almost entirely on the lower half of the piano. The melody inside those chords couldn’t be clearer. JOSHUA BARONE AT 2 MINUTES 47 SECONDS Ahead of her performances with the New York Philharmonic this week, the cellist Alisa Weilerstein joined us for a Facebook Live concert and interview. She closed with the two bourrées from Bach’s Suite No. 3 in C, which she has been touring as part of a three-hour marathon of all six of Bach’s cello suites. I asked when we could expect a recording; alas, likely not this year. But this led me back to her other albums, including her impassioned recording of Dvorak’s Cello Concerto with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. Her playing has the expressive power of human voice — especially in the second movement, in which Dvorak borrows the melody from his lied “Lasst mich allein.” The song’s opening line, “Leave me alone in my dreams,” comes through in Ms. Weilerstein’s playing, with the fragile sincerity of a pleading heart. JOSHUA BARONE Watch Alisa Weilerstein on Facebook Live and read our review of her concert with the Philharmonic. At 1 minute 46 seconds Electronic works by the composer Natasha Barrett were among the highlights I encountered at a “spatial audio workshop” last summer at Empac, the experimental performance center in Troy, N.Y. Reading an intriguing best-of-2017 list by the music writer Simon Cummings, I was alerted to the existence of a new album focused on some of Ms. Barrett’s early pieces. My current favorite from the batch is “Racing Unseen.” The composition starts out with some harsh and distorted waves of sound, before settling into a lull influenced by ambient textures. This calm is not long-lived, though. Shortly before the two-minute mark, a single thwack — suggestive of steel percussion — heralds a slow turn toward rhythmic chaos. When the composition reaches a feverish peak, Ms. Barrett can be heard toying with the beats in a way that might thrill fans of house music from Chicago’s “footwork” scene. SETH COLTER WALLS at 1 minute 3 seconds The charismatic tenor Vittorio Grigolo, who never holds back, is a hotheaded and heroic Cavaradossi in the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Puccini’s “Tosca.” Mr. Grigolo’s fans, who love his burnished sound and unbridled passion, are sure to be thrilled. Yet other opera buffs can’t get past some rawness in his voice. That downside matters more when he takes on classic bel canto roles, like Nemorino in Donizetti’s “L’Elisir d’Amore,” which he sang at the Met in 2016. Here he is in the aria “Una furtiva lagrima.” He does have a penchant for scooping (that is, sliding) up to higher notes rather than executing them cleanly. (Listen to the second phrase.) Still, if you can accept this as a characteristic of Mr. Grigolo’s dramatic approach and not as a vocal mannerism, rewards come with the ardency and sheen of his singing. When he exclaims “M’ama” (“She loves me”), about the woman he loves from afar, Mr. Grigolo sounds overcome with fervor and hope. Of course she loves him. How could she not? ANTHONY TOMMASINI Read our review of the new “Tosca.” AT 1 MINUTE 17 SECONDS Sergei Prokofiev, an adherent of Christian Science, was not especially known for settings of music of the Russian Orthodox Church, so he seemed the odd man out amid the likes of Kastalsky, Chesnokov and Rachmaninoff in a New Year’s program by the PaTRAM Institute Singers and the Clarion Choir. At the end of the PaTRAM half of the program came “Many Years,” Prokofiev’s arrangement of a centuries-old refrain for the coronation scene in Eisenstein’s 1944 film “Ivan the Terrible.” Here the festival choir of the Summer School of Liturgical Music at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, N.Y., sings it, after a minute of rising chant — a signature of the style — sung by a basso profundo acting as deacon: “Grant, O Lord, a prosperous and peaceful life.” JAMES R. OESTREICH at 30 seconds In a 1910 letter to the composer Edgar Varèse, Debussy complained of feeling betrayed by “so-called” pianists. “I can’t tell you the extent to which my piano music has been deformed,” he wrote. This year, the centennial of Debussy’s death, will offer many opportunities to hear his music, including the piano works. What bothered him about the way many pianists played his music, I think, is that they took the “Impressionist” label (and Debussy disliked that word) as an invitation for excessively loose rhythm and overly blurry textures. We have a few precious examples of Debussy at the piano. In 1904 he recorded a few short songs and a brief excerpt from “Pelléas et Mélisande” with Mary Garden, the soprano Debussy chose to create the role of Mélisande in 1902. Here they are in the fifth song (“Green”) from his cycle “Ariettes Oubliées.” You have to listen closely and disregard the surface noise. Debussy plays the lilting opening lightly and crisply. When splashes of watery arpeggios break out, the sound is milky but also wonderfully scintillating. ANTHONY TOMMASINI AT 53 SECONDS Tenet ushered out the Christmas season on Wednesday with Vespers music of the 17th-century German master Michael Praetorius, who has always struck me as the proprietor of the holiday candy store. His sweets include multiple settings of the hymn “Puer Natus in Bethlehem” (“A Boy Is Born in Bethlehem”), sung by Tenet this week in a version different from the more elaborate one it sings here, in a 2013 performance in San Diego with the Dark Horse Consort and the Bach Collegium San Diego.

2018,A Pizzeria and Fine-Dining Restaurant — All in One,"One frigid morning in December, a modest Revolutionary War-era wooden house in the center of Kent, Conn., was abuzz with activity. In the rear of the building, home to the newly opened restaurant Swyft, employees were tidying and prepping the night’s menu of wood-fired pizzas, fresh pastas and small plates. In a front extension, carpenters were banging away amid the elegant, putty-colored walls of Ore Hill, a fine-dining restaurant that will open early this summer. Nimbly presiding over it all was chef Joel Viehland, who crisscrossed the space, gesticulating to builders on the Ore Hill side, then darting over to Swyft’s prep stations and nudging his staff to “feed Sour Girl”— a term of endearment for his prized long-fermented sourdough starter. Viehland’s schedule for the past year has been a balancing act, preparing for the unveiling of his two distinct yet interconnected restaurants. In many ways, the concept, a combination of the casual and the formal, is not unlike the working relationship behind it, between Viehland and the philanthropist Anne Bass. After the James Beard–nominated Viehland, who has cooked at Noma and Gramercy Tavern, left his most recent post at the acclaimed Community Table in New Preston, he began brainstorming ideas with Bass, a longtime local resident, who just happened to be purchasing this building in Kent. “We started asking questions,” Viehland explained. “Do we need a casual restaurant, or do we need a fine-dining restaurant?” They decided that Litchfield County — with its growing number of quietly chic shops (including Plain Goods, George Home and Privet House) and its roster of marquee fashion- and art-world residents (Jasper Johns, Agnes Gund, Diane von Furstenberg) — could use both. At Ore Hill & Swyft, the balance between approachable and upscale will be key. On the Swyft side, the interior is relaxed and warmly inviting, clad in pine with the original 1780 post-and-beam construction beautifully preserved. Ore Hill, its fine-dining counterpart, will be more dressed-up but similarly low-key, furnished with Shaker-inspired tables and chairs. Behind both spaces are a number of design stars: Walter Moberg, who restored the fireplaces at the palace of Versailles, was brought in to consult on the fireplaces; the architect Yvette Adams, the landscape designer Arne Maynard, the lighting designer Craig Roberts and the art director Richard Pandiscio also all had a hand in the look and feel of Ore Hill & Swyft, as did Amy Mellen, the former creative director of Calvin Klein Home. The menu at Swyft is Southern Italian-based, but with plenty of global references. “It’s a pretty average Joe menu,” said Viehland, humbly underselling his selection of lush Bolognese, agrodolce-topped burgers and beef-tallow fries, “but we’re trying to do the best version of these classic items. It’s affordable food, but with elevated flavor profiles making things taste amazing.” Those expansive flavors come courtesy of Viehland’s precisely calibrated pizza dough made with five artisanal flours and his waste-nothing, skin-to-seed approach to produce (his kitchen shelves are brimming with apple peels, pepper skins and other discards that have been dehydrated, charred or ground up to be used as spices). A dizzying array of Swyft’s (and eventually Ore Hill’s) produce comes from Rock Cobble Farm, Bass’s nearby organic farm. “Anne has always been a passionate horticulturalist — she really knows a lot about plants,” said Viehland. “The level of this farm is crazy high.” There are 34 varieties of tomatoes alone, including Black Opal, Indigo Rose and Green Zebra, as well as cardoons, artichokes, husk cherries, tomatillos and black raspberries. But the real surprises are greenhouse-grown citrus such as yuzu, limes and kumquats, as well as lemongrass and ginger, which make their way into Swyft menu items such as crudo with yuzukoshō and pickled celtuce. When Ore Hill opens this summer, it will likely be offering experimental tasting menus. “I want to do some more creative, avant-garde stuff that you could only do in a fine-dining atmosphere,” Viehland said. To that end, Rock Cobble Farm is growing some unusual plants such as huauzontle (or “Aztec broccoli”) and hard-to-find varieties of melons such as Charentais and Prescott Fond Blanc. Viehland stressed, however, that he intends to keep the upscale part of the venture accessible to all. “I want to do a version of fine dining that’s not pretentious and overbearing but really warm, like we’re welcoming you into our home. There should always be a yin and a yang to these things.”",The New York Times
2018,A Place for Us to Skate,"the look Unity is a queer skateboarding collective in California, designed as a haven from the sometimes-hostile environment the sport has fostered. OAKLAND, Calif. — Trevor Straub first stepped onto a skateboard at age 7, and by 13 was making the rounds on California’s competitive skateboarding circuit, even taking home prizes. A series of ankle injuries got in the way of a skate career, but Straub’s healing time coincided with the early stages of exploring identity, an evolving “otherness” that was not met warmly by the skate scene. “I lost all my friends,” said Straub, now 25, who identifies as gender nonconforming. “I didn’t skate for 10 years. I just quit — I didn’t own a skateboard, I didn’t look at skateboarding magazines. I hated it.” Today, Straub rides with Unity, a queer skate collective in Oakland, Calif., that brings together L.G.B.T.Q. and gender-nonconforming people who want to reclaim skateboarding. Unity is the brainchild of Jeffrey Cheung, 28, a multidisciplinary artist from the East Bay. “I wasn’t out in high school,” Mr. Cheung said at a recent Unity skate meet-up in Oakland. “When I was skateboarding, I heard homophobic slurs all the time, like ‘faggot,’ or ‘that’s so gay.’ It’s not a very safe environment for a queer person to come out.” The idea for a skaters’ safe space came to Mr. Cheung at the end of 2016, when he was simultaneously reeling from the election results and grieving the death of a close friend. “I had a really dark end of the year,” he said. “It made me want to do something positive.” Unity was founded on Jan. 1, 2017, and now hosts monthly skate gatherings in the Bay Area that draw as many as 50 people per session. The collective has attracted individuals both familiar with and new to skateboarding, like Gabriel Ramirez, who described skating as “a very empowering thing to do.” He was encouraged to pick it up by Unity and by Mr. Cheung, who is his boyfriend. “Skateboarding is a part of Jeff’s life, and it was bound to become a part of mine at some point,” Mr. Ramirez, 29, said. Skate scenes, he said, “always felt like a space that I didn’t feel welcome in, even though I was definitely interested in it growing up. I was afraid of being picked on. I was figuring out my queer identity, and I felt like an outcast.” His experience is echoed by many who attend Unity events. “Growing up, I skated with your typical skate crew — dudes’ dudes,” said Victor Valdez, 31, who says he regularly heard homophobic slurs in the scene. “That’s what skateboarding was, and kind of still is. It’s this super-open, diverse community that’s super-jock-ish. They have these really heteronormative standards, it’s almost like football.” “When you’re skateboarding, you’re hanging out with dudes all day,” he said. “You’re not getting any other perspective.” Rob Ferguson, 30, who identifies as straight and as an ally to the queer community, was invited to the meet-up by a friend. Mr. Ferguson runs a skateboard academy in Oakland, offering introduction and intensive skateboarding camp programs for youth. His view of the skating community is optimistic and untainted by the discrimination felt by some members of Unity. Skateboarding, Mr. Ferguson said, is one sport in which it does not matter where you come from: “You can come from all walks of life and you are pretty much always accepted.” The scene has traditionally been made up of mostly young men, but skateboarding “has never forcibly excluded anyone else, not like other sports.” “Just because you’re invited doesn’t mean you’re welcome,” said Mare Young, 25, known as “Turb0,” who has been skating since the age of 7. Like many others who have since found Unity, Young mostly skated solo as a way to enjoy the sport but avoid the typical skate scene. Mae Ross, a 20 year old transgender woman, skated alone post-transition. “Skating was really hard for me for a second there, adjusting to my newly developing body and trying to skate and maintain relationships with people I skated with before,” said Ross, who relocated from Bakersfield, Calif., to the San Francisco area a year ago, in part to find like-minded people in a city long known for its L.G.B.T.Q. population, but struggled to find skating companions before Unity. “I thought I would meet more girl skaters or something, but even if I did, they wouldn’t really talk to me,” Ross said. “None of those hesher bro skaters liked me anyway, even before I transitioned.” Mr. Valdez also opted to skate alone after growing tired of the macho skate scene he’d grown up in. When he moved to the Bay Area, he skated by himself, he said, as he was trying to come out. “I wasn’t trying to meet a bunch of, like, skater bros and have to deal with that,” he said. Mr. Valdez discovered the Unity community through Instagram (@unityskateboarding). He messaged Mr. Cheung on Instagram and told him, “you’re doing cool things.” Mr. Cheung’s response, Mr. Valdez said, “was, like, ‘come out and skate.’” Arriving at his first Unity meet-up in June, he was floored. “It was insane,” he said. “I’ve never had a feeling like that before. It was insanely diverse in terms of sexuality, gender, race. Everyone dresses different, everyone has different style. It was a really amazing feeling, because that’s exactly what I was kind of looking for: that queer community that’s getting into skating.” Immediately, he said, “everyone was superfriendly, like you’ve known them together.” That was something he had never felt in a skate community.

2018,A Plan for the Knicks’ Future? Look to the Spurs’ Past,"On Pro Basketball By the fourth quarter on Tuesday night, Manu Ginobili was a 40-year-old Argentine rock star gyrating on stage at Madison Square Garden. He had injected life into a moribund San Antonio Spurs offense with his constant, if inelegant, motion. In one display of unorthodoxy that was extravagant even for him, he aimed a lob pass to LaMarcus Aldridge from 23 feet and watched it drop through the hoop. “It went so clean that nobody saw it,” the still Jack-be-nimble Ginobili said of how all three officials initially thought the ball had hit the net, not gone through it, before awarding him a 3-pointer. By then, the Spurs were on their way to a second victory over the Knicks within a week, 100-91, and the sizable Argentine cheering section that often greets Ginobili in New York was serenading him with chants of “Olé, olé, olé, olé, Manu, Manu.” Beyond such bursts of nationalistic fealty, the Spurs have never been among the N.B.A.’s sexier road and television ratings sells, in comparison to those teams powered by the preferred sneaker pitchmen that Coach Gregg Popovich’s five-time champions (dating to 1999) have never had. But what if they had hailed from a more media-centric market from which to launch their egalitarian approach, the one that endures in the post-Duncan era with a new leading man, Kawhi Leonard, who, like Tim Duncan, is averse to preening? By the measures of a time (the early 1970s) and team (the 1970 and 1973 championship Knicks) that helped shape the young Popovich’s coaching methodology, it’s easy to imagine him in New York being deified as the second coming of Red Holzman; Duncan as the reincarnation of Willis Reed; and Ginobili, along with the French point guard Tony Parker, as celebrated examples of melting pot diversity. Leonard? The melded athletic evolution of Cazzie Russell, Dave Stallworth, Bill Bradley and Dave DeBusschere. It’s also fair to wonder: In the increasingly glitzy, superstar-driven N.B.A., could the Spurs have even been the Spurs in a market like New York, with its itinerant night life temptations and news-media-induced ego inflations? “When you’re winning, I think you could do it,” Popovich said in the coaching office of the visitors’ locker room before Tuesday’s game. “I think they could have survived here. As far as the invasiveness, they’re also pretty open to people. They talk. But they’re pretty selfless in that it’s never been about the camera. So I think the solid, fundamental play and the individual personalities would have been appreciated by the Knicks fans, who are the most sophisticated — at least that’s what’s in my head.” The question becomes more relevant now that the Knicks have moved on from their failed Hail Carmelo experiment and are building a foundation with a Spurs-like international flavor, beginning with the Latvian big man Kristaps Porzingis, the promising French rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina and the charismatic Turkish center Enes Kanter. The Knicks may not be ready to beat the still formidable Spurs, but can they — operationally and stylistically, at least — become the Spurs? A comically caustic voice of experience, Popovich is often asked what he thinks of pretty much all things N.B.A., and more. He will typically respond by saying, “Last I checked, we were still turning the ball over, so until I get all of that stuff straight, I don’t have to worry about anybody else.” But the Knicks — and Ntilikina, in particular — did leave an impression on him in San Antonio last week with their attitude and their commitment to ball movement. “They came into the timeouts and walked back onto the court and they played, and whether something went well or wrong for them, they just played, just competed,” Popovich said. “So I was just impressed with the operation.” On Ntilikina, he said: “It was the first time I watched the point guard, and he was calm and cool the entire game. Didn’t say anything, just did what they asked him to do.” Noting Ntilikina’s mental approach, size, reach, court vision and defensive tenacity, Popovich nodded when it was suggested that the 19-year-old could be a nightly stat-line filler. “He might be special,” he said. Popovich had to deal with a 19-year-old French kid with a different body type and playing approach when Parker was a rookie in 2001. Popovich’s first workout impression of Parker was “a skinny kid” who struck him as “soft” and “too cool for school.” He was inclined not to draft him, but a second look convinced him otherwise, and Parker was so impressive in training camp that he wound up starting 72 games as a rookie — and that was for a team with championship aspirations. “I don’t know if rolling the dice makes you brave, but the insanity was certainly there,” Popovich said. Parker, he agreed, paved the road for Ntilikina and others. As did the Spurs, in a larger sense, for latecomers like the Knicks to the mining of international talent. “It’s just not an oddity, success through other people’s success, just knowing it could happen,” Popovich said. “We’ve all got ’em, and it’s made the N.B.A. better.” Importing talent is different from nurturing it and blending it with homegrown talent, as the Spurs have done for nearly two decades with uninterrupted excellence. The challenge for the Knicks’ management team headed by Steve Mills and Scott Perry is how to tune out the daily news media dissections, balance long-term ambitions with short-term rewards, while hoping that the owner James Dolan doesn’t resort to his past chaos-inducing intrusions. All with the understanding that Porzingis and his canny older brother and agent, Janis, are watching closely to see if the Knicks can behave more like the Spurs before the time comes to recommit long-term. Ever the defender of the smaller and less-fussed-over market, Popovich nonetheless said he hoped they could. “I’ve always believed that the N.B.A.’s better if it has good teams in New York, L.A., Chicago,” he said. “It raises everybody’s boat.” At least the case can be made it did the last time the Knicks won a title, when Popovich was touring the world while serving in the Air Force, 45 years ago this spring.",The New York Times
2018,"A Play About Race and Memory, With Fresh Wounds All Around","ATLANTA — It was 2014 — and in retrospect, an altogether different period in American history — when this city’s Alliance Theater first staged its adaptation of “Native Guard,” Natasha Trethewey’s Pulitzer Prize-winning poetry collection that conjures little-known scenes from the black Civil War experience, and challenges the way the broader story of the war has been told and memorialized. The nation’s first black president was still in office. “Charlottesville” was not yet shorthand for a hate rally. And grand statues of Confederate heroes stood, as they had for decades, in the hearts of southern cities like New Orleans and Memphis. Today, some of those statues have been taken down, while the fate of many similar monuments remains a searing topic of debate. And the Alliance, one of Atlanta’s premier theater companies, has resurrected its adaptation of “Native Guard,” this time not in a traditional playhouse, but at the Atlanta History Center, where it is being deliberately — and provocatively — staged just steps from the museum’s Civil War exhibit. The idea sprang in part from necessity. With the Alliance’s home base at the Woodruff Arts Center under renovation, the company decided to take its 49th season on the road, performing in venues around metro Atlanta. But the revival of “Native Guard” is also a deliberate effort by the theater to elbow its way into the roiling debate about race and historical memory that was sparked after a racist neo-Confederate sympathizer, Dylann Roof, massacred nine African-Americans in June 2015 at a Charleston, S.C., church. “It felt like we were the ones broaching the subject in 2014,” said January LaVoy, the New York-based actor who once again plays the character based on Ms. Trethewey, the United States poet laureate from 2012 to 2014. “Now, in 2018, these conversations are being had all the time, in all sorts of ways — and very impolitely.” Audiences at the play, which runs through Feb. 4, are being encouraged to stay after the performance to take part in what is billed as an Act II, a moderated audience conversation about the work, race and history. At intermission, they are encouraged to walk through the History Center’s Civil War exhibition and admire its extensive collection of rifles and ordnance, with words from Ms. Trethewey’s imagined monologue by a black Union soldier still fresh in their ears: “Some names shall deck the page of history/as it is written on stone. Some will not.” The wrongs Ms. Trethewey describes have not been easily righted. As calls for the removal of Confederate symbols have mounted, particularly around the South, the backlash from neo-Confederates and other whites concerned that their own history is being erased has been occasionally ugly, and even deadly. Though many see the public memorials to the breakaway Southern states as little more than celebrations of white supremacy, President Trump has lamented the removal of “our beautiful” Confederate statues. At the same time, amid the shoving, shouting and violence, a more measured conversation is being had about the recalibration of American history and the rethinking of historical symbols, one in which the art world has played a central role. Artists, art historians and preservationists have weighed in on what to do with the decommissioned Confederate statues, and on questions of their artistic merit. In Baltimore, a statue of a pregnant black woman with a raised fist, created by the artist Pablo Machioli, briefly occupied a space where the city’s Lee-Jackson memorial had stood before its removal in August. Good-natured petitions calling for alternative monuments to the African-American hip-hop artists OutKast and Missy Elliott have appeared in their respective hometowns of Atlanta and Portsmouth, Va. This is the context in which the Alliance seeks to interject its revival of “Native Guard.” Ms. Trethewey’s celebrated 2006 book is itself a kind of literary monument to her experience growing up in Mississippi as a biracial child, to her African-American mother, and to the Louisiana Native Guards, the black Union soldiers who fought on the Mississippi coast and guarded a prison camp for captured Confederates at Ship Island, south of Biloxi. “The book is trying, in many ways, to talk about those things that have been forgotten or erased or somehow left out of the historical record, and I’m very concerned with trying to inscribe, or reinscribe, those things,” Ms. Trethewey, an English professor at Northwestern University, said in a recent phone interview. The Alliance’s artistic director, Susan V. Booth, approached the Atlanta History Center with the idea of staging the play alongside its collection of Civil War artifacts. It was enthusiastically embraced by F. Sheffield Hale, the center’s president and CEO. “I said, ‘Hell yeah,” recalled Mr. Hale, who said he was already a fan of the book. “It fits into our new strategic plan of working with other institutions and getting different people from different ZIP codes and different interests in here,” he said. Mr. Hale is not a historian but a history buff, an Atlanta native with a law degree from the University of Virginia. Since taking the helm of the museum in 2012, he has helped raise $65 million for the center, bringing glossy upgrades to its main campus in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood, but also a fresh emphasis on diversity and historical nuance. The famous cyclorama painting, “The Battle of Atlanta,” that was once housed near the Atlanta Zoo, has been moved to the center and placed in a custom-built cylindrical gallery that will open to the public in November. The massive work, originally painted to celebrate Northern victory but later associated with the Lost Cause myth — the romanticized and often whitewashed version of the Confederate story — will be accompanied by materials that will, as Mr. Hale has said, “demonstrate the power of the use and misuse of historical memory.” Ms. Booth, the director of “Native Guard,” said that only small things will change from the earlier productions of the play. Ms. LaVoy and Neal A. Ghant, another actor returning from the original cast, deliver the full text of the book without a single deletion or alteration. “The beauty of the piece is its constructed elegance,” Ms. Booth said. “I didn’t want to change a word.” A gallery space has been transformed into a theater, with Ms. LaVoy and Mr. Ghant performing on a simple set that evokes a Ship Island beach, with a huge burlap backdrop. A number of Ms. Trethewey’s poems take up photographs as their subject, and in many cases the photos she refers to in “Native Guard” are projected onto the burlap. The epigraphs Ms. Trethewey sprinkles throughout the book are set to music; at one point, a vocalist, Nicole Banks Long, breaks into a fiery rendition of Nina Simone’s “Mississippi Goddam.” Producers offered free wine to entice the audience at the first preview to stay for Act II. The racially mixed crowd seemed eager enough to weigh in on what they had seen, and talk about the ways the distortions and elisions of American history have affected their present. One woman, who said she had moved from South Africa, lamented that this country had never engaged in a formal reckoning with its past, the way her homeland did after the fall of apartheid. “The lack of a formal reconciliation process here in the United States,” she said, is “still baffling to me.” Toward the end of the show, Ms. LaVoy recites “Incident,” a quiet and haunting poem about a Ku Klux Klan cross burning. When she performed it in 2014, Ms. LaVoy said, “It felt like I was telling stories as a warning, or you know, ‘Those who don’t know their history are doomed to repeat it: Here let me help you, let me teach you.’ “But then, after Charlottesville, I went back to the book, and I thought, ‘My God, it wasn’t past. It was prologue.’”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Plea on Salvadorans,"Letter To the Editor: Re “U.S. Eliminates a Protected Visa for Salvadorans” (front page, Jan. 9): I am saddened by many things done and said in the Trump administration. But no act has been as cruel as the decision to end Temporary Protected Status for the nearly 200,000 Salvadorans living in the United States, many of whom have been living, working and raising families here for more than 20 years. What possible good can it do for the United States to send a hard-working, taxpaying people back “home,” a place devastated by a long civil war where gang violence reigns? The Temporary Protected Status program was not meant as a pathway to citizenship, but what better way to judge a person’s worthiness for citizenship? What more proof do we need that a person who enters the country illegally out of fear for his life (or a life of utter poverty) will make a good citizen than over 20 years of being gainfully employed and paying taxes?

2018,A Prescient Sci-Fi ‘Parable’ Gets Set to Music,"When the plot of a dystopian novel and the daily churn of the news cycle start overlapping, admiration for a given author’s prescience may make way for alarm. Take Octavia E. Butler’s 1993 “Parable of the Sower.” Set in the 2020s, it describes an America where climate change is a menace, conflicts erupt over scarce water supplies, private armies protect corporate interests and the well-to-do wall themselves off in gated communities from the chaos surrounding them. A charismatic politician even promises to “make America great again.” “It’s not that Octavia predicted him,” the musician Toshi Reagon says of a current-day politician who, you may have heard, rode the same slogan to the White House. “It’s that she knew us so well and knew we would allow it to happen. That’s chilling. It gives me bumps on my arms.” Ms. Reagon, whose musical adaptation of the novel is the centerpiece of the Public Theater’s Under the Radar festival, is the granddaughter of a Baptist minister. Her parents became musical luminaries of the civil rights era and beyond: the late Cordell Hull Reagon founded the Freedom Singers, while Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon performed with that group as well as with another a cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock. Their 53-year-old daughter has an aesthetic that lives at the intersection of genres. With the dancer Michelle Dorrance, she created “The Blues Project,” writing music to accompany an exploration of relationships among dance styles, from tap to the Lindy Hop. She collaborated with her mother and Robert Wilson on two original operas. Her adaptation of “Parable of the Sower” is deeply rooted in the African-American sacred music that might be called her family inheritance. But it also incorporates soul, funk, the blues and even a whiff of EDM — “a couple hundred years’ of music that comes out of our country,” Ms. Reagon said. The director, Eric Ting, described the piece, which will be performed at the Public’s Newman Theater from January 8 to 15, as “a cross between a folk opera and a rock concert.” The festival bills it simply as an opera. Ms. Reagon began working on the show about 10 years ago, collaborating with her mother, but Dr. Reagon has since retired from writing and performing. Mark Russell, the director of Under the Radar, described it as “the heartbeat of the festival.” The organization has dedicated significant time and money to the project during a workshop period that included a concert performance at the festival two years ago. The song cycle, which is almost entirely sung-through, has a cast of 14 plus a five-piece band, in addition to Ms. Reagon, who sings and plays acoustic guitar. (The Arts Center at N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, where the show had its world premiere in November, is among the commissioning organizations.) Ms. Reagon said it was a challenge to sort out which elements from Butler’s dense novel could be musicalized. In one case, she turned back to an older song by her mother to dramatize a debate between a character and her minister father. “There’s A New World Coming” originally alluded to colonialism and the war in Vietnam. Here, it addresses the hostile dangers of the world Butler created. The hero of “Parable of the Sower” is Lauren Oya Olamina, an African-American teenager who is displaced from her California home and creates a new religion while building a community among fellow refugees. As a black woman, Butler, who died in 2006 as a much-decorated hero of the science fiction world, performed a radical act in simply claiming her own ground in a space where people who looked like her had long seemed invisible. (The cultural critic Mark Dery coined the term Afrofuturism, the year “Parable of the Sower” was published, in part as a response to Butler’s work.) “When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn’t in any of this stuff,” she told The New York Times in 2000. “I wrote myself in, since I’m me and I’m here and I’m writing.” As a youth, Ms. Reagon would stay up late at night to devour Butler’s books, she said. “I don’t know many black women who haven’t read it,” she said of the subject of her adaptation. “What’s really incredible is that black people insist on being in the future. Women insist on being in the future.” And if that future starts looking more and more like a dystopian vision? “Some people are in complete denial,” she said, “and some people are petrified. So I get to say: If you’re sensing something is off in a way you never have before, you’re right. Something is off. It is urgent.” It’s a new year, so why not try something new? The five performance festivals opening this month in New York will help adventurous theatergoers do just that. These showcases tend to highlight the experimental and the offbeat. Some firsts this year will also be lasts. On Jan. 10, the Coil festival will inaugurate the renovated home of Performance Space 122 in the East Village, but this will be the festival’s final installment. It will be replaced by year-round programming.

2018,A President Not Sure of What He Wants Complicates the Shutdown Impasse,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump mused last year about protecting immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, calling them “these incredible kids,” aides implored him privately to stop talking about them so sympathetically. When he batted around the idea of granting them citizenship over a Chinese dinner at the White House last year with Democratic leaders, Mr. Trump’s advisers quickly drew up a list of hard-line demands to send to Capitol Hill that they said must be included in any such plan. And twice over the past two weeks, Mr. Trump has privately told lawmakers he is eager to strike a deal to extend legal status to the so-called Dreamers, only to have his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, make clear afterward that such a compromise was not really in the offing — unless it also included a host of stiffer immigration restrictions. As the government shutdown appeared to near an end on Monday, one thing was clear to both sides of the negotiations to resolve it: The president was either unwilling or unable to articulate the immigration policy he wanted, much less understand the nuances of what it would involve. Both sides have reason to be confused. Each time Mr. Trump has edged toward compromise with Democrats, he has appeared to be reined in by his own staff, which shares the hawkish immigration stance that fueled his campaign. And Republican leaders, bruised by past experience with a president who has rarely offered them consistent cover on a politically challenging issue, are loath to guess at his intentions. The result has been a paralysis not only at the White House but on Capitol Hill, complicating the chances for an ultimate resolution of how to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, the problem underlying the shutdown. And it has raised questions not only about Mr. Trump’s grasp of the issue that animated his campaign and energizes his core supporters, but his leadership. “There’s a real sense that there’s a disconnect between the president and his staff on immigration issues, and people on all sides are seeking to exploit that disconnect,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Mr. Trump’s rivals, in his 2016 bid for the White House. “This is what happens when you have a president who is not clear and consistent on what he will accept: It emboldens all parties to take positions that they won’t compromise.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, suggested that Mr. Trump was in the thrall of extremists on his staff pulling him back from more moderate instincts on immigration. “His heart is right on this issue; I think he’s got a good understanding of what will sell, and every time we have a proposal, it is only yanked back by staff members,” Mr. Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill on Sunday. “As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we are going nowhere. He’s been an outlier for years.” Mr. Miller, 32, has been the ideological architect behind much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda and a tart-tongued and unapologetic true believer in the president’s “America First” approach to the issue. A former aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he was in the Senate, he cut his teeth on Capitol Hill as a lonely gladiator against bipartisan efforts to overhaul the immigration system and provide a pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, affecting a wide range of government programs. The White House had a tart retort for Mr. Graham, a onetime opponent of Mr. Trump who in recent months seemed to be growing close to the president. “As long as Senator Graham chooses to support legislation that sides with people in this country illegally and unlawfully instead of our own American citizens, we’re going nowhere,” said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. “He’s been an outlier for years.” The intraparty spat unfolded while Mr. Trump spent the weekend at the White House out of sight and off the airwaves, unusually disengaged, except for some phone calls, for a president who enjoys the limelight. His only comment on the situation came on Twitter on Sunday morning, when he vented his frustration as the shutdown threatened to bleed into the workweek, complicating his plans for a trip on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the run-up to his first State of the Union address on Jan. 30. “If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.’s!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, using the abbreviation for a continuing resolution, legislation to temporarily extend government funding. He was referring to filibuster rules in the Senate, which effectively require a three-fifths vote, or 60 senators, to advance major legislation, rather than a simple majority. Republicans have 51 seats. And he took a tone far different from the one he used this month in pitching a “bill of love” to address immigration, posting on Twitter that, “The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.” Underscoring that hard-line position, his campaign released a TV advertisement featuring an undocumented man who killed two police officers, and saying Democrats who refused to support a government funding measure without progress toward an immigration deal were “complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.” Those who know the president best argue that leaving the legislative haggling to his staff is merely the style of an executive used to delegating the small stuff to his underlings. “The misconception is that the president does not know what he does not know. In my experience, the reality is that the president knows what he does not know and does not think he needs to know it,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser. “He’s a C.E.O. The tiny details are for his staff.” But Mr. Trump is also a showman who is intensely focused on pleasing the audience in front of him at the moment, a habit that some confidants believe has led to misunderstandings about what the president is actually willing to accept in any deal. He often leaves people with the impression that he agrees with them, stressing whatever position is convenient at the time. Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that presses for less immigration, said Mr. Trump had maintained his tough line on the issue despite occasionally talking about a compromise. “He seems to make commitments that he is not going to keep,” Mr. Krikorian said. “His inclinations are hawkish on immigration, but he seems to like to be agreeable to people and nod his head when he’s at a meeting and people are saying things, and try to make a deal.” Mr. Krikorian said that he did not subscribe to the “Svengali theory” of the White House that cast Mr. Miller as a puppet master on immigration, but that it often fell to him and Mr. Kelly to explain the nuances of certain terms or proposals to a president unfamiliar with them. The chief of staff alluded to that dynamic in a closed-door meeting with Democratic lawmakers last week and later in an interview with Fox News, enraging Mr. Trump. Immigration advocates hold a darker view. “The president should trust his instincts and cut a deal,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies. “He is president and should not be the puppet of a few immigration restrictionist staffers, including his chief of staff. The perception is that they have total control over him, to the detriment of the nation.” Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star general who headed the United States Southern Command and was Mr. Trump’s first homeland security secretary, has emphasized immigration enforcement inside the country rather than policing the borders while Mr. Trump has indicated that is not as high a priority for him. On Sunday, Mr. Kelly fielded most of the calls from Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. The president was urged for a second day to step back from the fray, and for a second day he vented to aides that he wanted to do more to get involved. Yet when Mr. Trump has become engaged, he has sometimes created problems for himself and his party. Mr. Trump has demonstrated confusion over time about the details of immigration policy, including during a televised meeting in the Cabinet Room this month with lawmakers of both parties. When Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she wanted a “clean DACA bill,” Mr. Trump quickly agreed, only to have Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, pipe up to explain that meant accepting a stand-alone bill to legalize a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, without any security measures or other conditions the president had cited as priorities. During a closed portion of that meeting, Mr. Trump snapped at staff members for handing out a sheet of paper he had not seen before that included an elaborate plan for border security. “The president looked at it and said: ‘Who did this? This is way too much. I didn’t approve this,’” Mr. Graham said on Sunday. At that same session, he added, Mr. Trump had talked about a request of $18 billion for border security, and said he could build a wall for less. “So what does the White House staff do a couple days later? They pitch a proposal for $33 billion,” Mr. Graham said. “That’s just not credible.” OpinionCharles M. Blow",The New York Times
2018,"A President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation’s Racial Fires","White House Memo WASHINGTON — As he signed a proclamation marking the holiday next week honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., President Trump on Friday recalled the civil rights leader’s message that “no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are created equal by God.” Then came the questions from reporters. “Mr. President, are you a racist?” He did not answer and instead headed for the door. It is a question many were asking after the latest charged episode in a presidency that has played out along the nation’s racial fault lines from its beginning. Mr. Trump’s comment to lawmakers that the United States should accept more immigrants from places like Norway instead of from Haiti or “shithole countries” in Africa did not sound consistent with the notion that all people are equal no matter the place of their birth or the color of their skin. If it were a one-time comment, an inadvertent insensitivity, it would still have stirred a firestorm. But Mr. Trump has said so many things on so many occasions that have rubbed the raw edges of race in America that they have raised the larger issue. A country tainted at its founding by slavery and struggling with that legacy ever since is now led by a chief executive who, intentionally or not, has fanned, rather than doused, the fires that divide white, black and brown. The president’s approach to race has by many accounts damaged America’s standing in the world and complicated his foreign policy. At home, his words have at times emboldened what was once a political fringe and made it more acceptable to express thoughts that in recent decades had been deemed politically offensive. And he has put the Republican Party in the uncomfortable position of having to defend or denounce him as it heads into an already tough election year. “Is the president racist? I would say unequivocally yes to that,” said George Yancy, a professor at Emory University and the author of “On Race: 34 Conversations in a Time of Crisis,” published last fall. “Had he said one thing one time, we might say that was a slip of the tongue or it’s an example of unconscious racial bias or it was a mistake,” he added. “But I don’t think this is a case of unconscious racial bias. I think this is a case of unabashed white supremacist ideas.” White supremacists agreed. Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader, said on Friday that conservatives defending Mr. Trump on Fox News should stop saying it was about economics and legal systems, rather than race. “It’s obviously all about race, and to their credit, liberals point out the obvious,” he said. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, likewise welcomed Mr. Trump’s comments. “This is encouraging and refreshing, as it indicates Trump is more or less on the same page as us with regards to race and immigration,” the site said. The White House rejected assertions that Mr. Trump is racist. “This president fights tirelessly for all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender or background,” said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. “Any suggestion otherwise is simply insulting and belies all the results he’s delivered for minorities throughout this country.” Mr. Shah cited record-low unemployment among African-Americans — the culmination of a downward trend that began in 2011 under President Barack Obama — as well as policies intended to reduce crime and drugs and promote school choice in inner cities. Mr. Trump’s aides and allies expressed frustration that his comments were interpreted through a racial prism. He is an equal opportunity provocateur, they said, given to using strong and politically incorrect language to make larger points. In this case, they said, he was arguing that the United States should set priorities for who it admits based on merit and skills that would benefit the country. “Apart from the vocabulary attributed to him, President Trump is right on target in his sentiment,” Robert Jeffress, the evangelical pastor of First Baptist Church of Dallas and a presidential adviser, told CBN News. “As individual Christians, we have a biblical responsibility to place the needs of others above our own, but as commander in chief, President Trump has the constitutional responsibility to place the interests of our nation above the needs of other countries.” Mr. Trump tried to appeal to African-Americans during the 2016 presidential campaign by arguing that, since their neighborhoods were “war zones” and Democrats took them for granted, “what the hell do you have to lose” by giving him a chance. He ended up winning just 8 percent of the African-American vote, and polls show that his already meager support among blacks has fallen by half since he took office. Mr. Trump’s history of racially inflammatory episodes traces back to his first days in the public eye. As a young real estate businessman raised in Queens and working with his father, Mr. Trump and the family firm were sued by the Justice Department in 1973 for discriminating against black applicants for rental apartments. He eventually signed a consent decree requiring him to desegregate his properties, although he claimed victory because it included no financial penalty. As he became more of a public figure, Mr. Trump waded into racially charged controversies that periodically erupted in New York. After five Latino and African-American teenagers were charged with beating and raping a jogger in Central Park in 1989, he spent $85,000 to take out full-page ads in four New York newspapers calling for the death penalty. The Central Park Five, as they were called, were later exonerated and were paid a $41 million settlement, but Mr. Trump has never accepted that outcome. As late as 2016, he insisted that they were still guilty and that the settlement was “outrageous.” While Mr. Obama was in office, Mr. Trump was a leader of the so-called birther movement, promoting the conspiracy theory that Mr. Obama had been born in Kenya, a false claim he did not abandon until 2016. During the campaign, Mr. Trump also generated criticism for describing illegal immigrants from Mexico as “rapists”; proposing to ban all Muslims from entering the nation; and being slow to disavow the support of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman. Since taking office, he has asserted that there were good people on both sides of a white supremacist rally and counterprotest in Charlottesville, Va., and repeatedly lashed out at black football players he deemed insufficiently patriotic for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. In a closed-door meeting on immigration with advisers in June, described last month in The New York Times, Mr. Trump complained that Haitians “all have AIDS” and that Nigerians who visit would never want to “go back to their huts” in Africa. People close to Mr. Trump have long insisted that he is not racist and that his often crude language is applied across the board. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former “Apprentice” contestant who was one of the few African-Americans on his senior staff until her departure last month, bemoaned various racially charged moments during his administration, but insisted that “he is not a racist.” “Yes, I will acknowledge many of the exchanges, particularly in the last six months, have been racially charged,” she said in an interview with ABC News. “Do we then just stop and label him as a racist? No.” Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s campaign who now works for America First Action, a pro-Trump “super PAC,” said that as an African-American she found the president to be colorblind and empowering. The criticism of his words and actions, she said, owed more to partisanship. “If you’re on the left, then everything he says or does, you’re going to find a racist or sexist tone to it, period,” she said on Friday. “Even if you’re on the right but you’re an establishment person that is used to politically correct way of doing things, you might cringe when he says something that’s not politically correct. He says things people say at their dinner table. He’s just very bold and very honest, and a lot of people have been conditioned not to deal with people that way.” She said critics forgot that when he was in business, he supported the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Indeed, Mr. Trump donated free office space for Mr. Jackson’s civil rights group. But Mr. Jackson was among those who spoke out on Friday against Mr. Trump. “He speaks like a racist,” Mr. Jackson said. “He conjures up those fears. But to categorize him by a name does not quite address the issue.” Mr. Jackson concluded, “A misinformed man with power is a weapon of mass destruction.” Critics and scholars said Mr. Trump’s remarks reflected a longstanding stereotyping of minorities and immigrants and have given permission to others who used to hide such views. “I’m pretty sure that many of the same people he insults and degrades maintain the buildings, sew the clothes, and are at the backbone of the businesses that he and his family depend on for their wealth,” said Marcia Chatelain, an associate professor of history and African-American studies at Georgetown University. The event marking the King holiday that Mr. Trump held on Friday was planned long before the uproar over the president’s latest comments, but it put the stigma that his words have caused in stark relief. “When reporters shout out to Mr. Trump ‘are you a racist’ at an event to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, something is amiss,” said Ron Christie, who wrote a book about his time as an African-American adviser in President George W. Bush’s White House. “That the president needs to confront questions of racism or bias tells you that this isn’t fake news but a painful reality he must immediately confront.” Mr. Trump made no mention of the anger touched off by reports of his remarks when he signed the holiday proclamation. He was accompanied by Isaac Newton Farris Jr., King’s nephew, and Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development and the most prominent African-American in the Trump administration. He stared down at his prepared statement and stuck tightly to it, calling King an “American hero” who “opened the eyes and lifted the conscience of our nation.” Mr. Carson and Mr. Farris offered brief comments that likewise did not address the controversy. Mr. Carson’s office later emailed a statement from him saying that Mr. Trump “has always been respectful of my background, my ideas, and me as a person,” and that in group settings “he has always been respectful, welcoming, and inclusive.” As Mr. Farris left the White House, he paused to respond to the question that Mr. Trump did not. “I think President Trump is racially ignorant and racially uninformed,” he told CNN. “But I don’t think he is a racist in the traditional sense.” Mr. Trump’s comments, he added, were “another example of him speaking without knowing the facts.”",The New York Times
2018,A Presidential Fury Propels Wolff Book to No. 1,"Inside the List THE OUTSIDER: Presidential endorsements can help writers bigly. President Kennedy declared his love of the James Bond spy series, and brought Ian Fleming to this country’s attention. President Reagan enthused about the first novel to be published by the Naval Institute Press — an obscure submarine technothriller called “The Hunt for Red October” — and turned Tom Clancy into a star. It’s less usual for a presidential cease-and-desist letter to propel a book’s sales. But then, part of the point of Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury” (new at No. 1 in hardcover nonfiction) is that nothing about President Trump is usual. Wolff’s behind-the-scenes look at Trump’s first year in office draws heavily on interviews with aides and staffers, and the picture it paints is as grim as anything by Hieronymus Bosch. “Nothing contributed to the chaos and dysfunction of the White House as much as Trump’s own behavior,” Wolff writes in a passage claiming that the president, afraid of poisoning, won’t let housekeepers touch his toothbrush and barks at them even for tidying up: “If my shirt is on the floor, it’s because I want it on the floor.” In Wolff’s telling, his subject — used to the home comforts of Trump Tower — finds the White House “vexing and even a little scary.” Vilifying the commander in chief is itself a proud tradition on the lists (Dinesh D’Souza, take a bow), and Wolff’s scorching portrayal would probably have done well even had Trump not threatened an injunction. For his part, though, Wolff maintains that he set out with no preconceptions. “I would have been delighted to write a contrarian account here: ‘Donald Trump, this unexpected president, is actually going to succeed,’” he told “Meet the Press” this month. “That is not the story. He is not going to succeed. This is worse than everybody thought.” THE INSIDER: “The Woman in the Window,” A. J. Finn’s debut thriller about a possible murder and an unreliable witness, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 1. This book arrives with sky-high expectations courtesy of a reported seven-figure advance, rave early reviews and — maybe — the fact that Finn, in real life, is Dan Mallory, vice president and executive editor of William Morrow. (As it happens, Morrow is also publishing the novel.) “I knew that the market was ripe,” he told The Houston Chronicle recently. “But you have to have a story, and I wasn’t going to publish a novel until I felt comfortable with the narrative. … In the end, I think it was a happy confluence of my instinct as a writer and my expertise as a publisher.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Pricing Scheme to Unclog New York’s Arteries,"Editorial The congestion pricing proposals in Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s hands are a good start on two of New York’s eternal quests: finding ways to subsidize New York mass transit and ease the suffocating traffic on Manhattan’s busiest streets. Having endorsed the outlines of a report from a task force he created, the governor must now ensure that this hopeful beginning doesn’t lead to a dead end. The forces opposed to making drivers pay to enter the congealed heart of the city are powerful and will test Mr. Cuomo’s powers of persuasion. Any plan must have legislative approval. If the past is a guide, state senators and Assembly members from Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island and Westchester County can be counted on to proclaim their constituents’ divine right to drive wherever they wish for nothing. Mayor Bill de Blasio was surprisingly open to the proposals, given his past opposition, but he did not offer a full embrace. Even the governor, proudly casting himself as having “outer-borough blood in my veins,” may yet find reasons to abandon a pay-to-drive concept that is untested in this country and that fizzled when Michael Bloomberg as mayor offered a version of it. But it has worked in such cities as London, Stockholm and Singapore. As proposed for New York by Mr. Cuomo’s panel, Fix NYC, car drivers would be charged $11.52 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street during weekday business hours. That figure is equivalent to existing E-ZPass round-trip fees on tolled East River crossings. Trucks would pay $25.34. Taxis and app-based services like Uber and Lyft (potent causes of many traffic headaches) would have per-ride surcharges of $2 to $5. How much money for mass transit might this scheme yield? The task force’s estimates run as high as $1.5 billion a year — roughly 10 percent of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s operating budget. But much will depend on how the fees are structured, including in which hours and on which days they’re imposed. Questions of fairness are inevitable. For instance, toll-free East River bridges would stay as they are. This is one way perhaps to make the plan more palatable to Brooklyn and Queens politicians. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge could circumvent the congestion zone by zipping onto the F.D.R. Drive. But that’s not possible for those who use other East River bridges, which feed directly into streets within the zone. Then, too, some people will see the proposals as a burden on less affluent New Yorkers. Mr. de Blasio, who prefers a “millionaire’s tax,” has been among the objectors. But if the task force’s numbers are right, that argument is weakened. The panel says that of those who commute to jobs in Manhattan from other boroughs, a mere 4 percent do so by car — 118,000 people. Fewer than 5,000 of them are said to qualify as the working poor. (And aides to the governor suggest some sort of tax credit might be created to ease their pain, as perhaps would lowering tolls on bridges that don’t link to Manhattan, like the Throgs Neck, Whitestone and Verrazano-Narrows.) The simple fact is that mass transit needs the money and the central city needs relief from snarled traffic that, according to some estimates by business groups, costs the New York metro economy $20 billion a year. It’s long past time to discourage the many motorists who drive into Manhattan every day as a matter of choice, not necessity.",The New York Times
2018,A Problem for Republicans Fighting to Keep California House Seats: Trump,"LOS ANGELES — With California looming as a critical battleground in the Democratic campaign to capture Congress, vulnerable Republican House members here are now struggling under the weight of President Trump’s unpopularity and policies, which are widely viewed as damaging to this heavily Democratic state. Two Republican congressmen — Darrell Issa and Ed Royce — announced last week they would not run again in the face of tough re-election bids, sending waves of worry among Republicans already concerned about potential losses here. Their surprise announcements set off a scramble of interest from prospective Democratic candidacies in an increasingly rough environment for the Republican Party, which had been on the decline in this state even before Mr. Trump took power. Rocky Chávez, a Republican State Assembly member who jumped in to run for Mr. Issa’s seat, checked off the issues on which the Trump White House was out of step with many Californians, from offshore drilling to tax reform. But, he said, he was hopeful the mood would change by the time voters went to the polls. “If the economy continues to go well, this could change this whole discussion,” he said. “But it could also change on a tweet, as we all know.” Representative Duncan D. Hunter, a Republican in San Diego who is also a Democratic target, issued a statement after Mr. Issa’s announcement, declaring that he is “100 percent running.” But Mr. Hunter is under investigation by the F.B.I. on allegations of misusing campaign funds, making him particularly vulnerable, officials in both parties said, and there is speculation in political circles that he ultimately will step aside. (If Mr. Hunter did step aside, that would probably increase Republican chances of holding the seat, given his party’s registration advantage there.) The turmoil comes as California has emerged as the front line in Democratic efforts to win back the House. Seven of the 14-member Republican congressional delegation represent districts that Hillary Clinton won against Mr. Trump in 2016, including Mr. Issa and Mr. Royce. The party needs to capture 24 Republican seats to win back power. Democrats began recruiting candidates, raising money and setting up field operations here nearly six months ago. Mr. Trump’s disapproval rating among independent voters, whose support is critical for any Republican hoping to win, shot up 20 percentage points from the week after his inauguration to the end of last year, from 48 percent to 68 percent, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Independents make up 25 percent of the California electorate, a decimal point less than Republicans. The president had a 73 percent approval rating among California Republicans in a poll last month by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, which, while high, was still considerably below what Barack Obama enjoyed among Democratic voters when he was president. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have championed a tax bill widely assailed as punishing to California homeowners, dismantled policies aimed at fighting climate change and pushed tough and restrictive immigration policies. Last year, Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana by a hefty margin of 57 percent to 42 percent; days after the law took effect on Jan. 1, the Justice Department announced it would aggressively enforce federal strictures against the drug. The Interior Department moved last week to allow offshore oil drilling, a policy that has a long history of bipartisan opposition among Californians. The next day, it exempted Florida from the policy in response to pleas from Rick Scott, the Republican governor running for Senate, drawing accusations that the Trump administration was punishing this state. “Most days for California Republicans in Congress are days spent on defense,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor. “Defense spent on why Donald Trump wants to pull the country out of the Paris accords. Defense trying to explain why the president won’t give the same offshore drilling waiver to California as it did to Florida. And defense trying to explain the latest thing Donald Trump said that he’s now denying that he said.” Mr. Chávez said he would not have voted for the tax bill and opposed the tough immigration policies backed by some Republicans in Congress. “Offshore drilling — I don’t support it,” he said. “I’ve been in California my whole life. I remember the Santa Barbara spill.” For all that, Republicans have some reason to hope they can withstand any Democratic wave. The fact that Mrs. Clinton won districts represented by these seven Republicans does not mean that voters will necessarily support a Democratic candidate for Congress in November. Although Republican enrollment in this state has been on a steady decline, the party continues to have a registration edge in these districts. Historically, Democratic turnout drops in nonpresidential years — especially in California. “As a 34-year resident of Irvine in Orange County and as someone who has long been active at a variety of levels in political and policy debates, I am also reluctant to conclude that Democrats in a midterm election will be able to turnout a sufficient number of voters to overcome the current advantages Republicans still have in the districts,” said Mark P. Petracca, a professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine. Jim Brulte, the California Republican leader, said voters made their decision based on the candidates, not the party. He said he did not think Mr. Trump was an albatross on his candidates. “Look, Republicans lost every statewide race in California in 2002, 2010 and 2014, before Donald Trump even announced he was running for president,” Mr. Brulte said. “So anybody who wants to blame Donald Trump for the problems of the Republican Party, which began 20 years ago, is a revisionist historian.” It has long been a tough climb to get elected as a Republican in California. But Mr. Trump’s presidency has pushed a party already struggling closer to the brink. Republicans and Democrats said that the level of anger at Mr. Trump could very well push up Democratic turnout in these districts. “It was already difficult,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento. “But he’s made it more difficult.” Mark Baldassare, the president of the Public Policy Institute of California, said Mr. Trump’s stand on issues “has been at odds even with many Republicans” in the state, “especially on immigration.” “In our polling, we have seen majorities of Republicans saying they want a path to citizenship,” he said. “They support DACA,” the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects so-called Dreamers from deportation. The offshore drilling policy was the latest complication for Republican candidates. In a poll taken in 2017 by the Public Policy Institute, 69 percent of respondents said they opposed opening up offshore sites for drilling. Republicans were more supportive — 50 percent said they backed it — but majorities of Republicans who live near the coast opposed it. Mr. Issa’s district runs along the coast. Last week, moderate Republicans, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor, announced they were creating an organization intended to try to save the state party, in part by differentiating it on issues like immigration and climate change. “What works nationally doesn’t work in California,” said Chad Mayes, a State Assembly member and one of the founders of the group. “We are in a death spiral. We have to get out of this death spiral.” Mr. Trump is a historically weak political figure here. He drew 31.5 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton, an even poorer showing than Herbert Hoover posted when he ran against Franklin D. Roosevelt in the midst of the Depression. And he poses a challenge to Republican candidates for state and federal office who need the votes of the Republican base, who support Mr. Trump. The result: Candidates have spoken warmly about Mr. Trump at forums where they need to win Republican support. “Californians are waking up to one of the best economies we have seen in decades, since Ronald Reagan was president,” said Travis Allen, a Republican State Assembly member who is running for governor. “The Trump effect on the economy is being felt across the country — even in California. I fully expect this to continue and to be a huge benefit for every Californian.” Mr. Whalen of the Hoover Institution said that Mr. Trump “is not the person with whom you are going to identify the future of the party.” “But what do you do?” he said. “You can’t walk away from him.” Mr. Stutzman, the political consultant, said it would be difficult for the state party to recover as long as Mr. Trump is in the White House: “The degradation of the Republican brand in California cannot be reversed with Trump as president.”",The New York Times
2018,A Publisher’s Life and Library,"Open Shelves Some were alphabetical: Four Laurie Colwin novels shared a shelf with Evan S. Connell’s “Mr. Bridge” and Michael Chabon’s “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.” Other sections must have had a private logic: “The Furies,” by Fernanda Eberstadt, flanked by Bob Woodward’s “State of Denial,” and “On Truth,” by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt. The library of the legendary former Random House publisher Howard Kaminsky, who died last summer, contained books by friends and mysteries he wrote with his wife, Susan, under the pseudonym Brooks Stanwood. In a high, far corner: “The Art of the Deal,” by Donald Trump, which he came to regret publishing. We asked some of Kaminsky’s friends and colleagues to share their thoughts on his collection. “It’s a weird thing about book obsessives: We’re kind of like thieves, and certainly voyeurs. We go into people’s houses and immediately want to scope out their books, to see what sort of creatures they are. I knew Howard pretty well, but one book or another would still catch me by surprise. As in, Wow, how’d he get hold of that? Like his copy of Joy Williams’s ‘State of Grace’ — the Paris Review edition. Hell, she’s been a dear pal for 40 years, and I’m her publisher, but I don’t have that.” —GARY FISKETJON, editor of Alfred A. Knopf “We were often competitive readers. Once I confidently tried to outdo him on plot details in ‘The Brothers Karamazov’ and ‘Crime and Punishment,’ but I should have realized he owned them. He had a phenomonal memory for pretty much every volume on those beautiful mahogany shelves.” —ALEXANDRA PENNEY, author and journalist “Howard was a passionate and discerning reader. It was very gratifying to see the specialized books I wrote, starting with ‘Wallace K. Harrison, Architect,’ on his bookshelf alongside volumes by widely read authors such as Robert Caro and Ron Chernow.” —VICTORIA NEWHOUSE, architectural historian “He always brought me straight into the library when I arrived at the apartment, and he would often give me a book. I’ve recently been thinking of a Civil War novel he gave me: ‘Andersonville,’ by MacKinlay Kantor. It took him about 45 seconds to find it. He pulled it off the shelf and said, ‘I know you’re going to love this one.’” —GRIFFIN DUNNE, actor and filmmaker “Like the rest of us in book publishing, Howard could remember every book he published that made the New York Times best-seller list, and how high it got, so I’m pleased and not at all surprised that he kept a slipcased copy of my book ‘Making the List.’ Otherwise, it looked like my library — no way to tell how and why the books got there and stayed there. Why did he have two copies of ‘In Cold Blood’?” —MICHAEL KORDA, author and former editor of Simon & Schuster",The New York Times
2018,A Push to Make Washington’s Downtown More Livable,"Square Feet WASHINGTON — In a 43-square-block portion of the booming central business district, there are just 23 residential units, condos in a row of four late-19th-century townhomes on Jefferson Place, just south of Dupont Circle. It’s a minuscule number compared with the 33 million square feet of office space in the same area. With construction cranes for new office buildings dominating the skyline, owners of older buildings may face a choice: Upgrade to current standards to compete — an expensive proposition — or convert to residential use. The choice has been clear elsewhere, from downtown Manhattan to downtown Los Angeles, where a combined 18.1 million square feet of office space has been converted in the last 10 years. But in the nation’s capital, the change is just starting to emerge. In Baltimore, some 38 miles to the north, conversion of 1.9 million square feet of office space since 2013 has reduced office vacancies by 30 percent, according to an analysis by JLL, a real estate services firm. In Philadelphia, vacancies in older “Class B” office buildings, a notch below higher-quality “Class A” buildings, have dropped by 40 percent in 20 years because of conversions. To encourage conversions in the nation’s capital, where the office vacancy rate is around 11.4 percent, the district’s Council members are considering legislation to provide a tax abatement of up to $20 per square feet for 10 years, capped at $5 million a year. The DowntownDC and Golden Triangle Business Improvement Districts, two adjoining associations of property owners that represent the area, back the legislation. In a report released last month, the DowntownDC Business Improvement District said the new market-rate residences would be worth $600 a square foot, compared with empty office space valued at $450 a square foot. “Even with worst-case assumptions,” the report said, the net cost of the program would be no more than $2 million to $3 million a year in forgone tax dollars. But the office of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, who must sign the bill into law, has some reservations. “I would say, we’re listening hard,” said Brian T. Kenner, deputy mayor for planning and economic development. “We’ve got to see what the cost is and how much revenue that can create and be put to affordable housing,” a key priority of the Bowser administration. The district requires 8 to 12 percent of housing to be lower-cost units. Still to come is an essential statement of the bill’s fiscal impact from the city’s chief financial officer. An estimated 89,000 people work in the so-called Golden Triangle, an area of prime real estate that extends from the White House to Dupont Circle. The hope is that conversions will give it more of a 24-hour neighborhood feel. The only conversion underway involves the renovation of the former Planned Parenthood headquarters, on 16th Street Northwest, four blocks north of the White House. To be known as the Adele, the high-end project will have 13 condos ranging from $859,000 to $2.4 million. The situation is not yet dire: Washington’s office vacancy rate is lower than the region’s, which is 16.3 percent and expected to rise to nearly 17 percent by late 2019, according to Newmark Knight Frank, a New York-based real estate services firm. But the fear is, with more office buildings being built, the overall commercial vacancy rates in the district will also climb, leading to lower office rents. Proponents hope that the conversion bill will help both the market and the neighborhood. “We believe this bill will strengthen city’s tax base while adding residents and ensuring the longtime economic vitality of our downtown,” said Leona Agouridis, executive director of the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District. “It is a policy question: Do we want to have residents in the downtown area? If so, what are we willing to do to help realize it? This is a catalyst.” Gerry Widdicombe, a consultant to the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, said the idea behind the legislation was to “educate the market on how this can be done” without hurting the city’s tax base or the building owner’s bottom line. “It’s working in the suburbs because their office markets are really, really weak.” Jack Evans, a Democratic member of the Council and the bill’s sponsor, said the bill would enable a “Manhattanizing of the District of Columbia,” bringing more vitality to the city’s core by encouraging an influx of full-time residents who could walk to work while patronizing nearby shops and restaurants. “But for the city’s involvement, we would not get what they are looking for.” In the Golden Triangle, 77 percent of the office buildings were erected from 1960 to 1990. Ms. Agouridis suggested that owners must soon decide whether to demolish and rebuild or renovate them to the higher Class A or premium Trophy building standards. “It’s natural in the cycle of buildings,” she said. “It’s like your home, you get to certain point, you need to replace major systems. But with renovation comes opportunity. From a neighborhood perspective, it makes a lot of sense to get that conversion going.” In Washington, some owners have sought to upgrade older buildings to Class A by “re-skinning” the facades, giving them a more modern look and reducing energy costs. So far, building owners in Washington continue to favor such cosmetic face-lifts over more substantial conversions. Another factor contributing to rising office vacancy rates, according to Mr. Widdicombe, is that some companies, notably law firms, are relocating to newer buildings, where they are leasing less space per employee, a workplace trend known as densification. A new concept in Washington, conversions have been implemented elsewhere. More than 37.5 million square feet of “older office space that has reached functional obsolescence” in the nation has been converted to residential use over the last decade, according to JLL. In Washington’s Maryland and Virginia suburbs, for instance, higher office vacancy rates have resulted in more conversions of older buildings without the use of government incentives. In Old Town, a neighborhood in Alexandria, Va., the former offices of the Sheet Metal Workers International Union are now the Oronoco, a 60-unit luxury condominium on the Potomac River waterfront, with prices ranging from $1.3 million to $2.8 million. In Fairfax County, Washington’s most populous suburb, the county government recently voted to streamline rezoning for the “repurposing” of commercial buildings. In nearby Silver Spring, Md., a 1964 office building was converted into the 102-unit condo called Octave 1320, without the kind of tax abatement proposed for Washington, and other conversions are scheduled to take place. But in Washington’s core, the argument goes, the shift will occur only with government action. “Mixed-use neighborhoods create a more livable area, better use of infrastructure and expand the income tax base,” said Ms. Agouridis. “It is unlikely residential development in the central business district will occur naturally without the kind of incentive this bill will involve.” Thus, proponents say, residential housing will continue to be in great demand but short supply. The three-story Jefferson Place townhouses, built originally as single-family homes during the Gilded Age, are a notable exception. But they have a mixed zoning history. They long housed commercial tenants, but the buildings were converted in 2006 into condos, ranging from $499,000 for a one-bedroom to $2 million for three-bedroom units. According to the DC Condo Boutique website, the townhouse row “combines historic details with modern conveniences.” A one-bedroom, one-bath unit there — the only residence currently for sale and available for immediate occupancy in the entire Golden Triangle district — is on the market for $650,000. “Incredible location,” the listing says.",The New York Times

2018,A Rap Video for a Biology Class Was His Demo Reel,"Up Next Name Julien Turner Age 20 Hometown Pickerington, Ohio Now Lives In a dormitory suite at Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he is a second-year student. Claim to Fame In addition to being a straight-A student and a linebacker for his college football team, Mr. Turner is a budding filmmaker with a knack for making homespun content that ricochets across the web. Photos of his high school prom proposal (a goofy re-creation of a Jell-O mold gag from “The Office”) melted over 13,000 hearts on Twitter. He also runs Dreadhead Films, a indie movie studio he started with his 15-year-old brother, Justen, that has landed choice slots at the 2015 White House Student Film Festival and the Pan African Film and Art Festival. “Everywhere we go, we are always the youngest filmmakers there,” Mr. Turner said. Big Break In November, Mr. Turner uploaded a homemade rap video on cell division as extra credit for a biology class. Set to the Lil Uzi Vert song “XO Tour Llif3,” the low-fi video takes place on campus and features lyrics like “if my genes go left unread/ all my cells are dead.” Once the activist Shaun King retweeted the video, a media firestorm took off, including an article in The New York Post, an appearance on “Good Morning America” and nearly 370,000 likes on Twitter. Mr. Turner also passed the course. “My professor said she loved it,” he said. Latest Project The Turner brothers recently became two of the youngest directors to produce a segment for “Sesame Street.” They’re currently putting together a live-action short that will spotlight the number 6. Shot last month in Columbus, the clip features local children. Mr. Turner hopes to find roles for Bert and Ernie down the line. “We’re not at that level yet,” he said. “Hopefully, we get to work with them next.” Next Thing The brothers are developing a television pitch about a black female superhero. “The gist is that some of the extreme environments that we’ve dealt with in our communities are actually giving people abilities,” he said. Family Affair Mr. Turner’s father, Kevin, is a jazz professor at Ohio State University and his mother, Cynthia, is an accounting professor there who moonlights as a manager for her two sons. He and his younger brother used to ask for video equipment for Christmas and taught themselves techniques from watching YouTube. “We’re trying to soak in these experiences as young people and brothers, and use our youth and our blood connection to our advantage,” he said.",The New York Times

THE LAST MAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING The Life and Times of Enrico Fermi, Father of the Nuclear Age By David N. Schwartz Illustrated. 451 pp. Basic Books. $35. Albert Einstein once remarked that he had sold himself body and soul to science, “being in flight from the I and the we to the it.” Einstein’s transformation followed from and repudiated an early-adolescent phase of intense religiosity. Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist whose long list of achievements includes co-inventing the nuclear reactor, escaped into science as well, but in his case the impetus was traumatic: the sudden death of his beloved older brother, Giulio, during throat surgery when Fermi was 13. That loss precipitated an intense lifelong privacy and a personal and scientific strategy of quantifying the world. Fermi wielded a six-inch slide rule as we today wield our iPhones, to plumb the essence of events. He ranks high in the second tier of 20th-century physicists, behind figures like Einstein and the Danish theoretician Niels Bohr. There have been other accounts of his life, yet David N. Schwartz’s new portrait, “The Last Man Who Knew Everything,” is the first thorough biography to be published since Fermi’s death 64 years ago in 1954. Schwartz, the author of “NATO’s Nuclear Dilemmas,” cautions that the record of Fermi’s life is thin: no personal journals, few letters, little more than the testimony of colleagues, family and friends. The biographer was forced to devote most of his effort to Fermi’s work life. With a subject like Fermi, that restriction is a limit but hardly a loss. When Fermi died of stomach cancer at 53, Hans Bethe, the theorist who taught us how the sun shines, wrote his colleague’s widow, Laura, “There is no one like Enrico, and there will not be another for a hundred years.” Schwartz calls Fermi “the greatest Italian scientist since Galileo.” Add to these tributes that Fermi was a natural leader — charming, gregarious, bursting with energy, easy in command — and one is left wondering why a full biography has been so long delayed. The American part of Fermi’s life began in 1938. When the Swedish Academy decided to award him that year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for his work with radioactive elements and nuclear reactions, it took the unusual step of having Bohr ask Fermi privately if he could accept it. Adolf Hitler had banned the Nobels in Germany after a German peace activist was awarded the 1935 Peace Prize. In 1938, the academy feared Italy’s Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, might follow suit. Fermi knew Mussolini was hungry for national honors and told Bohr so. The advance notice gave the Fermis time to prepare their escape, urgent because Laura was Jewish and Mussolini was promulgating increasingly harsh anti-Semitic laws. The Nobel, worth more than $500,000 today, set up the family in its new country, where a professorship at Columbia University awaited the new laureate. Fatefully, the Fermis sailed from Italy the same week that two Berlin radiochemists discovered nuclear fission. That discovery was totally unexpected. In spring 1939, working at Columbia with the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, Fermi set out to answer a crucial question about it. Uranium atoms release a burst of energy when they fission, enough per atom to make a grain of sand visibly jump. But what then? Was there a way to combine those individual fissions, to turn a small burst into a mighty roar? Szilard, ever-resourceful, acquired hundreds of pounds of black, greasy uranium-oxide powder from a Canadian mining corporation. Fermi and his students packed the powder into pipe-like tin cans and arranged them equally spaced in a circle within a large tank of water mixed with powdered manganese. At the center of the arrangement they placed a neutron source. Neutrons from the source, slowed down by the water, would penetrate the uranium atoms in the cans and induce fissions. If the fissioning atoms released more neutrons, those “secondary” neutrons would irradiate the manganese. Measuring the radioactivity induced in the manganese would tell Fermi if the fissions were multiplying. If so, then a chain reaction might be possible, one bombarding neutron splitting a uranium atom and releasing two neutrons, those two splitting two other uranium atoms and releasing four, the four releasing eight, and so on in a geometric progression that could potentially produce vast amounts of energy for power — or for an atomic bomb. The experiment worked. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized a program to build atomic bombs, hoping to defeat a Germany that was potentially a year or more ahead in the deadly race. Fermi, working now at the University of Chicago, undertook the building of a full-scale reactor to demonstrate that a chain reaction could be achieved and controlled. By then it was known as well that a nuclear reactor would breed a newly discovered element, plutonium, an alternative nuclear explosive. Fermi’s reactor would also demonstrate the breeding of plutonium. Instead of water, which absorbed too many neutrons, the demonstration reactor would use graphite, the form of carbon found in pencil lead, to slow the neutrons. Graphite blocks the size of planter boxes, drilled with blind holes to house slugs of uranium metal, would be stacked layer by layer to form a spherical matrix. Fermi, who loved American idioms, called his creation a “pile.” Across the month of November 1942, Fermi supervised the building of Chicago Pile No. 1 on a doubles squash court under the west stands of the university football stadium. It was ready on the frigid morning of Dec. 2, 1942. Through the morning and early afternoon, wielding his slide rule, Fermi slowly took the pile critical, with a characteristically Fermian break for lunch. It worked, which meant a bomb would almost certainly work as well. Historically, no other development in Fermi’s life ranks as high as the nuclear reactor, mighty versions of which produce more than 11 percent of the world’s electricity today. Fermi continued to contribute original scientific work throughout the war and postwar at the University of Chicago. He advised the United States government on atomic energy and worked on weapons problems during summer stints at Los Alamos. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb more vehemently than J. Robert Oppenheimer but escaped the ruination visited upon Oppenheimer by the vindictive chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis L. Strauss. He went on to help build the first hydrogen bomb. I kept wishing this biography were livelier, lit with more surprises, but Schwartz, working with limited sources, tells the story well. A few infelicities are distracting. “Disinterested” doesn’t mean “uninterested.” “Fulsome” still means “offensively flattering,” not “generous,” though the meaning is changing. Brig. Gen. Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, not Oppenheimer, held “authority over the entire Manhattan Project.” Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, one part of the project, where the first bombs were designed and built. Still, these are minor mistakes. All in all, Schwartz’s biography adds importantly to the literature of the utterly remarkable men and women who opened up nuclear physics to the world. An earlier version of this review misstated the year for which a German peace activist, Carl von Ossietzky, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It was 1935, not 1936.",The New York Times
2018,A Restaurant Where the Bathroom Soap Complements the Meal,"“I like to get a bit of a surprise when I go to the bathroom at a restaurant,” the Danish chef Adam Aamann explains when asked why he has taken a hands-on approach — quite literally — to the restrooms in his new restaurant. Diners freshening up at Aamanns 1921 — which opened in Copenhagen in August and offers a modern take on classic Danish cuisine — are given a choice of two liquid soaps. One smells of lemon, cedar, bergamot and thyme; the other carries notes of lemon, bergamot, orange and rosemary. Both were handmade by Aamann himself. “I like to throw myself at things I haven’t tried before,” he says, standing in the kitchen of his three-story house in Osterbro, one of Copenhagen’s smartest neighborhoods. “I also thought it would be an extraordinary way of tickling people.” In particular, Aamann wanted to “create the full experience” at Aamanns 1921: for diners to return to the table with — one hopes — clean hands that smell like the herbs used in the kitchen. In other words, the soap should provide a “reference” to the food. At Aamanns 1921 that means smorrebrod — Denmark’s traditional open-faced sandwich, adorned with fixings that include marinated herring, matured cheese, kohlrabi and pickled onions. Aromatic herbs adorn most dishes. It won’t surprise seasoned observers of the Danish culinary scene that Aamann is making his own soap. The 43-year-old is credited with restoring the reputation of smorrebrod. The dish had fallen out of fashion when, in 2006, Aamann opened a deli in Copenhagen and began making it with fresh, seasonal ingredients produced from scratch, such as fermented herring, pickled vegetables and sourdough bread. (For Aamanns 1921, he even bought a stone mill so that he could produce his own flour.) At the time, Aamann’s decision to focus on smorrebrod was unusual: Few chefs took the lunchtime staple seriously, while contemporaries such as René Redzepi, the head chef at Noma, were focused on the big picture — promoting sustainability, seasonality and Nordic culinary traditions such as fermenting and curing to bring about a food revolution and change the way Danes ate. But Aamann’s gambit paid off, and today he’s one of Denmark’s best known chefs: He is the author of four cookbooks, presents a food program on DR, Denmark’s public service broadcaster, and in 2007 received a prestigious award from the Danish Gastronomic Academy. Last year’s launch of Aamanns 1921 — his fourth restaurant — merely confirmed his reputation as Copenhagen’s smorrebrod king. Still, most restaurateurs might have found someone else to produce — if not procure — the soap used in their restaurant’s bathrooms. Both of those options were “on the table, too, of course,” Aamann says. But, of soapmaking, he says, “But then I Googled it and saw it wasn’t that complicated.” To prove his point, Aamann sets up a production line on his kitchen countertop, where last August he produced about 20 liters of soap for the new restaurant. His method involves combining precise amounts of organic ingredients — including distilled water, foaming agents and aromatic essential oils — which he buys online. He begins by combining oils in a jar, counting each drop sotto voce, and jotting down the total — a procedure that makes him resemble an apothecary. Aamann tests numerous combinations, constantly making adjustments. (“Let’s try 10 drops of thyme, seven of lemon.”) Sometimes he crinkles his nose. (“Too much mint, it’s a bit toothpaste-y.”) Other times he beams as if he’s solved a puzzle. Once satisfied with the ratio, he scales up the quantities and mixes everything in a large aluminum bowl. Indeed, with its spoons and spatulas, the process resembles baking — though Aamann likens it to making snaps, the distilled spirit that’s flavored with botanicals and typically paired with smorrebrod. “You could make a nice snaps using quince, but you might need something else to give it edge, like oak,” he says. “It’s the same with soap. If you use cedar oil, which is warm and spicy, it would go with herbs such as rosemary and thyme, or citric oils like bergamot.” (Other advice for would-be soapmakers? “Follow your nose.”) So far, diners are delighted with Aamann’s soap. “It’s had a huge impact on guests, with many wanting to know where to buy it,” he says. His peers, however, are “annoyed they didn’t come up with the idea themselves,” he jokes. Aamann has no plans to sell his soap, however. Instead, he wants to ramp up production and make enough for all of his restaurants. And with supplies of the first batch running low, Aamann is working on new “recipes,” using ginger, mint and cinnamon. But he won’t be drawn out on the details. After all, it’s meant to be a surprise.",The New York Times

2018,A Rival Steps Up to Challenge Turkey’s President Erdogan,"The Saturday Profile ANKARA, Turkey — Out of the repressive climate of the last 18 months since a bloody coup attempt in Turkey, the most fearless challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — and potentially his most serious rival in future elections — has been Meral Aksener. A former interior minister and seasoned right-wing politician, Ms. Aksener, 61, is credited with gathering much of the national support for the “No” campaign in an April referendum that nearly defeated Mr. Erdogan’s attempt to vastly expand his powers. Now she plans to build on that support to challenge him for the presidency. She predicts that Mr. Erdogan will call early presidential elections for July 15. Expelled from the Nationalist Movement Party in September 2016 after challenging its leader over a growing alliance with Mr. Erdogan, she founded the Iyi Party, or Good Party, a year later in October. She is already campaigning around the country. “I call it the movement of the brave,” she said in an interview in November in new party offices in Ankara, the capital. Under the state of emergency imposed by Mr. Erdogan since the attempted coup, public gatherings are prohibited and freedom of expression and the media are tightly constrained. Most of those joining Ms. Aksener’s movement are young people chafing under the restrictions, she said. Ms. Aksener and Mr. Erdogan both represent the center right of the political spectrum, but she opposes him on almost every aspect of his politics, from his increasingly autocratic form of government to his anti-Western diatribes that have damaged relations and scared off foreign investment. Mr. Erdogan remains Turkey’s most popular politician by far, but last year’s referendum showed that the country is deeply divided. Ms. Aksener says she is uniquely placed to draw support from right-wing nationalists and more liberal centrists who are disenchanted with Mr. Erdogan. “We saw in the referendum the country is split in half,” she said. “The Good Party is the only party that can get votes from both camps.” Still, her path ahead will be anything but easy. Although Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party has slipped slightly in the polls, there is little sign that Ms. Aksener is the cause, said Kemal Can, a prominent political writer. “Most of the polls show that she cannot draw the vote away from A.K.P.,” he said, using the party’s Turkish initials. “She may sway 1 or 2 percent from A.K.P., but these are already estranged voters who most probably already voted No in the referendum.” Since she occupies some of the same political space as the president, Ms. Aksener is in many ways campaigning as the anti-Erdogan. She says she wants to re-establish freedom of expression, reverse draconian measures that have imprisoned journalists and closed down newspapers and media outlets, and restore a nonpartisan justice system and constitutional court. She also says she wants to reverse Mr. Erdogan’s April referendum, which will introduce an executive-style presidency after the next elections, regardless of who wins. “We are going to return to a parliamentary system,” she said. “The second thing is to restore trust in the economy.” The daughter of a civil servant, Ms. Aksener grew up in a small rural village in western Turkey. Her family was among the hundreds of thousands resettled from Greece in the population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1923. “Despite limited education, I managed to go to university and became a lecturer,” she said. She gained her doctorate in history in Istanbul and taught at several universities. Yet Ms. Aksener said the possibility of moving up a class through education had become elusive in Turkey, where employment has become partisan, depending on whether a person is connected to the governing party. “The opportunity I got 45 years ago, you cannot receive today,” she said. Education and the economy are the two things people are most concerned about on the campaign trail, she said. Thousands of families were affected when Mr. Erdogan scrapped the national high-school entrance exam in September, ordering students instead to attend their closest neighborhood school, many of which have been transformed into religious academies. “Pupils were preparing for the exam for four years,” Ms. Aksener said, “and you change it overnight?” “Mobility between the social classes will be diminished,” she added. “Children will not be able to dream about their future, and this is the saddest thing.” Although Mr. Erdogan has overseen a period of impressive economic growth, allowing many in Turkey to climb out of poverty and join the middle classes, Ms. Aksener noted that the growth has been built on a construction boom rather than industrialization. Pointing to high youth unemployment, she said research conducted by her party had found that 18- to 25-year-olds from middle-income families felt trapped in a triangle of unhappiness, despair and fatalism. “The Good Party will give hope to these people,” she said. She entered politics in 1994, joining the True Path Party of Suleyman Demirel and serving as interior minister for nine months until a military coup replaced the government in 1997. She joined the Nationalist Movement Party in 2007 and became deputy speaker of Parliament for eight years. Although the Nationalist Movement Party has a history of extreme right-wing elements, Ms. Aksener has avoided nationalist rhetoric and describes herself as center-right. Her party manifesto is carefully worded, supporting a strong defense against terrorism, immigration and outside cultural influences. Senior members of her new party have been more outspoken, though. Umit Ozdag, the vice chairman of the Good Party, caused an outcry in November with derogatory comments about Syrian refugees. Ms. Aksener remains focused on attacking Mr. Erdogan’s policies. She broke with the Nationalist Movement Party leader, Devlet Bahceli, over his support for Mr. Erdogan’s new presidential system, which she criticizes for lacking checks and balances. She is also campaigning for women’s rights, hoping to win over female voters. “In the cities, women are harassed based on their gender,” she said. “In the villages they are beaten up or even killed.” She describes her 24 years in politics as a “very rough political life.” During the 2015 parliamentary election campaign, supporters of Mr. Erdogan alleged on television that a video showed her cheating on her husband, a mechanical engineer. In the furor that followed, both Mr. Erdogan and his wife called her in sympathy, as did Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and his wife — although Ms. Aksener said that amid that sympathy they also encouraged her to drop out. “I noticed there was an expectation that I should end this fight,” she said. “I went in the opposite direction. I continued the fight and I sued those people.” Her accusers backed off somewhat, but were later acquitted. The battle taught her a lesson, she says. “I saw them up close,” she said. “I am not afraid of Erdogan, not as much as a grain of dust.”",The New York Times
2018,A Romney Who Is Unfailingly Loyal to Trump,"NORTHVILLE, Mich. — She is the very profile of the voter President Trump tends to repel: a soft-spoken, college-educated mother of two who lives in an upscale suburb in one of the most contested battleground states. This was not lost on Mr. Trump when he picked Ronna McDaniel to be the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. Neither was the fact that her father is Mitt Romney’s oldest brother, and that bringing her into the fold would put an exclamation point on his sublimation of the establishment wing of the party. Ms. McDaniel, who is 44 and only the second woman to lead the national committee, now faces a challenge that is as personal as it is political. She has to fortify her party in a hostile election environment as it tries to keep control of the House, the Senate and 13 governorships where incumbent Republicans are leaving. That job has been complicated by a wave of retirements by disaffected Republicans, putting more seats at risk in districts like her own in Michigan. Then there is the fault line running right through her family. Her uncle, who has been one of Mr. Trump’s most unflinching critics, is likely to run for the Senate in Utah. His re-emergence on the national stage threatens to set off new quarrels in the party over questions of loyalty to the president. Ms. McDaniel has tried to leave little doubt about where her loyalty lies. She even stopped using her full name — Ronna Romney McDaniel — professionally after the president joked with her and her husband about dropping her given surname. “You know the job you’re signing up for,” she said in an interview one recent morning at a diner near her home, referring obliquely to the fact that committee leaders typically have to toe the president’s line when their party holds the White House. And she has indeed been highly deferential. She fell in line after Mr. Trump insisted last month that the Republican National Committee put resources back into the Senate race in Alabama to aid Roy S. Moore, who had been accused of preying on girls as young as 14. Alabama rejected Mr. Moore and elected a Democrat to the Senate for the first time in a generation. But even now, Ms. McDaniel will not say whether she believes the committee’s move was a mistake. “I understand why the president did what he did,” she said. “He wants to keep that majority.” She stressed that disputes in the party were an unwanted distraction. “If you’re spending more time attacking your fellow Republicans, you’re not helping us win in November,” she said. “I would prefer,” she added, “that we don’t always air those differences. I used to say if you have a fight within your family, you don’t go on ‘Jerry Springer.’” So far, Ms. McDaniel has managed to hold together the factions of the party that are split over their feelings about Mr. Trump but united, for now, in pursuit of conservative policy goals. A relentless fund-raiser who spends up to six hours a day on the phone wringing money from donors, she has helped put the party in a formidable financial position. The Republican National Committee has nearly $40 million in the bank, compared with the Democratic National Committee’s $6.3 million. “It’s not been easy for her for a lot of reasons,” said Ron Kaufman, who represents Massachusetts on the Republican National Committee. “The good news is Ronna understands totally the downside of where we are, as well as the upside. And she understands that our job is to make whatever potential wave there is a ripple.” That “she’s raised a ton of dough” only helps her position in the party and with the president, he added. She has a close relationship with the president that is perhaps unlikely for a Mormon from suburban Detroit. She has delivered something Mr. Trump intuitively understands: quantifiable results. Not only has she raked in money, but his narrow victory in her home state also helped put him over the top in the Electoral College. “She won,” he has told people. He has also been known to refer to her as “my Romney.” “The president has a pretty sterile view of results,” said Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff and party chairman who pushed Mr. Trump to pick Ms. McDaniel as his successor. “And if the results are the money is being raised and the apparatus is running well, the president is going to be pretty happy.” Politics being in her blood, Ms. McDaniel worked her way up through various positions in the Michigan Republican Party before being elected as the state chairwoman in 2015. Ms. McDaniel remained neutral throughout the 2016 primary races even as her uncle spoke out against Mr. Trump, denouncing him as “a phony, a fraud.” And when it became apparent that Mr. Trump would probably be the nominee, she enthusiastically embraced his campaign. As for her own surname, she insisted that the president had never asked her to drop it outright. He raised the issue, she said, only lightheartedly, in front of her husband. And she said she liked the brevity of her name without it. “My husband and the president joked about it,” she said. “My husband likes it, too.” Republicans said that she appeared to have accepted the reality that party committee leaders in her position are generally not afforded much leeway, and that under Mr. Trump that seemed especially true. “You’re not the party’s chairman, you’re the president’s chairman,” said Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. “As a Romney, she accepted the role of being a Trump person. And if she is going to do a good job, then she’s going to have to be a Trump person.” Mr. Trump has often given Ms. McDaniel credit for telling him he could win Michigan — a prediction that few Republicans or Democrats were willing to make. “I told Ronna for two years this state was competitive, and she listened to me much more than Democrats did,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is old friends with Ms. McDaniel’s family. “I was in union halls talking to people who were scared about trade, who were scared about their pensions. And she was hearing it, too,” Ms. Dingell added. “I get it,” Ms. McDaniel said. “I was at the ground level when the movement came through my state.” As she looks to her backyard now, a movement of a very different kind seems to be building. But this time, it is her job to stop it. Ms. McDaniel’s own congressman, Representative Dave Trott, has announced that he is joining the wave of Republicans who will retire. Analysts have since moved the district from likely Republican to tossup.",The New York Times
2018,A Rush to Find Survivors Amid the Mud of Southern California Enclave,"SAN FRANCISCO — Rescue workers scoured mud-swollen riverbeds in the wealthy Southern California enclave of Montecito on Wednesday, clutching to the hope that they might find some of the more than a dozen people missing after mudslides swept away about 100 houses. At least 17 people were killed in mud flows so powerful that some one-story ranch homes in the area, which is northwest of Los Angeles, were covered up to their gutters. The devastation, sudden and violent, struck early Tuesday after a winter storm drenched and destabilized hillsides stripped bare last month by the largest wildfire in California history. “Hundreds of people have been rescued and evacuated, many of them having to be hoisted out of the area by our aircraft,” Bill Brown, the Santa Barbara County sheriff, said Wednesday afternoon. After surveying the affected area by aircraft, the sheriff said it was “very stunning to see the extent of the devastation, to see the breadth of the area that has impacted so terribly by this.” The authorities said 28 people were injured, four of them critically. At least 300 houses were damaged in the Montecito area and many more were listed by the authorities as “threatened.” “We are still in the hopeful, optimistic mode that we can find survivors,” said Mike Eliason, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, which has rescued six people since the hillsides gave way. Canine units worked their way along the Montecito and San Ysidro Creeks, where a large number of houses were swept away. The area near the creeks was the most treacherous, Mr. Eliason said, as creeks swelled with the sudden torrents of water mixed with ash from the fires, rocks and dirt. “Some single-story homes were obliterated, just wiped off the foundation,” he said. “Others had holes blown through from boulders.” The mud also hid some dangers from rescue workers. “We’ve gotten multiple reports of rescuers falling through manholes that were covered with mud, swimming pools that were covered up with mud,” Anthony Buzzerio, a Los Angeles County fire battalion chief, told The Associated Press. “The mud is acting like a candy shell on ice cream. It’s crusty on top but soft underneath, so we’re having to be very careful.” Five highways remained closed on Wednesday, including rural, two-lane roads, said Tim Weisberg, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation. The main north-south roadway, the 101 Freeway, will be closed until at least Monday. “There are some portions that look like a riverbed,” Mr. Weisberg said of the 101. “It’s a mixture of dirt, debris, boulders, rocks. In some areas it can be six inches or a foot deep.” Ron Werft, president of Cottage Health, a hospital in Santa Barbara that has treated those injured in the mudslides, said the hospital had to shuttle personnel by boat and by air as a result of the closing of the 101, a crucial north-south artery. Under blue skies Wednesday, rescue workers made progress, clearing roads that had trapped residents in the area around Romero Canyon, northeast of Montecito. But the longer-term consequences were also becoming evident, including damage to water mains and smaller pipes that provide the area with water. “We have no water currently in storage,” said Nick Turner, general manager of the Montecito Water District. The water district instructed those residents still receiving tap water to boil it before using it for cooking or drinking. Using bulldozers and other heavy equipment, workers cleared trees, boulders, downed power lines, household items and building material that had been swept onto the roads. “A little bit of everything you could imagine, including a kitchen sink,” Mr. Eliason said. “Literally a kitchen sink was found.” Among the dead was Roy Rohter, 84, said Michael Van Hecke, a friend and the headmaster of St. Augustine Academy, a classical Catholic school Mr. Rohter founded in nearby Ventura. Mr. Van Hecke said he learned of his friend’s death from Mr. Rohter’s daughter. “He was a real scrapper, an entrepreneur,” Mr. Van Hecke said. “He bootstrapped himself all the way up to a very successful life.” The mudslide also injured Mr. Rohter’s wife, Theresa, at their home in Montecito. Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for the joint recovery effort, which involves 14 helicopters and nearly 500 personnel — including firefighters and emergency workers from several counties — said the affected area was nearly 20,000 acres. Among those who were reported missing on Tuesday were the father of a boy who was swept hundreds of yards downstream, and the father of a sailor stationed in Hawaii. Montecito is home to mansions owned by celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, but most of the damage occurred to more modest homes in the flatlands. The wreckage of the downpour, coming so soon after the wildfires, was not a coincidence but a direct result of the charred lands, left vulnerable to quickly forming mudslides. The wildfires, known as the Thomas Fire, burned over 280,000 acres last month spanning Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, and became California’s largest on record. The area has not received significant rain since last spring. “I think most people are really shocked at the extent of the damage and how big the impact was to the area,” Sheriff Brown said in a television interview. “Although we knew that this was coming you couldn’t help but be amazed at the intensity of the storm.”",The New York Times
2018,A Safer Home for Dangerous Plays,"On a recent afternoon at Soho Rep, a welder sent sparks arcing past a dressing room strewn with metal bars and twin vises holding lengths of steam pipe. Lumber and sprinkler system components packed the upstairs hallway; in the theater itself, a lighting team wearing cloth masks crowded around a table. It was good to be home. In September of 2016, Soho Rep, a downtown company with audacious taste in plays, announced that it would immediately vacate its 73-seat theater at 46 Walker Street, which it had rented for 25 years. A round of lease negotiations had revealed building regulations at variance with the company’s use of the space, resulting in what Sarah Benson, Soho Rep’s artistic director since 2007, described as a moral obligation to leave. Maybe a legal obligation, too. As Cynthia Flowers, Soho Rep’s executive director explained, “If something, God forbid, were to happen, there could potentially be huge ramifications.” But after nearly a year and a half in exile, Soho Rep has returned to Walker Street, and is kicking off its 43rd season with a typically startling play, Aleshea Harris’s “Is God Is,” which begins previews Feb. 6. “It was inconceivable that we would ever find our way back into the space,” Ms. Benson said. But here they are. Ms. Benson and Ms. Flowers were sitting in a bakery around the corner from the theater, drinking tea and nibbling vegan treats. (Power tools and particulate matter made an on-site conversation tough.) The weather was wintry and the pressure to complete renovations in time for the final rehearsals for “Is God Is,” must have been intense. But having survived a season away, the company leaders were very nearly giddy. “It’s a whopping relief,” Ms. Benson said. The Soho Repertory Theater was founded in 1975 by Jerry Engelbach and Marlene Swartz. Its first home: a warehouse space on Mercer Street. (That explains the Soho Rep name, at odds with the TriBeCa locale.) Established as a repertory company devoted to neglected classics, it evolved into a forum for new plays, with programming that became increasingly nervy. It has launched writers including Mac Wellman, Len Jenkin, Melissa James Gibson, Richard Maxwell, Young Jean Lee, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and Lucas Hnath, while also providing a home for innovative designers and directors. By many measures, the space at 46 Walker Street has never been ideal. It’s small. There’s no proper lobby. The shabby bathrooms are down a steep flight of stairs. Apartments above mean that musicals have to be produced elsewhere. As for fly space and wing space — you’re kidding, right? But to do theater Off and Off Off Broadway is to compromise with the columns, the must and the size. For all its faults, 46 Walker Street is a venue in a hip, easily accessible neighborhood with under-market rent. “That it’s been an affordable space that we’ve had access to for the last 25 years is a huge factor in Soho Rep’s existence,” said Ms. Flowers. The scruffiness and the strange proportions have encouraged gutsy schemes by directors and designers. Compactness is a kind of virtue, too. The small space prompts intimacy and with limited seats available, there’s no pressure to program box office hits — even the runaway successes don’t break even — so chances can be taken. “The projects that no one else wants to touch with a barge pole are often the ones we’re most excited about,” Ms. Benson said. Over the years designers have cut a hole in the floor (“Blasted”), covered the place in carpet (Annie Baker’s “Uncle Vanya”), sent cotton balls winging through the air (“An Octoroon”) and packed the floor with 20,000 pounds of dirt (“Generations”). In the fall of 2016, gathering what she thought was routine paperwork for a lease renewal, Ms. Flowers went to the Department of Buildings website and learned that the theater had only ever been approved for a maximum occupancy of 70 people — a number that includes cast, crew and box office, as well as audience. Worse still, no scenery was permitted. Panic hit. “It was just horrible,” Ms. Benson said. “It was extreme,” Ms. Flowers said. They talked to lawyers and real estate consultants who advised them that the Department of Buildings would be unlikely to investigate, but Ms. Benson and Ms. Flowers didn’t feel that they could risk the potential liability. A rental production, “My Name is Gideon,” was already in tech. They met with its producers that night and told them they would need to leave. Their own fall production, a musical called “Duat,” already had a berth at the Connelly Theater. They scrambled for a venue that could house the spring show, Richard Maxwell’s “Samara,” which they eventually placed at the A.R.T./New York Theaters. But a nomadic life was unsustainable. The company, which has an annual operating budget of $1.6 million, can’t realistically continue without cheap rent. “We’re doing work that nobody else would produce, by writers people don’t know yet, trying to charge reasonable prices,” Ms. Flowers said. “The economics of that do not make sense.” Luckily, Ms. Flowers and Ms. Benson weren’t alone in their distress. Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, read about their departure in The New York Times. A longtime champion of the theater, she called Rick Chandler, the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, so that he could walk through the space and suggest solutions. After working with what Ms. Menin described as “an alphabet soup of different agencies,” she was able to coordinate an agreement that amended the certificate of occupancy in return for increased safety measures — fireproof walls dividing the theater and box office, a new sprinkler system, improved ventilation and an enclosed staircase at the back. Soho Rep’s board unanimously approved the plan and contributed $180,000. The rest of the money for the $300,000 renovation came from longtime donors, the company’s annual gala and a matching grant from the Tow Foundation. The renovations haven’t made the place luxurious. “It is very basic, functional, fast and dirty,” Ms. Benson said of the repair. Even with the emendations, fewer seats will be available for each production. But it enables the company to keep going — at least until 2022 when the current lease expires — in a space that invites experiment. “It’s a space with character. It’s a space you can have a conversation with,” Ms. Benson said. “It’s unusual to have a space you can be so impolite with.” The design for “Is God Is,” takes gentler liberties, but it continues the company’s commitment to handing over ample resources to early-career artists. Under Ms. Benson’s leadership, the company not only favors works that toy with language and form — an approach pioneered by Ms. Swartz and the other previous artistic directors, Julian Webber and Daniel Aukin — but it also takes on plays with difficult, risky ideas. As Taibi Magar, the director of “Is God Is,” said, “They are a company that can take on complicated, dangerous plays that are somewhat impossible to theatricalize.” She was speaking after a rehearsal of the play, which won the Relentless Award for adventurous playwriting in 2016. A tale of two African-American sisters saddled with bloody revenge, it is a startling, sprawling work that borrows from Afropunk, epic poetry and classic Westerns and includes some disturbing scenes of violence. (The scene they were rehearsing that day, in which the sisters are mistaken for strippers and dance to 2 Chainz’s “Birthday Song,” that was pretty disturbing, too.) Ms. Harris, the playwright, seemed floored that the theater had chosen her work to reopen the space. “It’s extraordinary,” she said. “I’m terribly, terribly honored.” Back at the cafe, Ms. Benson insisted that the honor was all hers. “It’s epic, it’s huge,” she said of the play. “It’s sensational.” And she has just the place to put it.",The New York Times
2018,A Satisfying Soup From the Italian Pantry,"City Kitchen Some soups are delicate, light and refreshing, served as the prelude to a meal. Others, like this one, are hearty and nourishing meals in themselves. It is not precisely a soup, but a soupy concoction of potatoes and pasta, known throughout Italy as pasta e patate. This is an example of the country’s bare-cupboard cuisine, la cucina povera, in which inexpensive basics are transformed with small jolts of flavor from aged cheese, dried chiles, herb pastes and the like. Thrifty but flavorful, its principal aim is to feed a family during times when funds are tight. (If no potatoes were in the pantry, you could make a similar soup with beans or lentils.) Humble, but not spartan, many dishes from this tradition are also exceedingly delicious. Here, you soften an onion in a hot pan with a generous glug of olive oil, then add chopped potatoes, salt, a garlic clove, a rosemary sprig and water. When the potatoes are done, a handful of pasta goes in, and when the pasta is al dente, you ladle this steaming, chunky marvel of a soup into bowls. Pass the grated pecorino and Parmigiano, a cruet of oil, the pepper mill and crushed red pepper. That’s the bare-bones version. There are any number of regional variations, of course, and every cook is at liberty to customize according to whim. Some might add, for example, more vegetables, like celery and carrot; some tomato, a little or a lot; bacon or pancetta or ham; beef or chicken broth; or, as in my recipe, a large quantity of chopped kale. Though the soup could be made from start to finish and served right away, you can make it several hours, or even a day, in advance. This allows for the flavors to meld and for the potatoes to break down a bit. But since you don’t want the pasta to be overcooked, cook it separately, and stir it in as a final step. Small, textured pasta shapes, like pennette, orecchiette or rigatoncini are the best choice. For potatoes, I like yellow-fleshed ones like Yukon or German Butterball, but russets will suffice. As for the double-carbohydrate, starch-on-starch nature of this soup, I regard it as a satisfying win-win.

2018,A Saucy App Knows China’s Taste in News. The Censors Are Worried.,"HONG KONG — One of the world’s most valuable start-ups got that way by using artificial intelligence to satisfy Chinese internet users’ voracious appetite for news and entertainment. Every day, its smartphone app feeds 120 million people personalized streams of buzzy news stories, videos of dogs frolicking in snow, GIFs of traffic mishaps and listicles such as “The World’s Ugliest Celebrities.” Now the company is discovering the risks involved, under China’s censorship regime, in giving the people exactly what they want. The makers of the popular news app Jinri Toutiao unveiled moves this week to allay rising concerns from the authorities. Last week, the Beijing bureau of China’s top internet regulator accused Toutiao of “spreading pornographic and vulgar information” and “causing a negative impact on public opinion online,” and it ordered that updates to several popular sections of the app be halted for 24 hours. In response, the app’s parent company, Beijing Bytedance Technology, took down or temporarily suspended the accounts of more than 1,100 bloggers that it said had been publishing “low-quality content” on the app. It also replaced Toutiao’s “Society” section with a new section called “New Era,” which is heavy on state media coverage of government decisions. The change was made, the company said, to “promote the spirit of the Communist Party congress,” referring to the gathering of top party leaders that took place in Beijing in October. The episode points to the fine line that Toutiao’s creators must walk. Despite China’s famously strict censorship, online news is a big business there. More than 610 million people in the country gained access to some news on the internet in 2016, according to official statistics. Toutiao, which says it uses complex algorithms to decide what its users see, combines China’s hunger for media content with its rising ambitions in artificial intelligence. Its daily user base of 120 million people is equivalent to more than one-third of the population of the United States. Suan Lin, a 24-year-old private equity analyst in Shanghai, said that she normally has to search high and low online to find articles about the Chinese historical dramas she watches on television. But Toutiao delivers, she said. “Once you’re on it,” she said, “you just can’t stop.” In China, however, a strong position in media invites scrutiny from the government’s censorship apparatus. That scrutiny has become heightened over the past two years as the authorities have looked beyond the political to crack down on news it sees as degrading to society as a whole, which can include things as seemingly unsubversive as celebrity gossip. In Toutiao’s case, one of the accounts that were suspended this week had posted a saucy video of a woman in a short skirt. It got 57,000 views. Another suspended account had recently put up a post titled “The World’s Ugliest Celebrities, Michael Jackson Is Ranked First, You Won’t Want to Eat After Reading This.” “Once you have more people watching, then you want to be more cautious,” Wei-Ying Ma, who heads Toutiao’s artificial intelligence lab, told a conference in Beijing last month. As Toutiao’s popularity has skyrocketed, Bytedance has become a darling of Silicon Valley investors such as Sequoia Capital. The company, which is currently valued at $20 billion, has been in talks with existing backers to raise new financing that would value the company at more than $30 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public. That price tag would make Bytedance among the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world, not just in China. Airbnb is said to be valued at around $30 billion. SpaceX, the rocket maker founded by Elon Musk, is valued at $21 billion. Bytedance has big plans for overseas expansion, too. It recently spent between $800 million and $1 billion to purchase Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe. At the Beijing conference last month, a top Bytedance executive, Liu Zhen, said the company hoped to be earning half its revenue from outside China within the next five years. Jinri Toutiao, whose name means “today’s headlines” in Chinese and is pronounced JING-er TOE-tee-yow, aggregates content from various sources and looks much like Facebook’s newsfeed. But instead of displaying articles and videos based on what your friends have shared, the app does so based on what you have previously read and watched on the app. If you click on articles about iPhones, then Toutiao will feed you more tech coverage. After you watch a few cooking videos, the app will fetch you more clips of people wrapping dumplings and braising chicken’s feet. This approach has helped Toutiao thrive amid China’s heavily controlled environment for social media. Instead of policing the sharing activity of tens of millions of users, the company needs only to calibrate and adjust its centralized recommendation software. But it also needs to make sure the app’s content does not cross the lines of censors. That is a huge task, particularly given that the overwhelming majority of content on Toutiao is produced by individual bloggers, not professional news organizations or other institutions. Ms. Liu said at last month’s conference in Beijing that 90 percent of the app’s content comes from blogger accounts. Toutiao has around 1.2 million content-producing accounts in total. According to Bytedance, every piece of content is automatically screened to check that it is acceptable before appearing on Toutiao. But once something has attracted more views, the system applies a more sophisticated screening algorithm. Certain material is also examined by humans as a final check. Bytedance also takes more overt steps to stay on the right side of the authorities. Important updates from the government are sometimes pinned to the top of a user’s feed. That can lead to awkward juxtapositions — between, say, a state media write-up on President Xi Jinping’s recent decisions and a photo slide show on six women who are “so beautiful that rich businessmen immediately became attracted to them,” as the piece’s headline puts it. Toutiao has come in for official rebuke before. Last June, the Beijing bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered around a dozen accounts on the app shut down, calling on Toutiao and other news portals to “actively promote socialist core values” and create a “healthy, uplifting environment for mainstream opinion” by eschewing dishy coverage of celebrity scandals. In September, the website of the People’s Daily newspaper, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, published a series of opinion articles strongly criticizing A.I.-based news apps, including Toutiao, for spreading misinformation and superficial content. Despite Toutiao’s popularity, some in China share that view. Yang Sun, a 26-year-old financial analyst in Shanghai, decried the app’s sensationalist headlines. “It should absolutely be taken offline,” Ms. Yang said. “Totally deserves it.” An earlier version of this article misstated how Bytedance screens content uploaded to its Jinri Toutiao news app. All content gets screened by a basic computer algorithm. It is not the case that content is not screened if it is seen by only a handful of people. The incorrect information came from a comment by Wei-Ying Ma, head of Toutiao’s artificial intelligence lab, who told a Beijing conference last month that, “If there’s a video that one or two people watch, we don’t care.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Savage Question About Obama and HQ, Answered","It was Michelle’s birthday. So what was former President Barack Obama doing there, smiling out from phone screens as one of the 91 winners of the Wednesday night game of HQ Trivia, the live show that more than a million people play twice a day? Had he really passed up celebrating his wife’s 54th birthday to compete for a chance to win a tiny share of a $2,000 jackpot, after both of them reportedly received an advance of more than $60 million for a pair of books? Was the $21.98 he ended up winning really worth it to miss celebrating with his partner of 25 years? Was this Instagram tribute to her posted earlier in the day with the knowledge that he would have to excuse himself for about 15 minutes at 9 p.m.? It was the only thing that the HQties of Twitter wanted to know. Even Scott Rogowksy, the game’s cult hero host, acknowledged Mr. Obama’s image, though he seemed to take the president’s presence in stride. “We salute you, sir,” he said. “Thank you for your service.” Of course, the 44th president is famously competitive, whether it be over the tastiness of his chili recipe or the number of push-ups he can pump out. For his birthday each year, he competes in a round-robin of athletic competitions with some of his closest friends. In 2009, his first year in the White House, Michelle gathered a group to play basketball with him at Camp David. “He has a general philosophy that whatever he does, he’s going to do the very best he can do,” his friend Marty Nesbitt told The Times in 2012. One would assume that drive would extend to a trivia game that other celebrities have proved capable of winning. With the help of his family, the 86-year-old newsman Dan Rather was able to pull off a win at Christmas. HQ played it coy in a statement: “The Secret Service will be pleased to hear that we don’t share details on the identities of our players.” The game has grown prodigiously since its introduction in August, attracting tens of thousands of people to its December games and peaking (for now) at 1.3 million players in a game on Sunday. And Mr. Obama certainly seems as if he would have known the steps involved in a wine tasting (swirl before smelling), and be familiar with the songwriting career of Alan Thicke, knowledge that was integral to winning Wednesday’s second game. But a spokeswoman said that Mr. Obama, to the disappointment of all who have known the delight of surviving what the game calls a savage question, was not the account that had shared the jackpot Wednesday night. “President Obama is as competitive a trivia player as anybody,” said Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama. “But he was celebrating his wife’s birthday last night with dinner and a play. In other words, not exactly the most conducive environment for gaming on a phone.”",The New York Times
2018,A Sci-fi Writer Inspired by the Plight of Irish Immigrants,"Inside the List SPACE CRAFT: Fans of Pierce Brown’s swashbuckling sci-fi adventure series won’t be surprised to learn that he loved world-building from an early age. “When I was a kid, we moved around, and I was forced to grow up in lots of places. I spent a lot of time alone. I’d go into the woods and build forts and create these huge imaginary scenes.” When he wrote the first volume in his best-selling “Red Rising” series, “I started with the main character and shaped my world around him,” he says. “I was inspired by the plight of Irish immigrants in the 19th century and by the disenfranchisement of working classes.” He’s still dissecting social hierarchies in the fourth book in the series, “Iron Gold,” which debuts on this week’s hardcover fiction list at No. 3: “I’m exploring the lives of people who become casualties despite the best intentions of the story’s heroes.” PICTURE THIS: Two new historical biographies appear this week on the children’s hardcover picture-book list: Brad Meltzer’s “I Am Harriet Tubman,” which enters the list at No. 4, and Margot Lee Shetterly’s “Hidden Figures,” at No. 8. Shetterly — whose 2016 book about black female mathematicians at NASA during the early years of the space race has already been made into a movie and a young-reader chapter book — says she relished bringing her narrative to the 3-to-7 set. “These are the ones who need the story the most,” she explains. “To encourage women and minorities to enter STEM fields, you need to start early.” She adds, “Distilling the story for them in no way means you dumb it down. You simplify concepts, but you don’t assume children can’t understand.” PALACE POLITICS: David Cay Johnston’s “It’s Worse Than You Think” debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list, where it sits with three other titles about President Trump or his administration. Johnston, a veteran journalist, is not surprised by the appetite for such books. “During the campaign, Donald Trump was like an accident on the other side of the highway, complete with fireworks and a marching band and dancing girls,” he says. “People were not paying attention to who he is; they were too busy watching the spectacle. But now people are saying, ‘Wait a minute. What’s going on here?’” In his book, Johnston says he is trying to show what members of Trump’s administration have been doing for the last year, “undermining rules on things like job safety, food safety, and air and water quality.”",The New York Times
2018,A Science Denier at the Natural History Museum? Scientists Rebel,"Rebekah Mercer, a supporter of President Trump and an influential donor to conservative causes — including groups that deny climate science — is under renewed pressure to step down from the board of New York City’s most prominent science museum, the American Museum of Natural History. This week, more than 200 scientists and other academics who have advocated policy action on climate change endorsed an open letter that calls on the museum to remove Ms. Mercer from its board and “end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation.” Among those who signed the letter, which warned of “a loss of public trust,” were Michael E. Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. “The museum deeply respects the work and views of scientists — both those who work as colleagues at the museum and those from the broader scientific community,” the museum said in a statement to The New York Times. “We also respect and understand scientists’ role in society, including adding their voices to political debates that relate to scientific issues. “The museum itself, however, does not make appointment decisions concerning staff or trustees based on political views,” the statement continued. “The museum has long maintained that its funders do not shape its curatorial decisions.” A spokeswoman for Ms. Mercer did not return calls seeking comment. Whether cultural institutions should consider the personal and political allegiances of their contributors remains thorny territory, particularly since nonprofit organizations can rarely afford to turn away generous donors like the Mercer family. Such questions were raised recently in connection with reports linking the Sackler family, prominent cultural donors, to the company that produces OxyContin, the powerful painkiller that has been involved in opioid overdoses. And some objected to the renaming of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s fountain plaza after the conservative philanthropist David H. Koch in 2014 (he gave $65 million). “A political litmus test for who should serve can be very destructive to a nonprofit institution,” said Reynold Levy, the former president of Lincoln Center. “As long as the mission and important portions of the program are supported by the trustee, what they do in the political world shouldn’t be relevant.” A similar effort by scientists, in 2015, called on the museum to cut ties with Mr. Koch, then a trustee. Less than a year later, having served on the board for 23 years, Mr. Koch resigned. At the time, both Mr. Koch and the museum said that the resignation was unrelated to the pressure campaign. In March last year, a group of employees filed complaints with the museum’s human resources department in an attempt to spur an internal conversation about Ms. Mercer’s role on the board, but nothing came of it, according to one person involved in the effort who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions. The museum emphasized that scientists and educators at the museum make decisions about scientific and educational content, not trustees and donors. “We believe that human-induced climate change is well-supported by scientific evidence and is one of the most serious issues currently facing our planet,” the statement said. “We are deeply committed to presenting evidence-based, scientific information about climate change to a broad public.” The latest push to oust Ms. Mercer from the museum board was spearheaded by the Natural History Museum, a nonprofit traveling museum that also led the 2015 drive to remove Mr. Koch. “Museums are among the most trusted sources of information in society,” the organization’s co-founder and director, Beka Economopoulos, said in an email. “Having a science denier and top funder of climate science denial campaigns in a leadership position at a science museum undermines the institution’s credibility.” We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Ms. Mercer, a daughter of the hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer, has been on the museum’s board since 2013. The Mercer Family Foundation has long supported a variety of conservative causes, including Breitbart News, the influential right-wing website founded by Andrew Breitbart and until recently run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist. The Mercer family publicly distanced itself from Mr. Bannon this month after Mr. Bannon’s provocative remarks about Mr. Trump were reported in Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.” Tax records show that the Mercers have given a little over $19 million to a variety of conservative groups, including at least three that reject the scientific consensus around fossil fuel-driven climate change: the Heartland Institute in Illinois, as well as the CO2 Alliance and the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change. The foundation has given nearly $5.9 million to the Heartland Institute since 2008, compared to about $4 million to the museum since 2012. The Mercer Family Foundation has also donated to New York City hospitals as well as the National Youth Science Foundation, which runs summer camps. But most of its money goes to conservative causes. The foundation’s 2016 return is not yet available on the Internal Revenue Service website. It was shared with The Times by the Climate Investigations Center, which tracks funding for organizations that reject established climate science. It is based in Washington and is supported by anonymous donors seeking to limit the risks of climate change. An earlier version of this article misstated the stance of the Becket Fund, a religious freedom group, on abortion. While the fund has litigated on behalf of groups that oppose abortion, it does not take a formal position on the practice. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Mercers’ support for Breitbart News. Although the Mercers have backed both Breitbart and the Government Accountability Institute, they did not fund the news site through a $2 million donation to the institute.",The New York Times
2018,A Sea of Trash on Lebanon’s Beaches,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — A winter storm in Lebanon has resurfaced a longstanding national problem, in the form of a swirling sea of garbage. Piles of trash began washing up Monday on the beaches of Zouk Mosbeh, a town 10 miles north of Beirut, leaving the shore littered with refuse. An earlier storm surge had dragged trash from a landfill out to sea, later depositing it along the coastline and up to 100 feet inland. Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Tuesday ordered a cleanup of the beaches in the Kaserwan district, home to Zouk Mosbeh and a region filled with beach resorts. Trucks began carting away the trash that overwhelmed the shoreline, though some experts said the accumulation would continue as winter storms resumed. The trash pileup may have resulted from the failure of a marine retaining wall surrounding a huge decades-old landfill, causing trash to flow out and settle on the northern shore line. Lebanon’s waste crisis, which some residents see as a symptom of the government’s failure to provide basic services to its citizens, has caused public outrage in the past. In 2015, protests against poor trash collection and management took hold across the country, culminating in the “You Stink” movement — a name that pointed to both the smell of uncollected trash festering in the summer heat, and to the perceived corruption underlying the Lebanese government. “Instead of using the waste as a resource for the economy, politicians are using it as a means to assert their political agendas,” said Sammy Kayed of the American University of Beirut’s Nature Conservation Center. The recent accumulation of trash on Lebanon’s coastline — known for its Mediterranean beaches that attract vacationers from across the world — has led politicians to trade jabs ahead of coming parliamentary elections. Samy Gemayel, a member of parliament and the leader of Lebanon’s Kataeb political party, called for the resignation of Tareq al-Khatib, the minister of the environment, for “failing to adopt preventive measures” to combat the trash, according to state news media. Mr. Khatib hit back on Tuesday, saying that open dumping in a district overseen by Mr. Gemayel’s party was one of the main sources of the garbage. While politicians take turns laying blame on one another, activists and residents have expressed dismay at Lebanon’s resurgent trash problem. “This is just one manifestation of something very severe happening in many places, not just in Kaserwarn,” Mr. Kayed said. “If they wanted to — if there was a real desire to negotiate and set up the necessary infrastructure for recycling and treating waste as the resource that it has the potential to be — it could be done.”",The New York Times
2018,A Selfie for Your Shelf,"Noted Last year Kim Phan, a clothing designer in Manhattan, decided she wanted a miniature version of herself. She wore a print dress from her label, Yumi Kim, and proceeded to a branch of Doob, where she stepped into a walled room — the “Dooblicator” — fitted with 54 cameras. The cameras captured her from every angle, and then Ms. Phan stepped out and reviewed the image on a monitor. “I wanted it to be a motion shot,” she said. “I told them, ‘I want you to capture my dress flying.’” Using a process called photogrammetry, a technology also employed by the film and video game industry, Doob converted the 2-dimensional image of her into a high-resolution 3-D file. Then, through 3-D printing, a resin polymer figurine is produced. Ms. Phan was immensely pleased with the result. “You’re able to have your own real-life Barbie,” she said. “It’s actually you.” Later, she returned with her fiancé and had a figurine made of herself jumping onto his back, which she keeps on her desk at home. You can also see copies of Ms. Phan’s figurines at a Doob store in SoHo (there’s another branch on the Upper East Side, and stores in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere), along with dozens of other samples, ranging in size from four inches tall (the Buddy, $95) to 14 inches tall (the Diva, $695). How else to describe a Lilliputian rendition of a photograph that’s so realistically detailed, one subject called it “creepily accurate”? A personal action figure? Mini-Me, like the character in the Austin Powers movies? “People use the term ‘3-D selfie’ a lot. It really isn’t that,” said Michael Anderson, the chief executive of Doob USA. “We refer to them as 3-D-printed replicas.” Doob, which was founded five years ago and whose headquarters are in Düsseldorf, Germany, is betting big that people want to see themselves made small: smiling alone; hugging their spouses in an eerily perfected version of the old wedding-cake topper; astride a Harley-Davidson, tattooed arms naked to the wind. Whether you consider them cute or creepy, they are perhaps the most currently relatable example of the much buzzed-about, yet perplexing, 3-D printing. To visit the SoHo store and be in the presence of so many real New Yorkers looking exactly like they do on the city’s streets, only shrunken and displayed on tables and shelves, is, initially, surreal. You have stepped into some version of the new Alexander Payne movie, “Downsizing,” or that old Lily Tomlin-Charles Grodin flick “The Incredible Shrinking Woman.” One 10-inch figurine of a man dressed fashionably in a tan blazer, scarf and black-frame architect’s glasses, his dog lying obediently at his feet, was so lifelike that it captures his expression of self-satisfaction. “All that detail is integral,” Mr. Anderson said. “If it’s you, but it’s small and blurry, it’s just a trinket. But sometimes, on the larger figures, you can see the time on a person’s watch.” The more thought given to one’s appearance before the doobing process, the better the results, generally. Patterns and contrasting colors show up well, for instance. And a good pose can capture the inner you. One family gathered three generations together for a group doob. A musician stood knees bent, blowing his horn. Then there’s the bodybuilder who took his shirt off, showing his waxed six-pack abs. Heather Stern first got doobed in 2014, when she was eight months pregnant with her daughter, Rosie. She has celebrated Rosie’s birthday every year since by getting doobed together. The naturalistic figures have made her think about “the toys we give to our daughters,” Ms. Stern said, like American Girl dolls. “For your daughter to have an image of a normal female body is a positive thing,” she said. But what to do with a doob? They aren’t sturdy enough to play with. Displaying them in your house or office may seem narcissistic. Ms. Stern keeps her doobs on a bookshelf at home with the Legos she builds (she is a mechanical engineer), though “it’s not like a centerpiece of the house,” she said. She added: “People are shocked by it: ‘Oh my God, that’s amazing, what is it?’” One fitting use is to advance the self-referential digital culture from which doobs sprung. That’s what Ashley Holt did. A custom cake maker in Brooklyn, Ms. Holt had a doob made of herself posing mouth wide open, midbite. After she received the finished figurine, which takes about two to three weeks, she made a cake in the form of a peach. Then she posed her doob with the cake, took a picture and posted it to Instagram — “to make it look like a tiny little person eating a giant peach,” Ms. Holt said. “I wanted to bring a doob into a cake design, rather than the standard cake topper.” For a finale, Ms. Holt returned to the Doob store weeks later and got a doob of herself holding her tiny cake-eating doob. “I was wearing the same outfit,” she said. “They call that a ‘Meta Doob.’”",The New York Times
2018,"A Senior Republican Senator Admonishes Trump: ‘America Is an Idea, Not a Race’","WASHINGTON — It was just after President Trump had finished railing in the Oval Office against African immigrants he said came from “shithole countries” when a senior Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who was there to negotiate a deal on immigration, spoke up. “America is an idea, not a race,” Mr. Graham said, according to three people familiar with the exchange on Thursday. Diversity was a strength, he said, not a weakness. And by the way, the senator added, he himself was a descendant of immigrants who came to the United States from “shithole countries with no skills.” Mr. Trump’s racially charged comments in front of more than half a dozen lawmakers, which also extended to immigrants from Haiti — followed by a day in which members of Congress denounced the president, defended him or stayed silent — now threaten what had been an emerging agreement to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Several people with knowledge of the conversation said the president had also demanded to know whether Haitian immigrants could be left out of any deal. The White House has not disputed the account of the exchange. The collapse of negotiations on an immigration deal would raise the risk of a government shutdown next week, given that many Democrats have said such an agreement must be included in any measure to continue funding the government past a Jan. 19 deadline. To try to steer the political narrative, the president took to Twitter on Friday with a vague account of the meeting, saying his remarks at the meeting were “tough, but this was not the language used.” President Trump’s approval rating fell across many demographic groups over his first year in office, including among those seen as important to his base. But Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who also attended the meeting on immigration, told reporters on Friday that the president had used the expletive several times, and had said “things which were hate-filled, vile and racist.” “I cannot believe that, in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday,” Mr. Durbin said. Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, told The Post and Courier of Charleston that Mr. Graham had related Mr. Trump’s remarks to him after the meeting, and he called news reports about them “basically accurate” based on that account. According to three people briefed about the meeting, it featured a dramatic moment between the president and Mr. Graham, who referred to Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign as a “race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot,” but who has recently grown close to the president and has advised him on immigration policy. After Mr. Trump disparaged African nations in foul terms, they said, Mr. Graham answered with an impassioned defense of immigrants and immigration as essential to the American ideals of diversity and inclusion. Mr. Graham has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the president’s remarks or his own. But on Friday, he released a statement that appeared to confirm the tenor of both. “Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday,” Mr. Graham said. “The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel. I’ve always believed that America is an idea, not defined by its people but by its ideals.” In Twitter posts on Friday, Mr. Trump charged that Democrats had fabricated parts of the exchange even as he defended the sentiment that prompted them. Mr. Trump said he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country,” and denied that he had asked to remove them from the immigration proposal, adding: “Made up by Dems.” In a joint statement released on Friday, two Republican senators who also attended the session, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, charged that Democrats were acting dishonorably, claiming that they could not remember whether Mr. Trump used the words attributed to him. “President Trump brought everyone to the table this week and listened to both sides, but regrettably, it seems that not everyone is committed to negotiating in good faith,” the senators said. “In regards to Senator Durbin’s accusation, we do not recall the president saying these comments specifically, but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest.” Also present at the meeting were the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California; Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida. Some Republicans condemned the president’s remarks, as Democrats announced plans to introduce a resolution next week to formally censure him for them. At an event in Wisconsin on Friday, Speaker Paul D. Ryan described Mr. Trump’s comments as “very unfortunate” and “unhelpful.” Mr. Ryan went on to recall how his own relatives immigrated to the United States from Ireland. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, suggested the president’s inability to refrain from incendiary statements was detracting from his agenda. “It’s an unacceptable view of the world, and it’s an unacceptable thing to say,” Mr. Blunt told KMBZ, a radio station in the Kansas City area. “You would expect the president to lead in determining how you filter your thoughts, rather than to continue to say things that take a lot away from what’s actually getting done.” Two high-ranking Democrats — Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Representative Jerrold L. Nadler of New York, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee — said they would call on Republican leaders to bring up a resolution reprimanding the president for “racist statements.” “We have to show the world that this president does not represent the real feelings of most of the American people, which is part of the reason why he lost the popular vote,” they said in a joint statement. “Congress must speak with one voice in condemning these offensive and anti-American remarks. There is no excuse for it.” The bipartisan backlash to the president’s comments intensified on Friday as Mr. Trump signed a proclamation at the White House for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, ignoring a question from a reporter about whether he is a racist. The current debate about Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant talk unfolded one week before funding for the government is set to be exhausted without action from Congress, where Democrats have pressed to include an immigration plan to preserve protections for roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants that Mr. Trump has moved to rescind. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program created by President Barack Obama that is commonly known as DACA, they have obtained temporary, renewable work permits. Mr. Trump announced in September he was ending the program, setting a six-month clock before the first permits would begin expiring and calling on Congress to enact legislation to create a permanent solution in the meantime. A federal judge in San Francisco this week issued a nationwide injunction, putting that action on hold and ordering the Trump administration to continue the program pending a legal challenge. While lawmakers had been closing in on a bipartisan deal on the matter and Mr. Durbin and Mr. Graham had been hopeful that Mr. Trump was on the brink of endorsing it, the furor surrounding his remarks appeared to deepen the divisions surrounding any such plan, prompting the president to discount the chances of an agreement. Conceding only that his language was “tough,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!” The president’s comments on Thursday came during a session in which senators were describing a plan to end the diversity visa lottery and allocate some of the visas instead to vulnerable populations from places including El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti that have had Temporary Protected Status in the United States. The measure under discussion would also provide legal status for DACA recipients and work permits for their parents, bar the children from sponsoring their parents for citizenship, and include $2.5 billion in border security funding. Mr. Trump had responded approvingly to the proposal after hearing Mr. Graham and Mr. Durbin describe it over the phone on Thursday morning, according to people familiar with the conversations, but the pair arrived at the White House to brief the president about it not long after to find several Republicans they were not expecting sitting in on the session. Attendees were startled by the tone Mr. Trump took during the meeting, and by Friday morning, Mr. Trump was listing his objections to the measure on Twitter and working preemptively to shift blame if the dispute led to a government shutdown. “USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly,” Mr. Trump said of the immigration plan. “The Dems will threaten ‘shutdown,’ but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most.” A headline with an earlier version of this article misquoted Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He said: “America is an idea, not a race,” not “American is an idea, not a race.” In addition, the article contained an incorrect middle initial for a New York congressman. He’s Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, not Jerrold B.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | A Sexual Encounter, and a Dispute","Letters To the Editor: Re “Guilty of Not Being a Mind Reader” (Op-Ed, Jan. 17): Bari Weiss brushes aside the problematic behavior of the comedian Aziz Ansari in a sexual encounter to advance her notion that his actions are commonplace and therefore no big deal. Nobody is expecting Mr. Ansari or anyone else to be a mind reader in the bedroom. But he didn’t need to be, because, according to the account in the website Babe, which Mr. Ansari didn’t dispute, Grace, his accuser, made it clear that she didn’t want to proceed. She did this when she repeatedly removed her hand from his penis and when she said “I don’t want to feel forced” and “no, I don’t think I’m ready to do this.” It’s on him that he ignored those actions. Grace’s ideas aren’t “retrograde”; she was simply asking Mr. Ansari not to continue to push her for sex. She was asking him to treat sex as something that happens between two people, not something one does to the other. He may indeed have considered the encounter consensual, but that doesn’t make it so. Ms. Weiss makes it sound as if Grace didn’t voice any objections. Whatever other sexual acts she consented to are irrelevant to his ignoring her direct statements. That’s the issue. RACHEL KRAMER BUSSELEGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. To the Editor: Bari Weiss proposes that if Grace was uncomfortable with Aziz Ansari’s sexual advances, she should have said so. This prescription has two flaws. First, Grace reportedly did tell Mr. Ansari how she felt late in the encounter, specifically mentioning force and the risk that she would hate him. Second, young women like Grace (who was 22 at the time) may be reluctant to explicitly say “stop it” for fear either of angering her date (who is stronger than she) or having no impact at all, as happened here. Far from asking men to be mind readers, as Ms. Weiss claims, supporters of #MeToo call upon men to acknowledge that they are not mind readers who can tell when a date really wants sex. A thoughtful man will “use his words” to ask whether his date is O.K. with what is happening, letting her know that she can safely say no and that her wishes will be honored. SHERRY F. COLB, ITHACA, N.Y. To the Editor: Aziz Ansari and his accuser went on a date. She accompanied him back to his apartment, allowed him to perform a sex act on her, reciprocated, rebuffed his efforts to take it further, then got up and left. The #MeToo movement has exposed plenty of lecherous predators, but Mr. Ansari is not one of them. Baseless accusations like this, and the media’s failure to distinguish between sexual assault and second thoughts, belittle the experiences of genuine victims, impede the fumigation of the Hollywood casting couch and dilute the potency of the #MeToo movement’s most effective ingredient: truth. GARY TAUSTINE, NEW YORK To the Editor: It’s time to rethink the hookup culture altogether, which for women tends to end in far more unhappiness than in good sex. It is based on the lie that women are just as eager as men to have unromantic, unattached, transactional sex. This is neither true of humans nor virtually any other species, where the female has enormous power through mating rituals of establishing when and with whom sex occurs. Grace was just doing what a good modern woman is supposed to do: Hook up. But even if she had halfway decent sex with Aziz Ansari, a virtual stranger, she would still likely have felt some primal regret, that “men are all the same.” It’s time for women to try some old-fashioned empowerment: Demand that men woo and seduce them, build a romantic charge, take their time to get to know the man, and then decide whether sex is even in the cards.

2018,A Sober Trump Reassures the Davos Elite,"DAVOS, Switzerland — On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump the candidate denounced what he called “the false song of globalism.” A year after taking office, President Trump came on Friday to tell the elites at Davos, who composed the song, that maybe they could still perform in harmony. In an encounter that might have surprised even him two years ago, Mr. Trump reassured the world’s political and financial leaders that his “America First” agenda was not a rejection of international cooperation. The combative nationalist gave way to the let’s-make-a-deal businessman, as he invited them to invest in what he called a resurgent United States. “I believe in America,” Mr. Trump told a jampacked auditorium on the last day of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. “As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world.” That did not mean Mr. Trump has joined the globalism chorus. He has spent much of the last year trying to dismantle the international political and economic system represented by the Davos consensus — ripping up or renegotiating trade agreements, threatening or imposing tariffs on imports and working to curb the flow of immigration. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that cross-border trade had to be made fairer and vowed to take action against predatory practices. “We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,” he said. “We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.” His moment in the global sun was shadowed to an extent by a New York Times report that he had tried to fire the special counsel investigating his campaign ties to Russia and backed off only when the White House counsel threatened to resign. Mr. Trump dismissed the report as “fake news,” even though other news outlets confirmed it, and he otherwise tried to ignore it publicly. But his unlikely visit to Davos was meant to be a shift in tone from his populist, protectionist rhetoric. He went so far as to say that he would be willing to re-enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade agreement he abandoned last year, if it was renegotiated on better terms. That offer came just days after the other 11 members opted to form their own bloc without the United States. “We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all,” Mr. Trump said, despite his oft-stated insistence on one-on-one trade deals rather than multinational pacts. Mr. Trump was largely well received by the billionaire investors, corporate executives and heads of state who a year ago were fretting that his election would mean the demise of the global order they had built, but today were celebrating his tax cuts and regulatory rollback. “The economy has improved since Trump came in,” said Kanika Dewan, president of Bramco, a company that builds airports around the globe from headquarters in New Delhi and Bahrain. “His offensive comments are mostly about capturing media attention. At the end of the day, he’s not going to do anything to destroy his legacy.” Brian Mikkelsen, Denmark’s minister of industry, business and financial affairs, welcomed Mr. Trump’s legislation slashing corporate tax rates. “I’m quite sure, talking to Danish business leaders, that they will invest more in the States because of these tax cuts,” he said. But like others, Mr. Mikkelsen emerged somewhat uncertain about which Mr. Trump to expect in the months ahead. “It was impossible to guess what direction he will take” on trade, he said. Mr. Trump used the overnight visit to salve other wounds. He expressed regret for sharing anti-Muslim videos posted by an ultranationalist British fringe group, which offended Prime Minister Theresa May. “If you are telling me they’re horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize, if you’d like me to do that,” Mr. Trump told Britain’s ITV. For Mr. Trump, whose rule is “never apologize,” that was an unusual concession. But he offered no public apology for recent offensive comments about African countries when he met on Friday with President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, the chairman of the African Union. The union demanded a retraction and apology at the time of the remarks, but neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Kagame mentioned the incident on camera on Friday. Beyond those meetings, Mr. Trump’s visit focused to a striking degree on business. His speech mentioned priorities like terrorism, Iran and North Korea in passing, but included nothing about China, Russia, Europe, climate change, global health or other priorities. He related to the audience as a fellow capitalist, asserting, incorrectly, that he was the only businessman to have served as president. Declaring that “America is roaring back,” he promoted a story of economic rebirth. “The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America,” he said. “I’m here to deliver a simple message: There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.” His comeback message, however, was tempered by a report that came out while he was on stage. The American economy grew by 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, healthy but lower than the 3 percent or 4 percent or higher that he has aspired to. Over all, the economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, Mr. Trump’s first year in office, up from 1.5 percent in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last year, but lower than in either 2014 or 2015. As he often does, Mr. Trump presented a selective version of the last year. He boasted that African-American unemployment was at a new low, but did not mention that it began falling in 2011, and that the decline this year simply continued the progress that started under Mr. Obama. He claimed credit for creating 2.4 million jobs since his election, but the number of new jobs in 2017 was no higher than in any of the last six years of Mr. Obama’s tenure. Still, he was right that stock markets have soared to remarkable heights on his watch and that the American business community had responded to his tax cuts and regulatory rollback with enthusiasm. His surprisingly warm reception here, despite the schism over trade and global affairs, underscored the optimism of many corporate leaders. Klaus Schwab, who founded the World Economic Forum in 1971, not only praised Mr. Trump on stage, but also seemed to exonerate the myriad incendiary actions that have troubled many in the corporate community. “I’m aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations,” Mr. Schwab said. Some in the audience felt that went too far, and booed. Mr. Trump’s speech was largely written by Gary D. Cohn, the president’s national economic adviser and a former Goldman Sachs banker, and Robert Porter, the White House staff secretary. Stephen Miller, the immigration hard-liner who often crafts the president’s more provocative speeches, was busy working on next week’s State of the Union address. In conversations over the last few days, Mr. Trump agreed to offer a more optimistic, less strident tone to show flexibility without making any substantive compromise. He stuck closely to the script on the teleprompter. Even during a later 10-minute session of questions and answers with Mr. Schwab, Mr. Trump generally stuck to the talking points, although he could not resist a jab at the “fake” media and noted that many in the room supported his Democratic opponent in 2016. “He was the marketer-in-chief,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research and information company focused on energy and other sectors. “He was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.” OpinionAntony J.

2018,A Soccer Tournament Breaks Through the Boycott of Qatar,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The blockade of Qatar led by its largest neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has closed borders, complicated business and affected countless other facets of life in the Gulf since it was imposed last June. Its has also affected the region’s most popular sport, soccer. Supply lines sustaining construction projects for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have been interrupted, and a regional championship tournament that was scheduled to take place in Qatar in December was moved to Kuwait because Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain had refused to participate in the original location. But in the last few days, soccer appears to have found a way around the wall. On Saturday, the Asian Football Confederation, which oversees soccer in the region, declared that when teams from Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. meet Qatari clubs in the A.F.C. Champions League, the games would take place home and away in those countries as planned instead of at neutral sites. Since the blockade includes a blanket ban on travel to and from Qatar by land, sea or air, the A.F.C. effectively ordered Saudi and Emirati clubs already scheduled to face Qatari opponents to ignore it in order to remain in the competition. The blockade began because Qatar’s foes accuse it of financing terrorism, cozying up to Iran and harboring fugitive dissidents; the travel ban had been its most visible aspect. But those travel restrictions were seemingly swept away — at least for one narrow, but quite public, case — by the A.F.C.’s ruling and by Saudi and Emirati soccer officials subsequently accepting that decision. “It is interesting that soccer is the only thing that appears to be breaching the diplomatic and economic boycott,” said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a specialist in soccer and politics in the Middle East. “In an environment in which the nations are having nothing to do with each other, this is the first way through.” This was not the case last December with the Gulf Cup, a biennial tournament featuring eight national teams from the region that was scheduled to be played in Qatar. Ten days before the opening match, with Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain refusing to participate, Qatar agreed to allow the tournament be switched to Kuwait. (The U.A.E. soccer association said that, in that case, its reasons for boycotting were not political.) The tournament went off without major incidents: Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. were placed in a different group from Qatar’s, and their national teams never met on the field. But with no resolution to the diplomatic crisis, concern quickly shifted to this year’s Champions League, a tournament featuring 32 of Asia’s top clubs from various countries, set to begin its group stage in February. The problem was that the tournament is split into eight groups of four teams, and with four clubs from Qatar, four from the Emirates and two from Saudi Arabia in the field, a collision of at least two of them seemed inevitable. (Iran, which has sided with Qatar in the political dispute, also has teams in the tournament and has its own diplomatic impasse with Saudi Arabia.) In the end, half of the eight groups contain at least one team from Qatar and one from Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. (or both). In January, the A.F.C. sent a delegation to the region to investigate the situation. But on Saturday it announced the games would be played at home sites after all, according to the event’s regulations. “The regulations are clear, and matches must be played in home-and-away format, especially in club competitions,” said Dato’ Windsor John, the A.F.C.’s general secretary. “Now we need to think from an operational point of view. We need to sit down with them and see what is needed. In terms of venues, kickoff times and all the rest, there is a lot to do.” Both the Saudi and U.A.E. federations expressed surprise at the decision but quickly indicated their participating clubs would not withdraw. The first tests arrive Feb. 12, when the group stage begins. “In view of U.A.E. F.A. keenness to cooperate with A.F.C., it announces the participation of its affiliated clubs in A.C.L. 2018,” the U.A.E. federation said a statement. Dorsey said that he saw compliance as a practical recognition by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. of the popularity of soccer in their countries, and an acknowledgment of the risks of denying fans access to prestigious games. “I don’t think it shows that there is a change in attitude so much as the need for domestic maneuvering,” he said. That does not mean there will be no trouble. During the Gulf Cup in December, a Saudi delegation walked out of a news conference to protest the presence of Qatari journalists. In September, Saudi authorities ejected a reporter from the Qatari-owned network beIN Sports from a crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, despite the network’s status as the broadcast rights-holder for the event. The A.F.C. has yet to comment on the prospect of neutral venues when Iranian and Saudi clubs meet. Those two countries cut diplomatic ties in January 2016, and a year later that dispute led to a Champions League semifinal between Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Iran’s Persepolis being held in U.A.E. and Oman. Instead of games attracting as many as 150,000 fans combined in Riyadh and Tehran, only 14,000 people actually attended the two neutral-site matches. “Taking the matches to a third country is a temporary solution, or should be,” said Steve Kim, a former head of club competitions at the A.F.C. “The games need to be played home and away. But in Asia, that can be difficult.” All this sporting drama and tension is playing out against the backdrop of the 2022 World Cup, to be hosted by Qatar. The tournament is central to the country’s efforts to become an influential player on the global stage, and disrupting it — or forcing its cancellation — could be seen as a coup for its rivals. In October, a leading U.A.E. security official wrote on Twitter that the blockade would end if Qatar gave up hosting rights to the tournament. “If the World Cup goes out of Qatar, the crisis in Qatar will end because the crisis was made to break it,” said the official, the Dubai security chief Dhahi Khalfan. The recent decision by the Champions League, then, is encouraging, according to Dorsey. “If the Gulf crisis is to last into 2022, then this breach of the blockade means that an even more significant breach would occur at the World Cup,” he said. For John and the A.F.C., the issue was much simpler. “We haven’t thought about that,” he said of the World Cup. “We have obligations to fans, media and sponsors, and we are focused on making sure that our fixtures are completed.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Sports Rodin Works in Bronze, and in Volume","TOMS RIVER, N.J. — The hulking figure lay on its side in the long grass, partially mummified by a tarp and some bubble wrap. Brian Hanlon recognized it as soon as he saw the face. “There’s Shaq!” he cried. Indeed, there was Shaquille O’Neal, even larger than life, frozen mid-dunk. Hanlon rapped on the copper-toned torso. It was hollow as a PVC pipe. This was just a polymer cast of the real statue of O’Neal — that 900-pound monument of bronze and granite stands proudly outside the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, La., where O’Neal played his college games for L.S.U. It didn’t bother Hanlon that the cast was covered in snow, resting ignominiously outside an old chicken coop like a fallen oak. He’d actually had forgotten it was out here. He’d been busy. Last year, in fact, was Hanlon’s busiest to date. He is a sculptor by trade, the creator of the kinds of statues that stipple the stadiums, plazas and rotundas celebrating our sports icons. In 2017, he unveiled 30 new monuments, from Charles Barkley at Auburn to Evander Holyfield in Atlanta to Jackie Robinson as a football player at the Rose Bowl. At Indiana University, 12 new statues of Hoosier basketball icons went up in the lobby of Assembly Hall; each was designed by Hanlon. And after the conclusion of this year’s Winter Olympics, Hanlon could soon be adding skiers and figure skaters to his impressive roster of honorees. Hanlon’s phone keeps ringing because sculpture seems to be enjoying a renaissance, particularly among universities and teams flush with television riches and eager to celebrate their glory days. But statues are coming down, too; cities like Charlottesville, Va., New Orleans and Memphis, among others, have removed Confederate monuments, and a petition to remove a prominent Christopher Columbus statue in New York also gained traction. In the uproar, Hanlon says he has heard a kind of wake-up call. Times change. But bronze can last forever. “I realized how important and powerful what I was doing was,” he said. “There may be some days I do take it for granted.” Raised in Holmdel, N.J., Hanlon, 56, speaks often about the “spiritual” connection between his art and its inspiration. Part of that is the result of his own relationship with clay; it rescued him, he said, from a serious alcohol addiction that derailed much of his early adulthood — until he arrived at Boston University, in 1988. Finally sober at age 27, he invested in a future with his hands. Classically trained and raised Catholic, he initially sculpted mostly liturgical scenes or portraits of saints and local priests. But one of his first pieces — a statue of the javelin thrower Bob Roggy for Holmdel High School — struck a chord. He used water-based clay rather than oil-based, which is firmer and less pliable. He found that he could manipulate the clay to convey an aspect of the sculpture that does not quite belong in church: movement. His statues since then are rarely the static forms that make other pieces seem, well, statuesque. “It’s his love of sports that you see in the statues — the motion and the energy,” said Chris Riccardo, a ceramic artist and classmate at B.U. “But it’s Brian. You sit down with him and he will sell you on how important art is to him and to this world. He’s so positive with everything.” Hanlon’s “studio” is the 3,000-square foot coop, which he began renting from a local farmer in 1992, located in an overgrown field off a hidden dirt road. It had no air conditioning, no bathroom and no windows, so Hanlon poked two skylights through the roof. He shares the space with a mattress firm, which uses it for storage. “This is my stuff here,” he said, pointing to the cast husks of gigantic statues of a lion, a dog and the former football star Ernie Davis, all scattered behind the coop. They have spilled outside, near an abandoned station wagon, because there is no space left inside. Hanlon unlocked the coop and, in dusty lighting and shivering cold, revealed the resin casts of nearly a hundred other statues, many of them familiar. Next to the boxer Larry Holmes, extending a ferocious left fist, was the former Temple basketball coach John Chaney, pointing a bony finger. Behind them was the figure of Steve Gleason, a former N.F.L. player who has A.L.S., blocking a punt. Some statues are enormous, like a 15-foot-tall Dominique Wilkins rising for a dunk. Others, like a kneeling Yogi Berra, are more approachable. There are flattened basketballs and battered baseball mitts, once used as props for the modeling, on the floor, alongside the heavy mallets, saws, wrenches and clamps Hanlon uses. Constructing a Shaq-size sculpture out of bronze is tough work. Hanlon starts with a full-scale armature — a skeleton, of sorts, made with rebar, steel, foam, wood, chicken wire and other materials. “You name it,” Hanlon said. “Whatever can hold that clay.” More than 1,500 pounds of clay were heaped onto that underlying armature, rendered and finessed so that the tiniest details of O’Neal (muscle definition, jersey wrinkles, hair strands) could shine through the finished patina. Those details emerge though Hanlon’s research. A statue of Bob Cousy, for instance, adopted the ramrod straight posture of the great point guard as he dribbled. Another, of the basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, memorialized him in a familiar pose: seated on the bench, sucking on a towel. “He captures their movements, their actual poses,” said Scott Zuffelato, the vice president for philanthropy at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which has declared Hanlon its official sculptor. “That says a lot about Brian’s perceptiveness to how an actual athlete is presented to the public and represents their game.” In 2015, Hanlon unveiled a 25-ton monument to Dr. James Naismith, based on a picture of Naismith showing a basketball to some children. Hanlon recreated the image with a twist — he sculpted the likeness of a young Earl Lloyd, the N.B.A.’s first black player, onto one child’s face, to evoke a sense of the game’s evolution. Yet Hanlon also has learned to keep his ears open to different sources of inspiration. “Stephen A. Smith is a great one,” Hanlon said, referring to the bombastic ESPN commentator. “He was screaming about some player the other day, and I thought, ‘You know, somebody should make a statue of that guy.’” He pitches many of the ideas directly to prospective clients. Though they may resist the idea of spending $125,000 to $180,000 for a statue of their own, a few come to realize that there are few better ways to capture the spirit of an icon. Hanlon has created six statues for Syracuse, all of them displayed in a plaza outside the team’s football practice facility: the former football stars Davis, Jim Brown and Floyd Little; the football coach Ben Schwartzwalder; and the lacrosse coaches Roy Simmons Sr. and Simmons Jr. “You feel the person,” the Syracuse athletic director John Wildhack said. “You get a sense for the person and the strength, the spirit, the resolve, the commitment that they all had in their own way.” After sculpting the clay around the armature, Hanlon paints it with several layers of rubber, followed by coats of plaster and fiberglass. This forms the mold into which molten metal is eventually poured. Forcing open that mold after it settles can be like ripping apart two ice cubes frozen as one. For a statue of St. Peter, Hanlon once hooked a rig to his pickup, attached a line to one side of the mold, which was also attached to a wall, and floored the gas pedal. Other reveals involved ratchets and straps attached to the beams of the coop. “I can’t believe that thing didn’t fall in on me,” Hanlon said. “I did some crazy stuff in there for sure.” The creation of the mold is critical. “If the integrity of your mold is no good,” Hanlon said, “you just blew months and months of work.” “A bajillion mistakes could happen,” he added. “And somehow we pull it off.” Today, he watches for those mistakes from half a world away; most of the statues he designs now are forged and cast in a foundry he owns in Xiamen, a port city in southeastern China. Hanlon can coordinate every step of the monthslong process, from the modeling to molding to bronzing to shipping, via video conference. Recently, however, he had to give up many of the hands-on aspects of his work because of health concerns — namely the effects of years of working with resin dust, sequestered in the coop. But he says he no longer needs to feel the clay in his fingers to know when a statue could last in perpetuity. “It’s the stories,” Hanlon said. “I’m more interested in the back story than the sculpture itself. If the back story is good, the sculpture is going to be great.”",The New York Times
2018,A Storytelling Choreographer Who Listens to Her Audience,"For an in-demand choreographer, Camille A. Brown spends an unusual amount of her time listening and responding to what audiences have to say. Often, what she hears is upsetting. Sometimes the most disturbing comments prove the most useful. Since 2012, performances by her dance company have incorporated a post-show conversation among viewers and the cast — presented not in the usual way, as an extra, but as an integral part of the work. Earlier this month, Ms. Brown recalled an exchange from one of those conversations: “This older white man decided to start talking about how the black family basically doesn’t exist,” she said. “He went on and on about single-parent homes. I pointed out how most members of my company” — all African-American, including Ms. Brown — “came from two-parent homes. I told him, ‘You have a narrative in your mind, but I’m showing you another narrative.’ “Love does exist between black men and black women,” she continued. “And you have to tell people that.” This exchange is a reason that her newest dance, “ink,” includes a love duet for a man and a woman. Another section of the work, which has its local debut in Montclair State University’s Peak Performances series Feb. 1-4, features a sequence of playful brotherhood for two men. After a recent preview performance, someone expressed surprise that the men didn’t turn on each other. “It goes to show what people expect when they see two black men on the stage,” Ms. Brown said. “I want to show them something different.” That is what Ms. Brown, 38, has been trying to do, in many ways, since she started her company in 2006, and in the works she has made for other troupes, including Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But it’s especially true of the last three pieces she has created for her group, a series that reveals her growing trust in her own art. “Mr. TOL E. RAncE” (2013) took on the stereotypes of blacks in entertainment, past and present, using film footage and spoken dialogue. “Black Girl: Linguistic Play” (2015) looked at the experience of girlhood, making a dance out of playground games. Both had educational components: post-show conversations, study guides in the programs. “The first one was about other people’s perceptions of black people,” Ms. Brown said. “And ‘Black Girl’ was more about the inside — my childhood, my perspective. Where is the black girl joy that I don’t see in the media? How can we bring that to the stage?” “Ink” extends that idea — its brotherhood duet is a kind of male counterpart to “Black Girl” — and also the method, turning everyday gestures into dance. Ms. Brown said there were more to investigate, like the handshakes known as dap. “And I wanted to tie them to the African tradition and show how the gestural language keeps coming around.” In an opening solo, Ms. Brown — an exceptionally precise and powerful dancer — looks like she is stirring a pot, introducing gestures that recur with different meanings throughout the work. One second, she’s an African griot miming stories, the next she’s a hip-hop D.J. spinning records. “I wanted it to be pops and flashes, not chronological,” she said. “So that people see the different gestures but not in a particular place and time.” The mash-up continues through the other parts of “ink.” But the live music is centered on percussion, on drums, and in a climactic section called “Migration,” the African element gains force in communal dance like a spiritual explosion. Ms. Brown explained: “It’s to say, ‘This is what’s been underneath the whole time, the thing that’s carrying us through, the African spirit.” The idea of cultural continuity, that the present always contains the past, is itself a running theme in her work. It’s the explicit message of her 2016 TED video “A Visual History of Social Dance in 25 Moves,” a four-minute survey course on African-American social dances, which has been viewed more than a million times online. In “ink,” the concept is presented more abstractly. Ms. Brown said she and the dancers worked on stripping the gestures down so that they didn’t look “dancey,” then on building them back up so that they became alive in a theatrical sense. She gives her dancers the freedom to make choices, the way actors do. “I almost look at my dancers as actors,” she said, which isn’t surprising, since she is one of the rare concert dance choreographers who sustains a high-level career in theater, too. Most recently, she did the choreography for the current Broadway revival of “Once on This Island.” (In his review of the show for The New York Times, Jesse Green called her work “electric.”) For Ms. Brown, there is no hard separation between her work in musical theater and her work for her company. The Double-Dutch jump-rope moves in “Black Girl” had their origin in something she created for “Fortress of Solitude,” the musical version of the Jonathan Lethem novel at the Public Theater in 2014. “Working in both worlds has helped me be a better choreographer,” Ms. Brown said. “Because theater is all about the story, the story, the story. And as a choreographer in concert dance, I want to be a storyteller.” To Theresa Ruth Howard, a writer and former dancer who has followed Ms. Brown’s career closely, “ink” demonstrates how musical theater has contributed to Ms. Brown’s artistic growth. “The work has become more and more abstract,” Ms. Howard said, “but Camille has learned how to tell a story so well that she can now tell it in a purer concert dance form.” Ms. Howard — who described Ms. Brown’s work as a love letter to black people, “showing things we want to see” — also noticed another progression. “Camille has always been concerned that people would miss or misunderstand things,” she said. “She practically wrote a textbook in the program for ‘Black Girl,’ but now she’s more willing to let the work speak for itself.” Ms. Brown agrees. “When I was creating ‘Black Girl,’ I wanted it to be a piece that was recognizable for everyone,” she said. “I wanted it to be culturally specific, but with universal themes. But this new work is not about being universal.” “The gestures are a language,” she continued, “and some people will recognize it, and think ‘I know that’ or ‘I know that guy,’ but other audience members won’t be familiar with it.” Similarly, references in the rhythms — reggae, dancehall, the beat from Mary J. Blige’s “Real Love” — will carry strong associations for some people, but not for everyone. “I like that,” Ms. Brown said, “because it forces some audience members to think past what they think they know about black people.”",The New York Times
2018,"A Strange Itch, Trouble Breathing, Then Anaphylactic Shock","Diagnosis “I can’t breathe,” the woman panted, her voice a husky monotone. Her sister looked anxiously at the clerk at the triage desk at the University of Iowa hospital emergency room. The woman’s breath was rapid and coarse. Her chest heaved with the work of simply breathing. She pulled at the neck of her sweatshirt — suddenly it was too tight. She pulled it over her head and dropped it to the floor. She was naked beneath the top; she had been in bed when this attack came on. The 54-year-old woman was helped into a wheelchair and whisked into the inner sanctum of the E.R. What followed was a blur of concerned faces, needles and medical data. Her blood pressure was dangerously low; her heart was racing. She was given epinephrine and steroids, but it was hours before she could explain what had happened that night. She was staying at her mother’s house in rural Iowa, she told the doctors. Just as she was going to bed, she felt a sudden tingling in the palms of her hands. She recognized the sensation immediately: Twice in the past eight years, she had felt the same strange itch on her hands and sometimes her feet. Each time it was quickly followed by a terrifying sense of her throat closing. ↓ Anaphylactic Shock She had driven herself to her sister’s house, several miles away, and her sister drove her the rest of the way to the hospital. She opened the car window to let in the frigid winter night air. She struggled to breathe. Black spots swam before her eyes, but she willed herself not to pass out. She had had this kind of allergic reaction twice before but never as severely. She knew from her own research that this was anaphylactic shock — a potentially deadly allergic reaction. After she got the medications, the woman’s symptoms resolved. She stayed in the hospital overnight, and when it was clear that the episode was over, she went back to her mother’s house. She made an appointment to see a local allergy specialist right away. ↓ A Mystified Allergist The specialist spent nearly two hours going over everything the woman had been exposed to — food, plants, toxins, anything that might have triggered this nearly fatal allergic reaction. There were no new exposures that day, nothing she hadn’t eaten or touched many times before and after this latest attack. The most common cause of severe allergic reactions in adults is food, but the allergist couldn’t identify any likely suspects. He was mystified. He asked her to share her diagnosis when she got one. For months after returning to her home on Long Island, the woman was anxious about everything she ate, and she worried every night when she went to bed. She always kept a bottle of Benadryl and an EpiPen with her, but still she was terrified about what might happen if she was too far from a hospital the next time. ↓ ‘I Need a Nurse!’ When her next attack happened — just 10 months later — she was already in Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in East Patchogue, N.Y. She was being treated with antibiotics for a devastating case of gastroenteritis due to salmonella. Her first meal, after days of nothing but clear liquids, was beef brisket with potatoes and carrots. It smelled good, but she had no appetite. She made herself eat a few bites anyway, knowing it was her first step toward going home. A couple of hours later, she felt a strange itch on the top of her head. She scratched reflexively. Then the recognition hit her like a slap: Not now, she thought. She grabbed the IV pole, still dripping fluids into her system, and ran out into the hallway. “I need a nurse,” she shouted. Her heart was pounding, and she knew what was coming next. Hospital staffers in scrubs descended on her. Was she having a panic attack? No, an allergy attack, she told them. They helped her back into bed and gave her oxygen, Benadryl and steroids. “What happened?” someone asked. She told the whole story, plus something she now realized — every one of her attacks seemed to come a few hours after she ate beef. She didn’t go through this every time she had a hamburger or steak; meat was a regular and much-loved part of her diet. But she was pretty sure that she had steak — or beef brisket, this time — before each episode. Her doctors were dubious. New food allergies — especially severe ones like hers — are uncommon in adults. This was much more likely to be an allergic response to one of the antibiotics they were giving her. The patient, though, found that theory hard to swallow. It might explain this episode, but what about the earlier ones? She hadn’t been on antibiotics then. The doctors had no answer. ↓ Was a Tick to Blame? A nurse had a different theory about what happened, one the patient had heard before but never believed. There was some kind of tick, the nurse told her, whose bite could make you allergic to meat. She didn’t know much about it. But, the nurse suggested, she should check it out. The woman had been bitten by ticks before — who on Long Island hasn’t? But was it really possible for a bite to produce this crazy reaction? Indeed it was, she discovered, when she got home and began doing some research. The bite of the lone star tick — named for a white spot shaped like Texas on the arachnid’s back — could cause an allergic reaction to mammalian meat. The trigger was a sugar, identified as galactose-α-1,3-galactose and more casually known as alpha-gal, a carbohydrate found in the flesh of all nonprimate mammals. How the tick bite triggers this allergy is not yet known. The link between the tick — whose range extends from southern Florida to Maine and as far west as Iowa — and the resulting alpha-gal allergy was first described in 2009 by Thomas Platts-Mills, a professor at the University of Virginia, who himself developed the disorder. Unlike most food allergies, in which symptoms occur within minutes of consuming the allergen, the alpha-gal reaction is delayed. The symptoms — ranging from a rash to nausea to shortness of breath and even anaphylaxis — can appear four to six hours after a meal containing meat. Stranger still, the reaction doesn’t occur after every exposure. ↓ A Diet Changed Forever The diagnosis of mammalian meat allergy (M.M.A.) can be confirmed with a blood test that identifies antibodies to alpha-gal. The patient contacted Diane Cymerman, an allergist she had seen years earlier for seasonal allergies. Cymerman asked her to list all the foods she consumed before her last episode in the hospital and had her blood tested for antibodies to everything on the list, down to the black pepper and parsley seasoning. And to alpha-gal. The first results came back the following week: She had a moderate allergy to beef, but everything else was normal. The following month, the test results for alpha-gal antibodies came back. She was wildly allergic to galactose-α-1,3-galactose. Cymerman called the patient with the news. She had to avoid eating meat from mammals — and everything derived from them, including Jell-O and other foods and medications made from gelatin. Even safe foods cooked on a grill that has also been used for meat can be contaminated with enough alpha-gal to trigger a reaction. The patient contacted the allergist back in Iowa and told him what she had. He was amazed. He had only recently heard a lecture on this phenomenon. He had never seen it before her case. It hasn’t been easy for this Iowa transplant to give up beef and other meat that comes from mammals. Some days, she tells me, just thinking about a juicy hamburger or steak makes her stomach growl. But she remembers her terror and that long drive to the Iowa hospital and sticks to chicken, fish and vegetables.",The New York Times
2018,A Stylistically Daring Novel Considers Fundamental Questions,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SOLAR BONES By Mike McCormack 217 pp. Soho Press. $25. Modernism was about many things, but largely it was about fragmentation. The world had cracked, and artists had noticed. Virginia Woolf showed what a mess our minds are, Gertrude Stein wrote portraits through a Cubist kaleidoscope, and T. S. Eliot shored fragments against his ruins. Perhaps most famous of all was a certain Irishman with the chutzpah to rewrite the “Odyssey,” turning Odysseus into a middle-aged Jewish cuckold roaming all day through the linguistic detritus of Dublin, his mind a patchwork of scraps. He doesn’t even finish his own story, but is cut off by his wife Molly’s torrential interior monologue, surely literature’s defining instance of “stream of consciousness” and a gloriously fragmented finale to a novel so mashed up and wonderful and horrifying it would be loved and loathed all the way down to the present moment, modernism’s most infamous book. So when I tell you that a contemporary Irishman has just written a novel with minimal punctuation, recording the stream of consciousness of a man sitting for a few hours at his kitchen table in western Ireland, you might be forgiven for assuming that we are back at the feet of James Joyce, brought here by a modernist apostle, and that you’d do well to wait for the annotated edition. But Mike McCormack’s “Solar Bones” (winner of the Goldsmiths Prize and longlisted for the Man Booker) is a wonderfully original, distinctly contemporary book, with a debt to modernism but up to something all its own. On Nov. 2, All Souls’ Day (when Catholics pray for the souls in purgatory), the civil engineer Marcus Conway finds himself in his kitchen feeling inexplicably disoriented, as if suddenly untethered from the world. In fact he is dead, a ghost, but he does not realize it. He hears the noontime Angelus bell from across the parish, remembers that his children have grown and moved on, and wonders how he is going to pass the four hours until his wife, Mairead, gets home from work. Finding newspapers on the table, he falls into a pedantic reverie on current events (he is not really a pedant, more a perennial worrier) that spills into thoughts of his life, then stories from his past, one cascading into another. The roughly 200 pages that follow draw together memories of family and work struggles, local and national politics, public works projects, medical crises, art, travel — in short, a life — all of it delivered in lucid, lyrical prose, with line breaks that rarely disrupt but act more like breaths, as if spoken by a friend across the table. A memory of Marcus’s father disassembling a tractor might turn existential: “as I recoiled at the thought that something so complex and highly achieved as this tractor engine could prove so vulnerable, so easily collapsed and taken apart by this single tool and so frightened was I by this fact it would be years afterwards before I could acknowledge the engineering elegance of it … and “this may have been my first moment of anxious worry about the world, the first instance of my mind spiraling beyond the immediate environs of “hearth, home and parish, towards “the wider world beyond “way beyond.” Or a memory of existential awareness (upon receiving his daughter’s birth certificate) might suddenly turn mundane: “there was a metaphysical reality to her now — she had stepped into that political index which held a space for her in the state’s mindfulness … this document which did not tag or enumerate her but freed her into her own political space, our citizen daughter who “are we ever going to leave this car park or are you going to sit all day gawping at that certificate “Mairead called from the back seat.” McCormack is a pleasure to read on everything from King Crimson — “music for engineers, all those dissonant chords laid down at right angles” — to picking out eyeglasses — “each made me look foolish in one way or another, too comic or too odd or too obviously chasing something I no longer possessed” — but it’s the connections that the book keeps coming back to, the way one story relates to another, the whole greater than its parts. Sticklers for verisimilitude might rightly point out that nobody really “thinks” in such articulate well-cadenced paragraphs (Molly Bloom’s mind is a rat’s nest by comparison), but the coherence McCormack has opted for is more than stylistic. In some ways, it’s what the whole book is about. More than once Marcus counts himself “one of those men who had always structured his days around radio news bulletins,” and his struggle against a fractured worldview fed by media saturation is the novel’s most compelling and recurring theme. The stories he dwells on longest involve a water contamination catastrophe that makes Mairead very ill (“history and politics were now a severe intestinal disorder, spliced into the figure of my wife who sweated along the pale length of her body”) and a case of political graft sabotaging a public construction project he’d overseen as an engineer. Meanwhile, his own “childhood ability to get ahead of myself and reason to apocalyptic ends” he sees reinvented in his son, Darragh, as a “kind of apocalyptic riffing,” the media-age glibness of the young. It’s in this context that a memory of something as innocuous as a video chat with Darragh (who was bumming around Australia, calling intermittently in the middle of the night) leads Marcus to imagine the world’s end: “standing hollow-eyed in the middle of some desolation with the wind whistling through your skull, just before the world collapses “mountains, rivers and lakes “acres, roods and perches “into oblivion, drawn down into that fissure in creation where everything is consumed in the raging tides and swells of non-being, the physical world gone down in flames “mountains, rivers and lakes “and pulling with it also all those human rhythms that bind us together and draw the world into a community, those daily “rites, rhythms and rituals.” McCormack’s sense of Armageddon is at once familiarly contemporary and blessedly contentious. Marcus’s gloominess is tempered by his own self-skepticism and struggle, but the true counterpoint is an agnostic sort of spirituality that accumulates over the course of the novel, a sense of the connectedness of humanity, the world in all its parts, “that harmonic order,” as Marcus imagines, “which underlay everyone and everything.” It is this same sense of order he identifies earlier, “upholding the world like solar bones, that rarefied amalgam of time and light whose extension through every minute of the day is visible from the moment I get up in the morning and stand at the kitchen window with a mug of tea in my hand, watching the first cars of the day passing on the road.” For all its apparent stylistic complexity, “Solar Bones” is a beautifully simple book. Death has not solved Marcus’s worldly problems, only offered a shift of scope, and this is what McCormack’s novel offers as well. Where modernism took a world that appeared to be whole and showed it to be broken, “Solar Bones” takes a world that can’t stop talking about how broken it is, and suggests it might possibly be whole.",The New York Times
2018,"A Successful Marriage Is Never as Easy as A, B, C","State of the Unions In his 20s and early 30s, Eric Sirota was a single physicist who lived alone and often felt like Victor, the solitary scientist in Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein.” Mr. Sirota, who also composes musicals, even began working on one inspired by the Frankenstein story. “The message is that everyone deserves a chance at love,” he said of his interpretation. “You have to go find it and nurture it but it’s something people are entitled to, and it makes them better people.” His own search for love was an endurance test: He estimated that in the 1980s and early ’90s, before internet dating sites even existed, he went on 110 dates, most of them blind and so uninteresting, he thought about science experiments during them. “I wanted someone who was exactly like me, who thought like me,” said Mr. Sirota, 58. “I now know that would be easier, but incomplete.” When he met Cara London in 1991 at a crowded singles event aboard the Intrepid, the aircraft carrier docked in the Hudson River, he didn’t recognize himself in her at all. Mr. Sirota is meticulous, mathematical and alphabetizes everything; she was a “flighty artist,” she said, who was mystified by physics and had never alphabetized anything in her life. At the time, she lived in an Upper East Side apartment with a Westie named Rocky. He disliked dogs, and cats too. They had almost nothing in common but liked each other immediately. “Love is a force of nature a physicist can’t explain,” Mr. Sirota said. “You can’t apply logic to it.” Their wedding, which took place less than a year after they met, was highlighted in a Vows column on July 12, 1992. Now, more than 25 years later, they have not grown more alike, only more tolerant. “I don’t think there’s a day that goes by when we don’t view the world differently,” Ms. London, 56, said. They live in Flemington, N.J., in a house overflowing with her oil paintings and pastel drawings; Mr. Sirota has numbered and cataloged each piece. When their two children — Julia Sirota, 22, and Craig Sirota, 20 — were growing up, Ms. London would sometimes turn the kitchen into an art studio and forget about making dinner. Mr. Sirota, who has been a research scientist at Exxon Research and Engineering (now ExxonMobil) in Annandale, N.J., for more than 30 years, would just order takeout for everyone. He is also the one who makes sure the fire extinguishers in the house are working. “He’s technical, and my abilities are much more hands-in-the-dirt kind of thing,” Ms. London said. “I’m the one bringing home the animals, adding more pets, much to his consternation. He’ll say, ‘What? This wasn’t what we planned!’” She added, “We have things we don’t see eye to eye on but there’s never been a doubt that overall, we are a team. I think marriage is constantly choosing to be a team. It’s a conscious decision — this is a priority. This is home base.” Over the years, Mr. Sirota has continued working on “Frankenstein,” now the official title of his musical. In fact, as Julia and Craig got older, it became a family project. While some families work on puzzles together, the Sirotas huddled around the piano, revising “Frankenstein.” “I needed to find Cara, get married and have children so they could help me with the lyrics,” Mr. Sirota said. “My daughter did a lot of the editing. She said, ‘You can’t have this verse, it’s heteronormative.’ I said, ‘What?’” At one point in the musical, an older couple warns a younger one about marriage. “All days won’t be so sunny,” they say, and, “His lips won’t always taste like honey.” Also: “Young bride, the man whose ring you wear will one day start to lose his hair.” After many years together, Mr. Sirota and Ms. London agreed, the real stuff somehow becomes the romantic stuff. “You grow to love the imperfections,” Mr. Sirota said. “In fact, the longer and longer you are in a marriage, the less you even want perfection.” The Sirotas are empty nesters now (“We can eat anything, anytime!” Ms. London said), and “Frankenstein” has found a larger audience. After a short break for the holidays, performances of “Frankenstein” resume Jan. 15 at St. Luke’s Theater on West 46th Street in New York and continue every Monday night. In recent years, Mr. Sirota said, their marriage has entered new territory. Each year seems to bring a strange mix of graduation ceremonies, opening nights, college acceptances and funerals, of “congratulations and condolences.” In 2011, Ms. London’s father died of brain cancer and last March, Mr. Sirota’s father died of Alzheimer’s disease. Toward the end of his life, he could not remember the names of his children but he could perfectly recall the lyrics to his favorite songs. Whenever Mr. Sirota and Ms. London visited him, they would all sing together. “With gusto,” Mr. Sirota said. After Mr. Sirota’s mother died in 2015, he found a stash of letters she had secretly written to him when he was a teenager. In one, she outlined — more like conjured, it turns out — the type of woman she hoped he would marry. “It described Cara,” he said, his voice cracking with emotion. “If she had to invent a daughter-in-law, it would have been Cara.”",The New York Times
2018,A Suitcase-Size Satellite’s Big Image of Frozen Earth Below,"Trilobites About two weeks ago, a satellite called Iceye-X1 hitched a ride into orbit aboard an Indian rocket. It’s about the size of a suitcase, and has already sent its first picture, constructed out of microwave radar reflections, back to Earth. “I personally love this image,” said Rafal Modrzewski, the chief executive of Iceye, a Finnish start-up that built and operates the satellite, referring to a scene from the Noatak National Preserve in Alaska. “It’s full of snow, but it’s so much more complex than you think at first.” The swath of the park visible in the first image is 1.2 gigabytes of data that encompasses an area about 50 miles long by 25 miles wide. It was made using a technology known as synthetic aperture radar, or SAR. The capability of Iceye-X1 is not by itself groundbreaking. Edward R. Caro, who worked for decades on spaceborne radar instruments at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said it is roughly comparable in performance to what he and his colleagues put on NASA’s 5,000-pound Seasat satellite early in his career. “It would be analogous what we were flying in 1978,” he said. But Iceye-X1, which weighs less than 220 pounds, takes advantage of the miniaturization of modern consumer electronics, largely using off-the-shelf components, and the cheaper rides to space now available. “I can’t praise them enough for what they’ve done,” said Mr. Caro, who provided some consulting to Mr. Modrzewski’s team. The price for the first satellite was in the “single digits in millions,” Mr. Modrzewski said. He said a more traditional radar satellite would cost a hundred times more. The SAR technique takes advantage of the fact that the instrument is moving over the surface of the planet. The echoes of multiple pulses are combined to achieve what would be observed by one pulse from a larger radar antenna. “That’s the whole trick with synthetic aperture,” Mr. Caro said. “It’s kind of fooling Mother Nature.” Mr. Caro also worked on a succession of more capable instruments that flew on the space shuttle. The radar, penetrating several feet below the surface, proved a boon for archaeologists, identifying unseen ruins in the Sahara and along the ancient Silk Road route in Asia. By using pulses of several wavelengths, a radar that flew on the shuttle in the 1990s provided a more detailed picture of terrain below. Short-wavelength pulses would bounce off the top of trees, for example, while longer wavelength radar would map out the terrain of the ground. A middle wavelength gave a measure of the biological material from the ground to the treetops. Plugged into the shuttle’s power system, the radar could make continuous measurements, mapping 90 percent of Earth’s surface in just 10 days. Iceye-X1 has limitations. The satellite’s instrument can take only two snapshots every hour and a half; it spends the rest of the time recharging its batteries. It also sends just one wavelength of radar pulses. On the other hand, shuttle flights at the time cost hundreds of millions of dollars each and lasted a couple of weeks at most. Mr. Caro’s radars spent most of the time on the ground, turned off. Development took years, and proposals to NASA to send another radar satellite into orbit never came to fruition. Mr. Modrzewski said his company is already developing more capable successors — each one is designed to last only about three years — and a constellation of small satellites could provide world coverage. The next version of the satellite will more than double the ground resolution, Mr. Modrzewski said. But the single satellite now in orbit could provide valuable information on sea ice, even at night or when the region is obscured by clouds. “If you’re on an icebreaker and you wanted to know the best way to navigate, a SAR image can really help you with that,” Mr. Caro said. The dream of a bigger, more advanced synthetic aperture radar mission also continues with Nisar, a collaboration between NASA and India’s space agency. “All the bells and whistles you can imagine,” said Mr. Caro, who is participating in the design review. But that mission may not launch until 2021.",The New York Times
2018,A Swiss Banker Helped Americans Dodge Taxes. Was It a Crime?,"Stefan Buck created bank accounts for dozens of Americans hiding money from tax collectors. The U.S. tried to hold him personally accountable. “We really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct,” said Stefan Buck.CreditCreditClaudio Bader for The New York Times Diane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors. One bank after another turned her down on that afternoon in 2009. They were worried about a United States crackdown on tax evasion and were no longer willing to shelter American money. Finally, across the street from a city park, up a discreet elevator, seated in a luxurious conference room, Ms. Butrus found a banker ready to help. His name was Stefan Buck. Mr. Buck said that his employer, Bank Frey, would be happy to take Ms. Butrus’s money, according to court documents and interviews with Mr. Buck and Ms. Butrus. He instructed her to wire the $1.5 million to Bank Frey. He told her that her name wouldn’t be attached to the new account. It would be known internally as Cardinal, an alias she chose in a nod to her favorite baseball team. After that, Ms. Butrus contacted Mr. Buck via prepaid cellphones she picked up at a Walgreens drugstore. Every six months or so, she flew to Zurich to withdraw money directly from Mr. Buck. She would return to the United States secretly carrying just under $10,000 in cash — the cutoff for having to make a customs declaration. The setup allowed Ms. Butrus to avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes. And it wouldn’t have been possible without Mr. Buck and Bank Frey. As much as chocolate and watches, Switzerland is known for bank secrecy. That made the country a destination for money that the wealthy wanted to hide. Last decade, it also made Swiss banks targets for an assault by the United States government, which was tired of Americans escaping taxes on money in offshore accounts. Many banks came clean, divulging their clients to American authorities. Many Americans, including Ms. Butrus, searched for new places to park their money. Bank Frey was among the very few to defy the legal onslaught. And Mr. Buck, a clean-cut and self-confident 28-year-old at the time he met Ms. Butrus, was the bank’s public face, responsible for landing and then managing American accounts. That put Mr. Buck in the government’s cross hairs. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted him for conspiring to help Americans avoid taxes. It seemed like another blow against Swiss bank secrecy. But things didn’t go as prosecutors had planned — and the chain of events could have big consequences for America’s fight to keep people from evading taxes using offshore bank accounts. Mr. Buck was raised in Germany. His parents had been championship ice dancers; his mother competed in figure skating for Switzerland in the 1972 Olympics in Japan. His father ran an insurance company, and Mr. Buck figured that one day he would take it over. But an acquaintance from business school offered him a job in early 2007 at Bank Frey. The bank was tiny, with about 20 employees. Mr. Buck shared an office with four people, including the bank’s receptionist. “We all got along well,” he said. The business revolved around clients that the bank’s founder, Markus Frey, had accumulated over the years, according to Mr. Buck and the court testimony of another former bank employee. At first, there wasn’t a focus on Americans. Then, in 2008, a legal earthquake shook the foundations of Swiss banking. American prosecutors started filing criminal charges against bankers and executives who had set up accounts for Americans. In 2009, UBS, the huge Swiss bank, admitted helping Americans hide money from the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to provide authorities with the names of its tax-dodging clients. Soon Swiss banks were expelling American clients. Not Bank Frey. It didn’t have offices in the United States, and executives didn’t see it as their responsibility to police whether their clients were paying taxes. “We decided there’s no reason not to maintain business with American clients,” Mr. Buck said in an interview. Executives consulted with legal experts to ensure they weren’t crossing any lines. “We really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct.” Opening accounts for desperate Americans seemed like a golden opportunity. “The positioning of Bank Frey as a solely Swiss private bank is now considered as a competitive advantage by the market,” the bank’s chief executive, Gregor Bienz, said at a board meeting in late 2008, according to records of the meeting. Mr. Bienz didn’t respond to requests for comment. Over the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars in American deposits flowed from Swiss banking stalwarts — institutions like Credit Suisse and Julius Baer — to Bank Frey. Its number of American clients roughly tripled, according to court records. By September 2012, nearly half of the bank’s $2.1 billion in assets was held on behalf of American taxpayers. Ms. Butrus was one of them. C. Richard Lucy, a former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America executive in New York, was another. In late 2009, Mr. Lucy’s contact at Julius Baer, where he’d had an account for many years, told him he had to move it elsewhere. Mr. Lucy traveled to Zurich and met with about 15 banks. None would take his money, according to his court testimony. There was one exception. “A couple of times the name Bank Frey came up as a bank that was new and aggressively seeking out accounts,” he testified. (He didn’t respond to requests for comment.) Sure enough, when Mr. Lucy showed up at Bank Frey’s offices, Mr. Buck said he would open him an account. Mr. Lucy was impressed by Mr. Buck’s assurances that his bank had nothing to worry about in the American tax-evasion investigations. “I had found what I was looking for,” Mr. Lucy said. Mr. Lucy said that Mr. Buck arranged for him to get a Matterhorn-emblazoned debit card that didn’t have Bank Frey’s or Mr. Lucy’s names on it. Mr. Lucy was told that, when he needed money, he should call Bank Frey and ask them to load money onto the debit card. He could use it at any ATM. Mr. Lucy wanted to bring some account documentation back to New York. He said Mr. Buck advised him not to take anything with Bank Frey’s name on it. (Mr. Buck denies giving that advice.) Mr. Lucy took a pair of scissors and snipped Bank Frey’s name and logo off the paperwork. Back in Manhattan, Mr. Lucy bought a prepaid phone card for his calls to Zurich. He made them from a pay phone outside his apartment building. When that phone was damaged, the only other functioning pay phone he could find nearby was inside the kitchen of a boutique hotel. Surrounded by the kitchen’s hubbub, he chatted on the phone with his Swiss banker. By the turn of the decade, other Swiss banks were booting their American customers — and handing them glossy Bank Frey brochures on the way out the door. Mr. Buck, who eventually rose to be Bank Frey’s head of private banking, said he felt he wasn’t doing anything wrong. All the same, he warned one client, Christine Warsaw, against sending banking instructions through the United States Postal Service, she said in court. “No USPS, use fax,” she wrote in a note to herself. Mr. Buck said he didn’t tell her not to send materials through the mail. By 2011, it was dangerous for Americans to keep their money in undeclared offshore accounts. More banks were handing over client lists to the Justice Department. If you showed up on a list, prosecutors might pursue you. A safer option was to turn yourself in to the I.R.S. through a voluntary self-disclosure program. It allowed taxpayers to pay back taxes, cooperate with investigators and move on with their lives. Ms. Butrus closed her Bank Frey account and eventually declared the money to the I.R.S. She paid her taxes and a stiff penalty and pledged to help the I.R.S. and prosecutors. Mr. Lucy did, too. On disclosure forms, both identified Mr. Buck as their relationship manager. Prosecutors were hunting for bankers to hold accountable. The theory was that bankers knew they were enabling Americans to break the law and therefore were part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Prosecutors turned to people including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. By 2013, more than 20 employees of Swiss financial institutions had been criminally charged. At least a dozen pleaded guilty and received a fine, probation or both. Several hunkered down in Switzerland, which refused to extradite its citizens to the United States for actions that weren’t illegal in Switzerland. None had actually gone on trial. At 5 o’clock one morning in April 2013, Mr. Buck was awakened by a phone call. Bank Frey’s chief executive was on the line. “Go look at Bloomberg,” Mr. Buck recalls him saying, referring to the business-news service. “I’m sleeping,” Mr. Buck said he replied. “Do it now,” his boss ordered. Mr. Buck pulled out his cellphone. There it was: an article saying he had been indicted. Terrified, Mr. Buck skimmed the indictment. The indictment made clear that his former clients were assisting the government. “It was surreal,” Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck, 32 years old at the time and single, went to work to hand in his I.D. card and cellphone. He was placed on paid leave; the bank would cover his legal expenses. Then Mr. Buck headed to his sister’s house. It was her husband’s birthday, and they were hosting a barbecue. His sister, Sylvia Muther, was nearly nine months pregnant. “We were scared he’d go to jail,” she said. “We tried not to think about that.” “I got hammered,” Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck spent months weighing his options. He could plead guilty and be done with it. He could spend the rest of his life in Switzerland, which wouldn’t extradite him. Or he could fight the charges. That third road was perilous. If Mr. Buck won at trial, he would be free — and the Justice Department’s fight against bankers who enable tax evasion would be dealt a serious blow. If he lost, he was looking at up to five years in prison. In October 2014, one of UBS’s top executives, Raoul Weil, went on trial in Florida. Federal prosecutors accused him of helping clients hide billions. Mr. Weil’s lawyers argued he had no knowledge of or responsibility for what had happened. The jury deliberated for barely an hour before acquitting him. The same week, a Los Angeles jury acquitted an Israeli banker who faced similar accusations. The Americans’ pursuit of foreign bankers no longer looked invincible. A few months later, on a cloudy morning in January 2015, Mr. Buck was skiing with friends in the Swiss Alps. Above the tree line, they started their descent. A sign on the slope marked the boundary between France and Switzerland. Mr. Buck realized he was crossing an international border — and that meant he theoretically could be picked up on an American arrest warrant in France. “I was scared,” Mr. Buck said. He told his friends to continue without him. He snapped off his skis, trudged back up the slope and skied down the Swiss side of the mountain. Mr. Buck realized he couldn’t spend the rest of his life fearful of crossing a border. “There was no way I was just going to stay in Switzerland,” he said. Mr. Buck told his lawyer, Marc A. Agnifilo, that he wanted his day in court. On Nov. 9, 2016, Mr. Buck boarded a flight to New York. He had spent the previous two nights too scared to sleep. Mr. Agnifilo had negotiated with Manhattan prosecutors to let Mr. Buck out on bail once he arrived. The catch was that he would have to stay in the United States, with his passport confiscated, until his trial. “Do you have any idea when I’m going to come back?” he asked Mr. Agnifilo. “No,” his lawyer responded. “Hopefully you don’t have a cat you need to feed.” An I.R.S. agent collected Mr. Buck as he exited the plane in New York. He was fingerprinted, photographed, shackled and driven to a prison next to the Brooklyn Bridge. He spent the night with a cellmate whose hedge fund had been raided that morning by agents with machine guns. The next day, Mr. Buck pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. He moved into an Upper East Side apartment, paid for by Bank Frey, which by then had ceased operations, its business model seemingly up in smoke. It would be months before his trial was scheduled. Mr. Buck made the most of the free time. He trained in Central Park for the New York City Marathon. He became a Yankees fan. For New Year’s, he went to Miami with friends. Since he had no I.D., he couldn’t fly; instead he spent 33 hours on a Greyhound. “He sees it all as an adventure,” Mr. Agnifilo said. He spent much of his time in Mr. Agnifilo’s 26th-floor law offices, helping his lawyers translate German-language documents. The crux of the defense was that the responsibility to pay taxes and declare income did not rest with Mr. Buck. It was his clients who had decided not to pay taxes. He was under no obligation to tattle; in fact, he was prohibited from doing so by Swiss bank-secrecy laws. Trial preparations dragged on, partly because Mr. Agnifilo also was representing Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who eventually would be convicted of fraud. Mr. Buck had heard of Mr. Shkreli. He hadn’t realized they would be sharing a lawyer. Mr. Agnifilo and Mr. Buck both recall shouting matches over whether the lawyer was sufficiently devoted to his client’s case. Mr. Buck’s trial started in October. Prosecutors branded him as a crucial cog in an international tax-evasion scheme. Mr. Agnifilo decided that Mr. Buck shouldn’t testify. While the defendant was confident of his innocence, the cross-examination promised to be brutal. And Mr. Buck’s English was imperfect. Jurors heard from a parade of Mr. Buck’s former clients, including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. They testified that Mr. Buck and Bank Frey had been instrumental in allowing them to dodge taxes. “We didn’t want anyone, specifically the I.R.S., to find out we had an account at the time,” Ms. Butrus testified. Prosecutors said all the secrecy — the nameless debit cards, the scissored bank paperwork, the shadowy phone calls — showed Mr. Buck knew what he was doing was wrong. “These are techniques used by a person who is trying to keep from getting caught, not by a person who thinks he’s operating legally,” said Sarah E. Paul, an assistant United States attorney, near the end of the trial. Then it was Mr. Agnifilo’s turn. “At the center of the crime scene, there is an American with a pen,” he intoned. “Stefan Buck has nothing whatsoever, nothing whatsoever, to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes” to not declare offshore assets. Mr. Agnifilo said the fact that Mr. Buck came to America, rather than staying in Switzerland, confirmed that he had nothing to hide. “Let Mr. Buck go back to Switzerland,” he finished. It was a moving performance. “I’m close to crying the first time in 25 years,” Mr. Buck wrote on a Post-it note he handed his lawyers. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff, also was impressed. “I knew you were a powerful orator,” he told Mr. Agnifilo after the jury left, “but you have exceeded all bounds.” The jury deliberated for a little more than a day. On Nov. 21, Mr. Buck was sitting on a toilet in the courthouse bathroom when the verdict came in. He hustled to the courtroom. A pair of United States Marshals hovered at the back. “Are they here for me?” Mr. Buck recalled asking his lawyer. No, Mr. Agnifilo fibbed. He knew the marshals were there to take Mr. Buck into custody if he was found guilty. The jury filed in and delivered the verdict: not guilty. Afterward, Mr. Buck spoke to the jurors in the hallway — the first time they had heard his voice. “Happy Thanksgiving,” he told them. Mr. Buck’s acquittal reverberated through the legal community. The Justice Department had now lost the three cases it had tried against foreign bankers who helped Americans avoid taxes. Dozens more cases are pending. Those who represent accused Swiss bankers say they expect Mr. Buck’s verdict to embolden defendants and to cause prosecutors to think twice before bringing new charges. “It should change their calculus,” said Marc S. Harris, a lawyer at Scheper Kim & Harris, who successfully defended the Israeli banker in 2014. He said the cases represented a “misguided effort” by the Justice Department to respond to political pressure to prosecute bankers. In early December, Mr. Buck’s family and friends greeted him at the Zurich airport with a giant welcome-home poster. His priority was to get to the Alps for peak ski season. “The timing of my return is perfect,” he said. He hopes to get back to work soon in the Swiss finance industry.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | A Syria Plan That Breaks the Law,"Op-Ed Contributors WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently announced that American troops will remain in Syria even after the fight against the Islamic State has ended. If the administration carries through on this promise, it will commit the American people to an indefinite conflict that could bring our troops into direct confrontation with the armed forces of Syria and its closest allies, Iran and Russia. In the process, it will break just about every relevant law on the books. As repulsive as the regime of President Bashar al-Assad is, an American-backed attempt to prevent it from re-establishing control over Syrian territory, as Secretary Tillerson indicated, would embroil the United States in a new prolonged, bloody and increasingly complicated conflict. Indeed, Turkey’s cross-border air and ground assaults in recent days on Afrin, a northern Syrian enclave held by American-supported Kurdish militias, demonstrate how fragile the situation is. To be sure, any course of action in Syria risks dire and deadly consequences. Nearly half a million people have died since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The horrors of the violence there defy description, and the role and intent of Russian and Iranian forces backing Mr. Assad remain of deep concern. Yet even though the consequences of bringing American troops home after the defeat of the Islamic State in Syria are uncertain, far more dangerous are the consequences of remaining indefinitely. Yes, the United States has a role to play in holding Mr. Assad accountable for the crimes he has committed against his own people and preventing him from committing more. But the president doesn’t have the power to unilaterally make the decision to commit American troops to stop Mr. Assad by force. He needs to make his case to Congress and the American people, as well as the international community. Inserting American troops into this situation on his own is not just bad policy, it is illegal under both the Constitution and international law. Start with the Constitution. The founders created a system in which the power to declare war rests with Congress, not the president. The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war. The president must then terminate the use of armed forces within 60 days (with 30 days for withdrawal) unless Congress has declared war or otherwise authorized the use of military force. The Trump foreign policy team has made clear that it does not think it must abide by any of these rules, and the new commitment announced by Secretary Tillerson shows that it is ready to break them. Clearly and lamentably, the president is prepared to flout constitutional limits on his authority to commit our troops on his own. The Trump administration might argue that the troops are already in Syria, so keeping them there isn’t “introducing them.” But that would make a mockery of the statute. The Obama administration explained in 2015 that the authorizations for the use of military force that Congress agreed to in 2001 and 2002 provided the legal basis for operations against the Islamic State because they were broadly aimed at terrorism as a threat. That justification was tenuous, but surely nothing in the statutes could plausibly be said to extend to an American military presence in Syria after the Islamic State has been credibly debilitated. We’re not the first ones to point out such concerns. Senators Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, and Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, have worked for years to draw attention to the absence of legal authorization for military operations in the Middle East. And Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear at a recent committee hearing that if the United States were to remain in Syria to fight Iranian proxies, “the authorizations are not there for that kind of activity.” If the constitutional violations weren’t troubling enough, the announced plan would also put the United States in direct violation of international law. The American operations against the Islamic State and Qaeda elements in Syria were made in the defense of the United States and its allies, particularly Iraq. This was the basis for the American explanation to the United Nations of its military operations in Syria, provided by Ambassador Samantha Power on Sept. 23, 2014. That explanation was reiterated in a letter to Congress from Secretary Tillerson last fall. Some critics have said this use of the self-defense exception is overbroad. But even if that argument was plausible before, the indefinite commitment of United States troops to hold territory in Syria cannot be defended on similar grounds. Stabilizing the territory taken from the Islamic State is undoubtedly essential to ensuring terrorist threats do not re-emerge, and that must be a priority for the United States. But as the threat from the Islamic State diminishes and the Syrian conflict returns to a battle over whether Mr. Assad will regain full control over land held by rebels who are divided among themselves, it is no longer possible to argue that the mission is one of self-defense. If the president were to order American troops to hold Syrian territory in those circumstances, he would be ordering them to act in clear violation of the United Nations Charter. In so clearly breaking international law, we would not just put our troops in harm’s way; we would also be licensing malevolent leaders the world over to follow in our footsteps. And we would be doing so when the world’s approval of American leadership has dropped to a new low — down to 30 percent from 48 percent just a year earlier. This course of action would significantly undermine America’s hard-earned global leadership as a champion of law-bound international action, perhaps irreparably. For several decades now, Congress has gradually ceded its war authority to the executive branch. If it does not act now, it may lose what authority remains. Congress has to attend to its constitutional duties: Our troops and their families deserve a public debate over the precise scope of their mission if we’re asking them to put their lives on the line. Congress must tell the president he cannot engage our troops in an illegal war in Syria. To allow this blatantly illegal action would spell the end of congressional authority over war. And it would offer incontrovertible evidence that the United States under President Trump is no longer a champion of the world order, but is ready and willing to tear it down.",The New York Times
2018,A Teenager’s Basketball Dream Is Size XXXXXL,"GENEVA, Ohio — When strangers approach Robert Bobroczkyi, as they often do, the first question is almost always, “How tall are you?” Lately, he has been responding with typical teenage snark. “Five-eleven,” he might say, making up a figure nearly two feet off the real answer. Forgive him. Though his voice rumbles forth like boulders down a mountain, and each of his hands is the size of an iPad, and he could gaze down upon the crown of the head of any N.B.A. player today, Bobroczkyi, 17, still has the deprecating wit and trademark eye roll of a sophomore in high school. Because that is what he is. He likes horror movies, science-fiction novels, “old-school” music and NBA 2K. He sleeps wherever and whenever possible. He taught himself to play the piano from YouTube clips. In English class, he was asked to give a presentation about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It helped, he joked, that he had seen the Indiana Jones movies. And then he steps on a basketball court, where he can reject 3-point attempts from just outside the lane. He doesn’t need to be anywhere near the ball to be an intimidating factor. All he needs is to grab the rim, with both hands, while standing flat-footed. This is life at 7 feet 7 inches, with the world at your size 17 feet. If Bobroczkyi entered the N.B.A. tomorrow, he would join his Romanian countryman Gheorghe Muresan and Muresan’s contemporary Manute Bol, who also played at 7-7, as the tallest men to play in the league. But unlike the hulking Muresan and the shot-blocking Bol, Bobroczkyi is modeling his far-from-developed game off that of Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis, who at 7-3 has redefined how a player of that length can handle the nimbleness and fluidity of the modern game. Bobroczkyi is also learning that the one thing no coach can teach — height — will not guarantee him a future in pro basketball. He developed scoliosis at a young age, which gives him lower-back trouble, and though he has stopped growing, his hips have been left misaligned by several inches. And then there is his weight. Eating enough to fuel his eight-foot wingspan and gain the muscle needed to sustain a career is a daily ordeal. That is one reason he left Europe to come here to the Spire Institute, a 750,000-square-foot facility on 170 acres in the solitude of Ohio wine country. Aside from the basketball court, with floorboards ripped from Quicken Loans Arena (where the N.B.A.’s Cleveland Cavaliers play), and the health-conscious cafeteria, Spire is also close to the Cleveland Clinic, which assigned a dietitian to assist with Bobroczkyi’s nutrition. The goal is to get his weight, 195 pounds, to rise by a pound per month. Doing so requires consuming a diet of 4,500 calories per day. Bobroczkyi eats slowly, and sometimes uncomfortably. At his school, nearby Grand River Academy, the plastic chairs in the cafeteria are of normal height, which means his legs fold underneath his seat, his ankles lying flat against the floor. Eating a bowl of miso soup this week meant lifting the bowl to his lips; for the liquid to travel all the way up there by spoon would be a long and shaky journey. Bobroczkyi said the day he met Porzingis, while visiting a basketball academy in Seville, Spain, was the first time in a long while that he stood eye-to-eye with somebody other than his father. Porzingis was 7-foot-1 at the time. Bobroczkyi was 14. Bobroczkyi was always tall, even when he was little. He passed six feet before his ninth birthday. He dunked at age 12. His father, Zsigmond, is 7-1, and his mother, Brunhilde, a former volleyball player, is 6-1. Still, their boy’s size raised concerns. At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors ruled out Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition of the connective tissue that can lead to life-threatening heart trouble. Other tests over the years eliminated other, potentially worrisome, conditions. “We made all kinds of tests through the years to ensure everything was all right,” the father wrote in an email. “We made them everywhere, every year, once including Rome, Seville, Washington, Vitoria, Budapest. Everything was fine.” In Bobroczkyi’s hometown, Arad, in western Romania, he was known mostly because of his father, who had played professionally with the Romanian clubs Elba Timisoara and West Petrom Arad, and even with Muresan on Romania’s national team, forming what might have been the world’s tallest frontcourt at the time. But he began to garner attention when, in middle school, he surpassed his father’s height. He went to Italy to play for an amateur club, A.S. Stella Azzurra, but took a year off from basketball to work on his frame, which was struggling to support his long limbs. Around that time, Bob Bossman, director of the basketball program at Spire, discovered a YouTube video of Bobroczkyi coolly knocking down 3-pointers and making passes. “I saw he has potential,” Bossman said. “You don’t get to work with a kid like that often.” Bossman reached out to Bobroczkyi on Facebook. The conversation began: Bossman told him about the facilities, the chance to play on a team with some of the nation’s top recruits, to attend a small boarding school down the road, to practice at an Olympic training site. When Bobroczkyi and his family visited the campus in 2016, he packed a bag and did not return to Italy. He first lived in a dorm at Grand River, a 187-year-old preparatory academy with 80 students. School officials brought in an eight-foot bed for his room and custom desks in his classrooms. He has since moved into a house with his basketball teammates at Spire; the bed could not fit in the door there, he said, so Bobroczkyi props two suitcases at the end of his twin with a pillow on top to support his feet. “You have to get used to it,” he said of his height, a sizable understatement given the challenges that come with it. Doorways are perpetually too low. Pants need to be custom-ordered. Shirts are XXXXXL. His team once flew him to Hartford for a game, but forgot to reserve a seat for him in an exit row. “Never flying again, Coach,” Bobroczkyi told Bossman when he landed. On the bus ride back to Ohio, he sat in the back row, his legs splayed out down the aisle. “Yes, Rob! Thirties! You’re on them!” The voice of Brandon Strausser, the strength and conditioning coach at Spire, echoed around the cavernous performance center. Bobroczkyi lay on a bench with 30-pound dumbbells on either side of him, ready for his first rep of 10 presses. Strausser and John Wallace, Spire’s performance director, had tailored a workout plan for Bobroczkyi that was like nothing they had ever attempted. It was arguable that nobody had created anything like it. After all, whose body could compare? Porzingis was 6-9 at age 17. Muresan did not reach his playing height until age 20. Bobroczkyi even has a couple inches on the former N.B.A. center Shawn Bradley, who was 7-5 in high school. His experience then, navigating the harsh and bewildering climb to maturity, is truly singular. He cannot fade into the background of his high school hallways, much as he might want to try. In his algebra class, the teacher Matthew Pavlovic asked students to pair up for an assignment — a difficulty for Bobroczkyi, whose elevated desk is set off slightly from the others. He shuffled it across the room with loud screeches. His father used to tell him that his height could be a blessing or a curse. It was up to him to decide. But asked if he would like to grow any taller, Bobroczkyi shook his head. “I’m done,” he said. “I think I grew enough.” When Bobroczkyi arrived in Ohio, his flexibility was, Strausser said, “rough.” His lower back was hurting. Walking could look laborious. He moved adequately on the court, but only in short bursts. “He’s not slow,” Bossman said. “It’s just about how many times he can get up and down in a matter of a game or a few minutes.” So while teammates were doing squats and charting their records in the bench press on a blackboard above the entrance, Bobroczkyi lay on the turf, spread his arms, bent his knees and twisted his torso, meticulously cycling through a 40-minute routine of stretches. His weight lifting program is mostly body resistance, using bands and straps, but when he finally got onto the bench, under those 30-pound weights, Strausser was delighted. He held a spreadsheet in front of him with almost 50 different exercises designed for Bobroczkyi. “As much as we can of each movement, in every single movement category that we can think of, is literally on here,” Strausser said. “Because he needs it.” It was a big deal at Spire when, in a practice not too long ago, Bobroczkyi dunked. This might sound like celebrating a sunrise. But it was a sign that his confidence was growing. “I mean, I like when I do it, but I also find that I still don’t have enough to push guys around the rim to dunk on them,” he said. “That’s a big part of it. But once I start to gain some pounds, that should start to happen more often.” At a recent practice, Bobroczkyi ambled around the sideline, spinning a basketball on his finger and dribbling it through his flagpole legs. He was relegated to being mostly an observer as his teammates raced up and down the court in fast-break drills and three-man weaves. He had played 12 minutes of game action over the weekend, the coach, Dave Briski, explained, and he needed time to recover. “Hopefully by next year he can play some major minutes,” Briski said. “If we can get 10, 15 minutes a game out of him next year, I think that’s a lot.” Before Bobroczkyi can entertain the thought of becoming the next Porzingis, or even of earning a scholarship to a Division I college, he needs time to adjust to the speed of the American game. Bossman and others contend that his time on the court is productive, but limited. “He’s so skilled for his height,” his teammate Julian Dancy said. “I’ve never seen a guy that can shoot 3s like him, especially the college 3 already.” After dinner one night this week — breaded chicken, turkey tetrazzini, green beans and two helpings of rice pudding — Bobroczkyi rode the shuttle with his teammates to the house they share near campus, then sat on his bed. Below posters of Porzingis and Dirk Nowitzki, his face lit up when he heard the news that Porzingis had been named to the N.B.A. All-Star team. He had been too shy, he admitted, to say anything the first time they met. But now, he said, he would relish another chance. What would he ask? He paused to think. “I’d like to ask him what advice he would give me,” Bobroczkyi said, finally. “About anything. Life, basketball, everything.” His voice trailed off. He nodded, said “yeah,” and went back to folding his laundry for the next day.
