2018,Frick’s Expansion Is Approved by Landmarks Preservation Board,"In a major victory for the Frick Collection, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on Tuesday approved the museum’s latest plan to expand and renovate its 1914 Gilded Age mansion — the institution’s fourth such attempt to gain more space for its exhibitions and public programs. “They recognized the strength of the plan to upgrade the building to ensure the long term vibrancy of the Frick,” said Ian Wardropper, the Frick’s director. “The public process can be painful, but we listened and I think the project is better because of that.” The commission voted 6 to 1 (with one abstention) after the Frick had presented a revised proposal in response to concerns raised by commissioners at a public hearing in May. Some critics were disappointed by Tuesday’s vote. Theodore Grunewald, a preservationist, called it “a vote for blandness.” Others called it progress. Peg Breen, the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, which opposed the Frick’s previous proposal in 2015, called the Frick’s revised plan — by Annabelle Selldorf in collaboration with the architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle — “a very respectful addition.” “They listened to a lot of people and delivered a plan that deserves support,” she added, citing in particular the museum’s decision to restore and feature the original gated garden on East 70th Street. The Frick’s presentation on Tuesday pushed back the addition to allow for additional greenery behind the garden’s north wall. Designed by Russell Page, the garden had become a flashpoint, since the Frick’s previous plan called for replacing it with a six-story addition that would connect the museum to its art reference library on East 71st Street. An outcry from architects, preservationists and critics helped defeat that proposal in June 2015, sending the Frick back to the drawing board. The most recent iteration instead highlights views of the garden from a renovated lobby; creates a new second level above the reception hall; and adds a new education center, cafe and expanded museum shop. Despite the setbacks along the way, the Frick persevered in its efforts to make more room in the Fifth Avenue landmark mansion, designed by the firm Carrère and Hastings for the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. The collection of about 1,400 paintings, sculptures, works on paper and decorative arts — including works by Rembrandt, Goya, Vermeer and Renoir — has more than doubled since the Frick opened in 1935. The Frick’s music room will become a special exhibitions gallery, immediately adjacent to the permanent galleries and within the original square footprint, reusing the existing doorways with original wood trim and wood floors. A 220-seat underground auditorium, the Frick argued, would better serve its educational and public programs than the current music room. Some advocates unsuccessfully tried to get the Landmarks Commission to postpone Tuesday’s vote to consider an interior landmark designation for the Frick that would preserve the music room, designed by John Russell Pope. “The Music Room offers something completely unique and irreplaceable in New York City — the opportunity to hear chamber music and piano recitals in the intimate confines of the Frick mansion,” said Michael Gotkin, a preservation advocate. “When you hear a concert at the Music Room, you feel like a privileged guest at a private performance in a grand home.” The Frick project will now continue through the public process and is expected to break ground in early 2020, and to be completed in 2022.

2018,Opinion | Friday Night Music: Chvrches (Self-indulgent! Not a Column!),"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist OK, this time I really am going to revive Friday Night Music. Regular readers know that back when my blog was clearly distinct from the column, I kicked back almost every Friday by featuring a video performance by a band I liked. But I let the practice slide for a variety of reasons. One reason was a change in format that makes blog posts digitally indistinguishable from regular columns headed for the physical paper. Even though I try to signal the difference with warnings like “wonkish”, I know that many readers still don’t understand that there’s a difference between stuff I write to deadline on Mondays and Thursdays and stuff I post when the mood strikes; I get complaints about “wasting space” even when no trees were killed in the making of a post that’s technical, self-indulgent, or both. And to be fair, some of my off-schedule pieces – even fairly technical expositions — do end up being featured on the home page and even getting a lot of readers. Another reason was the political grimness of our times, which I have to admit put me out of the mood for music posts for a while. But I still find great comfort in music, maybe even especially in these times, and my mid-60s wannabe hipster tastes are still expanding. So I’ll try to share a few of the bands I’m listening to these days, beginning with Chvrches. (The “v” was to make them findable in Google searches!) Now, I know I’m very behind the curve here – this band got big years ago. Also, in principle I should dislike the idea of a synth-driven band with two guys doing the instrumentals while a pretty young woman does the singing. But they really are indie, not some commercial creation, and both the sound and the lyrics, especially on the early stuff, have something elliptical, off-center, and deeply affecting about them. Oh, and the Glaswegian accent is a joy to hear. So here’s a live performance of their biggest hit – apparently only the band’s second public appearance! OpinionKathleen O’Brien",The New York Times
2018,Frieze Fair Put a Price on High Heat. It Was Met With a Lawsuit.,"How much are a few beads of sweat worth? Frieze New York, the mega art fair that takes place annually on Randalls Island, has an answer. After announcing last month that it would offer compensation to galleries affected by a heat wave that caused extreme temperatures in the main tent structure during this year’s fair in May, Frieze has now specified how much it’s willing to pay: 10 percent of the cost of a booth, with a minimum of $1,000 for each gallery that requests compensation. The price of booths varies, with emerging galleries under 8 years old paying around $8,000 for a spot in the fair’s subsidized “Frame” section. The $1,000 minimum also applies to those galleries. In an email sent to galleries Thursday morning, executives including the fair’s director, Victoria Siddall, and artistic director, Loring Randolph, wrote: “We promised to give something back to you following Frieze New York and we are writing now to confirm that we are offering 10 percent of the booth fee to every gallery who was affected by the heat on the first two days of the fair.” In order to receive the refund, galleries must fill out a formal request, essentially opting in to receive the money. “We made a commitment during the fair to give something back to every exhibitor, and since then we have consulted a number of galleries, including those on our committee,” Ms. Siddall said in an email exchange Friday. “We are now following through on this promise.” For some galleries, the compensation isn’t enough. On Friday, Shane Campbell Gallery filed a lawsuit against Frieze Events, asserting that the fair had been negligent in not preparing for the heat. In the suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, the gallery is seeking full reimbursement for all fees associated with participation in the fair.",The New York Times
2018,"From Ace Hotel, a New City and a New Brand","Q & A The executive Kelly Sawdon talks about the property set to open in Japan next year — and the Ace spinoff called Sister City. Making hotel lobbies socially magnetic and in-house restaurants and bars urban destinations has become the blueprint for a lot of boutique hotels. Arguably, Ace Hotel, the small hotel company founded in Seattle in 1999 by a trio of musically focused entrepreneurs, perfected that design. Its nine hotels — including locations in Chicago, London, Los Angeles and New Orleans — aim to distill the creative vibe of each city by hosting events featuring local musicians, artists, writers and filmmakers. This fall, the company plans a relatively restrained spinoff hotel in New York called Sister City and next year it will open an Ace in Kyoto, Japan designed by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma on former imperial palace grounds. Kelly Sawdon, a partner and the chief brand officer for Ace Hotel, has been with the group from the beginning. The following are excerpts from an interview with Ms. Sawdon on the direction of Ace. How will Sister City be different than Ace? Ace is about taking the city and the culture and bringing it within our walls. Sister City is a place that’s still encouraging people to go out and explore these cities, but it’s about having a place to come back to that’s quiet and calming. It allows the guests to engage with the community as they please and not be participating in it when they come back to their hotel. Why Kyoto for your second international hotel? Kyoto is the cultural center of Japan. It’s a place that a lot of people found inspiration and creative evolution from David Bowie to Yoko Ono and the Talking Heads. It’s always been one of those places that people go to and really find a different point of view or a different way to evolve their craft. For one, it’s just a beautiful creative city. And two, there’s just a lot happening there. Historically there’s a lot of crafts and arts and music coming out of Kyoto. I’m sure everyone expected us to go into Tokyo and for us it was, why not start with Kyoto, the cultural capital of Japan? This is your first project with a well-known architect. Why did you choose Kengo Kuma? He’s a kindred spirit in that he’s very thoughtful and his approach to architecture is in line with our point of view. Our point of view is about creating spaces that feel handcrafted, that really feel like the city that they’re in. Going into that country we want to still be ourselves but embrace Japanese culture. Kuma-san’s attention to detail and the way he uses a lot of natural materials and really celebrates those materials we feel is similar to our design approach. Ace started scrappy and now will have a star-chitect in the portfolio. What philosophy do the hotels share? The original philosophy is friends taking care of friends and how do we create a space for them. Every hotel we look at with a fresh lens. We look at the history of the city and find things that inspire us and people we can collaborate with. There’s no set formula. It all varies but the through line is focusing on making this hotel feel authentic in the city that it’s in and working with people there that are craftsmen or furniture makers or designers and engaging that creative community within each city so that spirit and that energy of that city authentically comes through. People are more mobile today and travel is growing. What role will hotels play in the lives of future travelers? Technology is really allowing people to be their own concierge or curator and people are looking for experiences more than ever these days. Hotels are ways to create those experiences and a way to encourage travel, to encourage people to come and understand the city and the culture of that community.",The New York Times
2018,From Brewery to Bakery: A Flour That Fights Waste,"For some people, beer is the perfect end to a workday. For Bertha Jimenez, it’s the start of a new way to eliminate food waste. Breweries throw out millions of pounds of used grain every day that could have other uses. While some is repurposed as animal feed, compostable products or heating fuel, little has been exploited for its value as food. But Ms. Jimenez, 35, has created a small start-up, Rise Products, that converts the grain into a flour that is finding its way into sustainable bakeries and kitchens in New York and as far away as Italy. The potential for recycling beer waste first came into the cross hairs of Ms. Jimenez, an immigrant from Ecuador, while she was working toward her doctorate in 2015 at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. Intent on finding ways to reduce industrial waste, she started a side project with like-minded friends — most of them also immigrants — and craft beer provided an easy target: Everyone loved it, but it had issues. Ms. Jimenez lives in Brooklyn, which at last count had 20 craft breweries that are tossing out grain. Ms. Jimenez and Ashwin Gopi, a classmate and a founder of Rise, began asking around for samples so they could figure out how best to reuse them. Mr. Gopi called Jeff Lyons, who was then the brewer at Greenpoint Beer & Ale Co. “They told me they were trying to reduce waste,” said Mr. Lyons, who quickly agreed to supply some grain — three Tupperware containers’ worth, all the students could carry. “The grain still has nutritional value, and all we were doing was throwing it out.” Brewing relies on grains, typically malted barley, which are first soaked in hot water. This step releases sugars that are crucial to the later production of alcohol. Once those sugars are released into the liquid, the grain is discarded. Knowing that barley was healthful, Mr. Gopi, Ms. Jimenez and a third founder, Jessica Aguirre, nibbled it plain. Spent grains look and taste like brown rice, without the heft. They stirred the stuff into porridge, and baked it into cookies and cakes. But when they took the dried grain to bakers to gauge their interest, they were met with shrugs. Finally, Peter Endriss, an owner of the Brooklyn bakery Runner & Stone, suggested they make flour. “It seemed like such a logical repurposing of spent beer grains,” he said. Today, the Rise Products team makes its flour in a commercial kitchen in Long Island City, Queens. The grains are dried in an oven, then ground, milled and sifted into a fine flour — all by hand, which is why it costs $8 a pound wholesale, and $16 retail. The price will drop, the partners say, when they raise more money, move to a bigger space and automate the process. But because of the growing interest in reducing waste, many chefs and bakers are already eager to work with what the team is calling its “Super Flour.” At Runner & Stone, Mr. Endriss makes a shortbread cookie with a half-and-half blend of Rise flour and all-purpose flour. Bien Cuit, another Brooklyn bakery, has created a chocolate, barley and dulce de leche poundcake with a streusel made of Rise flour. Sfoglini, a Brooklyn pasta maker, produces radiatori using a combination of durum semolina, rye and Rise flour. Another champion of recycling food waste is the Italian chef Massimo Bottura, whom Ms. Jimenez impulsively emailed in 2017 to see if he’d like a sample. He did, and later his staff asked for another 15 pounds. There is no word yet what they’ll do with it, but one day it may appear on the menu at Mr. Bottura’s restaurant Osteria Francescana, in Modena, Italy, which was recently awarded the top spot on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. The Rise partners say some big brands have also requested samples, including Kellogg’s, Whole Foods and contract manufacturers for Nestlé and its subsidiary DiGiorno Pizza. (Barilla, the Italian pasta maker, has invested in ReGrained, a small start-up in the Bay Area that is making granola bars with brewery leftovers and its own spent-grain flour.) Joel Gamoran, the national chef for Sur La Table stores, loved the scent of the Rise flour when he first opened a bag last summer. “It totally has this insane, nutty profile that you don’t get from flour,” he said. Mr. Gamoran talked with Rise about using it in his cooking classes, but until the price comes down, it’s just a conversation. As barley contains less gluten than wheat, it works better with foods that don’t need to rise much, like biscuits or bread, Mr. Gamoran used the Rise flour for biscotti, crisp shortbread and wafers, which he thought were “400 times better then anything I had put together” in the past. And because brewing removes sugars, Rise flour has one-third the carbohydrates of traditional all-purpose flour; because it’s made from barley, it has twice the protein and 12 times the fiber. Rise now uses about 1,200 pounds of grain a week, from several craft brewers in Brooklyn; it takes about four and a half pounds of grain to make one pound of flour. In order to grow, Rise applied to several business accelerators that could provide money and mentorship. In 2016, after Ms. Jimenez got her doctorate, Rise joined Food-X, an accelerator in New York City, and completed plans for a mechanical process that could speed flour production. The program connected them to a lawyer who helped them file a patent for the method in 2017. That same year, the team joined Laudato Si’ Challenge, a Rome accelerator focused on solving global problems like food waste, that was inspired by Pope Francis. In preparation for the final exhibition, Ms. Jimenez and Ms. Aguirre managed to make a cup of flour using a microwave at their Airbnb apartment in Rome. The two baked a loaf of banana bread and served it to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the Vatican’s point person at the presentation. He liked it. “It was a proud moment,” Ms. Aguirre said. This week, Rise will have a booth at the Specialty Food Association’s Fancy Food Show in New York, to gauge the interest of buyers from around the world. The team hopes to move beyond brewery waste. It can use byproducts from wineries or juice bars; anything with a moisture content of more than 70 percent will work. With infinite waste streams to be tapped, the founders — who hail from India, Lithuania, Korea and other nations — have their sights set beyond the United States. “In the long term, we can bring this to countries like ours,” Ms. Jimenez said. “We want to look at technologies that won’t be prohibitive for other people to have.” Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,"From Cairo to Kolkata, Traces of a Vibrant Jewish Past","Personal Journeys A largely vanished world can be rediscovered (though not easily) in cemeteries, synagogues and winding streets. I spotted the front gates of the graveyard one morning on my way to Arabic class in downtown Tunis. Squished into a crowded metro car, I couldn’t see clearly around the other passengers, but that Hebrew and Star of David were unmistakable. In the 15 years since then, I’ve visited at least a dozen other semi-abandoned synagogues and Jewish cemeteries across the world — in Egypt, Turkey, Morocco and India — but you never forget your first graveyard. A short walk from the Cité El Khadra metro station, the Borgel Cemetery is on the outskirts of downtown Tunis, sandwiched between the metro tracks and a light industrial area. On the day I went to investigate, the front gates were locked with a heavy chain and no one responded to my shouts. So I went around back and hoisted myself up the eight- or nine-foot brick wall that surrounded the graveyard. When I got to the top, I heard a commotion and saw a group of kids gathered in the alley below. “The Catholic cemetery is over there,” said one of the older boys. He pointed in the direction of a nearby graveyard, this one filled with crosses. “You are Catholic,” one of the others asked, “aren’t you?” I hesitated for a moment, then told them the truth. “My father is Catholic,” I said, “but my mother is Jewish.” They looked somewhat stunned by this admission. If they had been born 70 years earlier — when Jews made up 30 percent of the city’s population — they might have had Jewish neighbors and friends. They may have bought their produce from a Jewish grocer. Their mother might have worn jewelry made by a Jewish goldsmith. These days, however, there are only a few hundred Jews left in Tunis and they tend to keep to themselves. Aside from Israeli soldiers on Al Jazeera, most of these boys had probably never seen a Jew. There was a long silence before one of the older ones spoke up. “Honor your mother first,” he said and the rest of them agreed. Dropping down into the graveyard felt like stepping into a forgotten world. Over the next weeks, I would return, meet the cemetery’s watchman, and visit other, more well-tended sections. But on first glance, the graveyard looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The plots around me were overgrown and unkempt. Headstones had fallen over. A pack of white dogs appeared to be living in an old mausoleum. Walking around the cemetery, brushing off the headstones, I tried to imagine the lives of those interred around me: parents and children, husbands and wives, pharmacists, shopkeepers and engineers. Most of the people buried in the plots nearby had spent their entire lives in Tunis. They grew up in the old city or Nabeul or La Goulette. They went to school, fell in love, fought with their parents and drank coffee with friends on the Corniche in La Marsa. Of all this life, what remains? It isn’t difficult to find vestiges of Jewish life in Europe. Many of the largest and most important synagogues have been carefully restored. There are Jewish museums in Berlin and Prague. In Barcelona and Venice, the old Jewish ghettos have themselves become tourist attractions. Outside Europe, these remnants are more difficult to find, though not for a lack of history. For centuries, the intellectual and cultural center of Jewish life was in the capitals of the Middle East. Less than a hundred years ago, there were vibrant Jewish communities in Baghdad and Isfahan, Bukhara, Aden and Fez, cosmopolitan economic hubs where Jews lived alongside Muslims and Christians, Armenians, Berbers and Kurds. Today — aside from a few notable exceptions in Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco and Iran — these communities have vanished. Our collective memory of the Jewish past tends to focus mainly on Yiddish-speaking European Jews, the world that was destroyed by the Holocaust. But traces of a Jewish past can be found across the Middle East and North Africa, in Central and South Asia, as well as South America. It’s in synagogues and cemeteries, in the facades of old buildings, in language, food and the memories of those who left. You just need to know where to look. There are only a dozen or so Egyptian Jews left in Cairo. But these mostly elderly women are the last remnants of a thousand-year-old history. In medieval times, Cairo was home to one of the most important Jewish communities in the world. A rival to Baghdad and Jerusalem, the city attracted Jewish merchants, migrants and scholars, including the great philosopher Moses Maimonidies who once said of his adopted home: “In times gone by, when storms threatened us, we wandered from place to place; but by the mercy of God we have now been enabled to find a resting place in this city.” My introduction to the city’s Jewish past was 18 years ago, when a friend at the American University of Cairo invited me to Rosh Hashana services at the Sha’ar Hashamayim Synagogue, a hundred-year-old Art Nouveau structure in the heart of downtown. The congregants that night were mostly expats (students, embassy staff and the employees of various multinational corporations), but there was a small group of Egyptian Jews at the front of the hall and one could feel the presence of their forbearers in the empty space above us. In the years since, I’ve returned to Cairo a half-dozen times, most recently on a research trip for a novel centered around Sha’ar Hashamayim’s much older sibling, Ben Ezra. Tucked amid the winding streets of Old Cairo (also known as Fustat or Coptic Cairo), the squat and unassuming Ben Ezra Synagogue has been a center for Jewish life in the city since 1040. Rebuilt and refurbished a number of times over the past thousand years — most recently through the joint efforts of the Egyptian government and North American Jewish philanthropists — the synagogue was once home to the famous Cairo Geniza, a treasure trove of documents that revolutionized the study of the medieval Mediterranean world. According to legend, Ben Ezra was named after the prophet Ezra himself and the well in the courtyard is said to be the place where the infant Moses was drawn from the Nile. Apart from these two synagogues — and the recently renovated Maimonides Synagogue, where the philosopher prayed as a boy — Cairo’s most notable Jewish landmark is the Bassatine Cemetery. Established in the ninth century, when the Sultan Ibn Tulun decided to build his palace on the site of the former Jewish cemetery, Bassatine sits on an anonymous patch of land, far from the city center. According to the Lonely Planet guidebook, the cemetery is a few miles east of Maadi (an exclusive, leafy neighborhood where many Jews made their home in the late 19th century). The Bassatine News website, an online newsletter put out by Cairo’s Jewish community council, gives the cemetery’s exact longitude and latitude, which would have been useful if my phone had worked in Egypt. None of the cabdrivers I asked had ever heard of the place and the maps I brought with me didn’t even cover this part of the city. Eventually, after walking around the outskirts of Maadi for most of the afternoon, I came upon the cemetery, tucked into the bend of a freeway in the middle of a stone cutters’ district. As I surveyed the seemingly endless expanse of tiny workshops, men and boys cutting statues and paving stones for the villas of Cairo’s upper class, a small pickup truck drove past, the bed of which was filled with men covered in white dust. They looked at me like I was a ghost. “No entry,” said a man standing outside a nearby workshop. As with the cemetery in Tunis, the gates of Bassatine were locked with a heavy chain and the graveyard was surrounded by a wall, this one at least 12 feet high. It was too high to climb, but along the far side I spotted a makeshift earthen ramp. I was halfway up the ramp when someone started shouting at me from inside the graveyard. “It’s closed,” he said, “the cemetery is closed.” “I’m Jewish,” I shouted down. Although his face softened somewhat, he still wouldn’t let me in. “Talk to the rabbi,” he said, “you need an appointment.” When I got home that afternoon, I tried in vain to find the rabbi who would grant me permission to enter. But it didn’t really matter. There are traces of Cairo’s Jewish past scattered throughout the city. They’re in the facade of the old Les Grand Magasins Cicurel department store, one of the many formerly Jewish-owned stores downtown. They’re hidden in the tomb of Saad Zaghloul, the beloved Egyptian nationalist, whose Jewish ally helped write the country’s first constitution. They’re in the produce stands selling molokhia, that quintessentially Egyptian vegetable also known as Jew’s mallow. They’re on the street, in the bootleg DVDs of golden-age Egyptian movies from the 1930s and 40s, featuring Jewish actors and producers like Najima Ibrahim and Togo Mizrahi. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, Kolkata was home to a thriving Jewish community, many of them emigrants from Baghdad and Aleppo drawn to the capital of the British Raj. The community included actors, politicians, bankers and journalists, as well as the famous model and actress, Pramila, who was the first Miss India in 1947. With the end of British colonialism and World War II, most of the community moved abroad, leaving behind a smattering of synagogues, cemeteries and schools, as well as a small hospital and a number of streets named after Jews. I first heard about this history from a woman who happened to sit next to me on a flight from San Francisco to New York, whose distant relatives were caretakers of the city’s two most notable synagogues, Beth El and Magen David. This idea of a Muslim family looking after a synagogue after its congregants are gone stuck with me and was part of the inspiration behind my second novel, which revolves around a family of Muslim watchmen who guard the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. So, years later, when I visited Kolkata I asked a journalist friend about the watchmen, half expecting him to say it was all a legend. Not only was it true, he said, he had recently done a radio piece about the Jews of Kolkata. The synagogues were definitely worth a visit, he told me. “But first you have to try the challah at Nahoum and Sons.” One of the most visible remnants of Jewish life in Kolkata, the 116-year-old Nahoum and Sons bakery once supplied challah, hamentashens and other Jewish specialties to a community of 6,000. There aren’t many Jews left in Kolkata — as few as nine, according to the Jerusalem Post — but the shop’s current owner, Isaac Nahoum, continues to sell challah as well as a famous Christmas fruitcake, which the former the archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, said was the best fruitcake he had ever eaten. Once I had my provisions — well worth the trip — I turned my attentions to Burrabaazar, the neighborhood where the Beth El and Magen David Synagogues are. Even with directions from my friend and a map drawn by the manager of Nahoum and Sons, I spent the better part of the afternoon wandering around the neighborhood, asking people if they knew where I could find Synagogue Street. Eventually, an employee of a nearby sweet shop took pity and joined me in my search. Twenty minutes later, after a detour to the Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary (on Portuguese Church Street), we found ourselves looking up at the red and yellow arches of the Magen David Synagogue. “Jews used to live here?” the sweetmaker asked. “Yeah,” I said and half nodded, as if I wasn’t entirely sure myself. For the rest of the afternoon — walking around the synagogues, talking to their watchman, and listening to the story of their reconstruction — this question kept playing in my head. Jews used to live here? The sweetmaker had been working in the neighborhood for years and had no idea that there were two enormous synagogues around the corner. Just like I never would have known about Kolkata’s Jewish history if I hadn’t happened to sit next to that woman on the plane. Slowly over the course of the afternoon, the question became an affirmation. Jews used to live here. They prayed in those synagogues and played cricket on the Maidan. They ate cutlets at the Coffee House on College Street and bought their wedding cakes at Nahoum and Sons. And now that the community has dwindled to a few dozen or less, the last remnants of Jewish life in Kolkata are watched over by their former Muslim neighbors. It might be difficult to find the traces of Jewish history in Kolkata or Cairo or Baghdad or Fez. And it might be difficult to imagine that now-vanished world in which Jewish bakers lived side by side with Muslim doctors, Armenian tailors and Zoroastrian jewelers. But that’s all the more reason to search out those places. In visiting these semi-abandoned cemeteries and synagogues, in seeking out the remnants of this mostly forgotten past, I’ve tried, in my own small way, to pay my respects to the dead and to remember that lost world in which they lived.

2018,From Diapers to Dance Floor,"For teenagers who are pregnant or already mothers, the fairy-tale aspect of prom night is especially potent: They can transform themselves for a few hours and feel free. “I liked the place where it was held, how the tables were arranged and decorated and all the lights. It felt elegant.” — Karla Castillo, 19, 35 weeks pregnantCreditCreditPhotographs by Josephine Sittenfeld High school proms always have something of a Cinderella quality: Kids who usually slouch around in T-shirts and sneakers are transformed by formal wear into glamorous princes and princesses for the night. For teenage mothers, the fairy-tale factor is even more potent. They can shake off the responsibilities of parenthood for a few hours and feel free. At Sheila C. “Skip” Nowell Leadership Academy, a public charter school in Rhode Island that opened in 2013, two-thirds of the approximately 160 students are either pregnant or already parents. The school, which has campuses in Central Falls and Providence, offers a regular academic curriculum as well as wraparound services to provide the support its students need, including spending over $125,000 a year on child care for the children of its students. On May 17 the school held an Oscars-themed prom at the Imperial Room in Cranston, R.I. The girls wore floor-length gowns, sky-high heels and Instagrammable eyelashes. They danced and took selfies on the red carpet. “Prom means a lot to the students,” said the school nurse, Judith Russell, who knows the students well because of their pregnancies. “They get to dress up, which they don’t get a lot of. And they get to go out into a really nice setting that they don’t get a lot of,” she said. “And they get to see each other and dance and be uninhibited and it’s just really fun all the way around. They seem different at prom, they own it more. In their beautiful outfits they just feel proud of themselves and happy.” Then, at the end of the night, most returned to the responsibilities of parenthood. Here’s what some of the prom attendees had to say. Kelsey Barney: “To be honest, I would love to bring my daughter to prom, but it’s good to have that break. It’s always good to have a break when you’re a mom.” “My feet hurt. It’s only 6:35, prom started at 6. I feel like I need to go back inside — my feet are killing me.” Lisaury Ceballo: “I’ve never dressed up like that before. I have the dress at home to remember.” Leah Robinson: “My hair looked good. This is the first time I’ve had a sewn-in weave and it came out really well. My sister curled it. I had sandals that were black and gold, with fancy strings.” “My sister was watching my son during prom, she couldn’t wait for me to tell her how prom was. When prom was over we hung out in the parking lot for 30 minutes and I went home after that. My son was asleep.” Ashley Ortiz: “It’s honestly not as hard as people make it seem. It’s really easy. They go to day care. When I leave school I go pick them up and I go home and do my school work and clean.” “After prom I’ll go back home. I hope they’re sleeping when I get home, it’s going to be like 10 o’clock at night. I’ll come to school tomorrow. I’m a mom and I’m coming to school the next day, so once prom is done I’ll go home.” Chasitee Palmer: “Honestly, it was probably the best night I’ve had so far in my life. I was expecting for there to be a prom king and queen, but the school’s so small you can’t really have that. So I just decided I was the prom queen and my date was the prom king.” Yomely Moreno: “I was really proud. They looked like princesses.

2018,"From Expats to Fortunetelling Accountants, a Pile of Character-Rich Debut Novels","The Shortlist THE BALCONY By Jane Delury 244 pp. Little, Brown. $26. When a young American university graduate arrives at an old French manor to work as an au pair, her fantasies of provincial charms à la Flaubert and Manet are dispelled by the austere industrial landscape she encounters. The tensions between country-idyll expectations and dispiriting realities course throughout this shimmering debut novel, whose time-hopping narrative depicts the interconnected journeys of the estate’s sundry inhabitants from its 19th-century origins to the recent past. The decay and slapdash renovations of the manor and its adjoining cottage become a metaphor for the shifting familial bonds of these residents, whose lives are variously touched by two world wars and a terrorist attack in distant Paris. If this multigenerational cast of characters has the reach of an epic novel, Delury’s overarching interest lies in the more interior realms of identity and self-reinvention: the hardscrabble urban childhood fabricated by a country gentry, the counterfeit blood connection between a humorless government official and his schizophrenic fraternal twin brother, the reinvented persona of an expat educator in Madagascar, the split identities of Americans living in France. The vivid intimacy of Delury’s canvas is enhanced by descriptive prose at once concise and lush: a servant “with the articulations of a praying mantis and the tight face of a cockroach,” or an aristocrat’s wife whose sybaritic lifestyle echoes her former life as a courtesan, when “she’d been served naked, sprinkled with parsley, to a cousin of the emperor.” THE RELUCTANT FORTUNE TELLER By Keziah Frost 317 pp. Park Row. Paper, $15.99. Norbert Zelenka, the soothsayer of Frost’s title, could be a character out of one of those old Ealing Studios comedies in which Alec Guinness played all of the parts: a milquetoast who transforms himself into a player, prodded by a band of dotty but well-meaning elderly ladies. At 73, Norbert is squeaking by on Social Security checks, having rashly given away the millions he had saved as an accountant of 40 years. Enter a trio of do-gooder doyennes from the town’s Art League, who school Norbert into a second career reading fortunes. In no time flat, the retiring number-cruncher becomes a local celebrity, helped by an untapped gift for soft-soap, survival wisdom culled from his Reader’s Digest subscription and six positive reviews on Yelp. For much of the way, Frost’s determinedly feel-good story coasts on the back of its gentle humor (“Who is Hugh Bris?” Norbert asks when warned about falling victim to pride). The phlegmatic protagonist also gets a needed antagonist in the Art League’s fiercely micromanaging leader, Carlotta, who is categorized in the book’s pixilated New Age parlance as “a bossy negative energy field” but could be more bluntly described as a piece of work. A little precious goes a long way, and this tale of late-life growth soon tailspins with an overworked subplot involving Carlotta’s guilt-ridden granddaughter. In its repetition and pileup of whimsy, Frost’s novel makes a case for the Reader’s Digest condensations that have served its hero so well. PANORAMA By Steve Kistulentz 390 pp. Little, Brown. $27. When a character in a plane-crash novel insists on making a flight change at the last minute, one can’t help feeling that things aren’t going to end well for her. Portents of doom notwithstanding, matters are already going south for Mary Beth, a middle-aged office manager and single mom who feels stuck in her insurance company drudgery and noncommittal affair with her boss. And so it goes for her brother Richard, a disenchanted television pundit and hired gun for special-interest groups who has a recently failed relationship and a few bespoke suits to show for his fame. Kistulentz calculatedly positions his pivotal plane disaster midway into this pensive novel, drawing a dividing line between the life choices made by Richard’s stagnating siblings and their subsequent fallout. The author inventories his ill-fated passengers with a queasily clinical efficiency, delivering such a doozy of a crash that he unintentionally hamstrings everything that follows: Once 77 passengers and six crew members are fatally dispatched, why should we care about Richard’s laboriously etched pursuit of a news anchor job or his ex’s sullen parlays with a rebound boyfriend? Kistulentz is most persuasive with the nuts and bolts of the crisis machine: TV news editors who trim offending material from disaster footage and emergency teams deployed to inform surviving family members. The author’s state-of-the-art detailing of protocol stands in dismaying contrast with his retro characterization of guys who crave steak and the women who desperately hunger for them. THE LITTLE CLAN By Iris Martin Cohen 327 pp. Park Row. $26.99. Ava Gallanter, Cohen’s earnest 25-year-old protagonist, is a self-styled anachronism: a 21st-century female would-be writer entombed in the trappings of canonical 19th-century male European novelists. Cut off from her family’s money and installed as a live-in librarian at a fusty Manhattan arts club redolent of its geriatric members’ “hoarding and missed doses of Thorazine,” Ava (who writes with a quill pen and quaffs absinthe frappés) aspires to compose ornate opuses with brooding characters named Agustin and Anastasia. For all her Proustian predilections, she and her former beauty-pageant princess pal Stephanie have more in common with Wharton’s Lily Bart as they hang by a thread to the fringes of New York society. Which is perhaps why Ava bridles when Stephanie suggests that they dub the private literary club they are rigging up “The House of Mirth.” Cohen channels Ava’s Old World posturing with drolly twee sentences that choose the most arduous route to reach the shore (“from the deep well where memory and sleep curl their fluid boundaries, Ava felt a gentle dissuasion urging her from waking up”). If Stephanie hews a little too predictably to her typology as the now obligatory B.F.F.-with-moxie, she lends a welcome propulsive fizz to a novel that, emulating its fey lead character, perpetually threatens to go nowhere. She also provides an instrumental catalyst for Ava’s slow-stirring (and wisely open-ended) awakening, as she tries on new identities free of the fatalism or rote melancholia of her dead mentors.",The New York Times
2018,From Furniture to Cryptocurrency — Overstock Is on a Journey,"If you know Overstock.com only from its pop-up ads, internet searches or even its television commercials, you might think it’s just an online retailer selling some cool-looking furniture. But you’d be wrong. That description is as outdated as a chintz sofa. The company, created almost 20 years ago, has been a pioneer in the mysterious world of cryptocurrency. It was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin and it’s trying very hard right now to make an even bigger bet by selling off its retail arm and concentrating on the blockchain technology that not only supports cryptocurrency but could revolutionize an array of business sectors. Its founder and chief executive, Patrick Byrne, thinks there’s a bigger future in using the blockchain for trading in capital markets, voting, protecting property rights and more. The plan is a bold one that is not without risks. The stock, which has risen steadily, dropped sharply earlier this year in the midst of overall uncertainty about the valuation of cryptocurrency. But it has stabilized and is now trading at nearly double its price last June. Mr. Byrne seems undaunted despite the gyrations. “When we started off we were proud of saying we’re not a tech company, we’re a lemonade stand with a computer in it,” he said. [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here’s what you need to know.] But now, “it’s a logical time to sell our e-commerce business — to cash in my chips and do this crypto stuff on my own. I want to share the upside with my shareholders.” Mr. Byrne, along with his extended family, owns roughly 30 percent of Overstock. The evolution of Overstock has been both deliberate and serendipitous. The company initially relied on third-party technology for its sales, but more than 10 years ago it began building its own. A turning point came in late 2013 when Mr. Byrne gathered together a group of Overstock programmers to figure out how to accept Bitcoin for purchases. They moved quickly; within a month, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was never the end goal, he said; instead, it was only the first step in seeing what was possible with the nascent blockchain technology. Nearly five years later, the company generates from $68,000 to $120,000 in cryptocurrency revenues weekly. That translates to roughly “0.2 percent of our revenue,” Mr. Byrne said, adding that Overstock “converts a lot of that into dollars.” The handful of programmers and developers who came up with the initial Bitcoin capability has grown into a corps of about 65, based at the company’s new headquarters, which was built on a former Superfund site about 12 miles from Salt Lake City. In 2014, the company created a subsidiary, Medici Ventures, to manage and oversee its investments in blockchain-related firms. It was named for the Medici Bank of Florence — a pioneer of the double entry bookkeeping that revolutionized money and banking in the Renaissance. One of the investment results was tZero, described in the company’s most recent quarterly report, as comprising a “financial technology company, two related registered broker dealers, a registered investment adviser and an accredited investor verification company.” More colloquially, Mr. Byrne describes tZero as the place where “blockchain meets capital markets.” The name tZero stems from the initial goal — to trade securities that settle immediately, rather than after the three-day waiting period that existed under federal securities rules. (That time period was shortened to two days last September.) After several years of working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create the system, tZero got the regulatory go-ahead in December 2016, and a small class of Overstock equity is trading via that technology. But that platform was itself upended by last year’s proliferation of initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, which have created an alternative way to raise capital. Responding to the turnabout, tZero began focusing on the technology needed to develop a platform to trade the so-called coins or tokens created in offerings. And to raise capital, tZero itself designed what Mr. Byrne calls a security token offering — as opposed to an I.C.O. — saying that it complies with federal securities law. Whether the S.E.C. agrees with that characterization is an open question. Earlier this year, the commission escalated its oversight of I.C.O.s, asserting that many were really equity offerings in disguise. TZero is among those under investigation, Mr. Byrne acknowledged. But he called the heightened S.E.C. oversight “long overdue” for a market he viewed as rife with fraud and he expressed confidence that tZero’s offering was properly done. He said he was looking forward to meeting with the S.E.C. again — a not-so-veiled reference to the agency’s investigations into Overstock following several earnings restatements roughly a decade ago. No action has been taken against Overstock in the past. The S.E.C.’s current investigation, on which the agency has declined to comment, hasn’t slowed tZero’s expansion efforts. Mr. Byrne recently met with potential investors overseas but hasn’t yet disclosed how much money has been raised. In addition to technology under development, in May, tZero and Box Digital Markets announced a joint venture to create what they say is the “industry’s first regulated security token exchange.” Medici Ventures has backed other companies as well. With its president, Jonathan Johnson, a former Overstock board chairman from 2014 to 2017, Medici has so far invested an undisclosed amount in 13 blockchain companies. When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments. Among those is Bitt, a Barbados-based start-up that aims to serve people without bank accounts by creating digital wallets that would circumvent the need for the accounts or for credit cards. The market could be a large one. The World Bank recently found that 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts, although two-thirds of those own mobile phones. The company recently invested in Finclusive, which seeks to serve the estimated 7 percent of households in the United States without banking accounts as well as the approximately 20 percent of households that have a checking or savings account, but no other financial products through the banking system. The company, according to its website, connects financial service professionals with those currently underserved by the finance industry. Medici’s portfolio extends beyond the financial technology sector, including start-ups such as Voatz, a Boston-based company that seeks to secure voting via smartphones and blockchain. According to Mr. Johnson, colleges, unions and some municipalities, have tested the technology, which, he said, provided privacy and security through the use of biometrics and an ability to confirm that one’s vote had been counted. Most recently, West Virginia became the first state to test the technology in its recent primary election, allowing overseas members of the military to cast their votes. Michael Queen, a spokesman for the West Virginia secretary of state, said in an email that “a comprehensive audit is being conducted to evaluate the security of the blockchain used for the mobile application.” Six ago, Mr. Byrne and Medici formed a joint venture with the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar, a longtime proponent of protecting property rights — especially for people in developing nations, where the rights are often exploited. Mr. Byrne said he sought out Mr. De Soto, cultivating a friendship that resulted in De Soto Inc., a so-called social benefit company that would use blockchain to record property ownership. Even with the prospect of selling its retail arm, Overstock continues to invest in its e-commerce efforts, including working on efficiency in its supply chain and adding a new distribution center to improve its two-day shipping. Although it’s clear from interviews and earnings calls that Mr. Byrne’s sights are set on cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology, he cautions this is not an asset class for the general public. “While I wax enthusiastic, and while there’s a pony in there somewhere, the public should stay away from cryptocurrency. At least until the S.E.C. gets its arms around it,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,From High School Outfielder to Cardinals Flamethrower,"Extra bases Jordan Hicks was drafted by St. Louis with the No. 105 pick in the 2015 draft and has thrown pitches at 105 miles per hour in the majors. When Jordan Hicks played outfield in high school, he noticed a problem with his throws to second base. Hicks had a very strong arm, but every throw naturally tailed to the right. Eventually, Hicks learned to aim his throws a few feet over, and trust them to veer to their target. “I kind of mastered it, so I would just throw it and it would land perfectly,” Hicks said the other day, by his locker in the St. Louis Cardinals’ clubhouse. “It’s something I’ve always had to deal with, that run, so now I use it as my strength.” Hicks found his calling on the mound, and the Cardinals chose him with Pick No. 105 in the 2015 draft. Nobody could have known the significance of that number, which would one day flash on the Busch Stadium scoreboard when Hicks fired his running two-seam fastball to a major league hitter. “I surprised myself with it, really,” said Hicks, who topped out at 96 miles per hour at Cypress Creek High School in Texas, and 100 in the minors. “I tried to just give it everything I had for a couple of pitches and the adrenaline was up. It just happened.” It happened twice on May 20 against Philadelphia’s Odubel Herrera — one pitch for a foul at 105.1 m.p.h., another for a ball at 105. In the four seasons measured by Major League Baseball’s Statcast pitch-tracking system, only the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman has thrown a pitch as hard, a 105.1 m.p.h. ball to Baltimore’s J.J. Hardy on July 18, 2016. Through Wednesday, Hicks had thrown 11 pitches this season that registered at least 103 m.p.h.; Chapman had thrown three such pitches, and nobody else had reached that level. For the Cardinals’ veteran relievers, it is humbling to watch Hicks, 21, warm up in the bullpen. “It’s very deflating, to say the least,” said closer Bud Norris, 33, whose fastball averages 94 m.p.h. “But, no, it’s electric. You hear the pop, you hear the sizzle. We just want him to control what he can do, and that’s make pitches and help us win games.” Hicks has done that, with a team-low 2.13 earned run average through Wednesday in a team-high 34 appearances, though he has only recently begun to pile up strikeouts. In his first 24 games, he fanned only 12 hitters. But he had 19 strikeouts in his next 10 games as he learned to trust his slider. “It makes my fastball better because they’re missing my fastball more often now,” Hicks said. “Early on in the year, I feel like they were making a lot of contact on it because that’s all they were looking for. Now if they have to think about the slider, my sinker is going to do better because they’ve got to think about that pitch, too.” Most pitchers throw hardest by holding their fastball across the seams, meaning all four seams backspin through the air on each revolution. But Hicks prefers a two-seamer (also known as a sinker), which gives him that natural tailing action without sacrificing velocity. He rarely throws the four-seamer, but the Cardinals expect him to use it more, in time. “I think it’s something he’ll add to his repertoire,” Manager Mike Matheny said. “The goal would be elevating it a little bit more, using the top of the zone à la Chapman and most of the other hard throwers in the game, who have a lot of success there. But none of them can throw 100-plus on a consistent basis and have that much movement.” Hicks had not pitched above Class A before this season, but the Cardinals gave him a nonroster spot in their major league spring training camp, out of curiosity and as a reward for his strong performance in the minors. Early in camp, though, Hicks was late for a meeting, and Matheny reassigned him. “They wanted me to learn a lesson, that it’s not acceptable,” Hicks said. “I think it worked.” Lesson learned, Hicks returned for the Cardinals’ final exhibition game in Florida as a substitute starter for Adam Wainwright, who had a hamstring injury. Hicks overwhelmed the Washington Nationals, regularly hitting triple digits on the radar gun. “He was 100, 102, for four innings,” starter Miles Mikolas said. “Everyone was like, ‘What just happened?’ It was kind of an eye opener. If we were going to come out of the gate hot, this was a guy that was probably going to be a big part of that.” As they contemplated putting Hicks on the roster, despite his lack of experience, the Cardinals reached into their past for an example. In spring training 2001, they decided they could not break camp without the slugger Albert Pujols, who had played only three games above Class A. It was a wise decision. “That name came up in our discussions about Jordan, in terms of the last time players were coming into the front office saying, ‘Dude, that guy needs to be with us,’ ” General Manager Michael Girsch said. “We were like, ‘We weren’t even vaguely thinking of him for this role.’ Once every 20 years or so, you get that.” Now Hicks is challenging the upper limits of velocity. Most experts believe that no pitch will probably ever exceed 110 m.p.h., if that high. But then again, no one can be sure. “As a species, we haven’t gotten slower at the 100-meter dash or running the marathon or doing the high jump,” Girsch said. “The course of human history is that we keep being bigger, faster and stronger. We’re not making big leaps in velocity, I don’t think, at this point. But if Chapman can do it, surely someone else was going to come along and do it.” Chapman has “105.1 MPH” tattooed on the underside of his left wrist, marking his peak velocity. Hicks also has tattoos, but no plans for the same kind of tribute. “Just because you never know,” he said, smiling. “I could hit 106.” The Philadelphia Phillies lost infielder J.P. Crawford for four to six weeks on Tuesday when an errant fastball broke his left hand. Crawford was hitting only .194, but he has excelled in an area of emphasis for the surprising Phillies. Through Wednesday, Phillies’ hitters were averaging 4.04 pitches per plate appearance, trailing only the Los Angeles Dodgers (4.07). Crawford has averaged 4.38 pitches per plate appearance — and saw a mind-bending 40 in a game against Milwaukee on June 16. “He helped us win that game without getting a hit,” Manager Gabe Kapler said in an interview a few days later. “And I think that’s an important thing to shine a light on for players, because they look up and they see their batting average, and they’re like, ‘Aw, man, what kind of contributions am I making?’ I don’t think it’s the optimal way to think about baseball.” Crawford drew walks of six, nine and 11 pitches that game, while also striking out twice, both times on seven pitches. According to the team, no other Phillie has seen 40 pitches in a game (with five or fewer plate appearances) since at least 1988, when pitch-count data became available. The performance exemplified the kind of approach Kapler wants. “As an at-bat wears on, the at-bat moves in the favor of the hitter because he’s seen the ball do different things and the pitcher is getting frustrated and exhausted,” said Kapler, a former Dodgers executive. “And if you have a lineup of guys doing that, you have a frustrated and exhausted pitcher more often. I know when our pitchers are out on the mound, one of the things I’m looking for is how much stress does a specific batter give that guy — and more importantly, how much stress does an inning give that pitcher? So if we are stressing the opposing pitcher, I think that’s a good thing.” The Phillies have enjoyed mostly good things so far, in stark contrast to last season. Through 72 games in 2017, the Phillies had the majors’ worst record at 24-48. At the same point this season — entering this weekend’s series in Washington — they were 15 games better, at 39-33. When the Washington Nationals acquired Kelvin Herrera from the Kansas City Royals for three prospects on Monday, it marked the fourth season in a row that they have traded for at least one former All-Star closer, after Jonathan Papelbon in 2015, Mark Melancon in 2016 and Sean Doolittle and Brandon Kintzler in 2017. Herrera had a 1.05 earned run average in 27 games, with only two walks. By trading him well before the July 31 nonwaiver deadline, the Royals will save more money while bolstering a depleted farm system. The Nationals took on about $4.4 million more in salary for the rest of this season, plus a 30 percent competitive-balance tax. More important, they added a postseason stalwart who might help them finally escape the first round of the playoffs, which they have not done in four tries. Herrera has a 1.26 E.R.A. in 22 postseason games, including the clincher of the 2015 World Series, when he blanked the Mets for three innings to help make the Royals’ comeback possible. With teams carrying more and more relievers, and therefore having fewer position players on the bench, versatility is more important than ever. That could make the Minnesota Twins’ Eduardo Escobar an especially intriguing free agent this off-season. Escobar was not considered among the headliners of this winter’s class, which will include Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Josh Donaldson and possibly Clayton Kershaw. But if he continues his hot hitting, Escobar’s glove collection could help him score a big contract. Escobar, 29, has started at third base, shortstop, second base and left field over the last four seasons, and he was hitting .300 with 12 home runs through Wednesday. He also led the majors with 32 doubles in the Twins’ first 70 games, putting him on a pace for 74 doubles, which would break the major league record of 67, set by Earl Webb of the 1931 Boston Red Sox. No player has come within 10 of Webb’s record since 2000, when Carlos Delgado had 57 for Toronto and Todd Helton had 59 for Colorado. Brandon Morrow proved his durability last fall by pitching in all seven games of the World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Morrow now pitches for the Chicago Cubs — which means, recent championship aside, that he is prone to bizarre injuries. Morrow landed on the disabled list Wednesday with a lower back injury. He sustained the injury, he said, while taking off his pants. “You can get it doing anything — brushing your teeth, sneezing, picking up a kid,” Morrow told reporters. “I think almost everyone has a story. People hitting me up on Twitter were kind of making fun of me, but also people were saying, ‘Hey, I sneezed last week, and I haven’t been able to move since.’ ” Morrow’s misfortune prompted a column from Paul Sullivan, the longtime baseball writer for The Chicago Tribune, that listed many of the peculiar maladies to afflict Cubs players: ■ Shawon Dunston injured his back while lifting his daughter from her car seat in 1991. ■ Sammy Sosa injured his oblique while sneezing in 2004. ■ Ryan Dempster broke his toe while leaping over a dugout railing to celebrate a win in 2009. Some other (undated) high jinks: Mike Remlinger sprained his pinkie between two clubhouse recliners; Kerry Wood hurt himself slipping in a hot tub; and Jose Cardenal missed a spring training game with “stuck eyelids” after crickets kept him up all night. Then there was Steve Trout, who scraped his elbow and shoulder while falling off a bicycle in September 1985. Trout, a left-hander, was scratched from his start against the Cincinnati Reds and replaced by a right-hander, Reggie Patterson. That prompted a curious counter move from the Reds’ player-manager, Pete Rose. Rose was three hits away from breaking Ty Cobb’s career hits record — then believed to be 4,191 — and because this was the final game of a road trip, Rose seemed almost certain to do it at home. But even though Rose was a switch-hitter, he started himself only against right-handers in 1985. With Trout suddenly sidelined, Rose could not resist the chance to face Patterson, and he promptly got two hits to tie Cobb. At that point, Rose could have lifted himself from the game to ensure he made history in his hometown and not in Chicago. Instead, he gave himself two more chances to break the record that day, grounding out against Lary Sorensen in the seventh inning and striking out against Lee Smith with daylight fading in the ninth. The game ended in a tie — Wrigley Field had no lights then — and Rose indeed broke the record at home three days later.",The New York Times
2018,From Hollywood to Public Office: Cynthia Nixon Tests a Role Played by Men,"Arnold Schwarzenegger. Al Franken. Ronald Reagan. Sonny Bono. Fred Thompson. Jesse Ventura. Donald J. Trump. All were celebrities of a sort. All won high office. All were men. As Cynthia Nixon, the actress made famous from her turn on “Sex and the City,” runs for governor of New York, she is not just bidding to become the first woman and first openly gay governor in the state’s history. She would be one of the first female celebrities elected to a prominent political office anywhere in the United States. Every celebrity seeking office, especially those with show-business backgrounds, has confronted the question of qualifications. But will a famous woman be treated differently from all the famous men who have come before her? The crosscurrents of Ms. Nixon’s challenge to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — celebrity and dynasty (Mr. Cuomo’s father also served as governor); incumbency and insurgency; gender and ideology — have made their Democratic primary among the most closely watched in the nation. Women have captured numerous congressional primaries this year, but few female stars have even sought public office in recent decades. The actress Ashley Judd briefly considered a run in 2013 against Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, but never entered the race. Bess Myerson, who was the first Jewish Miss America and a television personality, later pivoted to public service, but lost her bid for Senate in 1980. Shirley Temple Black ran for Congress in 1967, arguing that “it wouldn’t hurt to have a woman’s viewpoint.” She lost. Decades earlier, Helen Gahagan Douglas, an actress from the 1930s, won a California congressional seat and ran for Senate in 1950 against Richard M. Nixon, the future president. He campaigned against her as a Communist sympathizer and a woman at the same time, calling her “pink right down to her underwear.” He won. Ms. Nixon, who is not related to Mr. Nixon (though she has sported a vintage “Nixon’s the One!” button on the stump), is attuned to the potential extra gender hurdles she must clear in trying to unseat Mr. Cuomo, a two-term incumbent. “Not just in politics but in most industries, women have to prove themselves five times over to be thought of as qualified,” Ms. Nixon said in a recent interview. Academics largely agree. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said that years of research have shown women running for office “have to prove their credentials more than men.” “There is an assumption,” Ms. Walsh said, “that men are qualified.” Ms. Nixon said that perception is internalized, too. She noted she had first been approached to run for governor back in 2010. The idea took years to sink in. “I think women ourselves feel like unless we have a Nobel Prize, written a best seller and labored in the industry for 20 years then we’re not qualified to put our hat in the ring.” Like so many male Hollywood stars before her, Ms. Nixon is trying to turn her lack of government experience into an asset, casting herself as an outsider not “beholden to the special interests.” “I’m not an Albany insider,” she almost reflexively declares when asked about her qualifications, in an anti-establishment strategy with echoes of Donald J. Trump in 2016. But in New York, where 75 percent of Democrats said they preferred “experience” over someone “new to politics” in a recent Quinnipiac University poll, she faces a tough audience. If fame poses a challenge for Ms. Nixon, it has also provided much of the political oxygen fueling her insurgent candidacy. Her launch video was seen millions of times. She recently appeared for 10 minutes on “The Daily Show,” after already chatting on Stephen Colbert’s late-night couch and Wendy Williams’s daytime program — the kind of exposure most neophyte challengers, especially ones more than 20 percentage points behind, could only dream of. And when she campaigns on crowded subway platforms, she is trailed by a crush of cameras and celebrated by commuters. “This is really happening!” squealed one young woman on a recent Friday morning. “She’s beautiful!” exclaimed another after they snapped selfies. “I know her from the movies!” said a third. Her first campaign financial disclosure, on Monday, revealed donations from numerous women in the entertainment world: “Sex and the City” co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis, the actresses Allison Janney, Laura Linney and America Ferrera, and the playwright Eve Ensler, among others. Rosie O’Donnell, the comedian and actress, gave $21,000, the maximum allowed. On the trail, Ms. Nixon has tried to focus on her history as an education activist and public school parent for more than a decade. Over that period, she got arrested outside City Hall and trekked to Albany to lobby for schools. When “Sex and the City” hit its 20th anniversary, Ms. Nixon drew parallels between her candidacy and her role on the show as Miranda, a career-oriented lawyer. Her campaign store now offers merchandise with the tagline, “I’m a Miranda and I’m voting for Cynthia,” and she wrote an essay on what it means “to be a ‘Miranda’ in 2018.” But she has not settled on how to sell her acting career (she has won an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy) as preparation to govern a state as large, complex and unwieldy as New York. Mr. Cuomo’s campaign team has signaled that they plan to leverage her lack of government or management experience against her; one of his campaign taglines is “proven leadership.” They have also highlighted some of Ms. Nixon’s rookie missteps, from misspelling Ithaca in an email to her shifting rhetoric on tax breaks for filming in New York — often with biting Hollywood puns about how governing “requires more than just reading off a script,” as Cuomo spokeswoman Lis Smith has said. Rebecca Katz, a top adviser to Ms. Nixon, dismissed the criticism, suggesting Mr. Cuomo gained an advantage from being the son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. “Cynthia is a self-made woman who didn’t inherit her success,” Ms. Katz said. “Her father didn’t get her her first job.” The qualifications bar has been a central challenge for past male celebrities. George Gorton, an early adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, said focus groups before the actor ran showed approval ratings that were off the charts. But no one wanted to actually vote for him. “He looked like a thug in a leather jacket,” Mr. Gorton recalled. “That was his image politically.” The Schwarzenegger team sponsored a ballot measure to soften and make more serious his image, starring him in television ads about after-school programs in 2002. He won the governorship in 2003. One factor working in Ms. Nixon’s favor, according to academics and political strategists, is that the Miranda character on “Sex and the City” was a high achiever. “She’s very much like her character,” Brittany Burrows said approvingly after she ran into Ms. Nixon while commuting in Brooklyn recently. Strategists who worked against Mr. Trump in 2016 have attested to the power of a television-formed image: The perception of Mr. Trump as a decisive billionaire executive from his years on “The Apprentice” was almost impossible to dislodge. Sheila Kuehl experienced this herself. As a child actor, she played Zelda Gilroy on the popular 1960s sitcom “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,” and when she ran for the California Legislature three decades later, she said voters still linked her with that brainy character. “That helps. Unlike so many women of my generation I had not been forced to play the dumb person,” said Ms. Kuehl, now a county supervisor in Los Angeles. Glenda Jackson, an Oscar-winning actress later elected to Parliament in England, also has a history of playing intelligent women. Ms. Nixon recently visited with Ms. Jackson, who won a Tony Award this year for Best Actress in a Play. “I offered to bang on doors if she needs a helping hand,” Ms. Jackson, 82, told Vanity Fair. In the current governor’s race, gender is already playing a prominent role. She has attacked Albany under Mr. Cuomo as an “old boys’ club.” She released an ad about the governor’s record on sexual harassment. And she made her bid to be New York’s first female governor into a key applause line. (A second female candidate, Stephanie Miner, the former mayor of Syracuse, has since joined the race as an independent.) Ms. Nixon has been less forceful, however, about her résumé. Pushed in the interview about her preparation to be governor, Ms. Nixon named “being a progressive fighter” as a top credential, saying she would cajole lawmakers by marshaling public opinion. “Many of the issues that I’m running on, they’re moral issues. If you want to get something passed, the fact of the matter is legislators don’t want to be on the wrong side of history,” she said. “You really, you create a groundswell among voters, you make it an issue they care about and then people can’t — legislators can’t ignore their constituents.” Jess McIntosh, a Democratic strategist who has worked to advance female candidates, said that “celebrity is a logical choice” when recruiting nontraditional candidates because it offers two of the hardest to find qualities: name identification and a potential fund-raising base. “We would have had a woman governor by now,” Ms. McIntosh said of New York, “if the traditional paths allowed for a woman.”",The New York Times
2018,"From Jewish Saint, to Israeli Politician, to Diaspora’s Ally","The Saturday Profile JERUSALEM — He has fought the Soviets from inside a gulag, battled against the peace process from inside Israel’s right wing, and spent the past nine years trying to stitch together Israeli and diaspora Jews just as they seemed to be pulling farther and farther apart. He won the first struggle, claims vindication in the second, and came up well short of success in the third. Much more needs to be done, Natan Sharansky acknowledges, if Jews in Israel are going to avoid permanently alienating their overseas brethren, particularly in America, over religious, political and philosophical differences. Perhaps a global Jewish parliament could help the two resolve their differences, he muses. But that will be for the next guy to try. “You never finish anything,” he said. “You do your part, and then you let others continue.” Always a believer in freedom and identity — what he calls “the twin poles of every human being” — Mr. Sharansky, 70, is freeing himself from the workaday world to revel in his newest identity: grandfather. His exit from the public stage has been less beatific than his exit from the Soviet Union in 1986, when he was practically sainted among Jews, after applying in vain for emigration to escape persecution and then serving nine years in labor camps and prisons. In Haaretz last weekend, Anshel Pfeffer bluntly dismissed Mr. Sharansky’s “lackluster leadership” of the Jewish Agency for Israel, saying he had allowed the world’s largest Jewish organization to lose “any real relevance to Jewish life in Israel or abroad.” If so, it was not for lack of trying. As chairman of the agency’s executive, Mr. Sharansky seemed to have negotiated an important milestone last year, granting Judaism’s Reform and Conservative movements a say in management of the Western Wall in Jerusalem and giving non-Orthodox men and women a more dignified place to worship together there. But when ultra-Orthodox parties threatened to bolt the government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abandoned the deal. Mr. Sharansky remains angry, but also seems to make excuses for the prime minister, a longtime friend and ally. “As a politician, probably he is right,” Mr. Sharansky said. “As the one who is supposed to be the leader of the Jewish people, I think it was a huge mistake.” “I also don’t think that he would lose his government,” he added. “But he decided that he doesn’t take risk, even if it is a 10 percent risk,” lest Israel’s security be put in another leader’s hands. The relationship between Israel and the diaspora is at an inflection point, in Mr. Sharansky’s view. Before, each condescended to the other, he said. Israelis believed they were saving Judaism and that those who did not move to Israel would eventually just disappear. American Jews believed they were saving Israel. “Our poor relative!” Mr. Sharansky said mockingly. “We are ashamed for not thinking about our brothers during the Holocaust. Don’t be afraid: We are rich, we are strong, we’ll save you.” Those days are gone, Mr. Sharansky said. Israelis know that world Jewry is its most reliable ally against delegitimization, and American Jews have learned that without a connection to Israel, “their grandchildren would not be Jewish.” It’s not about saving one another, he added. “We are in the business of saving us.” So he had the Jewish Agency train scores of young Israelis in how to debate and deployed them to American college campuses, the front lines of the fight against the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. “The most important thing is to try to build a core of young Jews who are not embarrassed,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you need to defend and justify everything that’s happening — nobody needs that. But to give you enough of an argument that you should not be afraid of your association with Israel.” Now, however, Mr. Sharansky says that what is needed is for those returning Israelis to teach their compatriots what it means to be a Jew in the United States, where “pluralism,” the development of more liberal strains of Judaism beyond Orthodox, was a necessary strategy for surviving as Jews. Currently, secular Israelis, who face no threat of assimilation, see pluralism as a shortcut to the loss of Jewish identity. “That’s where this misunderstanding begins,” he said. And it can only end when enough Israelis understand the needs of the diaspora to support politicians who will do the same, he said. “Nobody’s against, but nobody’s really for” making compromises with the non-Orthodox Jewish streams, he said. Mr. Sharansky has had quieter disagreements with Mr. Netanyahu. He obliquely scolds Israel’s government over its dalliances with hard-right nationalist governments in Eastern Europe, warning that just as “those who say they love Jews but hate Israel are not our friends, those who say they love Israel but hate Jews are not our friends either.” He has also shown his own blind spots as a politician, and even as an evangelist for freedom — chiefly, his critics say, by seldom applying as critical a lens as he used against the Soviet Union to Israel itself. Writing in The American Conservative, Michael C. Desch accused Mr. Sharansky in 2005 of failing to show the “moral clarity” he demanded of others, instead demonstrating “moral ambiguity and inconsistency in his advocacy of democracy and human rights, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Atop the indictment were Mr. Sharansky’s insistence that peace could be achieved only between Israel and a legitimately democratic Palestinian Authority — because real democracies do not try to kill one another, he argues — and his rejection of seemingly any peace initiative that required territorial concessions. To be sure, Mr. Sharansky is quick to acknowledge the suffering of Palestinians, but he lays it at the feet of the entire international community, not Israel alone. “It is a thousand times more difficult to be a dissident among the Palestinians than among the Soviets,” he said. “There, you knew that even if you will be isolated, you are part of a much bigger world of free thought, and this world is with you. Here, who cares?” It is “the free world,” he rails, that has cynically allowed Palestinian leaders to keep their people in refugee camps for generations and, of late, to send Gaza residents to be shot by Israeli soldiers along the fence. “And Palestinians will suffer again, and again, and again until the free world will say, ‘Enough,’ ” he said, and stop funding the Palestinian Authority, “stop dealing with these corrupt dictators,” save up the money for a future Marshall Plan and instead start helping Palestinians build a real democracy, beginning with independent representatives. “That’s what I was proposing 20 years ago, 10 years ago,” Mr. Sharansky said, “and that’s the only thing which can finish it.” To hear Mr. Sharansky tell it, his career has been an endless series of proofs of lessons from the gulag — lessons that the West, to his dismay, has still not fully absorbed: that every human being craves both freedom and a sense of belonging — impulses often in tension but ideally in balance; that free countries must spread freedom to those who lack it, even when the oppressors are allies; and that freedom cannot be imposed, but must be built from the ground up. Barack Obama ignored these in 2009 when he snubbed Iranian protesters for the sake of engaging the regime, Mr. Sharansky says (Mr. Obama and others have disputed this argument). Bill Clinton and Yitzhak Rabin both ignored them in installing Yasir Arafat as a dictator to keep Hamas in check. And every president since Jimmy Carter has given Saudi Arabia a pass on human rights. Already limbering up for the lecture circuit, Mr. Sharansky welcomes the new leadership of Saudi Arabia, saying he does not know yet how transformational Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will prove to be. “Let’s hope,” he said. “But then the role of the West,” toward the Saudis, he added, should be as it was toward the Soviet Union before its fall: to encourage democratization, but withhold a full international embrace until they do far more. “You have to push him to continue with this, like with Gorbachev.”",The New York Times
2018,"From My Seat, Panama Won the World Cup","Essay In defense of the little guys. They indeed belong. It’s safe to say the attention of the soccer world was not focused on the seesawing battle at Mordovia Arena in Saransk, Russia, on Thursday as Panama fell to Tunisia, 2-1, in the teams’ last game at the World Cup. Neither team advanced in the tournament — Tunisia managed its first World Cup win in 40 years; Panama goes home with an 0-3 record, the lowest-ranked team — but they most assuredly did in the sport. They might not have shone the brightest on the field, but they certainly stirred some far-flung corners of the globe. So why should I be surprised that after the game, the pounding salsa music came on, the rum poured forth and the happy banter and singing of scores of Panamanians, offering one another long hugs, filled a bar in Brooklyn that nobody seemed in a rush to leave? (They were still singing an hour after the game.) I rise in defense of Panama, and the other not-so-mighty teams officially exiting the tournament. This newspaper requires conflicts of interest be disclosed, so here is mine: I am the son of Panamanian immigrants. I possess a baseball cap with a big P in the national flag motif. I might have worn it at some point on Thursday, surrounded by Panamanians at this bar, Michelle’s Cocktail Lounge, essentially a social club for the small but vibrant Panamanian immigrant community in central Brooklyn. But my biases go but so far. The New York Times sports desk, where I am a ranking editor, offered live coverage of all the games on Thursday except one: the one I was watching, which was deemed too inconsequential. This is kind of how it went for Panama: not feared, maybe not totally respected, but a curiosity in its first appearance in the 88 years of the World Cup. Still, all around me, almost everybody wore the red jerseys of the Marea Roja, or Red Tide, and loudly sang the national anthem at the start of the game, a particular point of pride for any small country at an international event. They treated this game as if it were the World Cup final, yelling, “Tira!” — Shoot! — at even the faintest prospect of scoring, and groaning loud enough to be heard in Panama City when the ball sailed wide of the net, which was often. Panama, after all, doesn’t get much to celebrate on the world stage. Yes, there is that canal. And in terms of sports there was Roberto Durán, though I, for one, was teased relentlessly as a child after his “No más” fight against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980. Mariano Rivera, the famed Yankees closer, is destined for the Hall of Fame, but he left baseball five years ago. Panama scored only one certifiable goal in the tournament (its one goal in Thursday’s game was credited as a Tunisia own goal), which would have brought shame to the Brazils of the world but was celebrated as a remarkable achievement. It didn’t matter that it came in a 6-1 blowout against England in the second game, which, if I’m honest, was actually a lot worse than the score reflected. It was shot by Felipe Baloy. He is 37 and has had a long career of club soccer in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Panama is one of the oldest teams at the World Cup, stocked with veterans like Baloy, who kept dreaming of simply getting to the tournament, because, you know, it’s just the most-watched sporting event in the world. So understand the party that broke out here and in Panama with that one goal, that one assertion that, yes, this team belonged. Panama, of course, went through the rigor of the qualifying process, just like everybody else, and emerged as one of the 32 teams fit to compete. It should go without saying that the United States failed to make it, but I have to say it, because surely American fans are thinking, We would have done better. Maybe that’s true, but you also have to do better in the run-up. FIFA now plans to expand the tournament to 48 teams, raising the prospect of more minnows like Panama among the sharks. So be it. If you are going to call it the World Cup, let as much of the world in so that teams like Panama prove themselves in the qualifying tests and might ultimately develop into strong teams, spoilers, eventually even champions. Panama is better known for boxing and baseball, but both sports seem in decline there. There hasn’t been a big Panamanian boxing star in years, and the baseball output to the major leagues has waned, too. Fútbol is tightening its grip, and there is nothing like a first-time trip to the World Cup to generate the excitement to make it tighter. That was certainly the sentiment in the crowd around me on Thursday at Michelle’s. “It’s exciting Panama has gotten this far,” said Sandra Pinder, 64, a retiree who does not closely follow soccer but sat riveted for the entire game. “Hopefully next time they will be even better and succeed with the experience they have now.” As for me, I’ll keep watching the tournament, and not just because it’s my job.

2018,"From New York’s Primary Upset to Polling Data, How The Times Is Covering the Elections ","Bulletin board Our Politics editor, Patrick Healy, answered readers’ questions on The Times’s political coverage and plans for the midterm and 2020 elections. As the November midterm elections approach, we invited Times readers to ask our politics editor, Patrick Healy, about our current political coverage and our plans for the 2020 presidential race. We quickly heard from more than 200 readers. Here is a selection of the questions we received, which have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity, and Patrick’s responses. Please share any additional questions or suggestions for our Politics team in the comments. The Times coverage of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez before her surprise defeat of Joe Crowley was limited to a few paragraphs in articles about multiple candidates and a cameo in a prescient editorial warning the incumbent not to take his seat for granted. I’d like to hear from someone on the local politics/midterms team about the decision not to cover her more, their understanding of shifting demographics and whether they need to adjust the way they think about/approach nontraditional candidates. — Staci D. Kramer Hi, Staci. Thanks for the question. As you noted, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s defeat of Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, was a surprise. Our heavy, competing demands for coverage make it impossible to do all the stories we want to do, including all the ones we see and all the ones that we don’t see clearly because of the surprise factor. I’m proud of the pieces we did do about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — she was the lead figure in a Page 1 story about the surge in female candidates and a main figure in a long Metro piece about challengers last week. We have 13 reporters on the Politics desk, and we are making coverage choices among many hundreds of candidates and so many states, districts and issues. We also have critical stories to do about voters and their lives. We tend to look for themes, issues and developments that echo across multiple races, trying to draw connections for readers. That’s what we tried to do with the two stories that I cited involving Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. That said, I do wish I had assigned a piece that fully captured the dynamics, demographics and issues in the Ocasio-Cortez/Crowley race before Primary Day on Tuesday. I took away some lessons here. For instance, we wrote a few stories before the primary about Michael Grimm, a Republican trying to reclaim his New York congressional seat after serving time for tax fraud. He was a well-known figure, and his attempt at a comeback was audacious and intriguing — and it could have led to the seat flipping for the Democrats. Those were good angles with clear consequences, and they were good stories worth doing. But I do regularly ask myself how and whether we are covering all kinds of candidates, including ones who may not win their races but can still tell us something about the country right now. In the case of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, I wasn’t in tune with the intriguing elements of her story like I was with the Grimm story. I will keep asking myself those questions, and I will ask them of my team, as well. There are also lessons here about not making assumptions about the power of incumbency, and about understanding changes in a district and the way a new voice can powerfully reflect them. We have done a strong job covering progressive candidates, with pieces on Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Lupe Valdez in Texas, Jared Polis in Colorado, Ben Jealous in Maryland, Ayanna Pressley and Brianna Wu in Massachusetts, Amy McGrath in Kentucky. We have also done a strong job writing about Republican candidates and voters, evangelical voters and die-hard Trump supporters. These are critical stories for understanding the issues facing the country, its mood and direction, and its political and civic future. More and more we will ask ourselves whose stories we are telling and covering, and whose voices we need to do a better job reflecting. Thanks, Patrick Does her victory signal a strong move to the left in the Democratic Party? — Gilles de Domingo Hi, Gilles. It’s a really important question. More Democratic candidates are embracing progressive policy ideas like “Medicare for All”/single payer and making emphatic cases against the Trump presidency. But I think Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s victory was also very much her own. She was a smart candidate and campaigner, a gifted communicator who appealed strongly to the voters and the changing demographics in her district, and who championed issues — like abolishing the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — that resonated with many people there. She also campaigned hard and showed up at debates and events that her opponent skipped. So I think her victory was partly about her alignment with the voters and left-leaning issues of importance in her district, but also very much about her strength and tenacity as a candidate. Thanks, Patrick Here in New York, pollsters yet again got races like Donovan/Grimm (NY-11-R) and Crowley/Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14-D) badly wrong. What’s the future of polling, of political reporting, and of politics in general with such increasingly useless tools? — Stephen Koeth Given how inaccurate poll numbers were during the 2016 presidential election, have there been any reforms made in terms of how polls are conducted, analyzed, and assessed for accuracy? Has The New York Times revised in any way its policy or reviewed the standards by which it covers candidates and their campaigns? — Julia Leeds Hi, Stephen and Julia. Many of us have put too much faith in polls at one time or another. They must be regarded as snapshots of politics — not a guarantee or a prediction of the outcome of a race, but as one tool among many to help understand issues, candidates, campaigns and places. The Times does very few stories based solely on polls by others; more often, we include some data from well-regarded polling operations like Gallup and Pew when it provides illuminating context. We work closely with our colleagues at The Upshot, our data-driven storytelling unit, to assess polling data and decide whether it is useful for a story we are already pursuing. Polling is a way to survey a wide sampling of voters about issues and concerns that are vital to them. Issue-based poll questions can be revealing about a district or a candidate. But polls shouldn’t be taken as the final or absolute word on anything. We are careful how we write about polls, and poll results don’t dictate our coverage decisions. Thanks, Patrick How does the department decide the amount of coverage that various candidates receive, especially when unlikely challengers that are barely known are winning more frequently? — Jacob Leppek Hi, Jacob. The Politics desk currently has four editors and 13 reporters. All of the reporters have beats. No reporter is assigned to a single candidate or candidates for the midterms coverage (this will change for the 2020 presidential campaign). We make coverage decisions about hundreds of candidates and challengers based on a variety of factors: newsworthiness of their messages, issues, biographies, campaigns or strategies; ways that they represent broader themes, issues, tensions or developments in a race; their chances of making an impact — perhaps that’s by winning, or perhaps that’s about the challenge they are waging; and what their candidacies and races tell us about their communities, the voters and more broadly the way politics and life are unfolding in America. We don’t write many stories about a single candidate unless he or she is extremely well known and the race can tell us something about politics at large, like this long profile of Mitt Romney. Thanks, Patrick Stop ignoring third-party candidates. Any reporter who buys into the “fringe candidates aren’t worth the ink. They will never get elected” philosophy is a tool. — Joshua Good Hi, Joshua. Thanks for this. I hear you. I’ve never bought into the idea that we shouldn’t write about candidates simply because “they will never get elected.” A major factor for us — and this isn’t some excuse — is resources: We have so many political stories and races and candidates to cover, and a limited number of reporters and editors, so we have to make tough choices. We are often drawn to the campaigns that are the most competitive, that would resonate with a wide spectrum of readers, or where the outcomes could have major ramifications on people’s lives, on issues, on the balance of power, etc. But we are always looking for compelling candidates who tell us something important about the nature of their part of the nation or about a policy, idea or ideology and would make for a great read or visual story. If you want to share more thoughts on this, or flag specific compelling candidates that we may be missing, please email me: pdh@nytimes.com. Thanks, Patrick How will you cover 2018 without the repeat of the 2016 errors and continue on with what I have read as really strong journalism since 2017? — Patty McLoone Hi, Patty. Thanks for this. Our colleagues in Washington have done a terrific job covering the Trump presidency, the Mueller investigation and the extraordinary developments at the White House and in Congress. Reporters on our National and Business staffs have captured so many of the changes, challenges and struggles across America, from daily life, education, immigration and health care to the changing economic fortunes for families and voters. One of our 2018 goals is to collaborate extensively with these colleagues to tell a really complete story about all facets of life in America and how politics expresses itself in this country. I was a senior reporter on the 2016 campaign coverage, and I am proud of the work that our team did. By the end of that campaign, I think voters who read our coverage of Trump and Clinton were extremely well-informed about whom these candidates were, what they stood for and what kind of president each would be. I hope to deliver that kind of insightful coverage again, and to build on it by providing the smartest, most nuanced and accurate picture of the country and its voters. Thanks, Patrick Does the turnout among Democrats tell us anything about probable mobilization/motivation among voters in November? Does it confirm, e.g., that Democrats are energized for the 2018 midterms and so likely to vote in larger numbers than in past midterm elections? — Ken Dreyfack Hi, Ken. We ask ourselves questions like this regularly — but also, could there be a red wave, and why? What factors could stop a blue wave? Could the strengthening economy help Republicans? Which party and which candidates will benefit more from the politics surrounding the new opening on the Supreme Court? What influence could a report from Robert S. Mueller III have on the election? You are asking good questions; there are many others. I consider it enormously important not to make assumptions or shape coverage presuming a likely November result. Thanks, Patrick What is the prospect of a Republican challenge to Trump for the 2020 nomination or is the president’s hold on the GOP too strong? — Cameron Clyne Hi, Cameron. There’s a good chance for a Republican challenge to Trump in 2020 if he runs for re-election. Senator Jeff Flake and Gov. John Kasich are sharp critics of the president, and both have been making trips to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary. Senator Ben Sasse and outgoing Senator Bob Corker might be tempted, depending on how the next year unfolds. Trump has a 90 percent approval rating from Republicans, but there are so many variables ahead that it’s impossible to know if a strong challenger would come forward. Thanks, Patrick What will be the defining issue this fall to determine electoral success and control of the House of Representatives? — Emmitt Carlton Hi, Emmitt. It’s too soon to say. Every week seems to bring another moment or issue that, during a normal presidency, could be defining. A gun massacre. The president’s policy separating children and parents at the border. A possible trade war. The Mueller investigation. The strengthening economy. Tax cuts. The Supreme Court opening. The fraying of global alliances. Russia. North Korea. Disinformation. Stormy Daniels. Lies and false statements made by this president and this administration. The strong support that President Trump has from Republicans. The intensity and determination on the part of Democrats. But this is not a normal president or presidency. We have to keep reporting on the ground in towns and cities, keep asking questions and keep challenging assumptions rather than predict now what the defining issue will be.

2018,"From One Mineral, Brilliant Reds and Bright Blues","Q&A Rubies and sapphires are made of the same stuff, but trace elements alter their appearances. A. Both rubies and sapphires are mostly the same clear mineral: aluminum oxide, in a crystalline form called corundum. Trace elements present in varying amounts cause the different colors by altering which wavelengths of light are absorbed and reflected by the stone. For rubies, the ideal composition includes significant traces of chromium but little or no iron. The chromium alters the crystal structure so that all but red light tends to be absorbed. Chromium also absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths of light, but re-emits some of it at a lower energy in the red wavelengths. Iron would absorb this light; without it, the finest rubies are fluorescent in the red range. For blue sapphires, traditionally the most sought-after color, the important trace elements are iron and titanium. Their presence alters the crystal structure so that all but the blue wavelengths are absorbed. Sapphires in other colors have other chemical signatures. Laboratories often can identify the source of a gemstone by analyzing its chemistry. Recent research suggests that traces of silicon, too, play a role in determining the color of corundum, but its exact role has not been determined.",The New York Times
2018,"From Pyramids to Chocolate, Mexico City Through the Eyes of Children","heads up Mexico City is known for its many cultural attractions and a flourishing cultural scene. But the capital city’s appeal as a family-friendly destination hasn’t come to the forefront until recently. On our recent getaway to Mexico City, my two young daughters and I sat in the lush garden courtyard of our hotel, the Four Seasons, one afternoon and debated how we wanted to spend our evening. Should we head to Arena Mexico to see the theatrical spectacle of the flamboyant luchadores — Mexican wrestlers — fight it out with acrobatic-style moves while the crowd cheered them on? Or, did we want to learn how to make tamales and sopes topped with ingredients like beans, salsa and mole negro at Casa Jacaranda, a small cooking school situated in a 1913 home in the chic Roma neighborhood? Mexico City is well known for its many cultural attractions, including more than 100 museums and a flourishing arts and design scene. But the city’s appeal as a family-friendly destination hasn’t come to the forefront until recently. In a bid to attract more tourists, some hotels are stepping up their amenities for children, and tour operators are offering itineraries with an eye on the younger set. Our time in the Mexican capital was limited, but the choices for activities here seemed endless, and we were torn throughout our trip between many appealing options such as the two in question at that moment. Our appetites eventually won over, and we passed the night away with Casa Jacaranda’s two owners, Jorge Fitz and Alberto Estua, a couple who reside on the belle epoque home’s top floor, mixing corn husks with shortening for tamales, and pressing corn dough into circles for our sopes. We steamed the tamales in boiling water and cooked the tortillas on a griddle and topped them with black beans, beef and just-made guacamole. As we ate the dishes we had labored over, Mr. Fitz told me that the children’s cooking classes were only a few months old. At two hours long, they were abbreviated versions of the school’s full-day sessions, but they still gave children and their parents a snapshot of traditional Mexican cuisine. “We had repeated requests for lessons where parents and kids could cook together so we decided to start them, and they’ve already been a big hit,” Mr. Fitz said. As my daughters Meenakshi, 9, and Amrita, 5, and I discovered, there’s plenty here to occupy families like us, and the list, cooking classes at Casa Jacaranda included, keeps growing. The Mexican-based travel company Journey Mexico arranged our itinerary, and the head of its Mexico City office, Lillian Aviles, told me that the company has seen the number of its customized, private family trips to the city double in the past year from 20 to 40 — ever since it started promoting Mexico City as a destination that could engage kids. Parents with school-age children typically favor beachside destinations in Mexico such as Riviera Maya, she said, but the same travelers who visit the country again often want to spend a few days in the capital city to explore renowned museums and dine in internationally famous restaurants. “Mexico City is one of the world’s largest cities so it’s natural that people want to see it,” Ms. Aviles said. “The city’s hospitality industry is definitely catering more to kids, but even without organized activities, there’s plenty for them to see and do.” She was right: Meenakshi and Amrita were as engaged as I was on our trip to the Frida Kahlo Museum in Coyoacán, in the southern part of the city. It’s a colonial-style home that’s painted a rich blue and has an interior patio with a beautiful garden with blooming flowers. We especially enjoyed seeing Ms. Kahlo’s wardrobe of dresses displayed on mannequins, and her brushes and easel, along with the mirror that she used to paint her self-portraits. Afterward, we went to the San Ángel neighborhood, also in the city’s southern part, and walked through the vibrant crafts market where dozens of vendors were selling colorful piñatas, which, naturally, Amrita and Meenakshi wanted to buy. They cost only $1 each and with their bright hues — reds, blues and greens among the bunch — and varied shapes like stars and cones, they were works of art. I quickly agreed, and as we continued our stroll through the market, they talked excitedly about the candies they wanted to fill inside their new toys. On another day, we explored the nearly 1,700-acre Chapultepec Park, in the heart of the city and across the street from our hotel. It’s the largest urban park in Latin America and has museums, restaurants, a zoo and plenty of paths for biking, walking and running. The children’s museum, Papalote Museo del Niño, was definitely their favorite park attraction: The sprawling space had around 180 interactive exhibits, and they couldn’t get enough of the towering Ramon Tree, which they were able to walk through and which taught them about different forest ecosystems. And we spent at least an hour in the large garden, which had samples of the various kinds of soil and plants found in humid forests, wetlands and other ecosystems in Mexico. The city has at least a half-dozen other museums suited for children that we didn’t get a chance to visit. They include the Museum of Popular Art, where kids can participate in workshops on how to make Mexican crafts such as piñatas. Also, Mucho Museo del Chocolate, the Chocolate Museum, showcases the history of cacao in Mexico and has a chocolate lab where kids can make Mexican chocolate by grinding cocoa beans on a volcanic stone called a metate and even create sculptures with chocolate paste. Ms. Aviles, of Journey Mexico, has two children, ages 3 and 12, and said that when given a choice on how to spend a free day, both plead for a visit to the Chocolate Museum. “They drink hot chocolate when they’re there and leave with the chocolate that they’ve made,” she said. “Chocolate is their favorite food on earth so obviously the museum is a winner.” Hotels around the city where business travelers were previously the main guests are also stepping up to accommodate their growing number of young guests, according to general managers of these properties. The Four Seasons, a contemporary building with a large inner garden that’s a haven from the bustling city, for example, significantly amped up its children’s programming in 2017 to draw in younger guests and leisure travelers: On Sundays, the property has free activities, such as making Mexican crafts with a local artist, and holds special events throughout the year like an Easter egg hunt and games and an ice-cream cart near its outdoor pool come warm weather. “We wanted to find fun ways to entertain the more and more kids staying with us,” said Jose Adames, the hotel’s general manager. Of course, the point of going to Mexico City wasn’t to spend time at a nice hotel, but when we wanted a break from sightseeing, the property’s warm ambience and diversions were a pleasant respite. The culmination of our trip was grand: We awoke at 4:30 a.m. on our last day to make the 45-minute drive to Teotihuacan, the once mighty Pre-Hispanic city that’s now a Unesco World Heritage Site. There, we climbed inside a hot-air balloon and as the sun started to rise, we soared over Teotihuacan’s two large pyramids, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. I was terrified, but my daughters were exhilarated and held my hands to keep me calm. The pyramids were an incredible sight from the sky and equally captivating from the ground when we climbed up their steep staircases to the top following our ride. Our vacation in Mexico City had come to an end, at least this time. To our delight, we had immersed ourselves in art, culture, cuisine and nature all in one getaway. Next time, those wrestlers, which we missed seeing, along with many other new diversions, awaited us.",The New York Times
2018,From Staff to Stave: 5 Times Colleagues Who Combine Work and (Classical Music) Play,"A conversation with the Qwerty Ensemble about how journalism and music overlap. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. The New York Times is a big place, full of people who have interests aside from journalism and are happy to share them. It’s one of the joys of working here. There is a strong contingent of classical musicians in the building, many of whom play in outside groups for the sheer pleasure of it. It seemed convenient to band together on the premises during off hours. I knew, from an orchestra we happened to be in together, that Laura Chang, deputy editor for The Upshot, played the violin. The grapevine sent us other musicians: William Davis, an assistant editor for News Platforms (another violinist); Aaron Krolik, a developer for Interactive News (a violist); and Margalit Fox, a senior Obituaries writer (a cellist). We bonded in an empty conference room over Mozart and Brahms two years ago, gathering after work on a regular basis. We call ourselves the Qwerty Ensemble. We chose the name Qwerty as a nod to keyboards, of the writing kind, which have long served journalists. (Look at your left hand if you are reading this on a computer.) For the past few months we’ve been focusing on the Brahms Clarinet Quintet (which I especially am happy about). It’s a great way to ease the tension of high-pressure jobs at the end of the day. Over the course of our time together — and over drinks after rehearsal — we began talking about the ways in which playing music and creating journalism are similar. Here are edited excerpts from a conversation with my colleagues about how we got into music and how it connects to our work at The Times. DANIEL WAKIN: I took up the clarinet in around fourth grade, studied privately and have played in chamber groups and orchestras ever since. My mother gave me a choice: flute or clarinet. Flute made me dizzy. How did the rest of you start out as musicians? LAURA CHANG: My mom was a choir director and my dad is a natural harmonist; they managed to offer all six kids music lessons. My twin and I started Suzuki violin at 8. MARGALIT FOX: In fourth grade, when my Long Island public school handed out string instruments, I asked for a violin. I struggled — or should I say scraped away? — with school lessons for two years. My beleaguered parents begged me to take up something less gratingly high-pitched. I played the cello quite seriously through college but concluded that I simply didn’t have the discipline to pursue it professionally. So I put the instrument aside and didn’t play for nearly 30 years. A few years ago — in a reckless act akin to buying a used car without a look under the hood — I bought a very old, no-name cello for astoundingly little money on eBay and resumed lessons. AARON KROLIK: At 7 or 8 I was attending chamber music performances with my dad, and studying Suzuki violin method. I switched to viola at 13 and haven’t looked back. WILLIAM DAVIS: My parents got me lessons when I was 5 because I would mime playing with a cast-iron skillet and a chopstick. I attended the high school program at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where I spent more time in the office of the student newspaper than I did in the practice room. WAKIN: So for you, Will, the connection between music and journalism goes way back. I was able to combine these interests, too, with the help of some freakish luck: I oversaw and contributed to the classical music beat in the Culture department here at The Times for years. More cosmically, playing music and committing journalism are both collaborative endeavors, quests for the perfect phrasing and exercises in public scrutiny. Do you see other connections between music and journalism? DAVIS: I think the focus on detail is also very similar — whether you’re trying to find the missing phrase or sentiment or the right articulation. Journalism and music are both undervalued but deeply important to society. FOX: If I have any facility as a writer at all, I hope that it lies in control over tone and color and cadence and pacing. Playing with diction and syntax and structure, and trying to spin words out into a continuous silken thread to achieve the appropriate effect in a story is hands down the part of writing that gives me the deepest pleasure. I know in my bones that every one of those skills comes straight from having studied music. CHANG: Notes, accuracy, individual practice, teamwork, higher purpose. KROLIK: I second Laura. Publishing a daily report is a companywide effort and nothing taught me teamwork and higher purpose more than playing chamber music (especially as a violist!). WAKIN: Breaking news follows no schedule, but rehearsals and concerts do — strictly so. Has the job ever intruded on music-making? (When I worked as a reporter, I generally suspended orchestra playing. Did not want to risk it.) CHANG: One of my orchestras had a big concert scheduled a few days after the 2016 election. Needless to say, I was late to dress rehearsal. A great thing about playing with Qwerty is that everyone understands when you're delayed or have to jump on your phone. DAVIS: Depending on the group, rehearsals can be very strict, and it’s often one of the few times I really turn off my phone. I let my colleagues know I won’t be available and it has generally not been an issue. I have been known to run out in the 90-minute break between two rehearsals to do an interview for a story, though, or to be on my computer right up to the downbeat. Join the Qwerty Ensemble for an evening of music and conversation at Le Poisson Rouge on Tuesday June 5, when they will perform the first movement of the Brahms Clarinet Quintet.

2018,Opinion | From Westworld to Best World for the Internet of Things,"Mr. Zittrain is a Harvard professor and a co-founder of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. Last month the F.B.I. issued an urgent warning: Everyone with home internet routers should reboot them to shed them of malware from “foreign cyberactors.” Putting aside the strangeness that for once power-cycling a device could perform an effective exorcism upon it, the episode reveals more than just the potential for disruption of internet access for people using equipment they never expect to have to physically manage. It also underscores how unprepared we are to manage downstream-networked devices and appliances — the “internet of things” — that are vulnerable to attack. A longstanding ethos of internet development lets anyone build and share new code and services, with consequences to be dealt with later. I call this the “procrastination principle,” and I don’t regret supporting it. But it’s hard to feel the same way about the internet of things. Worries about security for these devices have become widespread, and they fall roughly into two categories. First, compromised networked things can endanger their users. In 2015, Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles after researchers showed they could hack a Jeep and disable its brakes and transmission. Coffee makers and other appliances with heating elements could have safety features overridden, starting a fire. And an alert was issued on certain pacemakers last year after vulnerabilities were found that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and issue commands to the devices. Second, hacking even a tiny subset of the 10 billion and counting networked things can produce threats larger than any one consumer. Individually these devices may be too small to care about; together they become too big to fail. Security systems in a city could be made to sound an alarm simultaneously. Light bulbs can be organized into bot armies, directed to harm any other internet-connected target. And worse than a single Jeep executing an unexpected sharp left turn is a whole fleet of them doing so. Short of rejecting internet integration with appliances, dealing with this is not easy. As with home routers, we tend to keep appliances around for years, so vulnerabilities aren’t phased out quickly. In fact, many vendors might stop issuing firmware updates for physical objects even while they’re still widely in use — abandoning the public to problems lurking in embedded code. And otherwise-valuable “over the air” security updates could also be a gateway to a hack, especially for small vendors of cheap if useful objects like $5 drones. The unusual problems of the internet of things call for unusual solutions. The first confronts the life-cycle problem. Companies making a critical mass of internet-enabled products should be required to post a “networked safety bond” to be cashed in if they abandon maintenance for a product, or fold entirely. Insurers can price bonds according to companies’ security practices. There’s an example of such a system for coal mining, to provide for reclamation and cleanup should the mining company leave behind a wasteland. For internet-connected appliances, “reclamation” can entail work by nonprofit foundations to maintain the code for abandoned products, creating an “island of misfit toys,” in the parlance of the famed 1964 Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas special. Proceeds from redeemed bonds would go to these foundations to maintain the products, like the way the Mozilla Foundation has transformed the 1998 Netscape browser long after its originators left the scene. A second intervention would require networked products modeled after analog counterparts to work even without connectivity. A smart coffee maker shouldn’t be so clever that it can’t make coffee without internet access. Switchover to non-connectivity mode will not merely help prevent things from becoming useless when the internet goes down, or if the original vendor disappears or jacks up service prices. It can also provide a soft landing for appliances that reach the end of their supported life cycles while still beloved by owners. Finally, networked devices made by different vendors need to be able to communicate with one another — the way that, say, Mac and PC users seamlessly exchange email. That prevents a household from becoming locked into a single vendor for all its appliances. It also prevents us from flocking to one or two vendors whose compromise could cause widespread consequences. While procrastination around security has been vital to the expansion of the internet, “later” doesn’t mean “never.” We can create incentives to design networked devices for both interoperability and safety, and to plan for remediation when some things inevitably go wrong. We can enjoy the best rather than worst of both worlds.",The New York Times
2018,"From Wine to Sweets, Greek Goodies at a New Athens Market","Bites Yoleni’s, a food emporium in the upscale Kolonaki neighborhood, is all about showcasing the gems of Greek gastronomy. At first glance, Yoleni’s looks like an Athenian grocery store of a bygone era. You can taste cold cuts, cheeses and halvah before you buy; the feta is sold by the slice from a large slab preserved in salty brine; and there is a bakery and a fruit and vegetable section. But walk a few steps farther in, and you’ll realize this multi-floor food emporium in Kolonaki, an upscale neighborhood of Athens, is all about showcasing the gems of Greek gastronomy. “I was thrilled every time I found a new product hidden in a tiny corner of Greece, in a village where an old granny would tell the secrets of a recipe or a hidden treasured ingredient,” said Nikolaos Pipas who, together with Dorotheos Chatziioannou, opened Yoleni’s in 2016. “We wanted to find all those treasures for Yoleni’s, to show people the real Greek cuisine.” During a recent visit, a dining companion and I started at the downstairs wine bar. With over 30 types of local wine available by the glass (and more by the bottle) the choices overwhelm, but Chara Dionysopoulou, Yoleni’s authority on Greek wine, is there to help. She recommended Alfa Estate’s fruity sauvignon blanc from northern Greece and a barrel-aged vidiano from Douloufakis Wineries on the island of Crete. Both paired well with generous portions of cheese — smoked metsovone and aged Cretan graviera — served with tomato-apple chutney and house-made sourdough. Up on the main floor an informal restaurant with a retractable roof offers two menus. One, called Topos, or place of origin in Greek, was created by Yoleni’s to revive various grandmothers’ lost recipes. Grilled sardines wrapped in vine leaves were piquant and lemony with a hint of thyme and garlic. From the second menu, we chose the cheese and egg pita, a traditional Greek pie, from Roúmeli (central Greece); the pie was unlike many of its other filo-dough counterparts: its crust was thin and crisp but not at all overpowered by its filling. Up a floor is a meat lover paradise: a butcher shop shares the space with a steakhouse; cuts are courtesy of the shop, Carnicero Meat & Delicatessen, but even a vegetarian like me won’t go hungry. Their roasted root vegetables served with avocado-yogurt sauce were sweet on the inside, crisp on the outside and just the right amount of smoky. For dessert we returned to the downstairs dining space to try the chocolate and nuts pita, an earthy, slightly bitter combination of dark chocolate, roasted hazelnuts and Aegina pistachio spread. Other sweets are made by Dina Nikolaou, a renowned Greek chef. Her delicate rose-petal icing sponge cake is infused with rosewater she prepares herself. With summer almost in full swing, it went perfectly with a freddo espresso, a cold, frothy favorite of Athenians, from a coffee shop on the same level. But Yoleni’s treasures don’t end there. Up on the second floor is a children’s area where, for a small fee, kids can play while adults enjoy their meal or even go shopping in the neighborhood. Cooking classes that teach old, forgotten recipes are on the third floor, as is an olive oil bar — a tasting experience that makes for another one of Yoleni’s undeniable gems. Yoleni’s, 9 Solonos Street; yolenis.com. An average meal for two, without drinks or tip, is 50 euros (about $60).",The New York Times
2018,"From a Convention Center’s Roof, ‘Walk-Off Vegetables’","Grace Notes Alan Steel dreams of “walk-off vegetables” the way the beleaguered subspecies known as Mets fans dreams of walk-off homers. At this moment in another season of disappointment, Mr. Steel’s dream seems more likely, although patience is required, just as it is required with the Mets. The first crop won’t be planted until 2021. Mr. Steel is planning a farm in the sky, on the roof of the extension being built at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the Far West Side of Manhattan, where he is not only the principal proselytizer for urban agriculture, but also the president and chief executive. “It gives us a story,” he said, and not just a story that could lead to bookings downstairs, because these days, as he quickly pointed out, “a lot of conventions are about sustainability.” The story of rooftop farms is one that says something meaningful can be done with the last batch of unused real estate in an increasingly crowded city. Something useful. That could have important consequences for the cityscape, but seeing “farm” and “city” in the same sentence derailed thoughts of how local locally grown produce could be — in other words, how short the trip from farm to table could be, how much fresher the produce would be when it reached the kitchen, how much less energy would be consumed than when fruits and vegetables are trucked long distances and what other benefits there might be. What came to mind was, admittedly, totally silly: “Green Acres,” the 1960s sitcom that opened with Eddie Albert singing about “land spreadin’ out so far and wide.” By Manhattan standards, the new farm will do just that. It will run along West 40th Street, at the northern end of the convention center complex, between 11th Avenue and 12th Avenue. But green acres, plural, it will not be. At 43,000 square feet, the Javits Center farm will not quite cover a single acre, only nine-tenths of one — 0.9871441689623508, with all the decimal places possible in an online conversion program. It will be a tiny fraction of the size of the average farm in the United States, which in 2017 was 444 acres. It will have something rural farms do not: stunning views that might have pleased the character played by Mr. Albert’s co-star, Eva Gabor. “I just adore a penthouse view,” she sang. “Dahling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue.” The rooftop farm will not be far from Park Avenue, with its prewar buildings, all brick and old-fashioned masonry. What she would see closest to the farm, however, are the tall, shiny and mostly linear towers that have remade the industrial barrens of the Far West Side. The rooftop will be the largest farm in Manhattan, but that is not saying much — Manhattan has not been farm country for generations. And, as far as rankings go, the rooftop farm at the Brooklyn Navy Yard will still be larger at 65,000 square feet. The one at the Javits Center will be about the same size as a rooftop farm in Long Island City, Queens (the borough that had the city’s last family-run farm, in Fresh Meadows, until it was sold to a real-estate developer in 2004). But the Javits Center farm will have the city’s only rooftop orchard, with apples, pears, peaches and maybe cherries, some grown in a 3,200-square-foot greenhouse. And then there will be the vegetables — cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, herbs, carrots, arugula and mesclun greens. The farmers will not wear suits and ties, and they will not have to worry about exploding tractors, as Mr. Albert did on “Green Acres.” “Mostly, we’re all people who ditched office jobs, so we hung up the suits and ties,” said Gwen Schantz, the chief operating officer of Brooklyn Grange, the ambitious company that will do the harvesting — this will not be a you-pick-it operation, though Brooklyn Grange hopes for teachable moments when school groups visit. “It’s easy as New Yorkers not to think about where our food was before it appeared on the supermarket shelf,” Ms. Schantz said. The crop will be bound for a close-by destination — extremely close by. Specifically, downstairs at the Javits Center. And that will drive the growing plans. Mr. Steel said the chef would forecast the menu and Brooklyn Grange would grow to order. “Any produce that we grow would be used locally, in the building, or nearby,” he said. Anastasia Cole Plakias, a founding partner and the vice president of Brooklyn Grange, said that was an ideal scenario. “It epitomizes the efficiencies in urban agriculture,” she said. Brooklyn Grange, which already grows over 50,000 pounds of produce a year on roofs around the city, has been selling produce to restaurants consumed within five miles of the other rooftop farms. The food from the Javits Center — which already harvests honey from beehives on the roof of its original section — could be consumed within 200 feet of where it was grown. Mr. Steel said that when it came to planning the Javits Center expansion, a $1.2 billion item in the Cuomo administration’s $100 billion statewide infrastructure plan, he wanted the roof to be “something more productive, instead of just a place where people could stroll.” “It’s relatively easy, if you’re building a new building, to build it strong enough to hold the weight.” And so the Javits Center extension is being built to hold at least a million pounds of soil, in a bed 18 inches deep — deeper than those at the Navy Yard or the Queens building. The soil, specially mixed for rooftop farming, will retain more water than ordinary soil. There will also be a water recycling system that will recirculate the runoff. “It will go into a ginormous cistern” in the basement before being pumped back up, Ms. Schantz said. Mr. Steel, who has run the Javits Center since 2014, has learned about rooftop agriculture off the job. He said his weekend house has a flat roof. “He has his own rooftop vegetables,” Ms. Schantz said, “so he’s a bit of a sucker.”",The New York Times
2018,"From a Pediatrician, Lessons for Dads-to-Be","The class is part of a broader effort to shed scientific light on fathers’ roles in child and family well-being. CHICAGO — In a conference room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on a recent evening, a group of men sat down for a class on pregnancy and childbirth led by Dr. Craig Garfield, a pediatrician who specializes in studying new fathers. The class is one of many that Northwestern offers to new parents, including some that are designed for moms, for grandparents and — in the case of one class called “Bowser & the Baby” — for dog owners. Dr. Garfield’s parenting class is for expectant fathers, most of whom are here after their pregnant partners signed them up for it. As the class got underway, the soon-to-be dads seemed uneasy. But with some prodding from Dr. Garfield, they began to open up, sharing some of their hopes and fears about becoming first-time fathers. One man said he hoped to raise a strong and confident daughter. Another said he was fearful about holding his baby for the first time because babies are fragile and he had never held one before. Others said they worried about their finances, losing sleep, the health of their babies and their partners, and not having enough time to spend with their children. “My hope is that you will all leave tonight having much fewer fears,” Dr. Garfield told the men. While today’s generation of fathers is not the first to change diapers or be actively involved in child care, they are more likely to participate than their own fathers, and much more so than their grandfathers. But Dr. Garfield and his colleagues have found that many dads who are eager to be engaged are often uncertain about where to begin. “This class serves as a ‘How-to’ or ‘Fatherhood 101’ to try and meet this disconnect between wanting to be involved and not being sure exactly what to do,” Dr. Garfield said. “Many new fathers really are scared of breaking their babies.” The class is part of a broader effort he is leading to shed scientific light on the role that fathers play in child and family well-being. Dr. Garfield, an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, has found that helping fathers benefits the children they raise. “My message is to get in early and get in often,” said Dr. Garfield, who is also an attending physician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “When the baby is born, be there, get your hands on the baby, change the diaper, talk to the baby, hold the baby, feel the baby. Get involved and don’t be shy about it because it’s all about building your confidence and getting comfortable with your baby.” Dr. Garfield explains to expectant dads how they can help if their partners breast-feed, whether it is positioning the baby at the right level or helping their partners stay hydrated. He shows them how to cradle their infants on their chests with skin-to-skin contact, a calming technique. And he encourages them to read and talk to their newborns often so their developing brains will benefit from hearing their voices. These steps and others can get fathers more engaged and comfortable with their newborns, Dr. Garfield has found, and they may also be crucial to their long-term development. Studies suggest that children who grow up with more involved fathers acquire better language skills. They have higher self-esteem and better grades in school, and they suffer less depression and anxiety. They have lower rates of truancy and are less likely to become teenage parents. “The data is pretty robust,” said Dr. Michael Yogman, an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “The more involved fathers are early on, the better the child does academically and the less likely they’re going to have behavioral issues later on.” In 2016, Dr. Garfield and Dr. Yogman published a report in the journal Pediatrics outlining ways that pediatricians and health care providers could engage new fathers in prenatal and postpartum care. They argue that this is particularly important given the evolving nature of family dynamics, with many mothers and fathers no longer exclusively playing the roles of primary caregiver or provider. Dr. Garfield’s interest in studying fatherhood stemmed from his own experiences. When his first child was born in 1997, he was the first medical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital to ask for a month of family leave. A year and a half later, when his son was a toddler, he took time off to be a stay-at-home dad so his wife, who also became a pediatrician, could focus on her residency. Dr. Garfield noticed that he was the only dad on the playground, at playgroups and in “Mom and Tot” classes. He and his wife found that their pediatrician ignored him during visits with their toddler, focusing on his wife. It dawned on him that he too had excluded fathers as a doctor, a revelation he wrote about in JAMA. “With remorse, I realize that during residency I established more eye contact and directed most of my advice toward mothers, even if both parents were present,” he wrote. Looking at the medical literature, he found that much of the research on child health and development was focused, appropriately, on maternal interventions. But he also felt that many populations of fathers were understudied: married and unmarried dads, single-parent fathers and gay fathers, adolescent dads, and even incarcerated fathers, who account for roughly 750,000 of the 72 million fathers in America. “I was frustrated that my discipline of pediatrics was slow to recognize the role that fathers play in child health, and that plays out in the research that we do,” he said. “Fathers are a key player in families — for positive and negative.” In shaken baby cases, in most domestic violence cases, he noted, the perpetrator is often the dad. In his research, Dr. Garfield found that some of the health issues new moms face also affect new dads. He discovered that new fathers gain significant weight and that many experience a major increase in depressive symptoms, which could lead to them being neglectful of their children. And he found that fathers of premature babies experience higher levels of stress than their partners during the transition home. Dr. Garfield is now developing an app to help parents of premature babies care for their infants, and he has called for wider health screening in new and expectant fathers, many of whom do not have primary care physicians. To better understand their well-being, Dr. Garfield is working on a pilot study to track health behaviors in new fathers. It is expected to start in August. In the meantime, he is trying to help individual dads through his expectant fathers’ class, which meets roughly once a month. One of his former students is Saleem Hue Penny, 38, the associate vice president of community and educational partnerships at Chicago Children’s Museum. Mr. Penny attended the class while his wife, Katie, was pregnant with their twins. The class prepared him for some of the hard realities of fatherhood, he said, and prompted him to speak up at doctor’s appointments and to be more involved in the care of their newborns, who are now toddlers. Mr. Penny was so inspired that he and a group of colleagues and community partners created an event at the museum, called “PapaPalooza,” where fathers brought their children to play while also getting information on affordable housing, employment, community college, and health and wellness resources. “It was empowering,” Mr. Penny said of the class. “It gave us the encouragement we need to be hands-on and engaged and to not be off on the sideline. The message was that you and your partner are a team and regardless of what is happening, you are forever with this child.”",The New York Times
2018,From the Slaughterhouse to the Playground,"Update On a recent morning, a steer head weighing two tons dangled from a nylon strap over the playground in Chelsea Waterside Park, on 11th Avenue between 22nd and 24th Streets. Carved out of limestone and measuring four feet from below its neck to the crown of its horned head, the bovine bust, suspended from the boom of the truck that had transported it there, was inched closer to a pedestal in a fountain area of the playground, which is scheduled to reopen next month after an extensive renovation. The bust swayed as onlookers held their breath. It rotated slightly. The expression on the sculpture was as placid as always, making it seem like just another day for the cow head. After all, the swaying steer and its identical twin, both of which were relocating to the playground, have been on the move for decades. As it was reported in The Times in 2014, the bovine busts, along with two ram heads with long, curling horns, began life as facade ornaments for the New York Butchers’ Dressed Meat Company. The building was completed in 1919 on 11th Avenue between 39th and 40th Streets. It was demolished in 1991 to make way for an office building, but right before the wrecking ball came, the sculptures were plucked from the facade. First they went to a warehouse in Brooklyn. Then they wended their way back to the West Side of Manhattan, eventually settling down in Hudson River Park, where at least they could spend their days outdoors again. For seven years, they spent their time on a lot in the park near West 34th Street, waiting for a permanent home. Finally, they have one. “The cows will have a lovely view of the West Side Highway and the new buildings going up on 11th Avenue,” said Madelyn Wils, the president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust, a public benefit corporation that operates the four-mile waterfront park, which encompasses Chelsea Waterside Park. The busts, along with Art Deco-style winged carvings that once adorned the entrance ramps to the West Side Highway and had also been languishing in the lot, will play a mere supporting role in the new playground, which was designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the landscape architecture firm that designed Brooklyn Bridge Park. The main attraction is an enormous rendition of a pipefish that was crafted in Denmark and pays homage to the real pipefish that are among the nearly 60 species of fish that inhabit the lower portion of the Hudson River. The live creature, with a seahorse-like head on a serpentine body, is about eight inches long, whereas the playground’s version is 64 feet long and wraps around a tower with a spiraling ladder and a slide wide enough for two people to go down side by side. The pipefish is painted attention-getting yellow, blue and orange. The steers aren’t quite so flashy — but they do look nice and clean. Specialists from Opus Architectural Arts, a Long Island City-based restoration and decorative arts company, washed off soot, dirt, grime and rust that had accumulated over decades, said Michelle Quartin, the firm’s founder and owner. They applied “bio-friendly paint remover” to a big black blot that had been splashed onto one of the steer’s snouts — perhaps in a long-ago act of vandalism — and used brushes to gently scrub off the paint by hand. Holes were drilled from the back of the heads to the front so that water could spout out of the mouths. The winged cartouches — made of granite, which is a harder stone — were also given a bath, and they had their edges rounded because they will rest on the ground and children will likely climb on them. “The nice thing is they already had a hole up the middle,” said Scott Streeb, a senior associate with Michael Van Valkenburgh, referring to pre-existing openings that once may have accommodated lampposts. He and his colleagues were delighted to incorporate the West Side artifacts into the playground’s new design, he said. The playground, which is a beloved destination for children from neighborhood schools and apartment buildings, including the New York City Housing Authority’s Chelsea-Elliot Houses and Robert Fulton Houses, opened in the northeast corner of Chelsea Waterside Park in 2000. It is being renovated after years of malfunctioning water features and drainage problems. It was “loved to death,” said Ms. Wils. To date, $2.5 million has been raised for the $3.4 million playground project, with help from the Hudson River Park Friends Playground Committee, local elected officials and real estate companies, Ms. Wils said, adding that the park plans to raise the balance through donations and fund-raising. After the playground is completed, the dog run and picnic area on the southern half of Chelsea Waterside Park will be upgraded. The Chelsea projects are among many improvements being undertaken in Hudson River Park, which was founded two decades ago and has been developed in stages. The park recently received $50 million from New York State and another $50 million from the city and hopes to have $50 million more when the air rights over some of its piers are sold, Ms. Wils said. In August, work will begin at Pier 26, at North Moore Street in TriBeCa, and will include the creation of an environmentally themed playground centered on two large-scale sturgeon from the same company that made the Chelsea playground’s pipefish. As for the steers, the only question is whether they will miss the rams that have been their constant companions ever since they were all rescued from the slaughterhouse facade. The rams were supposed to be part of the Chelsea playground — and, in fact, had been trucked there first, months ago — but their horns had broken and they were deemed too fragile. So they are back in the lot near West 34th Street for the time being. There is talk that they may end up in a park closer to Hell’s Kitchen, Ms. Wils said. “We’ll find a home for them.”",The New York Times
2018,From ‘Suite Life’ to the Brew of Kings,"Front Burner Dylan Sprouse, an actor on “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” has opened a meadery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Mead, the drink brewed from honey, is still somewhat obscure. Dylan Sprouse — notable for his role in “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” on the Disney Channel and who is newly in the business of brewing mead — may be more well known. With Doug Brochu and Matt Kwan, he has started All-Wise Meadery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to attract an audience for what some consider to be the world’s most ancient alcoholic beverage, one that was supposedly quaffed by King Midas, on Viking ships, and, fictionally, in Tolkien’s Middle-earth. The meadery has just released its first bottles. Straw-colored, with a slightly yeasty meadow-fresh aroma, the mead is bone dry with hints of citrus and vanilla. It’s food-friendly and at 11 percent, lower in alcohol than many wines.

2018,Fully in Agreement,"WORDPLAY Byron Walden’s puzzle sees the universal, with some humor. SATURDAY PUZZLE — Before I begin, I want to mention that we understand the need for a convenient link back to the main Wordplay page, which was lost when we changed systems. We are working on bringing it back to the Wordplay label at the top of the column. That may take a while, though, so for the time being, that link will be at the very beginning of each column, where it tells you which day’s puzzle we’re discussing. Well, friends, if you’re reading this then you’ve made it to another weekend. I always look forward to the Saturday puzzle, even after all these years, and Byron Walden is one of the regulars I really like. Today’s grid is quite open, complex and well-clued. Some specific momentum-stoppers, as well as more standard fill with notably clever clues: ALANIS, ENGEL, BEEBE, EYRE, AGENDAS, ELOPES and even the mundane HAVE, which I didn’t, until pretty late in the solving. Three of the four clues in the double stacks were difficult for me. 15A: I really did a double-take when I solved this one, “Commercial break?” I figured the twist might have to do with something like “go for some snacks”(obviously not those words but that gist), but I think Mr. Walden is operating on another level with ECONOMIC BOYCOTT. It’s a perfect clue. As an aside, economic boycotts have quite a rich history and make up one of the pillars of ethical consumption. There are people working hard to distribute information about the lines of production and practices behind all kinds of corporations and industries, which makes it far easier than ever before to at least inform ourselves about the companies we do business with as consumers. Stop lecture. 27A: Slang coinage, like time in general, seems to be spinning pretty fast these days, and the entry here (for “Passé, so to speak”) wasn’t complete, to me, which made it more challenging. I think the expression is so LAST YEAR. Does anyone remember how bad everyone thought 2017 was? 35A: This is actually the debut of TOUCH PAD, which I found interesting, as they’ve become so ubiquitous thanks to smartphones (and tablets, and computers that can also operate as tablets). 42A: This clever entry sounds like something biblical or similarly final, but it refers to the also-ubiquitous FAQS section that every website has. Apparently you’re supposed to pronounce this like an initialism rather (F A Q’s) rather than an acronym (FACKS), although I do like “facks” since it sounds a little like a tough guy asking for just the “facks,” ma’am. Some people are even more inventive. It’s certainly not worth fighting over. 51A: Another debut, also clued correctly, as there is a true definition of the term RADICAL FEMINIST. Kathie Sarachild coined it in the 1960s to refer to an extension of feminism that believed that current societal norms (which would be termed “patriarchal”) are untenable and need to be upended for feminist progress to be made — no more working with the system. This is pretty recent history, but it’s quite rarely brought up and I wonder if the history of feminism is ever included in any school curriculum outside of women’s studies. If it’s not, that’s an example of the patriarchy right there, isn’t it. It also explains why the term is used incorrectly, often, to insult. 7D: I’d never heard of the “naira,” but its spender would be a NIGERIAN; this currency has appeared in the Times puzzle a couple of times, in the clues and the answers. The naira has had a volatile value internationally, but according to the news there has been some progress made just this week to quell the chaos caused by multiple exchange rates. 8D: “Prior approval” doesn’t mean that you’ve already been given the go ahead here; it means that a church Prior has said O.K., and if you care about that, you’re apparently among the ABBOTS. 16D: Mr. Walden is justly proud of this dilly of a clue. A “Childlike personality?” isn’t necessarily a brat or a naïf; the Child in question is Julia, an archetypal CELEBRITY CHEF. This video is the long form version, but her summer dinner looks so delicious and perfect and there’s something in it (including chicken livers) for every taste. 33D: This term for a borrower’s limit, LOAN CAP, is also a debut and seems to refer mainly to students borrowing for their educations, which is an absolutely bonkers and enormous sector of American debt — now the second-largest next to mortgages. I usually don’t start a themeless having a grid in mind, but every once in a while, I’ll try to push myself with a hard one. This grid is a Manny grid (Manny Nosowsky, 1/10/03), so it’s like treading on hallowed ground for me. I like giving solvers lots of connectivity, but it definitely takes a lot of patience and sweat trying to find a way to make everything fit together. This one was hard enough that I’m gonna stay far away from the Manny grids that had even fewer black squares. The CELEBRITY CHEF entry/clue combo is one of my all-time favorites. I’m always on the lookout for clues that have two misdirecting parts. Here, I especially like that the first part of the clue points to the second part of the entry, and vice versa. On top of that, it uses the old hidden capital trick as well. Happening on this clue was like finding a four-leaf clover. The quote in the CYNIC clue was cut for space. The full version is ""a blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be.” Mister, we could use a man like Ambrose Bierce again. Ambrose Bierce rode off into the sunset forever, but if you’re not quite there yet, you can take a peek at the answer key.

2018,"Fun Things to Do This Weekend: Pride, Summer Solstice and Sensory Overload in Brighton Beach","Welcome to Summer! This week we’re celebrating! Pride, of course, but also any other occasion this first official week of summer may bring. New York City is good like that. Some of you have been asking how we select our recommendations. Here’s the quick and dirty: Margot has compiled a master list of events from new and old favorites, friend recommendations and an exhaustive combing of summer listings. Each week she selects for fun and variety, convinces the editor to sign off, and then she and Tejal head out on bikes or on foot to review, interview and explore. On that note, keep sending us your ideas, keep using the Google Map and keep sharing Summer with your squad! It’ll make planning that much easier. Til next week, Margot and Tejal What’s the Plan? If your average festival has stars on the bill, Ladyland is a constellation of icons. This concert-slash-rave-slash-Pride-party, hosted on Friday night by legendary queer night life producer Ladyfag, gathers a crowd of top music makers: SOPHIE, the it-girl trans artpop producer, and Oscar Nñ of the Q.T.P.O.C. collective Papi Juice, as well as Eve, Tommy Genesis, Ssion, Aquaria (currently in the final four on RuPaul’s Drag Race!) and many others. You’ll have a dizzying, dazzling afternoon, night and eventual morning. The show runs from 5 p.m. until 4 a.m. Yes, the lineup is eclectic, and so is the crowd — a given at Ladyfag’s parties. Zero tolerance for discrimination is rule No. 1; everyone — young, old, femme, queen, boy, girl, straight — is welcome. A vision so utopian is aptly situated at Brooklyn Mirage, a huge, palm-tree-lined space. The primarily outdoor nightclub provides all the trappings of a warehouse but with a top-notch sound system and unparalleled lighting (including video mapping) — and every line, from bar to the bathroom, has been engineered to take ten minutes or less. In the shaded entryway will be food vendors, and behind them, merchants in the Pop Souk, a market “where downtown goes to sell … not sell out.” Look for idiosyncratic wares you may never find again. Or maybe you’ll be distracted by the tattoo artists giving free ink nearby. Of course you’ll be near the stage as the night wears on, but keep an eye out for movement around the periphery: Easter eggs abound, including the “N.R.A. Sashay Away” for Gays Against Guns, with vogueing by Javier Madrid of the House of Ninja and L.G.B.T.Q. youth from the Ali Forney Center. However else you’re celebrating Pride, join the throngs at this power party. You have the rest of the weekend to recover, and forever to tell the story.

(If you’re a group of five or more, you can and should make a reservation.) Did you know Arrogant Swine recently acquired a frozen drink machine? Now you can get spiked slushies to slurp with the Carolina-style barbecue, in which a whole pig is smoked slowly over hardwood, before its sweet, fatty meat is chopped up and mixed together.

They pour their own rye kvass and lactic-fermented sour meads, along with plenty of other surprises. Maybe it already feels like every weekend you’re drinking and dancing yourself out of this world. It can certainly feel that way at Jupiter Disco, which is lit like a spaceship and decked out with the paraphernalia of dystopian sci-fi classics, and serves excellent cocktails.

Start with Sylvia Rivera, which has a few episodes, and then listen to Marsha P. Johnson and Larry Kramer. What’s the Plan? It’s 10:30 p.m. A besuited waiter swoops through the dark, teetering your fourth meat-and-cream course on the metal stand that’s already piled with dishes that you will never, ever finish. He’s now topping up your stemmed shot glass; you thank him, but can barely manage to tear your eyes off the Russian dancers dressed in bright, billowy pants, twirling and stomping to broadly “ethnic” music and disco lights. This is Tatiana, Brighton Beach’s favorite Russian-inspired supper club, and it is an experience. Hidden behind a row of innocuous diners on the boardwalk, the old-world indoor ballroom is where the neighborhood goes to celebrate birthdays, engagements, you name it. And, if we have anything to do with it, it’s where you’ll go this summer for your next occasion. First, gather as many friends as humanly possible, as a bigger party equals more fun. Call ahead to reserve a table inside for 8:30 (or earlier on Sunday). Ask for the fixed-price banquet, which starts at a steep $70 per head on Fridays and Sundays or $95 on Saturdays (you’ll get your money’s worth). You can also order à la carte, which is slow and expensive, but either way, your meal also gets you a variety show — or, as we’re calling it, sensory overload. There’s the slick, young emcee, orchestrating the show one minute and singing in a sweet tenor the next. Then there’s the photographer snapping excited couples who will later pay $20 per print. And finally, the singers — maybe human, maybe fembot — toggling between Russian hits and American Top 40, in their best impressions of Sia, Celine Dion and Xtina. All of which you’ll struggle to process amid layers of mayonnaise and potato. But give up on processing and just dance. The floor is yours after the acrobats finish their act (for us, that was around 10:45) and you have it until the wee hours of the morning, when you’ll finally stumble out to the calm sparkle of the ocean. Amazing, isn’t it, how many worlds we can fit in one small space. (Google Map) Before and After: Indoors If you’re spending the day here before you head to Tatiana, you’ll need snacks and plenty of cold beverages. Hop out at the Ocean Parkway stop on the Q train and stroll down Brighton Beach Avenue. Start at Varenichnaya with dumplings, all of the dumplings. The meat-filled pelmeni are small and wrinkly, thin-skinned and juicy. And the vareniki, which come both sweet and savory, are delicate and plump — don’t miss the ones filled with fried cabbage. Just across the street, you’ll see Güllüoglu, a Turkish chain selling syrup-soaked, sour cherry-filled baklava and Turkish delight. Keep walking to Cafe at Your Mother-in-Law and its Uzbeki-Korean kitchen. Try the buk-tya, a soup made with fresh tofu, or the pressed chicken tabaka, crisp and golden brown, with a garlicky tomato sauce. (Google Map) Before and After: Outdoors If you’d rather settle in at a breezy spot on the beach, fill up a bag with pastries at La Brioche and carry them to the boardwalk (you’ll pay for most of these by the weight). The soft, fried potato piroshki are particularly delicious, and yes, they travel well. Looking to build out something a bit fancier? Pick up cans of beer, glass bottles of fizzy Russian sodas and pint containers of prepared salads and smoked fish from Gastronom Arkadia or Brighton Bazaar. Ocean Wine and Liquor has a vast selection of vodka bottles to go. But for sit-down drinks, Anyway Cafe is a good bet, open until 2 a.m., often with live music.

2018,Funeral Is Held for Firefighter Killed by Ground Zero Toxins,"Chief Ronald R. Spadafora, 63, was in charge of safety for recovery workers after the Sept. 11 attacks. After Sept. 11, 2001, Ronald R. Spadafora was the Fire Department chief charged with the safety of workers at ground zero. On Friday, at his funeral in Manhattan, he was remembered as a hero, the latest firefighter to die from cancer caused by the toxins at the disaster site.CreditCreditJeenah Moon for The New York Times Firefighters die because they run into dangerous places, and they die because they stay. Chief Ronald R. Spadafora stayed — for nine months. His assignment was ground zero, the patch of steel and debris that a federal labor official in 2001 called “potentially the most dangerous workplace in the United States.” The job of making sure no one got hurt fell to him. In fall 2001, he watched rescue workers trade their dust masks for half-face respirators with triple-combo cartridges for organic vapor and acid gas. In the winter, he made a plan for extracting 8,000 pounds of chemical coolant from underground tanks, the substance so toxic that, at high enough concentrations, it could cut glass. And in the spring, after the remains of another two victims were found, he oversaw the bones being carried out in Stokes baskets, which are metal-ribbed stretchers, draped in American flags. On Friday, Chief Spadafora’s body was lifted off the back of a fire truck and carried into St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue the same way: swaddled in an American flag and laid in a Stokes basket. The toxins released by the World Trade Center site had given him blood cancer and, on Saturday morning, killed him at age 63. “He was there as each and every member was carried out,” the fire commissioner, Daniel A. Nigro, said of the post-9/11 recovery efforts, “just as he was carried out of this church.” That he was once the chief of safety for the entire post-9/11 recovery operation was a reminder of the indiscriminate trail of sickness and death that has followed the attacks. He is the 178th member of the Fire Department, and its highest-ranking member, to have died of World Trade Center-related illnesses. Another 343 members died in the Sept. 11 attacks. In a 2002 article in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, Chief Spadafora described the safety precautions he had helped design, while conceding that he and other rescue workers had still been exposed to a toxic soup of chemicals: “asbestos, metals, silica, organic compounds, and aromatic hydrocarbons, to name just a few.” And he recently wrote an article for a Fire Department handbook urging firefighters to wear their bunker gear in fires, to wash it afterward and then to shower, given the growing risks of cancer from burning plastics. “I thought I was invincible,” he wrote, “but I was wrong.” Just as the World Trade Center site paused when a firefighter’s body was recovered, so too did members of the Fire Department pause on Friday. From the edge of the bus lane to the opposite curb, firefighters filled Fifth Avenue. Police officers shut the street to traffic for blocks. On the sidewalk outside St. Thomas Church, a uniformed firefighter mopped up a grimy spot. Across the street, tourists and passers-by carrying shopping bags and cameras leaned against the metal barricades and glass storefronts. They asked who was being buried, little aware that the death toll from Sept. 11 was still climbing. Chief Spadafora was remembered as a professor of firefighting in a department full of students of the craft. He was an adjunct lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, wrote for WNYF Magazine, the official training publication of the Fire Department, and once gave a copy of a book of firefighter exams he had written to a neighbor, the author Amy Tan. He downplayed his smarts, Ms. Tan said during the funeral Mass, but she later told him the book had taught her that she “wasn’t smart enough to be a firefighter.” “My books make mothers and daughters cry,” Ms. Tan said. “His books save lives.” His cerebral attitude suited his work as a safety supervisor after Sept. 11. He wrote a safety message that became the second or third sheet of the daily incident action plan at ground zero. It described tripping hazards, cutting hazards, breathing hazards and how to mitigate them. “Most firefighters are Type A personalities: they think they can do anything,” said Robert F. Sweeney, who worked with Chief Spadafora at ground zero and is now the commissioner of the Yonkers Fire Department. But Chief Spadafora had an academic bent: He liked drafting plans and considering big-picture risks and was never rattled by the enormous scale of the recovery operation. “The man had the skills, the experience,” Mr. Sweeney said. “He was kind of a slow-motion guy — he talked slow, he walked slow.” A recipient of two master’s and a bachelor’s degree, he became the chief of fire prevention for the department, lifting morale among inspectors whose job it was to review construction and ensure businesses were following protocol. After being diagnosed with cancer at the end of 2015, he went into remission with the help of an experimental treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital and returned to work. He is survived by his longtime partner, Rhonda Shearer, 64, and a son, Brian Spadafora, 27. After the funeral, 178 members of the Fire Department carrying American flags, one for each department victim of World Trade Center-related illnesses, started walking back down Fifth Avenue.",The New York Times
2018,Funky Ceramics Are Everywhere. Including in Galleries.,"The fine art world has started to embrace works made from clay — a material it once deemed lowly. More than sewing, flower-arranging or zine-making, clay might offer the perfect antidote to modern times. Hyper-tactile, it taps into a primal desire to shape earth — what the potter and writer Edmund de Waal has described as thinking through the hands — and is beloved for its immediacy. “You move and the clay moves with you,” says Aneta Regel, who was a finalist for this year’s Loewe Craft Prize and who, 12 years after graduating from London’s Royal College of Arts, now finds her works — lumpy, funky, cooked until cracked — aligned with a prevailing taste for artfully imperfect handwork, more generally, and for all things ceramic, in particular. If it is unsurprising to find mounting evidence of the trend on Instagram and at lifestyle-leaning boutiques like Samuji in New York and CristaSeya in Paris, it is notable that clay’s proliferation has, over the past decade, extended to the fine art world, which has long been wary of the material, widely considered to be lowly, functional and inexpensive. One of de Waal’s early teachers liked to say that his pots “had to be cheap enough to drop,” a condition that recalls the train tracks around Kolkata, India, strewn with shards of terracotta as a result of riders’ tossing their empty cups of chai out the window. That has not been the attitude taken at recent art fairs. At Frieze New York last month, Matthew Marks Gallery showed a speckled and contorted coil by the ceramic artist Ken Price, while Parrasch Heijnen showed craggy forms by Julia Haft-Candell, one of Price’s artistic heirs. On the walls of Martos Gallery’s booth were paintings by Dan Asher; in the center, several small sculptures of his — modest unglazed stacks of what looked to be clay scraps. A low-slung table at the Blum & Poe booth was set as if for coffee with friends — or, dare I say, a craft fair — with pretty but plain-looking mugs and bowls by J.B. Blunk. In a way, it was among the most provocative displays at an event so focused on remarkably high prices, underscoring how, by placing ceramic works in this context, these artists and gallerists are not merely signaling a stylistic shift, but asking age-old questions about what qualifies as art. Of course, plenty of modern artists have at least dabbled in ceramics — most of the Fauves took a turn painting on pitchers and platters, and then there are the several thousand ceramic works by Picasso, from plates with faces to vases with tails, some of which were recently on view at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art outside Copenhagen. As Picasso worked in Vallauris, France, an emerging band of California sculptors (Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos, John Mason) made strides in establishing clay as a primary fine art medium. As did Betty Woodman, who started out as a “precocious studio potter,” says Stuart Krimko, the research and editorial director at David Kordansky Gallery, which works closely with the artist’s estate, and who ended up being the first living woman to have a retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art — in 2006. Woodman struggled for most of her career to be taken seriously, in part because she was a woman, in part because she worked in a medium that was relegated to the realm of decorative arts, but her work resisted easy classification. (Krimko mentions her “sort of proto-pillow pitchers that she dubbed erotic burritos.”) According to the sculptor Arlene Shechet, a friend of Woodman’s and a witness to her ongoing frustration with her lack of acceptance, “She’d ask me, ‘Why should we agree to be in any of these ceramic shows?’” Perhaps thanks to battles already waged, today’s contemporary artists seem to be relatively free of hang-ups about turning to clay. In addition to planning a coming retrospective of Woodman’s work, David Kordansky recently exhibited a series of large-scale pots by Ruby Neri depicting naïvely painted female nudes, their breasts in relief and their ponytails doubling as handles. Neri, whose father is the Bay Area sculptor Manuel Neri, trained in painting at U.C.L.A. in the late ’90s and transitioned to making fully ceramic works around 2015. “At first, I didn’t know if I could overcome ceramics’ heavy-handed history,” she says. “And I’d sort of pooh-poohed ceramics in grad school, like a teenager rebelling against their parents, but once I crossed over I realized it allowed me to shed all this debris, like fabricating armatures to put other material on top of, and focus on the enjoyable aspects of making work.” She considers the move a breakthrough, but says she does not feel inclined to push clay to its technical limits, as a traditional ceramist might. Shechet, who makes sculpture in clay as well as in a variety of other mediums, believes there is indeed still a line between fine art and crafts, and that good art is imbued with conceptual rigor and chases a higher aim. “More than any one material, what interests me is making works that are about being human,” says Shechet, whose partly porcelain sculptures will be installed in New York’s Madison Square Park in September. Though one could argue that, especially when compared with, say, bronze, ceramics, these fragile works that can’t help but retain traces of their maker, possess an inherently human quality. This philosophy pertains to work by a new generation of ceramic artists as well. Didi Rojas, a recent Pratt graduate, experiments with sculpting clay shoes — color-blocked Balenciaga sneakers, pearl-studded Gucci boots — expressly not made for walking. (Some of her latest creations are currently up at Andrew Edlin Gallery on the Bowery in downtown Manhattan and are about to go on view at Fisher Parrish in Brooklyn.) “Shoes are self-portraits of their wearers,” Rojas says, “and I like the idea of making something attainable through material, one made of the very ground we walk on.” Woody De Othello, who graduated from California College of the Arts last year and is set to have a solo show at Jessica Silverman Gallery in San Francisco this September, also uses clay, with all its associations of functionality, to build nonfunctional versions of everyday objects, such as a warped air vent or a blocky TV remote. He hopes that viewers will see themselves in the pieces, which droop downward as if they’ve had a long day, and uses a high-gloss, almost reflective glaze to heighten the effect. “A lot of times when people look at my sculptures,” Othello says, “they experience a desire to reach out and touch.” Does he allow it? “It’s definitely not allowed.”",The New York Times
2018,"Fyre Festival Organizer Sold Fake Tickets While Out on Bail, U.S. Says","The disgraced organizer of the Fyre Festival, who was charged last year with wire fraud in connection to the failed event, ran a fraudulent ticket-selling scam for several months while he was out on bail and now faces new charges, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. The announcement came about two months after the organizer, Billy McFarland, pleaded guilty to defrauding investors and vendors of the festival, marketed as a music extravaganza in the Bahamas. He piled up losses of about $26 million and is scheduled to be sentenced next week. In a statement on Tuesday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said that from late 2017 to about March — months after Mr. McFarland had been charged — he ran a company that sold fraudulent tickets to exclusive events like the Met Gala, Burning Man and Coachella. In one case, the authorities said, two customers flew from Florida to New York for the Grammy Awards, only to be turned away at the door. Prosecutors also allege that Mr. McFarland used an email account in the name of another employee of the company he owned, NYC VIP Access, and sent sale proceeds to other people’s financial accounts to try to hide his involvement. In all, they say, Mr. McFarland, 26, defrauded about 15 customers out of about $100,000. Now, in addition to the two counts of wire fraud to which he has already pleaded guilty, prosecutors have charged him with a third count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering. “William McFarland, already awaiting sentencing for a prior fraud scheme, allegedly continued to conduct criminal business as usual,” United States Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. He pleaded guilty to “defrauding investors and vendors of the Fyre Festival, but it is apparent that he did not stop there,” added William F. Sweeney Jr., the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. Each of the three wire fraud charges carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, as does the single count of money laundering. Efforts to reach a lawyer for Mr. McFarland were unsuccessful on Tuesday night. The Fyre Festival — which was billed as an extravagant, opulent experience in the Bahamas — failed in spectacular fashion in April 2017. Hundreds of concertgoers suffered through a disorganized mess filled with soggy tents and cheese sandwiches in foam containers; Blink-182, which was to headline the festival, never performed. The event was such a disaster that several lawsuits were filed seeking millions and alleging fraud, breach of contract and more. The endeavor also became the focus of a criminal investigation. In June 2017, Mr. McFarland was arrested by federal agents at his home in Manhattan and charged with wire fraud. The next day he made his first appearance before a magistrate judge and was released on $300,000 bail. In March, he pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud related to the festival and to his company Fyre Media. He told the federal judge, Naomi Reice Buchwald, that he had begun organizing the festival with good intentions but had “greatly underestimated the resources” it would take. “I lied to investors about various aspects of Fyre Media and my personal finances,” Mr. McFarland said at the time. “I deeply regret my actions.”",The New York Times
2018,"G-7, Manafort, Bourdain: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump brought a defiant swagger to the world’s most exclusive club: the Group of 7. Before he left Washington, he vowed that he would not capitulate on tariffs and called on the group to re-admit Russia. Above, Mr. Trump with the host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. The summit meeting concludes on Saturday. And then Mr. Trump turns his attention to another diplomatic encounter, with even higher stakes: his meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea on Tuesday in Singapore. Our correspondent in Singapore writes that the country’s history as a trading center and neutral diplomatic player makes it one of the few places in the world with relatively cordial ties to both North Korea and the U.S. ____ 2. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, brought new obstruction charges against President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, above. Prosecutors said the new charges related to Mr. Manafort’s efforts to coach the stories of witnesses against him. And they also added charges against an associate of Mr. Manafort, Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence. Separately, President Trump praised the arrest of a former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of an inquiry into leaks of classified information. As part of that investigation, law enforcement officials secretly seized a Times reporter’s phone and email records going back several years. ____ 3. Anthony Bourdain, the globe-trotting CNN host who transformed food writing and TV, was found dead of suicide in his hotel room in France. He was 61. Mr. Bourdain worked for years as a chef before he published a best-selling memoir, “Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,” that elevated him to celebrity status and a new career on TV. He was the witty, connected guide who would tell you things that others wouldn’t, our restaurant critic wrote. The news prompted an outpouring of grief from fellow celebrities and fans, including former President Barack Obama, who shared a meal with Mr. Bourdain in Vietnam in 2016. Here is what to read, what to watch and what to listen to by and about Mr. Bourdain. ____ 4. The U.S. retook the lead in the race to build the world’s speediest supercomputer. A $200 million machine called Summit, above, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, reclaimed the No. 1 place from China. It can make mathematical calculations at the rate of 200 quadrillion per second, or 200 petaflops. For comparison’s sake: If a person performed one calculation a second, he or she would have to live for more than 6.3 billion years to match what the machine can do in a second. ____ 5. The latest from our sports desk: Congratulations to the Washington Capitals, who won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Above, their fans celebrated in the streets. Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals is at 9 p.m. Eastern. (We’ll have live coverage here, and you can watch on ABC.) The Belmont Stakes is Saturday; here are our experts’ picks. (Post time is 6:37 p.m. Eastern, and NBC has the broadcast.) ____ 6. A year after the death of Freddie Gray, a teenager known as Nook was shot and killed by a police officer in Baltimore. Nook’s family is still seeking the truth about how he died. In a new five-part audio series called “Charm City,” we followed them as they searched for answers. Above, his mother, Toby. The series explores what Nook’s case says about Baltimore, race and policing. Listen here. ____ 7. For the first time in modern ballet history, a male dancer is performing as part of the female ensemble at an international ballet company. Chase Johnsey, above, is performing in the English National Ballet’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty” at the Coliseum Theater, as part of the female corps de ballet. The 32-year-old American identifies as gender fluid but uses male pronouns. “I want to be seen as a ballerina,” Mr. Johnsey said. “My hair is up, I wear makeup, female attire. I am able to do female roles and look the part, so that is artistically what I do.” ____ 8. American Muslims say they own guns for the same reasons as anyone else: for protection, for hunting and sport shooting, for gun and rifle collections or for their work. But they also cite another factor: fear of persecution and hate crimes. We sent a photographer around the country to talk to Muslim gun owners about why they decided to arm themselves, and how they’ve been received at gun stores and shooting ranges. They’re often viewed with suspicion or even harassed in such venues. Adam Abutaa, above, a 22-year-old Palestinian-American, told us he still practices at a range with friends: “We’ll just make sure not to talk any Arabic.” ____ 9. On the late-night shows, the hosts made a crack or five about President Trump’s upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. And Stephen Colbert took note of Melania Trump’s re-emergence after surgery. (Mr. Trump also talked to reporters about the first lady on Friday, saying she was doing “great” but still couldn’t travel.) “She saw her shadow, that means at least six more weeks of marriage,” Mr. Colbert quipped. ____ 10. Finally, time for your weekly reminder: It’s not all bad news out there.

2018,G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century,"And then there were none. General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain. The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company’s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company’s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies. [Read about Mr. Flannery’s goal to make G.E. “simpler and easier to operate.”] Over the last year, G.E.’s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index’s 30 components. S. & P. Dow Jones Indices — which owns the Dow — suggested that the slide in G.E.’s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction. “The low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. “Walgreens Boots Alliance’s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.” The move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index “will be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,” Mr. Blitzer said. The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care. And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896. Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison’s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value. [G.E. mirrored the growth of industrial America from the steam age to the age of electricity and beyond.] Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today. After G.E.’s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.",The New York Times
2018,G.E. to Spin Off Health Care Division as Part of Major Reshaping,"When John L. Flannery took over as the chief executive of General Electric last August, he declared that he would not be nostalgic about the industrial giant’s storied past when reshaping the company for the future. He wasn’t kidding. General Electric said on Tuesday that it planned to spin off its health care business and sell its multibillion-dollar stake in Baker Hughes, a major producer of oil field equipment, as Mr. Flannery turns the embattled industrial titan into a much smaller company. The company said it would retain just three major operations: jet engines, electric power generators and wind turbines. Those businesses accounted for 60 percent of the company’s $122 billion in revenue last year. G.E., once the ultimate American conglomerate and a symbol of corporate power, had endured a painful decline in recent years. Executives could not sell the struggling parts fast enough. In the past year, shares in the company have fallen by half, cutting its market value by $120 billion. On Tuesday, in a sign of its waning influence, G.E’s stock was officially dropped from the Dow Jones industrial average, having been one of the Dow index companies since 1896. In November, to help save some money, G.E. announced that it would cut its dividend, only the second time it had done so since the Great Depression. The current plan, Mr. Flannery said in a conference call with analysts, is to create “a simpler, stronger and more focused company.” Shares in the company rose on Tuesday, closing 7.7 percent higher as investors welcomed the change. For decades, G.E. added businesses as varied as home-mortgage lending and entertainment programming with NBCUniversal. The company shed its final stake in the television network and movie studio to Comcast in 2013. The thinking was that its corps of elite managers could make all the divisions profitable, even though they were in far different sectors. Jack Welch, who led G.E. for two decades until 2001, championed that model, becoming a superstar chief executive along the way. But the weakness of the G.E. model eventually became evident, especially when the financial crisis hit. At the time, G.E. was the largest nonbank financial institution in America, and its liabilities weighed on the industrial company. Under Mr. Flannery’s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E. shed much of the finance arm, GE Capital. But Mr. Immelt also made big acquisitions, like building up its oil field machinery business. Soon after, oil prices fell sharply, dragging down profits. Although the decline of the company was obvious when he took over, Mr. Flannery’s challenge quickly looked far more daunting. The troubles at G.E.’s big power turbine business were deeper than expected. And earlier this year, the company took a multibillion-dollar charge and set aside $15 billion to pay for obligations held by its finance unit, mainly on long-term-care insurance policies. The travails were not Mr. Flannery’s work, but he inherited them. It was clear that cost-cutting and getting rid of a few smaller businesses, like the spinoff last month of its railroad business, valued at $11 billion, would not be enough. More drastic action was needed, and Mr. Flannery took it on Tuesday. “G.E. did what it had to do to move forward,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. “The vision makes a lot of sense.” Spinning off the health care business as a separate company, G.E. said, is likely to take 12 to 18 months, and pulling out of Baker Hughes up to three years. The health care unit, which reported $19 billion in revenue last year, makes equipment ranging from M.R.I. machines to products that aid cellular technology research. In an interview, Mr. Flannery, who ran G.E.’s health business before he became chief executive, said his experience led him to conclude that it would do best as a separate company, free to seek investment and opportunities on its own. “In all these decisions, the issue is what is the best environment for these businesses to flourish — and for the shareholders,” Mr. Flannery said. Under the terms of the reorganization, G.E. will spin off a 20 percent stake in its health care unit into a new publicly traded company. It will then divest the rest of its holding to shareholders as a sort of tax-free dividend. G.E. will also sell off its 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes, gained in a merger of its oil and gas division with that publicly traded business in 2016. The proceeds from both moves will help G.E. reduce its net debt by $25 billion by 2020, the company said, strengthening its financial position. Jet engines, electric power generators and wind turbines, Mr. Flannery said, share similar technologies for power generation and propulsion. Their products are long-lived industrial equipment, and G.E. holds strong market positions. There are 65,000 G.E. jet engines in use worldwide, 7,000 power generators and 35,000 wind turbines. “These three are stronger together,” Mr. Flannery said. In the conference call and the interview, Mr. Flannery emphasized that G.E.’s management culture was being overhauled, as well as its portfolio of businesses. Corporate management will be leaner, with most decisions made by the businesses themselves. By 2020, corporate overhead costs will be trimmed by $500 million. Those cuts are in addition to a program to reduce companywide expenses by $2 billion this year. “Our businesses will be the center of gravity,” Mr. Flannery said. That is a conscious departure from the past, when G.E. was regarded to have top-heavy management. Even the company’s use of corporate jets — and in particular the use of an empty second jet to follow the one that carried Mr. Immelt — had been criticized as wasteful. The development of digital technology and advanced manufacturing, Mr. Flannery said, will remain vital to G.E. But the individual businesses will decide how much and whether they want to essentially buy that expertise from G.E.’s research labs and digital unit. Much of the research at its labs, Mr. Flannery said, is consumed by the three businesses that will remain part of G.E. But the labs, he added, will have to make changes to sustain a strong research capability, perhaps including doing contract research for outside customers. The digital technology center in San Ramon, Calif., had as many as 2,000 workers last summer. But the work force has shrunk since then. G.E. invested billions of dollars in that unit, begun in 2011. “There will be no cost drag from digital by 2020,” Mr. Flannery said.",The New York Times
2018,G.I. Joes Taught This Artist About Storytelling ,"The Story of a Thing Hank Willis Thomas on how playing with action figures shaped his childhood — and still informs his work today. In this series for T, Emily Spivack, the author of “Worn Stories,” interviews creative types about their most prized possessions. The conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas’ work moves fluidly between politics and pop culture. Here, Thomas — whose show, “Black Survival Guide, Or How to Live Through a Police Riot,” opens at the Delaware Art Museum on July 14 — reflects on how the time spent with his friends playing with G.I. Joe action figures influenced the work he makes today. I started collecting G.I. Joe figures with Kung Fu Grip when I was 5 years old. They were given to me for my birthday, for holidays, or I’d trade with a friend. I have over a hundred of them. The way you played with G.I. Joes was shaped by what you understood the character’s history to be. The figures were grown — they were representations of adults, typically in military uniforms, who had specific names, back stories, and jobs. You could manipulate their bodies, bending their arms and knees, rotating their hips and shoulders, and sometimes even their hands and necks. So you become both omniscient, but also a manipulator of existing situations. It was the early ’80s, this time of gung-ho Americana. Music and culture from the late period of the Cold War was pervasive. Then these G.I. Joe action figures, real American heroes, were giving children license to author scenarios based around violence before they could even read. There was no consequence to that violence. Death was insignificant. You could always revive Storm Shadow, Duke, Lady Jaye or Hawk by picking them up and bringing them back to life. If you needed someone to get saved, you’d bring them to Doc, who was a black doctor, the only doctor, which was an interesting choice to me. A group of my friends would get together where I lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to play with G.I. Joes. We’d figure out the set-up — what was happening, who was going to be relevant to the story, how it was different from last time, and which characters would die. That seems like a lot of work. I’d love to watch what it was like now. It’s not like we were actually doing physical activity; it was us telling each other a story collaboratively. Maybe it seems cliché, but I do a lot of that now, collaborative storytelling. I even used these action figures in 2005 to make a short film with my friend Kambui Olujimi about my cousin’s murder, called “Winter in America.” From the elements of pop culture to the way I critique American identity and values in my work, playing with G.I. Joes was my training ground. This interview has been edited and condensed.",The New York Times
2018,G.M. Says New Wave of Trump Tariffs Could Force U.S. Job Cuts,"General Motors warned Friday that if President Trump pushed ahead with another wave of tariffs, the move could backfire, leading to “less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages” for its employees. The automaker said that the president’s threat to impose tariffs on imports of cars and car parts — along with an earlier spate of penalties — could drive vehicle prices up by thousands of dollars. The “hardest hit” cars, General Motors said in comments submitted to the Commerce Department, are likely to be the ones bought by consumers who can least afford an increase. Demand would suffer and production would slow, all of which “could lead to a smaller G.M.” The president has promoted tariffs as a way to protect American businesses and workers, aiming at dozens of nations with metal tariffs, as well as bringing broader levies against Chinese goods. But companies, which rely on other markets for sales, production and materials, have been increasingly vocal about the potential damage from his policies. The warning by G.M., echoed in comments by trade groups and other automakers, could test the president’s aggressive approach to trade and his commitment to business. In the past, Mr. Trump has lauded General Motors for its job creation and vowed to defend the auto industry. A G.M. spokeswoman, Dayna Hart, said that the company had no contingency plans calling for job cuts, but that such a move was “something that could happen.” “We are still assessing the impact,” she added. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. G.M. and other industry leaders are caught in the middle of an escalating trade war that has prompted retaliation from the European Union, Mexico, Canada and China. Last month, Mr. Trump ordered an investigation into whether imported cars and automotive components pose a national security risk, calling for penalties expected to be as high as 25 percent. The administration has already put levies on imported steel and aluminum, and is about place tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. G.M. and other automakers rely heavily on parts and materials from overseas to build their cars. The president’s threat to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement could hurt the industry’s supply chain, which integrates operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. “If there’s a full-blown trade war, it will be pretty tough for the auto industry and consumers,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at AutoTrader.com. “Consumers are already facing headwinds in credit and average prices going up,” she said. “If you add a tariff, my guess is a lot of people just won’t buy new cars.” The increasingly global nature of automotive supply chains has left manufacturers especially exposed. This week, Harley-Davidson said it would move some of its production outside of the United States to avoid retaliatory measures by the European Union. The company said it was the only “sustainable option” to “maintain a viable business in Europe.” The decision invoked the ire of the president, who quickly threatened punitive taxes. He accused the Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker, which he had cited as a poster child of American manufacturing, of having “surrendered.” Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which has several plants in the United States, is also considering other manufacturing options, according to a Bloomberg interview with Bob Lee, an executive overseeing powertrains for the company. “It’s contingency planning on a massive scale — supply-based planning, logistics planning, vehicle-build location planning,” Mr. Lee told Bloomberg on Thursday. “This is not trivial, and it’s been going on for awhile.” G.M. and its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, have been at odds before with the Trump administration. Last year, after Mr. Trump blamed both white supremacists and the groups protesting them for violence in Charlottesville, Va., Ms. Barra and other executives weighed disbanding an elite council formed to advise the president on economic issues. Mr. Trump shut down the group before they could dissolve it. In January, Ms. Barra said Nafta should be modernized, but not scrapped entirely. Mr. Trump has suggested that the United States withdraw from the trade pact or renegotiate it. In criticizing prospective auto tariffs, G.M. played heavily on its position as one of the country’s largest employers. The company said it had 47 manufacturing locations, 25 service-part facilities and 110,000 employees in the United States, where it conducts most of its research and development, design, engineering and other work. G.M. suggested that additional tariffs would put American companies at a disadvantage in the midst of a “fast-paced transportation revolution led by cutting-edge technologies.” Its investments in jobs and operations at home, the carmaker said, are critical to this effort. “The economic fortitude of companies like ours directly supports the economic strength of the nation, which, in turn, contributes to the security posture of the United States,” the company said. The Commerce Department will hold public hearings in a few weeks on the auto tariffs, before it releases the results of its investigation. The government said it had received 2,500 comments already and expected more by the deadline on Friday. “The purpose of the comment period,” the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said in a statement, was “to make sure that all stakeholders’ views are heard, both pro and con.” “That will enable us to make our best informed recommendation to the president,” he added. In a highly intertwined, global car industry, a trade war can play out in unexpected and costly ways. American automakers, which export an estimated two million vehicles, increasingly rely on global sales as a buffer in tough times. Retaliatory tariffs from Europe or China could weaken their overseas business. They also depend heavily on parts from foreign suppliers. G.M. has said that its supply chain sprawls across 20,000 businesses worldwide and is an operation of “great breadth, scope and complexity.” European and Japanese automakers are major employers in the United States, supplying hundreds of thousands of jobs. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, recently issued a profit warning, in part blaming tit-for-tat measures for weakness in its sales of S.U.V.s, which are built in Alabama. The German automaker BMW, which has a large factory in South Carolina, said in a comment about tariffs that the protectionist approach would make American companies less incentivized to improve their productivity. “The deeper the economic ties from trade and integrated value chains, the more costly conflict would be, and therefore the more unlikely it is to occur,” BMW said. Toyota wrote in its submission to the Commerce Department that the cost of its popular Camry sedan would rise $1,800 if subject to new tariffs. The car is built in Kentucky while sourcing 30 percent of its materials from abroad. The Japanese automaker said that the tariff, if approved, would be terribly timed. The auto industry is at a vulnerable point in its sales cycle, exiting a long stretch of record growth and heading into a period of weaker demand. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Washington-based trade group that represents foreign and American companies, was more specific. With a 25 percent tariff, the average price of an imported vehicle would rise by $5,800, the group said in a statement. Annual sales would slide by one to two million vehicles. And production would slip 1.5 percent, causing 195,000 workers in the United States to lose their jobs.",The New York Times
2018,G.O.P. Lawmakers Hope Trump’s Border Action Heads Off Political Threat,"On Washington WASHINGTON — Washington moves slowly except in times of crisis — political crisis that is. Beleaguered Republican members of Congress breathed a momentary sigh of relief on Wednesday after President Trump suddenly relented and took steps to stop the separation of immigrant children from their parents after they illegally entered the country along the southern border. With the midterm elections less than six months away, Republicans trying to hold their majorities in the House and Senate were desperate for quick action that would bring an end to heartbreaking images of crying toddlers who had been taken from stunned parents. They were well aware that the situation was inciting public outrage at a level that threatened to oust some Republican lawmakers from their congressional seats come November. “America is better than this inhumane, anti-family zero-tolerance policy,” the office of Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican in the Senate, declared again in a tweet on Wednesday morning, hours before the president announced his retreat. But Republicans are not out of the woods yet. The president’s grudging executive order, which took a shot at Congress for its “failure to act,” is likely to be only a temporary respite in the standoff over immigration. Congress is still struggling to resolve myriad issues, including the fate of undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, as well as Mr. Trump’s demand for $25 billion to build a wall along the southwestern border, with the House facing a series of difficult votes Thursday on the immigration question. At the same time, Democrats are unlikely to let the subject go. They always intended to press immigration as a major topic in many 2018 contests, and the public’s furor at the separation of families only validated that approach. It was unclear what effect the president’s decision would have on those legislative efforts. Some lawmakers said measures were still needed to make permanent the president’s executive order and to clarify how families should be treated. But others suggested that the order would relieve the pressure on the House and Senate to move ahead. “It’ll take the heat off Congress doing it, and you’ll still have the uncertainty,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who leads the Judiciary Committee. “It takes care of political problems, but it doesn’t take care of the policy problem,” he said, adding, “and that’s too bad.” Republican congressional offices had been deluged with calls and emails from incensed constituents and lawmakers facing protests back home. The intense scrutiny energized Democrats and put them on the offensive, drowning out attempts by Republicans to focus on issues more to their liking, such as their tax cuts. Politics aside, many Republicans said that they were simply appalled by the policy on humanitarian grounds and that it needed to end immediately. “I’m very glad that the president is going to bring a halt to this atrocious practice,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who, along with Mr. Hatch and other Republicans, wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions urging him to end the policy in the interest of “ordinary human decency.” The politics were clearly bad for Republicans, particularly those most at risk in November. Mr. Trump’s tough talk on immigration might rally his most devoted followers and be a good platform for 2020, but this is 2018. The Republicans most in danger of losing in November are in swing and suburban districts — many carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 — and those photographs from the border were not playing well. Republicans were already struggling with female voters, and the separation policy was definitely not going to build support with that core voting group. Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, acknowledged that if the issue remained unresolved, it could damage his party heading into the midterm elections. “Certainly if this doesn’t get fixed soon, there could be a cost,” he said, though he noted that he was not worried about his own district. One vivid illustration of the perceived potency of the matter was that every Senate Democrat — including those seeking re-election in states carried by Mr. Trump — signed on to a measure ending the practice introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Those so-called red-state Democrats are often leery of breaking too publicly with the president because of his popularity in their states, but in this case, they did not hold back. One of them, Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat in a difficult re-election battle against Gov. Rick Scott, took to the floor on Wednesday to assail Mr. Trump and his policy. “It has always been an American value to keep families together even when you are adjudicating the lawful or unlawful status of the parents,” Mr. Nelson said. Several Republicans noted that experience has shown that immigration politics can be tricky and that Democrats could overplay their hand. Democrats prompted a government shutdown in January over an immigration stalemate but quickly relented after deciding it was a miscalculation to press the issue too far. Republicans also said that in the current chaotic political environment, gauging which issues have staying power and which do not is difficult. While Republicans in Washington were nervous about the fallout of holding the children from their parents, challengers to some of the Democrats running in red states were going on the attack, portraying incumbents such as Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania as proponents of an “open border” policy. On Twitter, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, tried to broaden that message, accusing Democrats of being the “party of illegal immigration while Rs are party of legal immigration.” But the president’s quick reversal after multiple definitive declarations that his hands were tied — combined with the palpable Republican relief at the policy change — made it very clear that the party knew it was on the wrong side of the debate. Now the question is whether the president’s action will be enough to quiet the public clamor over the decision to tear children from their families.",The New York Times
2018,"G.O.P. Moves to End Trump’s Family Separation Policy, but Can’t Agree How","WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans moved on Tuesday to defuse an escalating political crisis over immigration, but failed to agree on how to end President Trump’s policy of separating immigrant children from parents who cross illegally into the United States. The Senate had one plan, and the House another. Mr. Trump remained defiant, refusing to act on his own. In a fiery address to a group of small-business executives, Mr. Trump falsely blamed Democrats for the separation crisis and demanded a broad overhaul of the United States’ immigration laws, a process that would take months. At the same time, he belittled one of the central ideas behind the effort by Senate Republicans to immediately stop separating families on the Mexican border. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that “all of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together,” endorsing quick passage of a narrow bill to provide legal authority to detain parents and children together while the courts consider their status. In the House, Republicans vowed to press ahead with votes this week on a pair of more sweeping immigration bills — one drafted by conservatives and the other a compromise measure between conservatives and moderates — that address the family separation issue to different degrees, while also strengthening border security and making other changes to the country’s immigration system. In an hourlong meeting on Capitol Hill with House Republicans, Mr. Trump declined to explicitly back either one, saying he would sign both bills. Republican leaders are trying to rally support for the compromise bill. “The president was very firm in explaining why it’s so important that he gets this bill to his desk so that we can solve some problems and secure our border,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip. He added, “We want to secure our border; we want to reunite kids. Our bill does just that.” Mr. McConnell said he planned to reach out to Democrats to support his conference’s effort, hoping to stanch the political damage from the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy that has led to heartbreaking stories of children separated from their mothers. But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, immediately shot down the Republican approach, saying that Mr. Trump could — and should — use his executive authority, not legislation, to quickly end the family separations. “Anyone who believes this Republican Congress is capable of addressing this issue is kidding themselves,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “The president can end this crisis with the flick of his pen, and he needs to do so now.” Mr. Trump has the power on his own to change that zero-tolerance policy at the border, which would once again allow border agents and prosecutors the discretion to allow families to remain together after crossing illegally into the United States. But it would also allow those families to be released while their court proceedings go forward, something Mr. Trump opposes. In his afternoon speech, Mr. Trump dismissed as “crazy” a proposal by Senate Republicans to expedite processing of immigrant families by hiring hundreds of new immigration judges. Rejecting a proposal by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to increase personnel in immigration courts with the hiring of 375 new judges, Mr. Trump suggested that many of the immigration judges could be corrupt, and he said that some lawyers who appear in their courtrooms are “bad people.” “They said, ‘Sir, we’d like to hire about five or six thousand more judges,’” Mr. Trump said in a long and rambling speech to the National Federation of Independent Business. “Five or six thousand? Now, can you imagine the graft that must take place? You’re all small-business owners, so I know you can’t imagine a thing like that would happen.” Mr. Trump has for weeks been urging lawmakers to pass broad legislation to overhaul the nation’s immigration system, including hard-line changes that would crack down on asylum seekers, reduce visas and spend $25 billion to build a wall on the southwestern border. Doing so, he said, would have ended the need for a zero-tolerance policy by allowing families to be quickly deported. Broad immigration legislation was supposed to be the subject of the meeting with Republican House members on Tuesday evening. But in his speech, the president also vowed to rewrite Republican immigration legislation to his liking. “We have a House that’s getting ready to finalize an immigration package that they are going to brief me on later, and I’m going to make changes,” Mr. Trump said. Lawmakers later said that the president gave no indication that he wanted to change anything about their legislation. Aides to Mr. Trump said he later told the House Republicans: “I’m with you 100 percent.” During the meeting with the lawmakers, Mr. Trump took no questions and veered from immigration to trade to North Korea — and he took a swipe at Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who lost his primary race after Mr. Trump opposed him. The president called him “nasty.” Mr. Sanford was not present to defend himself — his flight was delayed in Charleston — but in a telephone interview on Tuesday night, he said that the attack was “a sign of the times in terms of the way this president operates.” Noting the gravity of the issues that were the ostensible reason for the gathering, Mr. Sanford said with a note of incredulity: “You’re going to use that meeting to shoot at somebody you already killed?” In his speech to the National Federation of Independent Business, Mr. Trump was greeted by enthusiastic applause. Two other leading business groups — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable — condemned the practice of separating children from their parents. The Business Roundtable called it “cruel and contrary to American values.” The chamber’s top official said that “this is not who we are, and it must end now.” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, announced Tuesday on Twitter that he would withdraw four members of the Maryland National Guard, and their helicopter, from the southwestern border until “this policy of separating children from their families has been rescinded.” By Wednesday morning, governors from at least eight states had announced they would withhold or recall National Guard troops from efforts to secure the United States’ border with Mexico. But the broadest Republican opposition to the Trump administration’s policy was in the Senate. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and 12 other senators sent a letter to the Justice Department asking the administration to stop the separation of families until Congress can pass legislation. Mr. Hatch told reporters on Monday that the separation policy was “not American.” “As I have said for the last several weeks,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement, “I oppose the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents. This is counter to our values.” Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said he was working on legislation that would keep families together while increasing the number of federal immigration judges so court hearings could be expedited. “We’re overwhelming the system,” Mr. Johnson said. “We don’t have enough detention units for family units.” He added, “We would probably need to build more, identify more detention facilities, certify them so we can keep the families together.” In the House, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, introduced a measure that his office said “more easily allows for family units to stay together,” while also limiting the number of asylum claims. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump continued to falsely blame Democrats for forcing the separations and calling for Congress to enact hard-line changes to immigration laws that he says would make the zero-tolerance policy at the border unnecessary. “Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!” Later in the morning, Trump administration officials defended their treatment of children who had been separated from their parents at the border, describing a network of shelters in 17 states that provided education, counseling, health care services and playtime until children were reunited with their parents. Officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services insisted to reporters that the children in their custody were treated humanely. The officials said 2,342 were children who crossed the border illegally from May 5 to June 9 and were taken from a parent to allow the adult to be charged and detained. Once the parents were taken to detention, those children were reclassified by the government as “unaccompanied children,” and quickly sent to the Health and Human Services shelters. But the officials disputed charges of mistreatment of those children, saying that the agencies were subject to strict rules about how children were cared for. The facilities are “staffed by people who know how to deal with the needs, particularly of younger children,” said Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families. Mr. Wagner said that “the children in our care are receiving a full range of services.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | G.O.P. Wants Hungry Kids to Fund Tax Cuts,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. After tearing apart immigrant families until shamed by international outrage, President Trump and his party have now turned to endangering vulnerable American children. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, if House Republicans get their way, more than two million people, many of them young children, will lose access to the food stamp program known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). The farm bill that passed by a two-vote margin on Thursday includes tougher work requirements and new eligibility restrictions that would make it much more difficult for families who need food assistance to get it. The Agriculture Department administers SNAP. If the president gets his way, SNAP would be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services. And the name of that department, which already oversees other social programs like Medicare and Medicaid, would be changed to include the word “welfare,” which holds about the same amount of appeal for Republicans as “Communists” once did. The goal of these maneuvers is twofold: to stigmatize such programs — racially stigmatize them for white voters — and to make them easier to cut or eliminate. Let’s be clear. Welfare usually refers to a type of cash assistance that has all but disappeared. SNAP, by contrast, is a legally mandated benefit program. Just like Social Security and Medicare, it provides crucial assistance through a provision that’s been written into law. Some 42 million poor and working-class Americans use SNAP benefits to buy groceries. A vast majority of them are elderly, disabled or children. Of the people who are both of working age and able-bodied, most do have jobs. They simply don’t earn enough to feed themselves consistently. These working-age adults already face several requirements and restrictions on how much SNAP aid they can receive. For example, they must register with SNAP and accept any job offered to them, or any training program that they are assigned to. Unless they are older than 49 or raising children, they must also verify, on a monthly basis, that they are working or in job training at least part time (after a three-month grace period). The new bill would expand these work requirements to include people up to the age of 59, and those with children older than 6. It would also tighten the rules so that anyone who fails to comply loses coverage for a full year the first time, and for three years each subsequent time. Proponents say the point of such policies is to nudge people into full employment. Helping the unemployed and underemployed obtain jobs that can support them is a laudable goal. But the fact that Republicans have chosen such a widely debunked approach to achieve this goal undermines the party’s credibility. History and research have shown that stringent work requirements are good at forcing people off benefit rosters but terrible at lifting them out of poverty. To help figure out what does work, Congress funded 10 pilot projects in individual states four years back, when it last renewed the farm bill. Those programs are testing different approaches to job training and job creation. They are an example of exactly the kind of evidence-based policy that House Speaker Paul Ryan says he wants. If he and his colleagues were truly interested in lifting people out of poverty, they would wait, just a couple years more, until the data from those pilots were in before creating additional barriers to food assistance for vulnerable families. Saving money is also a worthy aim. But let’s be honest about what we’re saving it for, especially if we’re going to take food out of children’s mouths to do it. The Republicans’ recent tax cut made the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans wealthier, did little or nothing for average workers and added $1.5 trillion to the national debt. The party that passed that law is now using the resulting debt to rationalize taking grocery money, health care and other essentials from the disabled, retirees, and families with children. Fortunately, there is some hope on the horizon. The president’s proposal is likely to be a very long shot. And the Senate’s farm bill — which, unlike the House’s, has bipartisan support — takes a much more palatable approach to food assistance. It would expand the SNAP pilot programs and streamline existing work requirements so that fewer eligible people are inadvertently denied benefits. It would also increase funding for another farm bill provision known as the Emergency Food Assistance Program. That bill is expected on the Senate floor next week. Let’s hope that common sense and basic human decency prevail when it arrives.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | G.O.P. to Americans With Health Problems: Drop Dead,"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Polls suggest that the public considers health care the most important issue in the midterm elections. This immediately raises the question: Do voters understand what’s at stake? In particular, do they realize that if Republicans hold Congress, they will strip away protections for the 52 million Americans — more than a quarter of nonelderly adults — who have pre-existing conditions that, before passage of the Affordable Care Act, could have led insurers to deny them coverage? In fact, the Trump administration is already trying to take away those protections via the courts. It probably won’t succeed. But it might, in which case an estimated 17 million Americans would lose their health coverage. And even if the lawsuit fails, the administration’s support for an incredibly flimsy legal challenge — one so indefensible that three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case — is a clear signal of Republican priorities: G.O.P. to Americans with health problems: Drop dead. By the way, some people seem surprised by the administration’s moves here, since Donald Trump has promised many times to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But remember: The campaign against the Affordable Care Act has been based on lies every step of the way. First there were lies about what was actually in the act. Remember “death panels”? Then there were lies about the law’s effects. For a while, the Koch brothers-financed group Americans for Prosperity was running ads featuring supposedly real stories of Americans facing terrible hardships because of the A.C.A. But none — none — of these stories stood up to fact-checking. So the ads became vaguer and vaguer, and eventually featured actors pretending to be A.C.A. victims rather than featuring real victims, who were apparently too hard to find. But the most enduring lie from A.C.A. opponents — not just Trump, but all of them — is their claim that they want to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. They don’t, and they never did. You can see why they claim otherwise. A huge majority of voters, including 59 percent of Republicans, want to maintain rules that prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on someone’s medical history. So there is a powerful incentive to pretend that you’ll protect people with past health problems. But the falseness of the pretense has always been obvious. This falsity was obvious on sheer logical grounds even before Republicans began proposing supposed replacements for Obamacare. If you’re going to guarantee coverage regardless of medical history, you have to induce people to sign up for insurance while they’re still healthy, so that insurers have a manageable risk pool. That means some combination of subsidies to make insurance affordable and penalties for going uninsured — in other words, it requires a system that looks a lot like the Affordable Care Act. So demands that the A.C.A. be scrapped always meant taking away coverage from the people who need it most; Obamacare opponents just hoped people wouldn’t notice that fact. And the truth is that they mostly got away with it until last year, when Republicans had to offer specific health care legislation. At that point the game was up. It immediately became clear that every Republican alternative to Obamacare would, in fact, hang Americans with pre-existing conditions out to dry. And the public backlash against that revelation is basically the reason the G.O.P.’s repeal effort failed. But it only failed narrowly. And if Republicans still hold Congress next year, anyone who has a history of medical problems and doesn’t get health insurance from his or her employer will lose coverage. In fact, even getting a job with insurance coverage might not be enough: If the Trump-supported lawsuit succeeds, employers could refuse to cover new employees’ pre-existing conditions. What may seem puzzling about all this is the cruelty. O.K., Donald Trump is obviously a man utterly lacking in empathy. But don’t other Republicans feel a bit bad about the prospect of taking health care away from millions of Americans who have done nothing wrong besides having past medical problems? Actually, no. Consider Rick Scott, the governor of Florida (and current Senate candidate), whose attorney general has joined the lawsuit to eliminate protection for pre-existing conditions. While refusing to say whether he supports the suit, Scott declared, “We’ve got to reward people for caring for themselves.” Right, because if you get cancer, or arthritis, or multiple sclerosis — all among the pre-existing conditions for which people used to be denied coverage — it must be your own fault. By the way, a note to older Florida voters: You may think that none of this matters to you, because you’re covered by Medicare. If so, think again: If Republicans win in November, they’ll be coming after Medicare next, to offset the cost of their tax cut. Who says so? They do. So, as I said, voters need to understand the stakes in these midterms. They will determine whether people with medical problems get the health care they need.",The New York Times

2018,Gabrielle Hamilton Plans to Partner With Ken Friedman to Run the Spotted Pig,"The chef Gabrielle Hamilton says she is joining with Ken Friedman, who has been accused of sexual harassment by women who worked at his restaurants, to run the Spotted Pig, the West Village restaurant where much of the harassment is said to have taken place. Ms. Hamilton, the chef and owner of Prune restaurant, in the East Village, said in an interview on Wednesday that she was pursuing a partnership in which she and her wife, Ashley Merriman, would become chefs and co-owners of the Spotted Pig with Mr. Friedman. “We don’t have a deal, but we’re going to make one,” Ms. Hamilton said. “We’re going to be chef-owners. We’re going to run the Pig.” Mr. Friedman could not be reached directly, and a representative for him had no comment. The announcement shocked many in the food business, who had not imagined that such a prominent female chef would collaborate with Mr. Friedman; his previous business partner, the chef April Bloomfield, announced a week ago that she had ended their relationship. On social media and in interviews, people said they were caught off guard by what they saw as Ms. Hamilton’s disregard for Mr. Friedman’s behavior. “It’s shocking and disappointing news and a lot of women are upset, myself included,” said Kerry Diamond, editor of Cherry Bombe, a food magazine focused on women. Jen Agg, a restaurant owner and writer in Toronto who has become an outspoken voice for women in the restaurant industry, wrote in an email: “It’s bonkers, but more important, it’s callous and self-serving. I was once a great admirer of Gabrielle, in an industry where there are so few women to look up to, but sadly, after paying closer attention the last few years, I’m shocked, but not surprised by this.” The Atlanta chef Anne Quatrano, however, called Ms. Hamilton’s proposed deal “fantastic.” “If anybody can turn that situation it would be her,” she said. “She’s got the backbone for it.” Ms. Quatrano brushed off critics who think Ms. Hamilton should not be doing business with Mr. Friedman. “Sometimes you have to be in bed with the devil to control him,” she said. Ms. Hamilton said that she was proud of the work environment she has built with Ms. Merriman at Prune — last month Ms. Hamilton won the James Beard Foundation’s top award, for the nation’s Outstanding Chef — and that they are eager to bring it to the Spotted Pig. “Everyone gets so excited when José Andrés goes into these natural disasters and helps people,” Ms. Hamilton said, referring to the Spanish-American chef who received praise for his relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria last fall. “They ought to be happy that these two women are going into a man-made disaster to help make things right.” Ms. Hamilton was criticized extensively on social media for comparing her business decision to a humanitarian effort. Women who worked at the Spotted Pig and left because of Mr. Friedman’s behavior said they were stunned by Ms. Hamilton’s move. “It’s shocking and unfathomable why as a female chef, as a queer woman, Gabrielle would align herself with a sexual harasser and help bail this man out,” said Natalie Saibel, one of the two dozen employees who went on the record with their stories in a December report in The New York Times. A longtime server at the Spotted Pig, she was fired in 2015 after bringing a complaint against Mr. Friedman. After the Times report was published, Mr. Friedman said that “some incidents were not as described, but apologized for behavior that “can accurately be described at times as abrasive, rude and frankly wrong.” He said he was stepping away from daily operations at the seven restaurants he owned with Ms. Bloomfield, including the Breslin Bar & Dining Room in Manhattan, Tosca Café in San Francisco and their flagship, the Spotted Pig. On June 6, Ms. Bloomfield announced that they had ended their 14-year collaboration. She is taking over the Hearth & Hound in Los Angeles and Tosca Café, and will remain the chef at the Breslin and the John Dory Oyster Bar, both in the Ace Hotel in Midtown. The Spotted Pig is the locus of some of the most serious accusations of sexual harassment and assault that have rocked the restaurant world in recent months. The New York Police Department is investigating a claim that the celebrity chef Mario Batali sexually assaulted a woman in the private party room on the restaurant’s third floor. In the Times report, more than two dozen former employees of the Spotted Pig and other restaurants owned by Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield described an unusually sexualized and coercive work environment, which included text requests for naked pictures and forced kisses from Mr. Friedman, and groping and harassment from Mr. Batali and other customers. Ms. Bloomfield has been criticized for not doing more to stop the behavior and protect workers. In announcing her split from Mr. Friedman, she said she was turning her focus to the welfare of her staff and building a company she could be proud of. Through a representative, she declined to comment on Ms. Hamilton’s move. Ms. Hamilton opened Prune in 1999. She married Ms. Merriman in 2016, and at Prune the couple share the duties and title of chef. They will do so at the Spotted Pig as well, Ms. Hamilton said. Ms. Hamilton, who is a contributor to The New York Times Magazine, said the Spotted Pig, an international culinary destination that has won a Michelin star, and its nearly 100 employees needed help in the wake of the accusations against Mr. Friedman. She said she and Ms. Merriman view themselves as “exceptionally poised to be the leading edge of the paradigm shift,” and are not becoming partners with Mr. Friedman to offer him any kind of redemption. Ms. Hamilton said her goal was to “honor and respect April’s magnificent work, to be one of the luckier things that ever happened to Ken Friedman, to be women in business of increasing power and to get paid for our impeccable work.” The ending of Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield’s partnership can be compared to a divorce, Ms. Hamilton said. “We can follow that metaphor for a single beat further and say we are going to be the second marriage,” she said. “As everyone knows, it is a bittersweet truth. Everyone is a better spouse their second time around.” Other chefs pushed back on that notion. “There are certain people that will never be great spouses,” said Jessica Koslow, the chef of Sqirl in Los Angeles. An earlier version of this article misstated the year Prune opened. It was 1999, not 2000.",The New York Times
2018,Game On! Legislature Approves Sports Betting in New Jersey,"TRENTON — New Jersey moved one step closer on Thursday to making it easier for gamblers to be separated from their money. The State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting, paving the way for casinos and racetracks to take wages and providing the state with a new source of revenue. It is likely a matter of days now before cash can start changing hands at casinos in Atlantic City and at Monmouth Park Racetrack near the Jersey Shore and perhaps take advantage of the global interest in the World Cup, which begins next week, or the National Basketball Association finals. The last remaining hurdle is the signature of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, who supports sports betting but has not said publicly when he would sign the bill into law. The bill’s passage represents a capstone to the more than six-year effort to bring sports betting to New Jersey and helps spur interest in and provide a financial boost to the struggling casino and horse racing industries. Last month, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited commercial sports betting in most states. Although Delaware beat New Jersey in opening the betting window, allowing gambling to begin Tuesday, New Jersey is the first state to officially make wagering legal in a state where it had been prohibited since the Supreme Court’s decision. Delaware had been grandfathered in for select betting options. As states around the country rush to legalize sports betting, which some estimate was worth $150 billion a year on the black market, New Jersey’s regulations could serve as a template for dealing with some challenges that come with introducing the practice. In an effort to provide more revenue to brick-and-mortar gambling halls, the law imposes an 8.5 percent tax on in-person wagers but a 13 percent tax on bets made online or on mobile devices. In-person bets also carry a 1.25 percent fee to help communities where venues are based. The disparity is similar to laws already regulating online casino gaming in the state. It helps offset the larger expense for running venues. Online wagering will not begin until 30 days after the law is signed. Some legal experts said starting online wagering quickly is essential. Cutting into the black market, where gamblers can place bets from the comfort of their couches, will require making legal betting as effortless as possible. “You’re providing less of an incentive to customers to enter or migrate over from a black market to legal and regulated channels,” said Daniel L. Wallach, a lawyer from Florida who has followed New Jersey’s sports betting efforts. “Convenience will always trump driving 20 or 30 miles.” The amount of money that the state can expect to reap from sports betting is unclear. Some lawmakers have estimated that wagering could yield as much as $100 million during the first year, but the state treasurer, Elizabeth Muoio, has put it much lower, at $13 million. What the state’s law does make clear is that no money will go to any professional sports league. In a contentious hearing on Monday, Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and the Professional Golfers Association lobbied for an “integrity tax” to help pay for increased security to protect against cheating and to enhance statistical operations for real-time data used for in-game betting. Lawmakers were not moved. “You guys are in it to make money,” said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a Democrat from northern New Jersey and chairman of the Tourism, Gaming and the Arts committee. “This is hypocrisy. Nine years of fighting the State of New Jersey, and you come here? It’s disgraceful. Just a suggestion: You may want to write a check to the State of New Jersey for $9 million.” That was a reference to the state’s cost to fight the leagues in court. The bill sets the legal betting age at 21, even though the age to bet on horse races in New Jersey is 18. It allows betting on all professional sports, but it bans betting on collegiate athletics that take place in New Jersey or on college teams from New Jersey, like Seton Hall and Rutgers. The bill also bans betting on high school games and on the increasingly popular electronic sports leagues. The bill was amended at the last minute to allow betting before Mr. Murphy signs the legislation. That could let Monmouth Park, which has a sports betting operation ready to go, welcome gamblers as soon as Friday. But Dennis A. Drazin, the operator of Monmouth Park, said he was hoping to open on Friday, but would wait for Mr. Murphy’s blessing. “If it comes down to the governor telling me no, I’m going to do what the governor says,” he said. Daniel Bryan, a spokesman for Mr. Murphy, said the governor’s office was reviewing the bill, but could not say when the governor planned to sign it. “The governor has long been supportive of New Jersey’s right to allow sports betting and he wants to ensure that the proposed regulatory scheme is fair and reasonable,” Mr. Bryan said in a statement. Mr. Drazin is eager to get his license so he can start taking bets on Friday for the next game in the N.B.A. finals and the first game of the Yankees-Mets Subway Series. The Borgata casino in Atlantic City is also poised to take bets as soon as Mr. Murphy signs the bill. However, the Golden Nugget casino is excluded from taking bets on the N.B.A. because its owner, Tilman Fertitta, is an owner of basketball’s Houston Rockets. Jeffrey Gural, the chief executive of the Meadowlands Racetrack, said he expects to announce a partner for his sports betting operation in the coming days. As the closest venue to New York, and with the Jets and Giants playing in a stadium next door, Mr. Gural said the bill was a long time coming. “I think five years from now, people will look back on this and wonder why it took so long for the sports teams to recognize what they already recognized in Europe, that this was part of the culture of America and watching sports,” he said. Taking a victory lap at the State House was Raymond Lesniak, a former state senator who lead the fight for sports betting in the Legislature. Carrying a blue New York Giants hat in a brown bag, Mr. Lesniak said he was hoping he could bet Friday at Monmouth Park. “I’m taking the Giants to win the Super Bowl,” he said, before putting the cap on his head and raising his eyebrows. “It’s 40-1.”",The New York Times
2018,Gang ‘Hunting’ for Rivals Is Said to Have Mistakenly Killed Teenager,"The gang members roamed the Belmont section of the Bronx with machetes and knives, “hunting,” looking to exact revenge against their rivals, investigators said. They wanted blood. Instead of targeting a gang member, however, the Trinitarios dragged 15-year-old Lesandro Guzman-Feliz from a bodega and stabbed him repeatedly in what the police said was a chilling case of mistaken identity. But even as police officials announced an eighth arrest in last week’s gruesome killing that was captured on video, investigators were still working on Tuesday to piece together what prompted the attack on Lesandro. The Trinitarios, a vicious Dominican gang based in New York, are believed to be responsible for a wave of violence in that section of the Bronx, including a stabbing on Monday in Bronx River Park that left a 14-year-old boy in critical condition, the police said. Investigators said they believe the two incidents are linked. The men who attacked Lesandro believed he was a gang member, law enforcement officials said, but he wasn’t. . “They were out there hunting for rival Trinitarios and they found this poor kid,” the official said. “It’s a puzzle and we’re putting it together little by little. We want to know, obviously, why him? Why there? And, why so violent?” The slaying was captured on video that quickly went viral online, sparking an outcry over social media that included calls for justice from rapper Cardi B, the basketball star Carmelo Anthony and the Yankees pitcher C.C. Sabathia. As outrage grew, James P. O’Neill, the police commissioner, and Mayor Bill de Blasio both made appearances at the boy’s wake in the last two days. Six of the men charged in Lesandro’s death declined to challenge their extraditions at a Tuesday hearing in Paterson, N.J. Hours later, the police announced the arrest of a new suspect, Elvin Garcia, in the Bronx. All were expected to be arraigned on Wednesday afternoon, joining a 19-year-old who was taken into custody on Sunday and charged with second-degree murder on Monday. “We will leave no stone unturned,” Dermot F. Shea, the chief of detectives, said at a news conference in the Bronx. “We have ample resources to deal with anyone who wishes to engage in this activity. You are going to swiftly learn this is a no-win situation. If you flee to Paterson, if you flee to Wyoming, we will get you.” The men arrested in New Jersey — Jose Taverez, 21, Manuel Rivera, 18, Danel Fernandez, 21, Santiago Rodriguez, 24, all of the Bronx; Jose Muniz, 21, of Paterson, N.J.; and Joniki Martinez, 24, of Freeport, N.Y. — were awaiting transfer on Wednesday to New York City, where they face charges including assault, manslaughter and murder. They were each called one-by-one before Judge Ernest M. Caposela of the Passaic County criminal division of New Jersey Superior Court, where they each stood with their heads bowed. A trio of Passaic County public defenders represented the group. Five of the six had interpreters at their sides and wore headphones to hear courtroom exchanges translated from English to Spanish. Judy Fallon, a public defender who represented Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Taverez, said the defendants were worried about the safety of their families. “You only need to go on social media to see that tempers are very, very high — understandably high,” she said. “This is a terrible, terrible case. I just ask people to let the system run its course.” Kevin J. Alvarez, 19, turned himself in on Sunday. He was arraigned on Monday and charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, assault and gang assault. Investigators said they believe it was Mr. Alvarez who went into the bodega and dragged Lesandro onto the street, where he was stabbed repeatedly. At least two of the men detained do not have arrest records, a police official said, but five other have been arrested before. Lesandro, who was known as Junior, wanted to be a police detective and had participated in the Explorers program, a New York Police Department program for high school students. He was a sophomore at the Dr. Richard Izquierdo Health & Science Charter School, where classmate Michael Saster, 18, described him as “a good kid” who never did anything wrong. News of the latest arrest came as Lesandro’s family sat in mourning at his wake at the Ralph G. Ortiz Funeral Home on Southern Boulevard. Lesandro lay in an open coffin, dressed in his Police Explorer’s jacket with a New York Yankees jersey draped over him, surrounded by dozens of flower bouquets. His mother, Leandra Feliz, sat alone on a nearby couch as people filed by, paying their respects. The mayor, in remarks made during “Inside City Hall,” a live broadcast on NY1, said Lesandro had been a teenager on the right path and that the “city’s violence problem is largely a gang problem.” “The folks who did this horrible crime, I am very certain they will all be rolled up and they will all spend a lot of time in prison,” Mr. de Blasio said. A funeral for Lesandro is scheduled to be held at Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the Bronx on Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gareth Rhodes in the 19th District,"Editorial The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. New York’s 19th Congressional District stretches from the wealthy enclaves of Rhinebeck and the tie-dye world of Woodstock across the Catskill Mountains to the struggling dairy farmers near Cooperstown. In this enormous district, seven Democrats are competing in the primary on June 26 to challenge Representative John Faso, a first-termer who is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the House. This impressive field has divided party loyalists and independents alike, and the energy of the campaign has been matched by the energy of residents. The eager involvement of mostly homemade, neighborhood political clubs, and lively attendance at campaign events, is a welcome change in the political scene. These enthusiasts are anxious to take each candidate’s measure in person. One contender estimated that there have been at least 50 candidate forums. Here are the choices: Jeff Beals, an intense former diplomat and C.I.A. officer, moved to the district to become a teacher at a private school in Woodstock. Mr. Beals has promised to “fight corporate power” and calls Senator Bernie Sanders an inspiration. David Clegg, a lawyer and ordained Methodist deacon, has lived in the district for 37 years and is well known for his public service as a basketball coach, a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity and in fights against corporate polluters. Erin Collier, a latecomer to the field and its only woman, says her family has lived in the district so long that there is a hamlet named Colliersville. An agricultural economist for the United States Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, Ms. Collier has won support from women’s groups, including Emily’s List. Antonio Delgado, a Colgate graduate, Rhodes scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, worked until recently for Akin Gump, one of the most powerful lobbying law firms in the country, until quitting to run for this seat. Much of his comfortable campaign balance comes from his well-to-do former colleagues, though Mr. Delgado has won support from many progressives in the area. The Democrats who lost in the past two races in this district were relative newcomers, though, and while Mr. Delgado makes a compelling case for his candidacy, he grew up in a working-class home just outside the district in Schenectady and moved to Rhinebeck from Montclair, N.J., only just over a year ago. Local roots should count this year, especially since voters have been so involved. Brian Flynn, a dynamic businessman, has strong ideas about improving health care and the economy. He has created good jobs in the Northeast, but his connection to a firm that shifted positions from New York to the Dominican Republic has dogged him throughout the campaign. Pat Ryan, a West Point graduate who served two tours in Iraq, has made gun safety a key issue. One ad shows him holding an AR-15 and arguing that it is essentially a weapon he used in war — and should be banned at home. Mr. Ryan is a moderate who argues that Medicare should be a medical insurance option for those under the age of 55. A question hangs over his campaign, however — whether his work at technology firms included plans to spy on left-wing groups and unions for businesses and law enforcement. Mr. Ryan has said as a midlevel employee he had criticized the proposals, which he said were dropped. The seventh candidate, and The Times’s pick in this race, is Gareth Rhodes. Mr. Rhodes is a charismatic former press aide for Gov. Andrew Cuomo who grew up on a farm in the district. Motoring around the district in a small Winnebago, he has visited all 163 towns. He has listened closely to the woes of dairy farmers in dire straits, to families who have had to travel hundreds of miles to the closest maternity ward, to students struggling to pay off student loans. Like several of his competitors, Mr. Rhodes backs Medicare for all, a health care reform meant to bring Americans closer to the kind of universal system enjoyed in all other industrialized nations. Details matter, and there are several Democratic-backed proposals on the table, but Mr. Rhodes sees the conversation as a way to jump-start negotiations on health care fixes. How to improve gun safety is another key issue in this race, and it’s one way that Mr. Rhodes, the youngest candidate at 29, is trying to rally younger residents who barely voted in 2016. Born and raised in rural Ulster County, he left Harvard Law School last year to run for office. Among those in this worthy field, Mr. Rhodes stands out as the best candidate to take on — and beat — Mr. Faso in November. He offers the combination of intelligence, enthusiasm and empathy that is desperately needed in Washington today.",The New York Times
2018,Gavin Newsom and John Cox to Compete in California Election for Governor,"LOS ANGELES — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, took a major step Tuesday in his bid to become California’s next governor, capturing one of two spots on the November ballot as the state moved closer to the end of the era of Gov. Jerry Brown. John Cox, a Republican businessman backed by President Trump, captured the other spot, setting up what is — at best — a very long-shot bid for Mr. Cox in a decidedly Democratic state where Mr. Trump lost by nearly four million votes. Mr. Cox’s showing represented a major tactical victory for national Republicans as they seek to protect seven Republican-held congressional seats in California that Democrats are targeting as they try to recapture the House. Republican leaders, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader who comes from central California, had feared that having no Republicans running for a high-profile statewide office would diminish turnout among party voters in the fall. Importantly, Democrats seemed poised to avoid the disaster they feared in House races: Being shut out of the November balloting under the state’s so-called “top-two’’ primary system, in which only the top two finishers advance to the general election. But many of the districts had crowded primaries and in some of them votes were still being counted early Wednesday morning. The most-watched races here were seven congressional districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 and that are now held by Republicans. Democrats are aiming to capture those seats in November, a linchpin of their strategy to take back control of the House. [Here are results from New Jersey and the other states that voted Tuesday.] The November race between Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox promises to be, in part, a fight over Mr. Trump, and one in which the liberal Democrats who embraced Mr. Newsom have a clear advantage. The election is taking place at a critical time as California is enmeshed in a protracted fight with the Trump administration on range of battlefields, including environmental protections, immigration and offshore oil drilling. And on Tuesday night, both candidates invoked Mr. Trump in dueling remarks to supporters. “It looks like voters will have a real choice this November — between a governor who is going to stand up to Donald Trump and a foot soldier in his war on California,” Mr. Newsom told hundreds of supporters at a San Francisco nightclub, as he pledged to push for guaranteed health care for all and “a Marshall Plan for affordable housing.” Mr. Cox, speaking to friends and donors in San Diego, continually painted Mr. Newsom as “part of the status quo” and knocked the Democrat's attacks on Mr. Trump. “It wasn’t Donald Trump that made California the highest-taxed state in the country, it was Gavin Newsom and the Democrats,” Mr. Cox said. Running far behind in the governor’s primary race was Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor. In the race for United States Senate, Dianne Feinstein easily won a spot on the November ballot in what by every indication looks like an easy race this fall — no matter who ends up running against her. Among the seven highly competitive House races in California, Democrats battled for months to avoid getting shut out from the November ballot under the state’s “top two” election system: The two leading vote-getters, regardless of party, will go on to face each other in November. [Get live results from all the races in California.] California may be the single most important battleground for Democrats in their drive to claim a majority in Congress. Mr. Trump is intensely unpopular in the state, and broad backlash against his administration could help Democrats seize perhaps a third of the 23 seats they need to regain power. Yet California’s unusual open-primary system has become a difficult obstacle for Democrats, as a horde of candidates on the left have divided up Democratic votes and threatened to let Republicans monopolize the general election. The national Democratic Party has spent millions in California in recent weeks to attack Republican candidates in television ads, aiming to drive down their support and create more space for Democratic candidates to rise. And party leaders in Washington backed Gil Cisneros, a Navy veteran who won the California lottery, and Harley Rouda, a wealthy real estate executive, for a pair of Republican-held districts in Orange County that Mrs. Clinton carried in the presidential election. Both Mr. Cisneros and Mr. Rouda appeared to stand a good chance of making it into the general election, but both races were still too close overnight for the top two finishers to be determined. Voting took place across the state under a cloud of confusion as voters tried to navigate their way through the top two system. And in a potentially unnerving sign for some Democrats, the Los Angeles County clerk revealed Tuesday night that a printing error had improperly left about 119,000 names off voting rosters in the area — a development that Mr. Villaraigosa called “infuriating” as he urged affected voters to cast provisional ballots. Earlier in the day, at Laguna Beach City Hall, Aggie Dougherty had to thumb through the sample ballot packet she carried with her to remember which Democrat she had chosen after more than a dozen candidates inundated the 48th Congressional District with campaign material in their bid to unseat Dana Rohrabacher, a particularly embattled Republican. Ms. Dougherty, 67, a bookkeeper, settled on Harley Rouda, the candidate endorsed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Still, as she went into the voting booth, she realized she had to check to remember whom she had picked off the long list of Democrats. “Oh, right,” she said. “Harley.” Turnout appeared light during much of the day. A June primary historically has not drawn voters to the polls in particularly high numbers — even one that has drawn this kind of national attention. About 2.5 million votes had been received by mail as of Tuesday. (California voters are permitted to vote by mail through the end of Election Day.) Which is not to say the candidates were not trying to pique voters’ interest. “I literally could not go through my work day without getting flooded with calls,” said Tim Cain, 52, a video game developer in Orange County. “I basically said, my phone is no longer available.” With voting in progress, Mr. Trump prodded California conservatives to support Mr. Cox again on Tuesday morning, promising on Twitter that the long-shot Republican would “make a BIG difference” as governor. And the president encouraged Republicans to turn out in the congressional elections, offering a version of the argument his party is expected to deliver across the country this fall: “Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi.” Mr. Cox repeatedly aligned himself with Mr. Trump in his remarks to supporters Tuesday night. Even his closing message carried a slight echo of Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan: “Let’s together make California the Golden State once again.” Robert DeRose, a close friend of Mr. Cox, said he believed the Republican could win in November if he made it to the general election. Mr. DeRose contended that dissatisfaction with taxes would lead many voters to support Mr. Cox. “This state chases businesspeople away, people like me,” Mr. DeRose said. In the governor’s race, Mr. Newsom, 50, had long been viewed as a leading candidate to replace Mr. Brown, a Democrat retiring at the end of the year. He has spent much of the past 15 years preparing for this moment, and that was evident in the strength of his fund-raising and a broad base of support on Tuesday. But it was a somber night for Mr. Villaraigosa, who campaigned energetically and had a huge burst of financial support from fellow supporters of charter schools, including Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Eli Broad, the Los Angeles philanthropist. In an emotional concession speech that seemed aimed at unifying his party, Mr. Villaraigosa congratulated Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox and encouraged his supporters to “get behind the winner.” “Gavin, thank you for caring enough about this state to put your hat in the ring, to run for governor in this state,” Mr. Villaraigosa, flanked by his family, told a crowd of supporters. The contest for governor marks the end of a long chapter in California history. Mr. Brown, 80, is stepping down because of term limits. He has served two terms now — and two terms in the 1970s — and leaves office popular and generally respected. But Mr. Brown has struck a decidedly moderate note during his years in Sacramento — he was well known for pushing back at what he saw as excesses by the Legislature when it came to spending or lawmaking — at a time when energy in the Democratic Party was moving to the left. For the general election, the map of important congressional races in California extends well beyond the Southern California seats where Democrats feared a “top two” fiasco. The party is also choosing candidates to oppose vulnerable Republicans in the Central Valley and elsewhere in the suburbs around Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and health care have put sitting lawmakers in deep peril. Anneliese Gelberg, 21, wanted to vote for Jess Phoenix, one of three female Democratic candidates running for the House seat in California’s 25th Congressional District north of Los Angeles. For one, Ms. Gelberg said, she was more inclined to vote for women. She also liked Ms. Phoenix’s policies. But rather than casting her vote for Ms. Phoenix on Tuesday, she said she voted for one of Ms. Phoenix’s competitors — Bryan Caforio. “I knew that she didn’t have a lot of backing or support,” Ms. Gelberg said, over a lunch of grilled cheese and fries. In the end, she added, she wanted a Democrat to beat the Republican incumbent, Steve Knight, and she thought Mr. Caforio had a better chance.",The New York Times
2018,Gay Talese’s Ants,"Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: I graduated from film school in the early 1970s and I was lucky to find a job at a company that made industrial and documentary films out of a small office in a stately apartment building at the corner of 58th Street and Seventh Avenue. I spent a year or so moving lights and editing, and then, in 1973, I got a chance to produce and direct my first film: a promotional short in honor of Esquire magazine’s 40th anniversary. The idea was to depict famous articles that had been published first in Esquire. One was Gay Talese’s “New York.” New York is a city of things unnoticed. It is a city with cats sleeping under parked cars, two stone armadillos crawling up St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and thousands of ants creeping on top of the Empire State Building. Esquire wanted to see this onscreen. The armadillos were easy, but the ants required a bit of work. With a little research, I found a mail-order insect company, and five days later a package arrived: a Tupperware container swarming with 500 ants. We lined up the shot on the roof of the apartment building on 58th Street. I dumped the full container of ants on the stone parapet of the roof. There was my shot: holding tight on all those ants running around, and then tilting up, and zooming back to show the New York skyline. It was perfect.",The New York Times
2018,"Gay in India, Where Progress Has Come Only With Risk","BILASPUR, India — If you had told Ayesha Kapur 10 years ago that she would help lead the fight against one of the world’s oldest laws criminalizing gay sex, she would never have believed you. For most of her life, Ms. Kapur was afraid to ever speak of her sexuality. Growing up in New Delhi during the 1980s, Ms. Kapur knew of no gay women, no reference points from Bollywood movies that could provide the vocabulary for what she was feeling. The word “lesbian,” she said, was “like a bad word.” Three decades later, Ms. Kapur, who describes herself as deeply private and mostly apolitical, became a member of the first group of gay petitioners to challenge the law, known as Section 377. In stepping forward, Ms. Kapur, 43, and other petitioners admitted to the court that they were criminals under a law routinely used as a cover to harass, blackmail and sexually assault gay people. “According to the law of the land, I can be handcuffed,” she said. “It’s a very real prospect. Nothing stops the police from coming to the homes of the petitioners.” This summer, India’s Supreme Court is expected to consider those petitions as it reviews Section 377’s constitutionality, creating a surge of hope for lawyers and activists who have been campaigning against the law for years. But hope is tempered by years of disappointment. Even now, it is an act of calculated risk to identify publicly as being gay in India, or to advocate for change. In interviews conducted over three months, gay and transgender Indians from across the country described the cost of living in a country that has forced them to be outlaws: shunning by parents, social isolation, few protections in the workplace, and a frightening vulnerability to both police abuse and sexual assault with limited legal recourse. Ms. Kapur, who works in the food and beverages industry, said she came forward because she had finally had enough of all that. “Why are we invisible?” she asked. “Because we have made ourselves invisible? Or have we been made invisible? I don’t want to be seen as a criminal. That is what this is about.” In Bilaspur, a sun-cracked city in central India, Rajesh Yadav, slim with sharp cheek bones, said she had been gang-raped four times in less than one year, beaten with a brick and nearly thrown out of a moving vehicle because of her sexuality. “I would beg them to leave me every time, but they would beat me and use violence against me and then rape me,” said Ms. Yadav, 25, who identifies as a gay cross-dresser and prefers female pronouns. “If I start telling you my story, several nights would pass.” A., a young gay man who asked to be identified only by his first initial, shared a similar account. When A., 22, made plans to meet a man from an instant messaging application in eastern India, he was greeted instead by two different men, one of them in a police uniform, who drugged and raped him, he said. Afterward, one of the men took a selfie with A. “I was afraid he would blackmail me,” he said. Neither of them considered approaching the police to report the crimes, fearing the consequences of doing so. “Section 377 is cruel,” A. said. “It is being misused to harm people like me. It makes people hide.” In 2014, when a Bangalore-based doctor did come forward after several men he had sex with extorted about $25,000 from him, the police arrested the men, but then booked the doctor under Section 377, said Danish Sheikh, an assistant professor at Jindal Global Law School in New Delhi. “The doctor here becomes both victim and perpetrator,” he said. “The law has a chilling effect on your ability to access justice.” Victims of blackmail or sexual assault often hesitate to approach police for just that reason, fearing they will be arrested — or worse. “The rich ones, they will extort money from; the poor ones, they will use for sexual favors,” said Mohnish Malhotra, a gay-rights activist in New Delhi. “Nobody talks about these experiences,” he added. “This is not a conversation that people are comfortable with here in India.” But India was once at ease with depictions of same-sex love and gender fluidity. In Hinduism, gods transform into goddesses and men bear children. Rekhti, a genre of poetry that flourished in India from the late 1700s, describes erotic encounters between women. When British colonizers arrived in India, that acceptance of homosexuality eroded. In the 1860s, the British introduced Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The law imposed a fine, 10 years’ imprisonment or a life sentence on “whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature.” Section 377 is generally applied to sex between men, but it officially extends to anybody engaged in anal or oral sex. Activists said there had been a few advances in the years since India won independence in 1947, including when government literature distributed in schools last year recognized same-sex attraction. But homophobia here is still often expressed with predatory behavior, and Section 377 narrows channels for recourse. The push to strike down Section 377 began in earnest in 2000, when a terrified young man showed up at the Naz Foundation, an H.I.V. advocacy organization in New Delhi, pleading for help. Anjali Gopalan, who runs the organization, said the man’s parents had taken him to a government hospital where he was forced to undergo electroshock therapy to “make him straight.” After she relayed the man’s plight to India’s National Human Rights Commission, the commission said it could not help the man because he was gay and therefore a criminal. “I was horrified,” she said. Soon after, Ms. Gopalan filed a lawsuit challenging Section 377, fending off death threats until 2009, when a high court in New Delhi ruled that the law could not be applied to consensual sex. But appeals were filed by Christian, Muslim and Hindu groups and the law was restored by India’s Supreme Court in 2013. Thousands of gay people who had come out of the closet in 2009 were swiftly pushed back in. Some wealthier Indians left the country for good. “For the first time, I thought I needed to move out,” said the chef Ritu Dalmia, another petitioner challenging Section 377. “There was this fear — absolute fear.” In their judgment, the Supreme Court justified the ruling by writing that only a “minuscule fraction of the country’s population constitute lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders.” Since its inception, the court said, less than 200 people had been prosecuted under Section 377. But figures released by the National Crime Records Bureau, which tracks police complaints, suggest that many more cases are lodged, lawyers said. In 2014, the first year the bureau says it started tracking Section 377 cases, 1,148 complaints were filed. In 2016, the number had nearly doubled to 2,187. That year, over 1,600 cases were sent for trial. Drawing conclusions from the data is difficult. There is often no way to tell on police complaints whether sex was consensual. Many complaints are filed by third parties who make their own judgments, said Professor Sheikh. “It is very rarely the survivor who is filing the case,” he said. “The father would file the case saying that, ‘I caught this other person doing a wrongful act with my son.’ ” Responding to the court’s ruling, a team of lawyers led by Menaka Guruswamy and Arundhati Katju submitted a writ petition in 2016 on behalf of gay Indians. The petition challenged Section 377 on the basis that it violated their rights to equality and liberty, among other infractions, under India’s Constitution. “We always felt that there was a void,” Ms. Guruswamy said, “the absence of L.G.B.T. individuals saying, ‘This Constitution is mine as well.’” Initially, three other petitioners joined Ms. Kapur and Ms. Dalmia: Navtej Singh Johar, a dancer; Sunil Mehra, a journalist; and Aman Nath, a hotelier. Over the last few weeks, emboldened by that group, petitions were filed by 26 others, including Arif Jafar, whose outreach program for gay and transgender people was shut down in 2001 by police who said he was accepting funds from Pakistan to turn Indian men gay. Mr. Jafar was booked under Section 377 and other laws and spent 47 days in jail, where he was beaten by inmates. Though most of the petitioners are financially independent, protections that insulate them from the dangers that many gay Indians face, public opinion has slowly shifted in some places. Pride parades were popping up in cities. Parents were coming forward to support their gay children. Ms. Kapur took her own steps. She left a corporate job where she worked with “superb people” but felt bothered by co-workers assuming that everyone in the office was straight. In 2009, she also came out to her mother, who died of lung cancer shortly after the conversation. “After I lost my mother, I became a bit fearless,” Ms. Kapur said. “In death, she gave me courage.” Even if the Supreme Court excludes consensual sex from the law, lawyers said its archaic language means a legislative amendment is needed to protect people who are gay. Still, Ms. Kapur felt hopeful. Messages of support had overwhelmed negative ones, she said. After the Supreme Court referred Section 377 to a larger bench in January, Ms. Kapur’s father mailed her a framed newspaper clipping of an article from The Times of India profiling the “Famous & Fearless 5.” Under the clipping, he scrawled a note: “Your mother would have been so proud.”",The New York Times
2018,Gayle King Thinks #MeToo Needs Due Process,"Talk John Oliver used to do these satirical joke segments about your banter with Charlie Rose on his show. Do you look back at that now, after Rose was fired following multiple accusations of sexual harassment, and think about it differently? I don’t know, because it really was in good fun. It was very harmless. I had no idea that we would ever be part of the #MeToo story. I actually thought what John Oliver was doing was pretty funny. Has it made you think about how you relate to male colleagues on air? No. I am not worried about people misinterpreting what I say. I don’t want to turn myself into a pretzel trying to figure it out. You know when something is inappropriate. Listen, if it’s not something you would say or do in front of your wife or your mother or your sister, that’s a really good guideline. John Dickerson was hired to replace Rose on “CBS This Morning.” Did you have a moment when you just wanted to have the show hosted by the two women anchors — you and Norah O’Donnell — after Charlie’s dismissal? There are a lot of men in the world; I think it’s good to have one at the table. I really advocated bringing in another man. Could Norah and I have done it? Yep, but I’m glad that wasn’t the decision that was made. You’ve talked about the potential for backlash to the #MeToo movement. How do you see that playing out? I do worry about that, because I think when a woman makes an accusation, the man instantly gets the death penalty. There has to be some sort of due process here. All of these inappropriate behaviors are not all the same. Is being fired a particularly harsh punishment? In some cases, yes. But what about the rumors that some of these men will have a comeback? Sometimes it just doesn’t seem as if they’ve really taken a hit. It depends on who you’re talking about. We’re talking in generalities here, because many of the cases are different, but what I do know is you can’t come back if you don’t get the lesson and you haven’t acknowledged that you behaved badly. Throughout the scandal with Rose, you’ve always said that as difficult as hearing the allegations is, he is a friend of yours. How have you reconciled your feelings over this? I don’t feel as if I’ve had to reconcile my feelings. I don’t believe in turning your back on a friend, even when a friend has done something you adamantly disagree with and you’re disappointed in. But I also know that you listen to women, and I don’t discount their stories, either. What was your reaction to seeing how quickly Roseanne Barr’s show was canceled after her racist tweet? I was doing the hula in my office when I saw the breaking news! I’m all for freedom of speech, but freedom of speech comes with some responsibility. What do you think of the conversation that people have been having about racism and bigotry over the last year and a half? Do you think that we in the media are covering these issues well? I think we covered the Roseanne story pretty well, but I would like to have a real honest conversation about what is going on with police brutality and black people in this country. And it has to come from white people and black people. Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people in Charleston. James Holmes shot up that theater in Colorado. He’s alive. Nikolas Cruz is alive. And you look at some of the cases involving unarmed black men, and they’re dead. What is wrong with this picture? At the same time, Colin Kaepernick and N.F.L. players essentially tried to force people to have this conversation, and it looks as if they’ve been effectively silenced by the league. I’m disappointed in that conversation. Colin Kaepernick was making a point about racial inequality in this country. You can talk about racial inequality in this country and still love the country.",The New York Times
2018,Gaysploitation Upends the Stereotypes That Make Us Wince,"“Homosexuality isn’t funny.” That was the first of the “Guiding Principles for Motion Picture and Television Treatment of Homosexuality” released in 1973 by activists fed up with Hollywood’s habit of playing gay people for laughs. “Sometimes anything can be a source of humor,” the statement continued, “but the lives of 20 million Americans are not a joke.” Except when they are. Josh Collins, the director of the new film “Fags in the Fast Lane,” an Australian gaysploitation comedy in the spirit of sci-fi sex spoofs like “Flesh Gordon,” wants the gay community to stop taking itself so seriously. “Comedy must be irreverent or it wouldn’t be funny,” Mr. Collins said. “Nobody wants to watch model gay fare all the time.” Since the silent era, gay culture and gay men in particular have been laughed at on screen. Too often the jokes had cruel roots. As the gay film historian Vito Russo noted in his landmark book, “The Celluloid Closet,” “The history of the portrayal of lesbians and gay men in mainstream cinema is politically indefensible and aesthetically revolting.” Pansy, killer, nympho, coward: film comedy is littered with ugly and painful stereotypes that emasculated, infantilized and diabolized gay men. “It was so easy to code certain people as gay,” the film historian David Del Valle said in an interview. “All it took was a limp wrist and a lisp.” (Lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters have been less visible on screen, and when they have appeared it wasn’t pretty either.) It’s no wonder that gay activists spent decades pushing back against Hollywood stereotypes. But can gay characters be both offensive and funny? It’s a yes from gaysploitation, a subgenre, rooted in the sex-crazed work of Russ Meyer and Doris Wishman, that overflows with stereotypes behaving badly, like mincing villains and killer drag queens. To understand how gaysploitation upended clichés, it’s worth knowing why people were laughing in the first place. Here’s a look at how, through an uneasy mix of insult and pride, gay male characters have evolved in big-screen comedies. In the 1930s and ’40s, “a movie projector was as a lighthouse for gay men and women,” Richard Barrios wrote in his book “Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood From Edison to Stonewall.” For many gay men, watching nelly store clerks and fastidious bank examiners, played by actors like Edward Everett Horton and Grady Sutton, was the only way to see themselves represented on screen. Nobody played the pansy better than Franklin Pangborn, who with his pursed lips and precision double takes could be a proto-Jack McFarland. In films like the screwball comedy “Easy Living” (1937), Pangborn’s expert comedic chops “won hearts,” according to Russo, despite — or thanks to — being in service of stereotypes. Comedies of the late ’40s and ’50s finessed the nance into more of a coded gay best friend who often served as the smart alecky foil to the straight leading man. Much to the chagrin of Spencer Tracy in “Adam’s Rib” (1949), David Wayne was “a high-class Ethel Mertz” to Katharine Hepburn’s “feminist Lucy Ricardo,” as Russo put it. This gay character — usually single, smart and just a little sad — lived on in “Only When I Laugh” (1981), with James Coco as Marsha Mason’s gay bestie, and “Victor/Victoria” (1982), with Robert Preston as Julie Andrews’s drag-loving confidant. While activists in the ’60s battled the pernicious misconception that gay men were depraved perverts, John Waters fell in love with it. In “Multiple Maniacs” (1970) and “Female Trouble” (1974), Mr. Waters enlisted his clown-alien drag muse Divine to shock audiences with subversive story lines that — to the outrage of the growing gay rights movement — helped gaysploitation emerge in the post-Stonewall, sleaze-crazed ’70s. His films made his native Baltimore look like the queerest place on the planet. They “created this phantasmagoria of a landscape of America that was more real than people realized,” Mr. Del Valle said. Screen drag has a problematic past, raising questions about sexism, sexual identity and ownership of gay culture. (It’s complicated.) Since the silent era, with overt depictions of gay men verboten, drag was often just a comedic device straight men used to get away with something. Fatty Arbuckle donned sausage curls to avoid his wife in “Coney Island” (1917). Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis became filmdom’s most famous cross-dressing duo as straight guys evading mobsters in “Some Like It Hot” (1959). Dustin Hoffman needed a job in “Tootsie” (1982). A gay trailblazer was the French-language comedy “La Cage Aux Folles” (1979) about an actual drag queen (with a partner!). Fast forward, and the “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner Bianca Del Rio has starred in her own film, “Hurricane Bianca” (2016), a revenge comedy about a gay man who uses drag to play straight and fight injustice. It’s worth noting that this category is particularly racially diverse, from Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo in “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar” (1996), the still-rare Hollywood film to feature drag queens as leads, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a working-class queen in “Kinky Boots” (2005). “Fags in the Fast Lane” is a return to the transgressive, low-budget films under the gaysploitation umbrella that directors like Curt McDowell and Bruce LaBruce unleashed in underground circles decades ago. As for offensive-funny characters, take your pick: the Bollywood eunuch assassin or “Aztec she-male worshipers,” as the trailer puts it. For inspiration, Mr. Collins cited three comedies that once were on gay activists’ hit lists: “The Pink Angels” (1971) about gay bikers; “Zorro, the Gay Blade” (1981), the swishbuckling adventure film (with a gay character named Bunny Wigglesworth) and “The Gay Deceivers” (1969), about straight guys who pretend to be gay to dodge the draft.

2018,"Gena Turgel, Holocaust Survivor With a Love Story, Dies at 95","Gena Turgel, who was half of an oft-told love story born in the Holocaust and whose barracks mates at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp included Anne Frank, died on June 7. She was 95. The Holocaust Educational Trust was among those announcing her death. The location was not given. Ms. Turgel (pronounced tur-GELL) was imprisoned in several concentration camps after the Nazis invaded Poland and rousted her family from a comfortable home in Krakow. Most of her family members died, but she and her mother survived to see the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, in northern Germany. One of the liberating British soldiers, Sgt. Norman Turgel, saw her and was lovestruck — so much so that soon after meeting her he managed to arrange a dinner for her at the officers’ mess at his British camp. The lavish setting she encountered when she entered perplexed her. “I turned ’round to this Sergeant Norman,” Ms. Turgel recalled in an oral history for Shalom TV, a Jewish cable channel. “I said: ‘Do we expect any special visitors? What am I doing here?’ So he says: ‘You are the special visitor. This is our engagement party.’ ” They married six months later. Their love story became a favorite light-in-the-darkness tale for the news media — Ms. Turgel was “the Bride of Belsen” — but she took care over the years to make sure that the horrors she and millions of others experienced were recounted as well. She related her story in interviews and in a book, “I Light a Candle” (1987), and worked with educational groups over the years. In 2005, at 81, she escorted Queen Elizabeth II to her seat for a Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration in London, held on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, one of the camps in which she was held. “My story,” she said in a 2001 interview, “the story of a survivor, is the story that six million others cannot tell.” Gena Goldfinger was born on Feb. 1, 1923, in Krakow, the youngest of nine children of Samuel and Estera Goldfinger, who ran a small textile business. Her father died when she was young, but her mother continued the business, and the family was living comfortably when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, confiscated their possessions and uprooted them. They were relocated to a cramped apartment, then to the Jewish ghetto in Krakow, then, in 1942, to the Plaszow concentration camp nearby. In 1944, Ms. Turgel was force-walked, over days and days, to Auschwitz, further west in Poland. She often described being sent naked into a building with others, supposedly for a disinfecting shower; nothing happened for a long time, though eventually water came on. She concluded later that the building was a gas chamber, and that a malfunction or some other intercession had saved her life. Her other family members were not so lucky; one, a sister, was subjected to horrible medical experiments. “I often ask, ‘Why were my brothers and sister shot?,’ ” Ms. Turgel said in an interview with The Toronto Star in 1987. “Why was my sister injected with petrol? Was I meant to be here to tell this story to people who didn’t know? Perhaps God guided me, put me under his wing.” With her mother, she was moved to Bergen-Belsen after a brief period at Auschwitz. Another prisoner in her crowded barracks there was Anne Frank. “Her bed was around the corner from me,” Ms. Turgel told the British newspaper The Sun in 2015. “She was delirious, terrible, burning up,” she said, adding that she had brought Frank water to wash. Frank, whose wartime diary became one of the most famous pieces of Holocaust documentation, died in March 1945 during a typhus epidemic at the camp. Ms. Turgel saw the effects of that epidemic up close: In an effort to ensure her and her mother’s survival, she had talked her way into a job at the camp hospital. “The people were dying like flies — in the hundreds,” she said in the oral history. “Reports used to come in — 500 people who died. Three hundred? We said, ‘Thank God, only 300.’ ” The British liberated the camp in April 1945. In subsequent days Ms. Turgel helped guide the liberators and convey to them the needs of the sick. Sergeant Turgel was part of an intelligence unit looking for German officers to arrest. The couple returned to the camp for the 40th anniversary of the liberation, followed by television cameras. Mr. Turgel died in 1995. Ms. Turgel is survived by three children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She once recalled the vows she had made to herself after her husband took her to England to live. “I adopted three ambitions,” she said. “To learn the way of British life, and to learn the English language, and to write about my memoirs in case I forget. But how can one forget those atrocities?”",The New York Times
2018,He Gave a Light Sentence for Sexual Assault. Now He’s Off the Bench.,"Gender Letter Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends and culture by The Times’s gender initiative.

Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, The judge who sentenced Brock Turner, a Stanford University student charged with sexually assaulting a woman while she was unconscious, has been recalled by California voters. The campaign against the judge, Aaron Persky, was fueled by outrage over what many believed to be a lenient six-month jail term handed down to Mr. Turner. (The maximum sentence was 14 years.) When I first read about the case, I felt my heart rate spike. The victim, identified as Emily Doe to protect her privacy, went to a party, blacked out, and woke up, bleeding and covered in pine needles, in the hospital. In a searing statement, she described how she learned only later that she had been found unconscious and “naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize.” And yet, in a letter to Judge Persky — a Stanford alumnus — Mr. Turner’s father argued that jail would be “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action.” Mr. Turner ultimately served three months. In response, the California Legislature created a mandatory three-year minimum sentence for sexual assault of an unconscious person. Two years after the controversial sentencing, Judge Persky’s recall could be seen as a hopeful harbinger of changes in how punishment is meted out in sexual assault cases. But I found myself torn over the news. With millions of people behind bars, including a rising population of women, is it prudent to punish a judge for being lenient? And do we want judges, whose independence is essential to our systems of criminal justice and democracy, intimidated by public opinion? Many of the people leading the campaign against a recall — who wanted Judge Persky to stay on the bench — were women who feared that it would encourage judges to hand down harsh sentences across the board, simply to get re-elected. I’d love to hear your thoughts about the recall. Please write me at zoe.greenberg@nytimes.com.

Ms. Anthony did not take the stand — “the district attorney objected to her competency to testify in her own behalf” — and she was found guilty. But before being sentenced, Ms. Anthony was asked if she had anything to say. As it happened, she did. “Robbed of the fundamental privilege of citizenship, I am degraded from the status of a citizen to that of a subject,” she said, arguing that the trial itself was unfair, since the jury, the judge, the lawyers and the lawmakers were all men. The judge ordered her to pay a fine of $100, plus the costs of the prosecution. “May it please your honor, I shall never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty,” Ms. Anthony replied.______ Like this article?

Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, It is prom season, and also Pride Month, a calendric coincidence that has always felt problematic. After all, is there a more traditionally heteronormative event in an American teenage life than the high-school prom? But in recent years, students who see themselves outside the binary have begun to challenge the straightness of it all, turning prom on its head by attending openly. “Because straight is the default, you get a lot of people double-checking if they really just saw two boys holding hands,” said Ishan Merkel, 18, who went to prom in Bethesda, Md., with his partner, Melvin Lewis. “It seems like prom itself has changed,” he added. “The idea that you need a date to attend has dissolved, and with it, the strictness of male-female rituals. We actually had a lot of fun with traditions, like how to match two suits!” Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that similar dynamics drove this phenomenon as those that propelled same-sex marriage. While the primary argument was usually about rights and benefits, there was also a more emotional aspect that Professor Zimmerman summed up as, “If there’s a tradition, we want in.” “It’s a demand to be included, and it will win for exactly the same reason same-sex marriage won,” he explained. “Because the tradition itself is so deeply inscribed.” Seeing prom pictures like Ishan and Melvin’s, and all the limos and sequins around lately, I can’t help but think back to my own high school days, as a lesbian in 1990s Kentucky. I went three years in a row, and the prospect of bringing a girl on my arm was never even a fleeting thought. The guys I went with were kind, but it was ultimately an inauthentic, hollow experience. I was playing at womanhood like I’d played house as a child. Looking back, I wonder: if I’d been out at prom, would I have enjoyed the spectacle, instead of feeling like I was viewing it through glass? In a New York Times opinion piece in May, Ara Halstead of Olympia, Wash., reflected on the dilemma over whether to attend: “Maybe I needed to break the habit of isolating myself and recognize that I might not be as misunderstood as I thought. Maybe going to a function so centered on gender roles as an unapologetically gender-fluid student was the best way to make people like me visible to the rest of the school. I know there are other L.G.B.T.Q. students out there who have thought that prom isn’t for them. But I’d encourage those who are out and comfortable to think about it. I believe the big fights for equality around L.G.B.T.Q. issues, such as hate violence, homelessness and economic fairness, can’t be won unless we fight the smaller ones along the way.” Professor Zimmerman, who wrote a piece titled “The Prom: An American Relic” for The Boston Globe in 2013, told me that when prom first spread from elite colleges to high schools in the 1920s, it was “a radical act” as it allowed boys and girls to take off in a car and escape a parent’s purview. Now, he said, “ in an era of allegedly greater gender equality, greater gender awareness, I would say the prom is rather retrograde.” He added: “It’s a time we pretend we live in a different era.” For a majority of American teens, he is right: Under the gymnasium’s disco ball, time has stood still. But one might say that the queer students who are openly attending proms — or organizing alternative events in safe spaces outside of school — are making it a radical act once again. “Prom lies at the heart of the American high school experience,” Professor Zimmerman noted. “If we want to maintain those traditions, we’re going to have to let everyone in.” Happy dancing, Maya ______ The Times has a slew of Pride coverage, and you can find it all here.

[The New York Times] ______ In last week’s newsletter, my colleague Zoe Greenberg asked what you thought about California voters having recalled Aaron Persky, the judge who gave a six-month jail sentence to Brock Turner, the Stanford University swimmer who sexually assaulted a student while she was unconscious. More than 200 readers replied. Here is a handful of highlights: When a candidate loses an election (in this case, by a landslide) they are not being “punished.” In fact, that language is gaslighting the voters who are simply lawfully exercising their right to vote judges in or out. We can support women by not using language that implies that women’s voting decisions are punitive or emotional rather than rational and fact-based. Amy Luna Manderino, Chicago Author of the forthcoming book “The Sex Evolution: Evolving the Battle of the Sexes into an Alliance for Humanity.” I am more shocked that judges CAN be recalled. That makes them entirely too responsive to public attitudes -- and attitudes can change for the worse as well as for the better, as they did here. Judges should not have to concern themselves with public opinion or political vendettas. The only way they can be truly independent is if they answer only to the law and the Constitution. Michele Hogan, California Screenwriter If you do the crime, be ready to do the time. Rapists should be in jail for enough time to recognize that with rights comes responsibility to society and the community. Marc Richter, Burlington, Vt. Social worker One way of thinking about the recall of Judge Persky is that it demonstrates the capacity of the left, as well as the right, for destructive rage… Nearly three dozen members of the Stanford Law School faculty, more than 90 percent of those who expressed a view, opposed the recall. I will not purport to speak for all of them, but I can say that I and many of my colleagues were concerned about more than the risk that recall of Judge Persky would lead to harsher criminal sentences. The rule of law is all that stands between us and a world of might makes right. A. Douglas Melamed, Palo Alto, Calif. Professor, Stanford Law School ______ “Girls Who Fall in Love With Each Other” is (sadly) not the title of the newest Janelle Monae think piece. It is the headline of this New York Times article published in 1897 that describes “hundreds, and indeed thousands of cases” of romantic and sexual love among boarding-school girls. The piece describes such girls as “hysterical,” “weak-minded” and “foolish.” And it predicts they will become “the typical confirmed old maid, whose affection is ultimately bestowed upon a favorite cat or overfed dog, which she probably ‘adores’ in much the same way as she loved her school companion in her younger years.”______ Like this article?

Dear readers, Her voice was too “high pitched.” That was the feedback given to Vicki Sparks, a sports journalist who this month became the first woman to ever call a World Cup match live on British television. Jason Cundy, a former defender for Chelsea and Tottenham, couldn’t have been more blunt about it on “Good Morning Britain.” He prefers a male voice when watching football, 90 minutes of “a high-pitched tone” is too much, “and when there’s a moment of drama, as there often is in football, that moment needs to be done with a slightly lower voice.” It’s an assessment I haven’t been able to stop thinking about, in part because of the number of times I’ve gotten similar unsolicited feedback. “Stop with the vocal fry,” a man recently tweeted to me after I appeared on the radio. My colleague Emily Steel, whose groundbreaking work exposing sexual misconduct and cover-up at the hands of Bill O’Reilley and Fox News was part of The Times’ Pulitzer Prize for Public Service this year, is constantly told, “You sound like a little girl.” We brush the insults off, and yet they are familiar to most women who speak up in traditionally male spaces. Margaret Thatcher famously employed a voice coach to help lower her voice in an attempt to give herself more authority. Claims of being too “shrill” — a word that, by the way, is used twice as often in media to refer to women than men, as research by the linguist Nic Subtirelu has found — dogged Hillary Clinton in her campaign for the presidency. (Here’s a whole video on the science of hating Mrs. Clinton’s voice.) Meanwhile, the BBC published a fascinating article last month about researchers in Australia who had studied the voices of two groups of young women from the 1940s and the 1990s. They found that the “fundamental frequency” of those women’s voices had dropped by 23 Hz over five decades — in other words, the women’s voices got deeper. They attributed that drop to women’s rise in society, which, they speculated, has led women to adopt a deeper tone to project authority and dominance at work. It’s interesting to think about, particularly in a moment where we are seeing a record number of women strive for political office — a realm that has been, yes, traditionally male. Those candidates already face an uphill battle. Now do they have to think about the pitch of their voices, too? Here’s my question as we head into the weekend: If women had been in power since forever, would it be men working to raise their voices after being told they’re too “low-pitched”?

2018,"Yes, Britain, You Can Have More Women on Corporate Boards","Gender Letter Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends and culture by The Times’s gender editor, Jessica Bennett. Want future installments delivered to your inbox? Sign up here. Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, “There aren’t that many women with the right credentials.” “All the ‘good’ women have already been snapped up.” “We have one woman already on the board.” It may be hard to believe in 2018, but those were among the excuses British corporate bosses recently gave to explain the lack of women in senior positions at their companies, as my colleague Amie Tsang recently reported. They were surfaced as part of an investigation by the British government into why women fill only about a quarter of the country’s corporate-board seats. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised, with that attitude, that there are more men called Dave and Steve than there are women heading up the top 100 companies on the London stock exchange (and, yes, more men named John than women who run large companies in the United States). This despite the fact that academic research has shown that having more women in leadership actually yields better results for companies: They become more inclusive, more collaborative — and, ultimately more profitable. So I have taken it upon myself to respond to some of the, ahem, concerns put forth as part of a real survey of the 350 biggest publicly listed companies in Britain. (You can read all of them here.) Readers, you might consider clipping and saving for when you yourself are confronted with such “concerns.” “There aren’t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board — the issues covered are extremely complex.” You mean complexity like delivering a baby while in labor yourself, landing a plane after an engine exploded, or running the country with Europe’s largest economy? As for credentials: I’m just guessing here, but I’d imagine board members might need something like an advanced degree, some analytical thinking skills and the ability to collaborate. Did you know that women now receive more bachelor’s and master’s degrees globally than their male counterparts? In the United States, they also receive more doctoral degrees. We also do brilliantly in team-based organizational structures like, say, a corporate board. According to a 2013 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, women are in fact more attracted to cooperative environments than men. For good measure, women also have high emotional intelligence. In a quantitative review involving more than 23,000 participants in 26 cultures, researchers found that women are more sensitive, considerate and humble than men — “arguably one of the least counter-intuitive findings in the social sciences,” as the Harvard Business Review put it. (In other words: duh.) “Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board.” Just wondering: Have you ever asked an actual living woman about this? I’d posit that the real hassle is all the men questioning whether you belong there in the first place. There are lots of studies that show women handle pressure just fine, by the way. Here’s one, from the University at Buffalo, that found that estrogen helps females do better under stress than men, at least in rats (O.K., maybe a stretch); this one about tennis players, from Switzerland’s University of St. Gallen, found “that men consistently choke under competitive pressure, but with regard to women the results are mixed.” “Shareholders just aren’t interested in the makeup of the board, so why should we be?” Shareholders care about money, right? More women, it turns out, yields better returns. According to a 2009 study published in the American Sociological Review, gender diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers and greater relative profits. Catalyst, meanwhile, has determined that Fortune 500 companies with the highest representation of female directors had significantly higher financial performance. If you need even more convincing, check out this study, from McKinsey, which predicts that true gender equality would increase the global gross domestic product by $12 trillion. “My other board colleagues wouldn’t want to appoint a woman on our board.” Here’s the thing: It may no longer be a choice. Throughout Europe, a number of mandates are forcing corporations to boost the ratio of women holding board seats. Britain, for example, has called for women to make up a third of all board members among the top 350 publicly listed companies by 2020. “We have one woman already on the board, so we are done — it is someone else’s turn.” One woman is definitely better than none. But if you buy into what social scientists call “critical mass,” it takes a number of women in the room — usually around a third — for there to be meaningful effects. (Read more about what happens when women reach an influence of critical mass here.) “We need to build the pipeline from the bottom — there just aren’t enough senior women in this sector.” But wait! Having women at the top actually motivates women at lower levels to want to rise up, according to research published in the Strategic Management Journal. Be an ally! “I don’t think women fit comfortably into the board environment.” If you’re talking about physical comfort, you’re absolutely right. Have you ever noticed how cold it is in most boardrooms? Turns out, that’s about gender too: Most office temperatures are — I’m not joking — set to male comfort levels standards. So please, turn down the A.C. — and get your facts straight.

2018,Gender at the Group of 7: Can Making It a Priority Accelerate Change?,"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada put women front and center in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, he surprised some people. After all, the annual forum is a male-dominated event if there ever was one. Women make up a fifth of participants. “I’d like to focus on a fundamental shift that every leader in this room can act on immediately, one that I have made a central tenet of my leadership,” Mr. Trudeau told a packed room in Davos. “I’m talking about hiring, promoting and retaining more women. And not just because it’s the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, but because it’s the smart thing to do.” He then reeled off a series of telling statistics. Gender parity could add $1.75 trillion to the gross domestic product of the United States, he said, and $2.5 trillion to China’s. In Canada, reducing the gender gap could result in $150 billion more in annual economic output by 2026, according to McKinsey & Company, he added. Now Mr. Trudeau’s country holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 7 industrialized nations, and gender equality has become one of the organization’s top priorities, too. The Canadian government has appointed a Gender Equality Advisory Council to “support leaders and ministers in ensuring that gender equality and gender-based analysis are integrated across all themes, activities and outcomes of Canada’s G-7 presidency,” according to the advisory council’s website. The 21-member council is led by Melinda Gates, a chairwoman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Isabelle Hudon, Canada’s ambassador to France and Monaco. Other members include Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel peace laureate. “Canada is on a trajectory when it comes to gender,” said Katja Iversen, who is also on the council, and is chief executive of the gender-equality advocacy group Women Deliver. She noted that the Canadian cabinet had as many women as men, and that the country unveiled a gender-responsive national budget in February. The task of her gender advisory council, she said, was “to come up with the plans of what the world should look like for girls and women,” and “what the G-7 countries should do and commit to do” to improve prospects for girls and women. It’s not the first time that gender is high on the agenda of the world’s most powerful leaders. At the Group of 7 summit meeting in Taormina, Sicily, last year during Italy’s presidency of the organization, women’s rights appeared toward the top of the final communiqué. “Gender equality is fundamental for the fulfillment of human rights and a top priority for us, as women and girls are powerful agents for change,” the Group of 7 leaders said in their communiqué. Tacked onto the final communiqué was a separate document, “Roadmap for a Gender-Responsive Economic Environment,” with pledges by the seven countries to increase women’s participation and leadership in all walks of life, promote female entrepreneurship, improve women’s access to jobs and equal pay, and stop violence against girls and women. This year, Canada has appointed a council of women whose task is to offer pointers to the Group of 7’s predominantly male leadership. Of the seven nations in the organization, two, Germany and Britain, have women leaders. Ms. Iversen said she and her fellow council members started their deliberations in the early part of the year and made recommendations to Mr. Trudeau and to Canada’s Group of 7 representatives. The recommendations, she said, concerned issues such as sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence, jobs and peace and security. During the deliberations, she said Ms. Gates emphasized the importance of having access to gender-specific data. “A lot of data in the world today is not sex-disaggregated. You just get averages,” Ms. Iversen said. “If you can’t see where women live, die, work and have needs in terms of services or coverage, it’s difficult to make policies and investments that work.” How can the council hold to account the Group of 7, which was set up as the Group of 6 in 1975 as an informal talking shop for world leaders and whose good intentions are not necessarily going to be put into practice? “We’re not going to solve the issue,” Ms. Iversen replied. “We come up with suggestions.” She pointed out that gender inequality was “not a women’s problem” but rather a “societal” one. Next year, France takes over the rotating presidency of the Group of 7. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has made gender equality a priority. He has given women crucial cabinet posts and helped increase the percentage of women in the lower house of Parliament to 38, up from 27. His government is also introducing measures on equal pay, sexual harassment and violence against women. Ms. Iversen said she hoped France would also have a gender council and maybe even persuade the Group of 7 as a whole to institute one. What is needed, she explained, is “a continuing council that would look at what was promised and what was done” on every single issue.",The New York Times
2018,Genealogists Turn to Cousins’ DNA and Family Trees to Crack Five More Cold Cases,"Police arrested a D.J. in Pennsylvania and a nurse in Washington State this week, the latest examples of the use of an open-source ancestry site since the break in the Golden State killer case. When the Golden State Killer case was cracked in April with the help of a genealogist and an open-source ancestry site, many wondered if this was the new frontier of criminal investigations. This week all signs point to yes. In the last seven days, genealogical sleuthing techniques that are old to a handful of genealogists but new to most law enforcement have led to arrests in Washington State and Pennsylvania and unearthed a lead in a 37-year-old murder in Texas. All three cases were only revived when crime scene DNA was uploaded to GEDMatch, the same open-source ancestry site used in the Golden State killer case. CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist now working with Parabon, a forensic consulting firm, was involved in all three of the cases. She said she honed her techniques over a decade by helping thousands of adoptees track down their biological parents. “There are so many parallels,” she said in terms of how she uses relatives’ DNA and other publicly available data to build the branches of a family tree backward and then forward to focus in on a single person. GEDMatch, which contains about one million genetic profiles that people have uploaded after having their DNA analyzed by other companies such as 23andMe, updated its privacy policy, following the Golden State killer case to explicitly state that law enforcement may access a person’s profile to solve murder and sexual assault cases. It’s unclear if any of the cousins whose DNA helped lead to arrests have been notified that they played a role. Whether they should be told — and whose responsibility that would be — are among the many unresolved questions that have been raised with this new approach. It’s also wise to remember that a genetic match, on its own, is not an indicator of guilt. What it shows is that there is an extremely high probability that the DNA extracted from one source belongs to the same person as the DNA extracted from another source. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The victim: On March 26, 1986, 12-year-old Michella Welch was playing with her sisters in a park near her home in Tacoma, Wash. She offered to go pick up some sandwiches. She never made it back. The suspect: Gary C. Hartman, 66, who has worked as a nurse, was arrested last Wednesday and charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape. He pleaded not guilty. The path from cousins to suspect: A genetic profile was extracted from semen left at the scene. Ancestral analysis by Parabon provided investigators with a crucial clue: The person it matched had about 9 percent Native American DNA. Upon uploading this DNA to GEDMatch, Ms. Moore identified an individual who shared enough DNA to be a first cousin once removed, a dream scenario for a genetic sleuth. She also spotted a second cousin, which was promising, and a number of more distant cousins. But when she began to build the family tree, she was stumped. It was only when she considered the possibility of misattributed paternity — the person that public records said would have been the suspect’s grandfather was not actually his grandfather — that everything began to fall into place. She could trace the suspect’s ancestry back to his Native American great-great-grandparents on his father’s side and follow the movement of the family to Washington. Two brothers were then identified as people of interest because of their age and location at the time of the killing. After extracting DNA from a crumpled up napkin, police determined that Mr. Hartman was their guy. The victim: On Dec. 21, 1992, Christy Mirack, a 25-year-old teacher, was wrapping Christmas gifts when someone entered her house in Lancaster, Penn., and sexually assaulted and strangled her. The suspect: Raymond “D.J. Freez” Rowe, 49, was arrested on Monday. He has been working as a D.J. in Pennsylvania — and briefly in Southern Chile — since the late 1980s. These days, he not only performs at about 150 parties and events a year, he runs a D.J. academy, according to his website. The path from cousins to suspect: Parabon is not saying which relatives provided the initial match, only that GEDMatch was critical yet again. Once the building of the family tree — and other research — turned Mr. Rowe into a person of interest, police collected DNA from a piece of chewing gum and a water bottle at a party where he was D.J.’ing. It matched the genetic profile extracted from semen at the scene of the murder and Mr. Rowe was arrested, startling his community. The victim: In December 1981, Virginia Freeman, a 40-year-old realtor in Brazos County, Tex., went to meet a potential buyer. She was later found strangled and stabbed. Development: On Monday, the Brazos County sheriff announced that he believed James Otto Earhart, who was executed in 1999 for killing a 9-year-old girl, was responsible. The path from cousins to suspect: Upon uploading crime scene DNA to GEDMatch, Ms. Moore identified two second cousins and two third cousins once removed. By building a family tree back to their great-grandparents, and then filling in the branches, Ms. Moore came up with a list of relatives to research further. One family member turned out to be Mr. Earhart. Ms. Moore said that she then discovered that the child’s murder took place eight miles from the location where Ms. Freeman was killed. She had her lead. Because Mr. Earhart was dead, there was no easy way to run his DNA against the DNA left under Ms. Freeman’s fingernails. A DNA sample provided by Mr. Earhart’s son did show, however, that the person who left DNA at the crime scene was his father, Ms. Moore said. The subject: A man who checked into a hotel room in a remote part of Washington State under the false name Lyle Stevik. An active online community, detailed in an article at The Outline, tried to identify the man. Because he took his life not long after Sept. 11., the terrorist attacks played a role in some of the conspiracy theories that emerged. The development: In early May, the man was finally identified and his family was notified. His name has not been publicly released, much to the dismay of some people who assisted with his case. The path from cousins to an identity: Even before the Golden State killer case drew attention to this approach, the DNA DOE Project has been using public genealogical data and DNA profiles on GEDMatch to try to identify victims of murder and suicide that police cannot. In order to figure out who Lyle Stevik really was, a genetic profile extracted from a vial of blood was uploaded to GEDMatch. “We had tons and tons of matches,” said Margaret Press, one of the co-founders of the DNA DOE Project, in an interview. Eventually she and her team had a lucky break. “We contacted one of his matches to ask a question about her tree,” she said. “She mentioned a relative had been missing for 20 years. We got more information and everything fell into place.” The victims: In 1987, Jay Cook, 20, and Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18, were brutally killed while vacationing in Washington State. The suspect: William Earl Talbott II, 55, of Seatac, Wash., was arrested in May and charged with murder, and pleaded not guilty. The path from cousins to suspect: After finding second cousins on GEDMatch, Ms. Moore, built out a family tree all the way back to those individuals’ great-grandparents and then forward to two descendants who tied the two families together. The couple identified in the genealogical research had just one son, Mr. Talbott, who would have been 24 at time of the murders. His parents’ home was about seven miles from where Mr. Cook’s body was found. After surveilling Mr. Talbott for several days, detectives collected DNA from a cup he discarded, which matched the DNA extracted from semen at the scene.",The New York Times
2018,"General Motors, Migrants, ICE: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “We are putting out a damn newspaper.” As The Capital Gazette came under siege Thursday, with a gunman opening fire in the newsroom and killing five people, the journalists never stopped working. A suspect, Jarrod Ramos, was charged with five counts of murder. He barricaded the door to prevent people from fleeing the attack, the police said, and had a history of making general threats against the newspaper. Here’s what else we know about him. The victims included four journalists and a sales assistant. President Trump, who has railed against the news media, condemned the attack. “Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their jobs.” _____ 2. Through strategic praise and Trump family connections, the White House had quietly been encouraging Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire. President Trump, with Justice Kennedy, center, now has a second opportunity in 18 months to drastically reshape the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has said he’d like to appoint a justice who would overrule Roe v. Wade, and has begun reaching out to senators who will vote on his nominee. Republicans are bracing for a bitter fight. With Democrats largely powerless to block a Trump appointee, eyes are on two female Republican senators who could cast deciding votes. _____ 3. General Motors warned that new tariffs could force job cuts in the U.S. and drive up the price of its vehicles. “Increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller G.M.,” the company told the Commerce Department. Automakers have been caught in President Trump’s trade fight, as they rely on imported materials and parts from overseas. G.M., one of the country’s largest employers, currently has 110,000 workers in the U.S. _____ 4. The stakes are high for President Trump’s meeting with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, next month. Foreign policy experts, including some in his own administration, fear Mr. Trump will offer the same type of concessions to Mr. Putin that he did to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Mr. Trump declared success after that meeting, even though North Korea conceded virtually nothing on its military or missiles programs. “Trump sees a good meeting as a positive diplomatic achievement,” a former American ambassador to Moscow said. “That’s wrong. Good meetings are a means to an end.” _____ 5. Calls to abolish ICE used to be a rallying cry of the far left, but now they’re gaining traction in the midterm campaigns. Progressive candidates from New York to Hawaii have embraced the calls. And the movement even has some support in the agency’s own ranks: At least 19 agents are seeking to dissolve the agency, fearing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has limited their ability to pursue national security threats, child pornography and transnational crime. _____ 6. In marathon overnight talks, E.U. leaders reached a deal on migration, but the details remain sketchy. The agreement would shore up Europe’s borders and create screening centers to help determine whether migrants are legitimate refugees. “We still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views,” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, above, said. The issue has rankled the E.U. for months and threatened the bloc’s unity. We compare Europe’s immigration conflicts with the debate in the U.S. _____ 7.

2018,"Gennady Rozhdestvensky, a Leading Russian Conductor, Dies at 87","Gennady Rozhdestvensky, the Russian conductor who championed an eclectic array of music, including works by Alfred Schnittke and Sofia Gubaidulina at a time when the Soviet establishment frowned on those composers, died on Saturday. He was 87. His son, the violinist Sasha Rozhdestvensky, confirmed the death but did not say where his father died. He had struggled with heart problems, diabetes and cancer, his son said. Mr. Rozhdestvensky, widely admired for the emotional intensity and spontaneity of his performances, recorded some 786 works, ranging from repertory staples to neglected music. He inspired many composers, including Ms. Gubaidulina, who created an orchestral work for him influenced by the “rhythm of his movements.” In an essay in 1991, Schnittke wrote: “I once calculated that there are now some 40 compositions written for Rozhdestvensky — either derived from his ideas or else he was the first to conduct them. I could not believe it, but it really is so. I could even say that nearly all my own work as a composer depended on contact with him and on the many talks we had. It was in these talks that I conceived the idea for many of my compositions.” At the height of the Cold War, Mr. Rozhdestvensky was one of the elite Soviet artists permitted to tour abroad. In 1962, at the Edinburgh Festival, he conducted the first performances in the West of Shostakovich’s Symphonies No. 4 and No. 12, with the composer in the audience. In 1971 he conducted the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in a program of Borodin, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev at the BBC Proms. He was one of the most prominent conductors in Russia. As the chief conductor of the State Symphony Orchestra of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, he recorded the complete symphonies of Shostakovich, Glazunov, Prokofiev and Bruckner. He was also the principal conductor of the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra for more than a decade. Yet he struggled within the confines of the Soviet system, saying: “It is too difficult for me to work with such a bureaucratic machine. It interferes with my creativity and with my art.” In 1974, Mr. Rozhdestvensky took a risk by conducting Schnittke’s vast, exuberant and polystylistic Symphony No. 1, giving the premiere in Gorky instead of Moscow to avoid provoking the authorities. He also led world premieres of music by leading composers, including Edison Denisov, Rodion Shchedrin and John Tavener, and championed the work of many others, including Prokofiev and the Georgian composer Giya Kancheli. Mr. Rozhdestvensky led the first complete staging of Prokofiev’s opera “War and Peace” in 1959. He conducted the Russian premiere of Britten’s “A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream” in 1965 and, in 1974, the first Soviet revival of Shostakovich’s “The Nose,” which had not been performed since 1930. He also introduced Soviet audiences to the music of Hindemith, Poulenc, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Orff, among others. Gennady Nikolayevich Anosov was born on May 4, 1931, to a musical family. His father, Nikolai Anosov, was a conductor and professor at the Moscow Conservatory; his mother, Natalya Rozhdestvenskaya, was a soprano. He used his mother’s name, in its masculine form, professionally to avoid the appearance of nepotism, according to the Bolshoi Theater website. At the Moscow Conservatory he studied piano with Lev Oborin and conducting with his father. He made his debut as a conductor leading the Bolshoi Theater Orchestra in Tchaikovsky’s “Sleeping Beauty” while still a student, inaugurating a long association with the Bolshoi, where he was principal conductor from 1964 to 1970. Mr. Rozhdestvensky was appointed the ballet and opera company’s artistic director in 2000. But known to be prickly, he resigned the next year after conducting the original version of Prokofiev’s opera “The Gambler”; among other issues, he complained of being treated unfairly by Moscow journalists. In 2014 Mr. Rozhdestvensky conducted the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet in a two-week residency at the Lincoln Center Festival that included three full ballet productions (“Swan Lake,” “Don Quixote” and “Spartacus”) and concert performances of Rimsky-Korsakov’s “The Tsar’s Bride.” In a review for Musical America, the critic Sedgwick Clark noted a few messy passages but added that he “couldn’t have cared less in light of the abundant warmth and beauty achieved.” Mr. Rozhdestvensky met Shostakovich while a student and went on to promote his music vigorously. “It would be difficult,” he once said, “to overestimate the significance of my relations with Dmitri Shostakovich and Alfred Schnittke, in that these two titans opened before me a musical universe, like a gigantic magnifying glass reflecting our fragile world.” The critic John von Rhein praised the “vibrancy, commitment and burning eloquence” of Mr. Rozhdestvensky’s interpretations of Shostakovich in 2016 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, saying that he “is an unconventional conductor but anything but an eccentric musician.” “He doesn’t use a podium,” Mr. von Rheim added, “and he wields his rapier-like baton less to beat time than to fire cues in every direction. But his musical intentions are always clear.” Mr. Rozhdestvensky, who liked to keep rehearsals short, once said, “I conduct,” adding: “And if it works, all the better. I’m not one for self-analysis.” But he certainly knew what he wanted. In an interview in 1987, Mr. Rozhdestvensky described his experience leading an ensemble in Europe: “I pleaded with them during rehearsal to play more quietly, but it made no difference.” He said: “The concertmaster told me, ‘But the score says mezzo-forte, not piano.’ I said, ‘If you are driving and see a red light and also a policeman waving you on, do you stop or go? Well, I’m a policeman and the music is a red light.’ ” He made his debut at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, in 1970 with Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov.” He also conducted at La Scala and the Paris Opera. He had stints as chief conductor at the Vienna Symphony, the Stockholm Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony, and was a guest conductor at important orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the London Symphony and the Royal Concertgebouw. In 2008, Mr. Rozhdestvensky was scheduled to conduct with the Boston Symphony Orchestra but withdrew because, he said, he was offended by its marketing. His name had not been included on a list of “Distinguished Conductors” and “Artists who inspire” in the orchestra’s brochure, and he was upset that promotional materials featured a prominent photo of the cellist Lynn Harrell but none of him. “I feel not only slighted, but I suffered what is called in Russian a moral insult,” he said at the time. He also canceled concerts with the Amsterdam Sinfonietta in 2006 and in 2016 at the Philharmonie in Paris after similar incidents. He attracted both support and derision for his decisions to walk out. Besides his son, survivors include his wife, the pianist Viktoria Postnikova, and three grandchildren. In a film by Bruno Monsaingeon, Mr. Rozhdestvensky discusses the mysterious art of conducting. “There are no secret formulas,” he says. “It largely depends on intuition. Or perhaps the weather. If one could explain conducting, there wouldn’t be 1,000 conductors, but 10,000. We’d put them in a class and tell them how to spin their arms. Fortunately, some things cannot be explained.”",The New York Times
2018,Gentrification’s Empty Victory,"Squatters turned an abandoned schoolhouse into a thriving arts center. Then it was sold to a developer, who evicted the tenants. Nearly two decades later, the building remains vacant. Gregg Singer in his office in the building that was once P.S. 64, once Charas, and now, except for him, vacant.CreditCreditHaruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times One day in the summer of 1998, bidders had gathered in the auditorium of 1 Police Plaza for a public auction of city property. The Giuliani administration in those years had taken to selling off underused land for profit. But a few of the lots, including some community gardens and a cultural center, were not only used, but loved. So when the auctioneer called out “Parcel 41,” announcing the sale of a 130,000-square-foot building in the East Village, the former Public School 64, mayhem erupted. “Within seconds, people are screaming and jumping on their seats,” recalled Gregg Singer, who at the time was a brash, young real estate developer eager to bid on Parcel 41. “And you look down and there’s all these crickets — thousands of them, all over the place.” Protesters had released 10,000 insects into the auditorium, hoping to prevent the sale of the building known to them as the Charas/El Bohio Community Center. It didn’t work. The cricket-keepers were led away in handcuffs, and an intermission was announced. Workers came in with brooms to clear the bugs, and after 45 minutes, the auction resumed, and Mr. Singer’s was the winning bid. The property at 605 East Ninth St. was his for $3.15 million. He considered it a steal, as he had budgeted for $12 million — assuming the somewhat biblical disruption was not an actual bad omen but just part of what he considered nonsense that would soon quiet down. Protesters clamored outside the building, but he was escorted by police through a basement exit. With the property under his name, he expected to evict the existing tenants, clearing his path for renovation on the ramshackle structure. Chino Garcia, a founding member of the Charas center who was there that day, recalled watching as one of Mr. Singer’s competitors bowed out of the bidding, intimidated by the spectacle. “One guy said: ‘You know something? I ain’t going to bid on this building,’” Mr. Garcia, 71, recalled recently. “‘Because you see all these young people yelling here and outside? They’re going to be around for a long time.’” And they were. For the next two decades, and as recently as last year, protesters have held rallies, written letters and remained organized, eventually gaining powerful allies, whose influence, Mr. Singer now claims, has led the city to stymie his redevelopment efforts. Today, Parcel 41 sits vacant, an exaggerated emptiness haunting the better part of the block between Avenues B and C with its darkened windows, many shattered and boarded with plywood. Both sides want to see it occupied. To Charas loyalists, it is an unforgivable waste of space that could be used by children and older people in the community. Mr. Singer, now 56, believes it would have been occupied long ago, were it not for the interference of bad actors. “Where’s intelligence?” he asked. “Where’s just basic education that you know this building is better occupied than not?” Public School 64 was completed in 1906, and until it closed in 1977, it educated the children of the local tenements, when the Lower East Side was largely peopled by Jewish, Italian, Eastern European and Russian immigrants. The school was designed by the celebrated architect C.B.J. Snyder in the French Renaissance Revival style, though much of its ornamentation was removed by Mr. Singer over a decade ago in what Mr. Singer himself admits was a failed attempt to prevent a landmark designation. P.S. 64 was built when a population boom necessitated the rapid construction of hundreds of public schools, but by the mid-70s, following the city’s fiscal crisis, life around it had dwindled. Landlords walked away from buildings; arson was not uncommon. Led by Latino immigrants, locals eventually reclaimed the abandoned spaces in their neighborhood. Mr. Garcia and others saw opportunity in the old school; they cleaned and rehabilitated the building for community use, ultimately securing a lease with the city to use it for arts and educational programming. The building was host to after-school programs, theater productions, dance workshops and film screenings. A New York University student named Spike Lee used the space to showcase his work. Margarita Lopez, 67, was part of Charas since almost its beginning. She had moved from Puerto Rico and had helped sweep the floors of the building while volunteering as a community organizer. She rose through the ranks to become chairwoman of the Lower East Side Joint Planning Council, then district leader in 1994. At the time of the auction, she was the newly elected councilwoman representing the district, having only been in office for roughly half a year. She didn’t attend the auction, because she knew it was a lost cause and the building would be sold. Every day, she says, she is reminded of this loss, the one unfinished project from her long tenure as a politician and activist. Her apartment on East 11th Street is in a building that looks directly at the derelict P.S. 64. “I see it every day — in the morning, in the night, during the middle of the day,” she said one afternoon in March, gazing out at the building that haunts her retirement. When Ms. Lopez moved to the neighborhood in 1978, Mr. Garcia and his cohorts had begun reclaiming the empty P.S. 64. The neighborhood was riddled with rubble-strewn lots and blighted by cocaine and heroin; abandoned buildings were taken over by dealers or demolished by the city in an effort to squash the drug trade. That year, she attended her first community meeting where locals strategized to transform those empty buildings into centers of arts and culture. The meeting took place in P.S. 64. Ms. Lopez had been an activist for women’s and gay rights in Puerto Rico, and in New York she was eager to immerse herself in local activism. At Charas, she found her place — even going so far as to say she “came to live in heaven” when she moved to Loisaida, as the neighborhood was known among Spanish speakers. Ms. Lopez served in various organizations on the Lower East Side before being elected to City Council, where she served two terms. But in those early years, she was cleaning buildings for $25 a day. She helped clean the Charas building. The first floor was painted white and turned into a gallery. The basement was made into a theater for the performing arts. And while painters and dancers flocked to the sprawling rooms with their large windows, hundreds attended meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. The neighborhood was hardly without grit; when it became known that the city planned to sell the building, in 1997, the Latin Kings street gang — which also met in Charas — came to its defense at a Community Board meeting. The board sided with the gang members, but the city was unmoved. Charas was behind on its rent, it claimed, and though the organization made several offers to buy the building, officials found none of the proposals tenable. Within a year, the building would go to Mr. Singer. Mr. Singer, director and president of his real estate firm, Singer Financial Corporation, does not buy into the displays of high emotion that follow the Charas legacy. Where others see “emotional attraction” to the building, he said, he sees “nonsense.” On the day he bought the building and the crickets were released, he did not recognize a desperate last-ditch effort to save a beloved community center, but a clever ploy by opportunists to keep their cheap, illegal sublets. “When people talk about this emotional tie to the building, I don’t get caught up,” said Mr. Singer, who met for two interviews in his office, located on the first floor of the old P.S. 64 building. “What they’re emotionally tied to is making money off someone else’s back illegally.” He said he became aware of P.S. 64 only a few weeks before the auction, via an auction booklet he received in the mail from the city. He liked the building and he liked the neighborhood, which he saw was improving, so he went for it. He became aware of the high emotion surrounding the property only a year later, when Charas was digging in its heels in the face of his eviction attempts. As planned, he served Charas with an eviction order almost immediately, though the remaining artists and activists did not go quietly, some chaining themselves together in protest. It took two and a half years before a judge ruled that the eviction could be enforced; police officers emptied the building in December 2001. Since then, Mr. Singer has done little to moderate his dismissals of the Charas legacy. It sometimes seems that he embraces his role as the villain, even as he brushes aside the accusation. He will allow that the center was a source of good for the community, particularly with its youth programs and addiction counseling. And yet he unapologetically reduces emotional appeals to “nonsense” and respected community-builders to freeloaders. “Anyone who’s in business, anyone who has raised a family, anyone who deals with everyday things in the real world would think this whole thing’s ridiculous,” he said of the ongoing controversy. “But they’re of that mind-set — what can we get? What can we steal from somebody today?” He sees the pro-Charas faction as a vocal minority with powerful allies who, through two decades of political machinations that began with Ms. Lopez, are keeping the building a vacant eyesore. He said he made an effort to recruit community groups for the facility at the beginning, but was blacklisted by the then-Councilwoman Lopez. Ms. Lopez denies this. The building Mr. Singer had purchased came with zoning restrictions. He could not simply repurpose the school as luxury condominiums, though his opponents often state that this is his long-term plan. By the time the eviction was carried out in 2001, his current plan emerged: P.S. 64 would become a dormitory for college students, which was permitted, he said, by the property’s deed. Mr. Singer maintains this would be a boon for the East Village, with its booming collegiate population. And yet the Department of Buildings will not approve the project. So Mr. Singer filed a suit this January against the city. (It was the latest in a series of at least four lawsuits, all so far unsuccessful.) The city, the suit claims, has obstructed his legal right to develop the property, bolstered by Aaron Sosnick, a wealthy neighbor to the building, and the influential Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, which has surpassed Charas as the most visible entity opposing Mr. Singer, and which has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Sosnick. The lawsuit largely rehashes an ordeal that has been publicly litigated since the center’s eviction. Mr. Singer’s plan for a 19-story dormitory was stymied by the city’s 2006 decision to landmark the building (a move championed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation), limiting him to the building’s existing five stories. Efforts to start building a five-story dorm space have been complicated by the passage of a zoning text amendment called Rule 51 — or the “Dorm Rule” — also supported by the Greenwich Village Society, which lays out guidelines by which dorm developers must abide, including providing a 10-year lease with an educational institution as proof of intention. It also mandates that those institutions, not their landlords, control their leased facilities. The Department of Buildings has been a bit unpredictable in its dealings with Mr. Singer and its enforcement of the Dorm Rule, issuing building permits only to revoke them. Mr. Singer has, in stops and starts, made progress in smoothing over issues with the department, but to no avail — a stop-work order from 2015 remains in place, and Mr. Singer’s requests to meet with officials have been rejected. Adelphi University, the most recent institution to express interest in dormitory space, backed out. A spokesman for the university, Todd Wilson, said in an email that the school was “concerned about the delays and difficulties that had been encountered by the developers getting the project approved.” Mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, has gone further, claiming in October that his administration is interested in buying back P.S. 64 — but no movement has come from City Hall to that end since his announcement, and the mayor’s office has declined to discuss the plan further. Mr. Singer detects a conspiracy, but the buildings department insists the developer is simply not following the rules. “We denied the developer’s application twice last year because they failed to submit sufficient proof that the building would be used as a student dormitory,” said a buildings department spokesman, Joseph Soldevere. “We stand by our decision.” Mr. Singer, for all his lawsuits and harsh words for freeloaders and conspirators, remains insistently upbeat about the whole mess. He said he is unbothered by the “villain” label because it is simply not true. When asked about the initial auction mayhem in retrospect, he speaks as though swarms of crickets are par for the course, his tone light and genial. “I’m in real estate — this is part of the game,” he said. “This is like the long game, you know — this deal, that’s how I look at it.” Mr. Singer visits P.S. 64 about once a week. The only part of the building not falling apart, abandoned, graffitied or coated with pigeon droppings seems to be his modest office on the first floor, decorated with pristine renderings of “University Square” — a “new college living experience,” as the brochures claim, where students would enjoy a theater, a game room, yoga studios and other amenities. It could be great for the community, he insists. Why wouldn’t the city want this? Why wouldn’t the community? “The city, they should be knocking my door down, ‘Gregg, let’s renovate this building, let’s do something for the community,’” he said. “That’s what I’m surprised about. How government is so inept and so dysfunctional that they don’t care about the local community.” A faction of neighbors have recently sided with Mr. Singer, having grown tired of the protracted vacancy they say has made the block unsafe and unsightly and increasingly skeptical of the city’s explanations for the holdup. Paul Engler, a dancer who once rented space in Charas, was active in the push to landmark the building and considered himself an ally in the fight to reclaim it until the beginning of 2017, when he attended a community meeting about Charas and walked away with more questions than answers. He said he was frustrated by the lack of a concrete plan to reclaim the building, and was frustrated by the building’s vacancy. Mr. Engler, 60, is now a vocal supporter of the dormitory. Joining him is Jorge de Yarza, 40, who owns a tapas bar less than a block away from the schoolhouse. The two men in 2017 collected roughly 750 signatures from neighborhood residents in favor of the dorm plan moving ahead. Mr. Engler categorically stated that he is not in any way affiliated with the developer, but his change of heart has not endeared him to his neighbors, some of whom will no longer speak to him. Most recently, in January, an irate Aaron Sosnick berated him in Tompkins Square Park, yelling and wagging his finger and calling him a traitor. “‘How dare you?’” Mr. Engler recalled Mr. Sosnick saying. “Yelling, yelling, yelling. Very, very angry because I disagreed with him about something.” When reached by email, Mr. Sosnick, though declining to address other allegations, confirmed the episode. “I did in fact tell Paul Engler that he betrayed his friends,” he wrote. Even Ms. Lopez has pulled back from championing Charas. She retired from public life in 2014. The transition, she said, has not been easy. She is the super of her building, and she keeps herself busy with tasks that seem small compared to the oversize drama of Charas. In March she was hard at work re-tiling her building’s tiny lobby. She has ceded the fight to the preservation society — her voice no longer carries the weight it once did, she said. But she promised to rise up for the center if called upon. “I think it’s the fire inside, that it start going down,” she said. “But when Charas is mentioned, the fire comes back, because it’s like the last item that is not finished under my responsibility.”",The New York Times
2018,"George N. Leighton, Lawyer Who Fought Segregation, Dies at 105","CHICAGO — George N. Leighton, a distinguished Chicago lawyer and judge who worked to desegregate juries and schools, advocated for people facing the death penalty and represented a Chicago crime boss, died on June 6 in Brockton, Mass. He was 105. His death, at a veterans hospital, was confirmed by Langdon Neal, the executor of Mr. Leighton’s estate. He had returned to Massachusetts, his home state, after retiring. When Mr. Leighton moved to Chicago in the 1940s, he and other African-Americans could not join local bar associations or rent space at most downtown office buildings. But by the end of his six-decade career he was one of the most accomplished lawyers in the city’s history. That career included stints as a lawyer in private practice, as an assistant state attorney general and as a judge in state and federal courts. “He was an icon,” said Ruben Castillo, the chief judge for the United States District Court for Northern Illinois. “His legal career is like second to none. He did things that were just unheard-of.” As a lawyer in 1951, Mr. Leighton filed a lawsuit on behalf of a black family that had been blocked by white residents from moving into an apartment in Cicero, a white suburb of Chicago. Cicero residents responded to the family’s intended move with violence, and Mr. Leighton was indicted on charges of conspiracy to incite a riot. Thurgood Marshall, the future United States Supreme Court justice, represented Mr. Leighton, and the indictment was dismissed. “The kinds of cases that he was willing to take on, often with no fee involved at all, simply because it was the right thing to do, I think changed the conception that people had at that time of what an African-American lawyer might really be about,” Timothy C. Evans, the chief judge of the Chicago area’s Cook County Circuit Court, said in a telephone interview. Many of Mr. Leighton’s biggest cases as a lawyer focused on racial justice and segregation. In Mississippi, he challenged the systematic exclusion of African-Americans from juries and won a new trial for a black client who had been convicted of murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. In Alabama, he helped bring about the demise of an amendment to the state constitution that had been designed to prevent African-Americans from registering to vote. And in Harrisburg, Ill., he filed a lawsuit seeking to desegregate the local school system. Back in Chicago, in a very different case, Mr. Leighton famously represented the organized crime leader Sam Giancana. In one instance, after Mr. Leighton persuaded a judge to order the F.B.I. to limit its surveillance of his client, an appreciative Mr. Giancana gave him a gold wristwatch, which he wore for many years, Mr. Neal said. Mr. Leighton was named to an Illinois circuit court bench in 1964; became the first black person to serve as an Illinois district appellate judge in 1969; and, nominated by President Gerald R. Ford, was confirmed for the federal bench for the Northern District of Illinois in 1976. He retired from the bench in 1987 to return to private practice and continued working as a lawyer until 2011, shortly before his 100th birthday. “He was a man who loved the law,” said William J. Bauer, 91, a longtime friend and a senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in a phone interview. “He loved the judicial system and he loved people.” In state court, Judge Leighton acquitted two Puerto Rican teenagers who had been accused of assaulting Chicago police officers. He ruled that the officers had used unreasonable force by drawing their weapons while arresting the young men. The decision led some to seek his removal from the bench. Later, as a federal judge, he ruled that under the First Amendment Chicago officials had to allow a Nazi group to hold a rally at a city park. He was born George Neves Leitao on Oct. 22, 1912, in New Bedford, Mass.; his surname was Anglicized during childhood. His parents, Antonio Neves Leitao and Anna Silva Garcia, had emigrated from Cape Verde, an archipelago nation about 385 miles off the coast of Senegal, and worked in Massachusetts as itinerant agricultural laborers. Mr. Leighton earned a bachelor’s degree from Howard University in 1940 and enrolled at Harvard Law. He left law school to serve as an Army officer in the Pacific during World War II and rose to captain. He resumed law school after his service and graduated in 1946. Mr. Leighton lived most recently at the veterans facility in Brockton. He is survived by his daughters, Virginia Reynolds and Barbara Whitfield; five grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. His wife, Virginia Quivers Leighton, died in 1992. In 2012, Chicago’s main criminal courthouse became the Honorable George N. Leighton Criminal Court Building. His old desk is in the courthouse lobby, along with a description of his career. “The same place that indicted him and prosecuted him is now named after him,” said Judge Evans, who studied under Mr. Leighton in the 1960s at John Marshall Law School. At the courthouse naming ceremony in 2012, Mr. Leighton played down his accomplishments. “I practiced law,” he said. “That’s all I did.”",The New York Times
2018,Georgia Police Officer Is Fired After Striking Man With Patrol Car,"A rookie police officer in Georgia was swiftly fired over the weekend after body camera video showed him striking a man with his patrol car during a pursuit. An internal investigation by the Athens-Clarke County Police Department determined that the officer, Taylor Saulters, used excessive force when he struck the man, Timmy Patmon, with his vehicle on Friday. Chief Scott Freeman fired Officer Saulters on Saturday after initially placing him on administrative leave, said Eppi Rodriguez, a police spokesman. The Georgia State Patrol is investigating the crash and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is conducting a criminal investigation, Mr. Rodriguez added. Mr. Patmon suffered scrapes and bruises and was taken to a hospital for evaluation, a police statement said. “We work every day to build a rapport and relationships with the community so that when situations like this occur they know we will act in good faith,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “We’ll continue to be transparent and answer questions.” Efforts to reach Officer Saulters were unsuccessful on Sunday, and Mr. Rodriguez said the department was not associated with a union that represents its officers. Officer Saulters had been with the department for about a year, Mr. Rodriguez said, and had an “exemplary record” before Friday’s episode. Mr. Patmon, who is in his mid-20s, was wanted on a felony probation warrant stemming from a drug charge involving possession of methamphetamine and marijuana, Mr. Rodriguez said. He was arrested and charged with felony probation violation and misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer. In a statement posted on Facebook, the police said the chase began Friday around 7:30 p.m. Officer Hunter Blackmon and Officer Saulters were on patrol when Officer Blackmon saw Mr. Patmon, who he knew was wanted on a felony probation warrant. As the officers confirmed the warrant and attempted to confront Mr. Patmon, he fled, the police said. Officer Blackmon chased him down a sidewalk on foot while Officer Saulters tried to get ahead of him with his police vehicle, the statement said. A recording from Officer Saulters’s body camera, which was released by the police on Saturday, shows Officer Saulters, who is white, swerving left toward Mr. Patmon, who is black. The car hits a curb, flattening the front tire on the driver’s side, during an apparent attempt to block Mr. Patmon’s path, the police said. Mr. Patmon then emerges to the right of the vehicle, which Officer Saulters had driven back onto the road. As Mr. Patmon moves in front of the car, Officer Saulters keeps driving and strikes him. The police said Officer Saulters was maneuvering in an attempt to accelerate past Mr. Patmon. “We got him,” Officer Saulters says on the video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook. After a struggle on the ground, Officer Saulters commands Mr. Patmon to “give us your hands now or you’re going to get tased.” “Make a good decision,” he warns, as onlookers yell in protest. “I got him with my car — that’s what they’re yelling about,” Officer Saulters says later. Officers then request an ambulance for Mr. Patmon and later allow a woman to give him a cigarette. Eventually, Officer Saulters drives for several minutes to another location. When he exits the vehicle, he immediately tells other police officers, “I didn’t hit him with the car; I blocked him with the car.” “He ran into the hood of my car and bounced off,” he continues. Another police officer asks Officer Saulters if he has his body camera on. “As long as you didn’t make some kind of overt movement to strike him,” the officer says, “you’re going to be fine.”",The New York Times
2018,Georgia Resident Convicted of Murder in ‘Heinous’ 1983 Killing of Black Man,"In the fall of 1983, the slashed, scarred body of a 23-year-old black man was discovered in a grassy roadside area in a small Georgia city, about 40 miles south of Atlanta. Then, for much of the next 34 years, the case went cold. Last October, the authorities announced a break in the case. The man, Timothy Coggins, had been the victim of what the local sheriff called a “heinous,” racially motivated hate crime. He would not detail it, but said the authorities had arrested two white men and charged them with murder. On Tuesday, one of those men, Frank Gebhardt, 60, was convicted of murder, battery, assault and other charges in the killing of Mr. Coggins. He was sentenced to life plus 30 years in prison. “Hopefully, sir, you have stabbed your last victim,” Judge W. Fletcher Sams of Spalding County Superior Court said as he handed down the sentence. The other murder defendant, Bill Moore — Mr. Gebhardt’s brother-in-law — is awaiting trial later this year. Throughout the trial, prosecutors laid out the disturbing details that had previously been withheld: Mr. Gebhardt and Mr. Moore, they said, had dragged Mr. Coggins behind a truck and stabbed him more than 30 times, leaving “X” marks cut into his body. Witnesses said they believed Mr. Coggins had had a relationship with Mr. Gebhardt’s white girlfriend, District Attorney Ben Coker for the Griffin Judicial Circuit in Georgia said in a phone interview. They said they saw Mr. Coggins attend a predominantly black nightclub in Spalding County on Oct. 7, 1983, and then get into a car with Mr. Gebhardt and Mr. Moore. Another witness, Mr. Coker said, spotted the group the next morning in Sunny Side, Ga., a city in northern Spalding County, and said Mr. Gebhardt and Mr. Moore were arguing with a black man, Timothy Coggins. Larkin Lee, a lawyer for Mr. Gebhardt, of Griffin, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Tuesday evening. Mr. Coggins’s body was discovered on Oct. 9, 1983, in Sunny Side. The Spalding County Sheriff’s Office conducted an extensive investigation at the time, but the case went cold until March of last year, when the authorities said new evidence surfaced. By October, law enforcement had arrested Mr. Gebhardt and Mr. Moore and charged both men with murder and other crimes. Mr. Coker said Tuesday that witnesses had eventually come forward, saying that Mr. Gebhardt had bragged openly about having committed the crime. Three other people, Gregory Huffman, Sandra Bunn — Mr. Gebhardt’s sister — and her son, Lamar Bunn, were each charged last year with obstruction in the case, Mr. Coker said. Mr. Huffman, who was a detention officer with the Spalding County Sheriff’s Office, is accused of alerting Mr. Gebhardt to part of the investigation, Mr. Coker said. Ms. Bunn is accused of feeding Mr. Gebhardt information about how to avoid DNA testing, Mr. Coker said. Mr. Bunn, who worked at Milner Police Department in Lamar County, is also accused of providing information to Mr. Gebhardt that obstructed the investigation, Mr. Coker said. All three have been indicted by a grand jury and are awaiting trial, he added. At the time the charges were announced, Heather Coggins, the victim’s niece, told The New York Times that for years, the family had known next to nothing about who had committed the murder, or how. She also expressed hope that her family would “see justice” before long. Speaking with The Times again on Tuesday, Ms. Coggins, 41, of Griffin, described how the killing had affected her family and said that she had been unsure what the jury would decide as she sat in the courtroom. As the guilty verdicts were read, she said, she held hands with family members and cried. “Yes we’re angry, yes we’re sad,” she said, recalling the time right after her uncle was murdered, when she was only 6. “We were even scared 34 years ago.”. “Today,” she said, “we know what happened. Of course, it doesn’t make us sleep better at night, but now we know what happened.” Ms. Coggins spoke during Mr. Gebhardt’s sentencing and acknowledged how hard the trial had been on both her family and the Gebhardts. “I don’t think there’s anything that I could’ve said to Mr. Gebhardt that would change him,” Ms. Coggins said in an interview, noting that her family had long ago forgiven whoever was responsible for the killing. “That’s something that’s going to have to come from God, in time.”",The New York Times
2018,Georgia’s Prime Minister Resigns After Protests and Party Infighting,"MOSCOW — The prime minister of Georgia resigned on Wednesday, citing disagreements with Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the governing party and the country’s richest man. The resignation of Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili was announced in the wake of a series of antigovernment protests that have disrupted Tbilisi, the capital. “We have had a number of fundamental disagreements with the party’s leader over the past months,” Mr. Kvirikashvili, who has headed the government since 2015, said in a televised briefing, without going into details. “Today is the moment when the party’s chairman should have the opportunity to form a team on the basis of his own views.” In May, Mr. Ivanishvili announced his return to politics in Georgia, a former Soviet republic in the southern Caucasus Mountains between Russia and Turkey. Mr. Ivanishvili, a businessman, was elected chairman of the governing Georgian Dream party, which he had founded. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Ivanishvili made billions in the Russian banking and metal industries. In 2012, he founded his own party in Georgia, which defeated Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement in a parliamentary election the same year. Mr. Ivanishvili became prime minister, only to step aside in favor of a longtime business associate, Irakli Garibashvili, in 2013. With his fortune estimated at about a third of Georgia’s gross domestic product, Mr. Ivanishvili was believed to control the country’s politics from his futuristic palace, which sits atop of one of the hills overlooking Tbilisi. In a speech at his party’s convention, which elected him chairman in May, Mr. Ivanishvili cited economic underdevelopment, disagreements within his party and the hostility of his opponents as reasons for his re-entry into politics. Olesya Vartanyan, a Tbilisi-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, said both Mr. Ivanishvili’s return to politics and the protests were related to diminished public trust in Georgia’s government. “The Georgian government has been in crisis for quite a long time,” Ms. Vartanyan said. “Mr. Ivanishvili’s comeback and popular protests are just symptoms of this process.” One wave of protests was provoked by the murder of two teenagers, who were killed in a knife fight in central Tbilisi last December. Zaza Saralidze, the father of one of the two 16-year-old boys, accused the country’s prosecutors of a cover-up to protect the assailants. Since the end of May, Mr. Saralidze has been leading demonstrations, setting up tents in front of Parliament and periodically blocking Tbilisi’s main thoroughfare. The country’s prosecutor general was forced to resign, but the protesters demanded the resignation of the prime minister as well. Earlier in May, Tbilisi was the scene of a different kind of protest. Thousands of young people gathered in front of Parliament to protest against a heavy-handed antidrug police raid on two nightclubs in the capital. That time, however, instead of just shouting political slogans, the protesters also danced to techno music, turning a rally into a party.",The New York Times

WHEN THE CENTER HELD Gerald Ford and the Rescue of the American Presidency By Donald Rumsfeld Illustrated. 331 pp. Free Press. $28. In September 1974, a month after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace, President Gerald Ford pardoned him. “Jesus, don’t you think it’s kind of early?” asked Ford’s friend Tip O’Neill, the Democratic House majority leader. “You’re not gonna believe it,” Carl Bernstein exclaimed to his fellow Nixon chaser at The Washington Post, Bob Woodward. “The son of a bitch pardoned the son of a bitch!” The public was also taken aback. A majority of the nation — 55 percent — believed the pardon was the “wrong thing” to do, versus only 35 percent who felt it was the “right thing.” Ford’s approval ratings, a robust 71 percent when he took office, spiraled down to 40 percent by December. The decision to pardon Nixon may have ensured that Ford would not be elected to his own full term as president in 1976. “When Ford made his final decision to pardon Nixon, he did it without making any political calculations,” Donald Rumsfeld writes in “When the Center Held,” his sympathetic insider’s memoir of the Ford presidency. Rumsfeld had befriended Ford as a fellow Midwestern congressman in the 1960s and helped him make the transition from vice president when Nixon resigned. “He did not, for example, share his intention with any Republican members of Congress, where he certainly would have been able to find some support. Nor did he take any steps to prepare a media strategy. To the contrary, on learning of Ford’s decision to pardon Nixon the newly appointed White House press secretary, Jerry terHorst, promptly submitted his resignation 30 minutes before Ford was scheduled to address the nation.” The rumors that Nixon’s chief of staff, Al Haig, had brokered a deal with Ford were “wildly inaccurate,” Rumsfeld writes. Ford was acting out of the goodness of his heart, from his basic sense of decency, Rumsfeld argues. “We are not a vengeful people,” the new president told himself, perhaps a little wishfully. One poll showed that a significant majority — 56 percent — believed that Nixon should be prosecuted. Rumsfeld has written a kind of modern-day “Pilgrim’s Progress” about a good and godly man who enters the Slough of Despond (Washington, D.C.), is tried and tempted, but ascends to Celestial City with his virtue intact. That the narrator is a figure who has been likened in some quarters to Beelzebub makes the story more interesting, or at least curious. Rumsfeld himself was “not sure” what he would have counseled about pardoning Nixon. Ford did not ask his advice. But the new president did ask Rumsfeld to be his chief of staff. Rumsfeld initially balked, saying that Ford’s open-door “spokes of a wheel” management style was a prescription for disorder. “Come on, Rummy,” Ford pleaded. “Say yes.” Rumsfeld did, but he was soon frustrated by his lack of control over the large egos wandering in and out of the Oval Office. The members of Ford’s cabinet did not get along. The prideful and condescending defense secretary, James Schlesinger, squabbled with the prima donna secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. “Jim’s problem isn’t with you; it’s with me. He thinks I’m a dummy,” Ford told Kissinger with characteristic self-effacement. Kissinger would try to get his way by threatening to quit, as he had under Nixon. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller was a bull in a china shop. The bulls at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue were no easier to herd. Congress refused to spend any more money to aid South Vietnam, despite Ford’s appeal to “fundamental decency.” “Those bastards,” Ford exclaimed when the Senate rejected his appeal in the winter of 1975, as Saigon was collapsing. But that was as angry as he got. “Ford tended to assume most people were like him: essentially open, up front and without guile or cunning,” Rumsfeld writes. The president’s chief of staff was a little puzzled by his boss’s persistent amiability: “I did wonder whether there might be a bit of disadvantage to his characteristic down-home relaxed demeanor.” Rumsfeld noted privately at the time: “He never protects himself from having other people see him in a relaxed situation. Can a great leader let down and still inspire?” Looking back, Rumsfeld concluded, “I may well have underestimated the positive impact of the president’s natural approach.” Indeed, he concludes that Ford’s genial Midwestern decency was just what the country needed in the wake of Nixon’s excesses and the Watergate scandal. Still, Rumsfeld himself quit when he was unable to persuade the president to consolidate power in his chief of staff. (Ford was leery of Nixon’s “Berlin Wall” of the White House advisers H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.) Rumsfeld became secretary of defense instead. More in sorrow than in anger, Ford held Rumsfeld (along with the Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev) responsible for thwarting a final arms control deal with the Soviet Union that Ford badly hoped for as his legacy. Ford was so trusting that before the 1976 campaign, he wanted all the potential presidential candidates to meet at Camp David to forge a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy. Instead, Ronald Reagan attacked him for being soft on the Russians with his policy of — that French word — détente. Narrowly surviving at the Republican convention after a bruising campaign, Ford spontaneously invited Reagan to join him at the podium as a show of Republican unity. Reagan promptly upstaged him with a fiery speech that laid the groundwork for his 1980 Reagan Revolution. It would have been easy enough to cast the earnest, well-meaning Ford as a bit of a chump, but Rumsfeld portrays him as an honorable and brave man. Escaping an assassination attempt by Lynette Alice (Squeaky) Fromme, the president acted as if nothing had happened and, later in the day, had to be persuaded by the Secret Service not to shake hands with all the people waiting for him at the airport. With the help of his two longtime speechwriters, Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, Rumsfeld has produced a warm bath of a book. Readers may find it a little odd that Rumsfeld, that terror of bureaucrats in the George W. Bush administration, extols the virtues of Christian turn-the-other-cheek leadership. In his career, Rumsfeld’s true ideology seems to have been power — America’s and his own. Rumsfeld was initially talent-spotted by Nixon, who brought him into his administration to dismantle the war on poverty, but then decided he could not trust Rumsfeld’s political ambition and dispatched him with an ambassadorship to Brussels. As secretary of defense during the 2003 Iraq war, Rumsfeld steamrollered Bush’s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and the secretary of state, Colin Powell. What, besides a desire to warm up his image, moved Rumsfeld to tell the story of Gerald Ford’s beneficent 895 days? Perhaps, as he says in his author’s note, he wanted to show that “the Washington, D.C., of today is not entirely different from that of 1974.” Or, possibly, he has become nostalgic because Washington really was different a half century ago, when the Republican Party still had moderates and you could solve problems over a round of golf. In any case, he offers us a reassuring morality tale of virtue if not immediately rewarded, then ultimately redeemed. OpinionMaureen Dowd",The New York Times
2018,"German Hard-Liners Want to Close Borders, Threatening Merkel Coalition","BERLIN — The populist surge that has left Hungary, Austria and Italy threatening to close their borders to migrants has now spread to Germany, where it could even bring down Chancellor Angela Merkel and further unhinge Europe Union’s cohesion and stability. In recent days, Ms. Merkel has faced an increasingly virulent mutiny over the issue, which threatens to fracture her governing coalition as early as next week. The mutiny is led by her own interior minister, Horst Seehofer, a former Bavarian premier with a towering stature and plenty of beer-tent charisma, who sounds more in line with the nativist forces shaping politics in neighboring countries than with his own boss. His region found itself on the front line of the refugee crisis in 2015, when Ms. Merkel opened the borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants who poured into Bavaria. He has long been an outspoken critic of her decision, and in recent days the two leaders have been locked in a standoff. Like Europe’s more hard-line politicians on the right, Mr. Seehofer wants Germany to turn back at the border migrants who have no papers or who are already registered in another European country. Ms. Merkel has blocked the proposal because it would defy Europe’s open-border agreement; place an even greater burden on southern European countries, often the first ones to register migrants; and risk widening the already gaping divisions in the European Union. The tensions in the bloc were on full display this week, when Italy’s new hard-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, turned away a rescue ship with more than 600 African migrants, threatening to leave them on the doorstep of his European neighbors, until Spain agreed to let them in. Because of its troubled history and Ms. Merkel’s welcoming stance in 2015, Germany seemed somewhat more immune than other countries to the populist wave washing over Europe. The Bavarian revolt, coming as the region is preparing for state elections in October, has now provided a powerful glimpse of the groundswell of nativist anger that is building even in the richest parts of Europe’s richest country. “The Bavarian conservatives are closing ranks with Europe’s populists,” said Andrea Römmele, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “This is serious. It’s pure populism.” The decision to open Germany’s borders to more than 1.4 million migrants has politically haunted the chancellor. Opposition to the decision buoyed the far-right in elections last year, leaving a weakened Ms. Merkel to struggle for six months to form a governing coalition. Part of the price for the support of the conservative, Bavaria-based Christian Social Union was having Mr. Seehofer in the powerful position he now holds. Tension between the two leaders have steadily built. In March, Mr. Seehofer stirred controversy when he declared that “Islam does not belong to Germany,” only to be contradicted by Ms. Merkel. Ms. Merkel wants to find a European solution to the migration issue at a summit meeting of the 28-country bloc in two weeks. “It is an issue that we must resolve at a European level,” Ms. Merkel said this week. “That is very important to me.” But Mr. Seehofer is not budging. The far-right Alternative for Germany (known by its German initials AfD) has been expanding its support in Bavaria, threatening the stronghold of Mr. Seehofer’s Christian Social Union, which now risks losing its absolute majority for only the second time in half a century. He and his party have responded by veering sharply to the right: The proposal to turn back migrants at the border is reminiscent of one AfD made late last year. In a spectacular gesture of defiance, Mr. Seehofer has given Ms. Merkel an ultimatum: If she does not agree to the measure, he will carry it out against her will. The implication is that the border police in Bavaria, the main gateway into Germany for migrants, could start turning them back at the border as early as next week. It is the most direct challenge to Ms. Merkel’s authority yet — and to the values her chancellorship has embodied. For Mr. Seehofer, turning migrants back at the border has become a symbol of re-establishing control. For Ms. Merkel, keeping the border open is the last remaining symbol of her liberal migration policy. “Asylum tourism must end,” said Markus Söder, the Bavarian premier, using language frequently used by populists to describe the influx of refugees. His government has recently passed a hard-line police reform measure that restricts civil liberties, and has floated the idea of a Bavarian border force — although Bavaria borders only fellow European Union member states. “We have to consider our own people, not always focus on the whole of Europe,” Mr. Söder said. Mr. Seehofer, who reportedly does not vacation abroad, could not agree more. As interior minister, he is also “heimat minister,” a position he created in Bavaria five years ago and now wants to export to the whole country. Heimat is a fuzzy but evocative German term roughly meaning home, identity and belonging. And he has been busy seeking like-minded allies elsewhere in Europe, where they are more and more of them. On Wednesday, he skipped a meeting with Ms. Merkel to meet an outspoken critic of hers instead: Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria, who was elected last year on a pledge to clamp down on illegal immigration and leads a coalition with the far-right. During a joint news conference, Mr. Kurz spoke of the need for “an axis of the willing” in the fight against illegal migration, a turn of phrase, some commentators pointed out, that was once used by Benito Mussolini to describe the alliance between Italy and Germany. As if on cue, Mr. Seehofer let slip that he had spoken to his Italian counterpart, Mr. Salvini, to forge an alliance on border security among Berlin, Vienna and Rome. Just a few days earlier, Mr. Salvini had turned away two migrant ships: “The nice life is over for illegal migrants,” he said recently. “They can pack their bags.” Mr. Seehofer is also a personal friend of Viktor Orban, Hungary’s anti-immigrant prime minister, whom he has hosted several times in Bavaria. When Mr. Orban won re-election in April, Mr. Seehofer warmly congratulated him. “Nothing is more powerful a validation than success at the ballot,” he had commented, despite election observers’ talk about a “climate of intimidation,” and warned the European Union not to be “arrogant and patronizing.” The son of a builder, who rose through the party ranks in Bavaria, Mr. Seehofer has unapologetically embraced populism: “I will not apologize for doing politics for the people,” he once remarked. Always on opposite ends of the conservative spectrum, Mr. Seehofer, 68, and Ms. Merkel, 63, nevertheless share a long and checkered history. In 2007, when Mr. Seehofer was a junior minister in her first government, it emerged that he had fathered a child out of marriage. The news media turned a harsh glare on Mr. Seehofer, a proud Catholic who has always had a cross on the wall of his ministerial office, but Ms. Merkel stood by him. That has not stopped him from challenging the chancellor repeatedly. In October 2015, weeks after Ms. Merkel opened the border, Mr. Seehofer threatened to take her before the constitutional court if she did not limit the number of migrants. Last fall, he was lobbying for an upper limit of 200,000 asylum seekers per year. Ms. Merkel pointed out that a hard limit was unconstitutional. There is no obvious way out of their current showdown, which made for a tense and turbulent week in Berlin. On Tuesday, Mr. Seehofer was scheduled to announce his 63-point “master plan” but canceled at the last minute because he and Ms. Merkel could not agree. On Wednesday, they met until late into the night but parted with no agreement. On Thursday, a raucous parliamentary session had to be adjourned to give the two conservative groups time to talk between themselves. By the end of the week, Ms. Merkel had received the support of most, though not all, senior members in her own party. The former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble was hastily appointed as a mediator. On Monday, Bavaria’s conservatives are expected to confirm whether Mr. Seehofer will, indeed, defy Ms. Merkel. The survival of Ms. Merkel’s coalition is at stake. “It is possible that we won’t have a government next week,” Ms. Römmele said. “I’d say it’s 50-50.”",The New York Times
2018,Germany Crashes Out of World Cup With a Loss to South Korea,"KAZAN, Russia — Germany became the latest defending champion to crash out of the World Cup at the first hurdle, part of a trend but definitely not part of the plan when Germany arrived here loaded with stars and swagger. A smooth-running scoring machine when it won the Cup in 2014, Germany now appears in need of an overhaul after losing, 2-0, to South Korea here on Wednesday and bidding adieu to Russia about three weeks earlier than many expected. “We tried to improve and lift our game, but we just couldn’t do it today,” Toni Kroos, Germany’s star midfielder, said. [Up Next: Follow our live coverage of England vs. Belgium] It was the earliest exit for a German team at the World Cup since 1938, which seems even more distant when you consider Hitler was then the country’s leader and only 15 teams participated. After Wednesday’s defeat, Kroos, unlike some of his teammates, did not drop to the grass. But he looked stunned, nonetheless: standing all but motionless just outside the center circle and staring into space with a hand on each hip as South Korean players celebrated one of the bigger upsets in this tournament’s 88-year history. On Saturday, Kroos had given Germany what looked like a reprieve with his keepsake of a free kick to beat Sweden at the last minute. Germany always finds a way, said those in the know as Kroos’s shot curled into the Swedish net as if guided by GPS. But that rush of pure adrenaline turned out to be a false dawn instead of the cathartic boost this talented but ultimately ineffectual team required. With stars like Kroos, Mesut Özil and Mats Hummels, Germany won every match in qualifying for this World Cup, the first German team to do so. But it could not even make it out of the group phase in Russia. It failed to score in both its opening 1-0 upset loss to Mexico and its defeat to South Korea, which was its first in a World Cup against an Asian team. It appeared the Germans would need just one goal in the closing minutes on Wednesday to win and secure their place in the round of 16. Instead, they surrendered two goals in added time, to Kim Young-gwon and Son Heung-min, and lost. And so it was Sweden and Mexico that qualified for the knockout phase from Group F. With Sweden defeating Mexico, 3-0, in Yekaterinburg, each finished with six points to South Korea and Germany’s three, with the Germans finishing last in the group on goal differential. There seems to be a World Cup curse at work. Since the 1998 edition, the defending champion has been eliminated in the group phase on four occasions: France in 2002, Italy in 2010, Spain in 2014 and now Germany. But this team’s early exit was still an undeniable shock, and Joachim Löw, the German coach since 2006, used that same word — “schock,” in his own language — to describe the experience on Wednesday. “The disappointment of being eliminated is just huge,” said Löw, who added that the team deserved to go out early. “It turned sour. I must take responsibility for this.” The surprise was visible on the painted faces of the German fans in the late-afternoon light in Kazan. Above all, it was etched on the features of the German players as they cried on the field or hunched forward, hands on their knees, trying to absorb the blow. “Of course, we had high expectations for ourselves, but I don’t think we could fulfill it any of the three games,” said Hummels, the central defender who missed the Sweden game with an injury but returned to the lineup on Wednesday. “There was no game where we can say, ‘Yeah, we played the style we used to play and we expect ourselves to play.’ So we have to be disappointed in ourselves after such a tournament.” A four-time World Cup winner, Germany was a finalist in 2002, third in 2006 and 2010 and the champion in 2014 after dealing the host nation, Brazil, a 7-1 defeat in the semifinals, the memory of which still leaves many Brazilians wincing. But Brazil will be the team going deeper in this World Cup after qualifying for the knockout round later on Wednesday, and some Brazilians were in no mood to deprive themselves of a little schadenfreude. Some remembered that in a Happy New Year’s tweet in 2017, Kroos replaced the Nos. 1 and 7 with Brazilian and German flags. On Wednesday, the account for Brazil’s sports daily Lance wished Kroos a happy 2018, replacing the Nos. 2 and 0 with South Korean and German flags. “Football is a simple game,” once said Gary Lineker, the former English player. “Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.” On Wednesday, Lineker, now a BBC pundit, updated his old quip, tweeting: “Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans no longer always win. Previous version is confined to history.” The Germans certainly have historical company, however. The list of defending champions to lose very early shows how difficult it is to maintain momentum and focus with national teams whose players practice and play together much less frequently than they do with their clubs. Asked if this was the end of an era of German domination, Hummels shook his head and referred to the team’s loss in the 2016 European Championship after winning the World Cup. “We didn’t dominate; we won one tournament; you have to be honest,” he said. “We’ve always been one of the strongest national teams. We wanted to prove that once again when we came back together again in September, but this tournament we haven’t been on the level we have to be at a World Cup. I think many teams have big problems, but somehow they survived. We did the same against Sweden when it was almost over for us, but we didn’t make it a second time.” The struggles of soccer powers to remain soccer powers also reflects the increasingly global nature of the sport, where talent now finds its way to the highest level of the club game. Son, the South Korean forward who scored the second goal on Wednesday, plays for Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League. Midfielder Koo Ja-cheol plays for F.C. Augsburg in Germany’s Bundesliga, where many of Germany’s stars make their excellent livings. The intimidation factor is not what it was, but Germany was still among the rightful favorites entering this World Cup. Löw, at least in public on Wednesday, was grasping for answers, but did suggest self-satisfaction had played a role. “It was a bit of overconfidence ahead of Mexico,” he said. “That we can press the button and win.” Löw tried to press a few of his own in Russia. He benched Özil and midfielder Sami Khedira for the second game against Sweden and then, after noting publicly that they had shown a good reaction in practice, reinserted them in the lineup on Wednesday while leaving out Thomas Müller, a longtime national team fixture who had struggled to find his form in the first two games. But the shuffling could not solve the team’s attacking issues. The Germans certainly had opportunities. They repeatedly struck at the South Korean goal on Wednesday afternoon, just as they had done against Mexico in the second half last week. They took 26 shots to the South Koreans’ 11, but the finishing touch was lacking. There was a low and dangerous shot from Kroos that was saved by the diving Korean goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo, who was excellent on Wednesday. “Our coach told us that Germany probably wouldn’t think the Koreans are very strong,” Jo said. “I just tried to relax during the game and enjoy the experience.” There were also unchallenged headers from Hummels and the substitute Mario Gómez that missed their target late in the game. “We had enough chances to score,” Hummels said. “I had a big chance in the 87th minute. I have to score this one. This chance will haunt me for a few weeks.” Müller, who had been sent on to replace Leon Goretzka in the 63rd minute, could not change the equation. But unlike the previous defending champions to be eliminated this early, there was a modern twist to the German exit. This is the first World Cup in which the video assistant referee system, or V.A.R., is being used, and in the third minute of added time, the South Koreans took a corner kick that the Germans struggled to clear. Amid the crowd, Kroos, one of the sport’s most accurate passers, flicked the ball back toward his teammate Niklas Süle, who, surprised, let the ball go through his legs. It rolled on to Kim, deep in the box. He had time to control it and then score into the upper right corner past the charging German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The celebration was cut short when the line judge raised his flag to indicate offside, but the referee, Mark Geiger of the United States, reviewed the sequence on a video screen after consulting via his earpiece with V.A.R. officials in Moscow. He ruled that Kim’s goal was valid. The celebration resumed, and when it ended, Germany pushed forward in desperation, with Neuer, always eager to roam widely, abandoning his goal altogether and turning himself into an extra midfielder. He soon lost possession of the ball in the South Korean half, and Ju Se-jong lofted a long pass toward the empty German goal. Son ran it down ahead of Süle and made it 2-0 with a flick of his left foot in the sixth minute of stoppage time. Germany, as it turns out, does not always find a way, something that Kroos and his teammates will now have four years to reflect upon. As the minutes ticked by after the defeat, Kroos remained with his hands on his hips until he was the last German player on the field. When he finally decided it was time, he walked slowly, painfully, toward the tunnel. Then, like his team, he disappeared from view at this World Cup. —— [See how Sweden beat Mexico by clicking here.] Here’s how South Korea beat Germany (by Kevin Draper): It’s all over! The defending World Cup champions are out! Sweden and Mexico advance out of Group F. Son Heung-Min doubles the South Korean lead. German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had gone forward as Germany desperately searched for an equalizer and winner. South Korea booted the ball forward, and Son tracked it down with no German defenders back, and rolled it into the empty net. Hummels with another header, but he pops it over the goal. South Korea goal ruled offside — then onside after review! Off the corner, the ball squirted through to Kim Young-gwon on the back post. After taking a touch to steady himself, Kim blasts it off Neuer’s foot and in. South Korea has a corner kick, and as you might expect it’s walking about as slowly as possible to take it. Lee Yong is down getting treatment, as American referee Mark Geiger gives 6 minutes of stoppage time. Toni Kroos with another shot from outside the box, but it’s too close to Jo Hyeon-Woo, who smothers it. Germany chance! Mats Hummels runs free into the box for a Mesut Ozil cross but mistimes the flick of his neck and the ball goes off his shoulder. Marco Reus and Toni Kroos have both taken dangerous looking shots from outside the box but can’t get them on frame. The fact that Reus and Kroos are resorting to shots from outside the box tells you how stout the South Korean defense has been. Germany once again camped out in front of the South Korea goal and gets two half-chances but can’t get off a solid shot. A chance for Germany on one end as a ball slips through the box. A chance for South Korea on the other, but the counter attack is wasted. Ten seconds later Germany is back in front of South Korea’s goal but is called offside. Korea chance! Son Heung-Min drags his shot from the corner of the box just wide! Germany with their final change, pulling defender Jonas Hector for Julian Brandt. Mexico concedes another, and they’re being absolutely trounced by Sweden. Mexico really needs South Korea to hold on here. South Korea consistently has 10 men behind the ball. Only Son Heung-Min is staying high in anticipation of a counter attack. Toni Kroos with a desperation 25-yard shot that goes well over. Mario Gomez with a powerful header, but it’s right at the South Korean goalkeeper. Pulsing end-to-end action here, as both midfields seem to have disappeared, which perhaps isn’t surprising considering Germany has taken off two midfielders for forwards. South Korea is having a lot more success on the counter attack now. Son Heung-Min goes down in the box and the referee blows the whistle … to call Son for diving. He’s yellow carded. In the other game, Sweden has scored a penalty to go up 2-0. A German goal now would put Germany through. And now Thomas Müller on for Leon Goretzka. Germany really going for the jugular here. Koo Ja-Cheol hobbles off the field with support, replaced by Hwang Hee-Chan, who plays for Red Bull Salzburg in Austria. After some nice interplay, Timo Werner slices wide a volley from the penalty spot. They haven’t scored, but Germany’s players have already had better chances than in the first half. Sweden scores in the other game! This should light a fire under Germany, because as things stand they’re going out of the World Cup. This time it’s Moon Seon-Min. It’s South Korea’s third yellow card of the day and ninth of the tournament, the most of any team. German chance! Leon Goretzka pops free eight yards out and gets a solid head to a cross, but Jo Hyeon-Woo dives and pushes it aside. South Korea immediately tests Manuel Neuer from outside the box, but this time he comfortably holds onto the ball. Was Jogi Low’s halftime talk enough to inspire the Germans to a goal? Germany has had all the possession but just two shots on goal, neither of them particularly dangerous. Even if Germany advances to the knockout round, it’s hard to imagine it going much further given how weak its attack has been. In the other Group F game, Mexico-Sweden are also tied 0-0. As things stand, Germany and Sweden would both have 4 points, but Germany would advance on tiebreakers. After three minutes of stoppage time, Mark Geiger blows the half to a close. Still no goals on either side. Timo Werner slams an open shot after the whistle is blown for a foul … and it goes off the post, which is a pretty good metaphor for the German attack this morning. Germany seems to have fixed the “vulnerable to counter attacks behind its full backs” problem but not the “can’t really score a goal” one. After a corner Mats Hummels has the ball six yards out from goal but can’t get it out from his feet for a shot before South Korean keeper Jo Hyeon-Woo pounces on it. At least you can say this about the German performance: I can’t remember the last time South Korea had the ball for more than about four seconds. Both teams need as many goals as they can get, but neither squad has come particularly close so far. This quiet half isn’t what we were expecting (or hoping for). Every single German pass, cross, shot or dribble near the South Korean goal has been met ably by a South Korean defender. Germany is just camped out in front of the South Korean goal but hasn’t come particularly close to finding a quality shot. According to FIFA, Germany has had 70 percent of the possession, and has completed four times as many passes as South Korea. Now Lee Jae-Sung picks up a yellow card. South Korea seems to be fouling Germany every few minutes. Manuel Neuer almost gifted South Korea a goal! Koo Ja-Cheol put a free kick directly at Neuer, but he fumbled it. Neuer was barely able to recover in time and punch the rebound away from an onrushing Son Heung-Min. What is it with the best goalkeepers in the World at this World Cup? Against Portugal, David de Gea also bobbled a shot from outside the box, but unlike Neuer, his error resulted in a goal. Christopher Clarey: Neuer 2018 is still a long way from Neuer 2014. Hard to imagine him struggling to hold on to a free kick like that in peak form. Germany misses a golden opportunity. After dispossessing South Korea near its own goal, Timo Werner is wide open on the back post. But Leon Goretzka opts for a pass on the ground that is deflected out instead of crossing it to Werner. Korea made a few attacking forays early, but the last 5 minutes Germany has had the entirety of the possession. Christopher Clarey: So Joachim Löw made his point with Ozil and Khedira by benching them last game. We’ll see if they take the hint back on the field. Nice atmosphere in the stadium, but once you’ve been to a Peru game, everything else seems quiet Emphatic yellow card for Jung Woo-Young, who took out Jonas Hector sliding for the ball near midfield. A cagey start, with neither team having a good attempt on goal yet. It was above 80 degrees at kickoff in Kazan. After their grueling victory over Sweden, a number of German players talked about their tiredness and cramps, which is perhaps why they made five changes to their starting lineup. We are off! Germany is in green, while South Korea is in red. The group stage of the World Cup is almost over. What will it take for each team to advance to the knockout round?",The New York Times
2018,Germany and Italy at Odds on Migration Crisis After Meeting,"BRUSSELS — Sixteen European leaders vented their frustrations with failed migration policies on Sunday, with the German and Italian prime ministers trying to move the European Union toward their competing positions before a summit meeting later this week. Three years after a large influx of migrants and asylum seekers, the vexed issue of migration has become a popular populist issue and threatens to topple the long reign of Europe’s most prominent leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. In what was billed as a rare “informal meeting” of leaders under the auspices of the European Commission, the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, representing his new anti-immigration populist government, presented a plan that would upend the current regulations governing migrants and asylum seekers. The Italians want to abandon the principle that migrants must be returned for screening to the E.U. country where they first are registered. Instead, Mr. Conte proposed creating “international protection centers” that would screen asylum requests in common countries of transit but that would not obligate the countries of first arrival. The Italians, Greeks and Spaniards have recently borne the brunt of migrants coming from the Middle East and Africa, even after migrant boat travel to Greece from Turkey has been curtailed through a special deal promoted by the Germans. But while the number of migrants reaching Europe is far lower than in 2015 and 2016, at the height of the Syrian civil war, the politics of migration have become ever more poisonous, with right-wing and populist governments in Italy, Austria and Central Europe all pressing for better controls, along with surging populist parties like the Alternative for Germany. Ms. Merkel, whose government is under threat from her putative conservative allies in Bavaria, had pushed for the informal meeting to try to forestall her own interior minister and rival from ordering that all migrants registered elsewhere be turned away from Germany. That would mean a hard border with Austria and could represent a fatal blow to the idea of “border-free travel” within most of the bloc. Ms. Merkel came here looking for European solutions, even bilateral or temporary ones, to tamp down the challenge to her leadership and to the principle of border-free travel. If she does not find a kind of solution at the European Union summit meeting this Thursday and Friday, her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has vowed to defy her. (His party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union, faces a strong challenge from the Alternative for Germany in state elections in October.) Some think that could bring down her government and end her 12 years in power. After hours of discussion here on Sunday, Ms. Merkel emerged speaking of increased “good will” and a good discussion, which would have been impossible given the time constraints of a normal summit meeting. She said that all agreed that countries of “first asylum” should not bear undue burdens, that “all countries should share all the burdens” of migration and that migrants should not be able to decide for themselves where to apply for asylum. “We all agree that we want to reduce illegal migration, that we want to protect our borders and that we are all responsible for all topics,” Ms. Merkel said. “It cannot be the case that some only deal with primary migration and others only with secondary migration. Everybody is responsible for everything. Wherever possible we want European solutions. Where this is not possible we want bring those who are willing together and find a common framework for action.” The Italian government in particular has begun to turn away ships containing migrants rescued at sea, forcing them to try to find other countries to land their human cargo. It is currently in a spat with Malta, which is refusing to accept a German ship with 234 rescued migrants already turned away from Italy. Spain’s new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, urged other states to help Spain deal with the arrival of thousands of migrants from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea. Spain has seen a sharp rise in migrant arrivals. The United Nations says that around 40,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, some 16,000 in Italy, 12,000 in Greece and 12,000 in Spain. “It was a frank discussion in which we saw the things that unite us but also some discrepancies,” Mr. Sánchez said. “It was a good step forward.” He said that there was an important consensus “on the need to have a European vision, a common response to a European challenge, which is how to manage the migration flow.” President Emmanuel Macron of France cautioned that Europe must live up to its values, and he has suggested, like Ms. Merkel, solutions by willing countries to make progress now since unanimity among the 28 member states will be difficult. He has also said that he favors punishing member states that do not show solidarity on the migrant issue. With his own position safe, Mr. Macron said that with migration numbers down, “today’s challenge is one of political pressure in certain member states and what we call secondary migration within the European Union.” Europe would beef up its own border force, he said, and strengthen efforts to work with countries like Libya and Balkan states, through which many migrants travel.",The New York Times
2018,"Germany, Marijuana, Trade War: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Compromises in Europe, a rethink on medical marijuana in Britain and trade tensions roil markets. Here’s the latest: • The leaders of Germany and France are scrambling to save the European Union — and themselves — amid a growing number of populist fires over migration on the Continent. President Emmanuel Macron of France agreed to take back asylum seekers who were first registered in France, a boon for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as she seeks to forge an accord on limiting migration in the bloc. In return, Mr. Macron squeezed concessions from Germany on his economic reform plans that he could sell at home (where he is facing criticism for reprimanding a high school student). Meanwhile, European officials are eager to paint Greece as a comeback story as they prepare to end financial bailouts for the country. But much depends on how Greece’s recovery unfolds. And Italy’s new interior minister called for counting and expelling Roma people, angering allies and evoking memories of fascist racial laws. _____ • The British government ordered a review of the nation’s policy on the medical use of marijuana, after a 12-year-old’s cannabis-based epilepsy medicine was confiscated, eventually landing him in a hospital with severe seizures. Above, the boy, Billy Caldwell, with his mother. The spectacle of his agonizing battle against an inflexible bureaucracy prompted a national debate about legalizing the drug itself for recreational use (an idea firmly opposed by the government of Prime Minister Theresa May). But the government’s move underlined a growing consensus about Britain’s zero-tolerance marijuana policy: “Any war has been comprehensively and irreversibly lost,” a former leader of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party wrote. _____ • Global markets are shaking. President Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese imports — almost every Chinese product that comes into the U.S. — sent stocks lower across the globe. Above, a broker at the New York Stock Exchange. In a conference call with reporters, Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, asserted that China had more to lose from a trade war than the U.S. He again faulted China for unfair trade practices and said Mr. Trump had given China “every chance to change its aggressive behavior.” Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are trying to defuse an escalating crisis over Mr. Trump’s policy of separating immigrant children from parents who cross illegally into the United States. But they can’t agree on how. _____ • Archiving history as it happens: That’s the goal of “rapid response collecting,” which is being practiced by museums across Europe and America. A curator at the National Museum of Ireland woke up early the day after her country’s abortion referendum, grabbing campaign posters and putting out a call for flags, banners and signs — anything that could be preserved. “My job is to research this moment in history,” she said. • Elon Musk, above, Tesla’s chief executive, said in an email that a disgruntled employee sabotaged the company’s computer system. Tesla shares fell after word of the email was reported in the news media. • Now with two deep-pocketed suitors for 21st Century Fox — Disney and Comcast — the Murdoch family is weighing its options. Here’s what to expect. • The U.S. commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, shorted stock in a Kremlin-linked shipping firm after learning that reporters were preparing a potentially negative story about his dealings with the company. • IBM unveiled an artificial intelligence program that “debates” with humans. (It led to an unlikely question for the tech industry: Can a machine talk too much?) • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The United Nations refugee agency reported that the total number of forcibly displaced people rose by almost three million people in 2017, to 68.5 million. It was the sixth consecutive year that the figure hit a post-World War II record. [The New York Times] • The U.S. withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council — the world’s most important human rights body — in protest of its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. [The New York Times] • Intense fighting in Yemen.

Steven Spielberg’s genre-defining film “Jaws” was released on this day in 1975. It was his first big-budget film, and it ushered in one of the industry’s most successful careers. But the production was troubled with delays and budget-busting costs. Crew members called it “Flaws,” and Mr. Spielberg — not yet 30 years old — worried he might never work in Hollywood again. “No one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule,” he said. Especially problematic were three animatronic sharks meant to serve as the focal predator. Collectively known as Bruce (after Mr. Spielberg’s lawyer), they proved disappointingly unmenacing. And they corroded and malfunctioned because the young director insisted on the realism of filming in the ocean, not in a tank. Unable to show more than a few scenes of the film’s linchpin, Mr. Spielberg improvised. He filmed some scenes from the shark’s point of view and signaled its presence with John Williams’ now-iconic theme song. The result: a Hitchcockian buildup of tension and suspense. (The Times review was a bit dismissive.) Even the production delays ended up helping. “Jaws” missed the traditional Christmas window, and a later release (and a marketing blitz) made it one of the first summer blockbusters.

2018,Opinion | Germany’s Great Unraveling,"Mr. Cohen is an Opinion columnist, and a soccer buff. LONDON — For Germany, all things unravel in Russia. Germany was slow. Germany was ponderous. Germany was out of ideas — just like its chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the twilight of her leadership. Some people in Berlin are calling this the “horror summer.” The Mannschaft, so respected at World Cups and beyond for its never-say-die spirit, was timid. Out went the world champions of 2014 before the knockout stage, losing 0-2 to South Korea. This was the first time in 80 years that Germany has fallen in the first round. “The biggest disgrace in German World Cup history,” the mass-market Bild newspaper proclaimed. It is hard to argue with that verdict. Joachim Löw, the dark-shirted coach who had signed a new four-year-contract in May, looked on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He’d blown it, leaving Manchester City’s explosive young winger, Leroy Sane, out of the squad at the last minute, fielding an aging team, changing his selections for the three matches in an unsettling way, opting for Manuel Neuer — hero of 2014 — as goalkeeper although he’d been injured all season. Mesut Özil, the moody left-footed genius of the German midfield, was not alone in going on walkabout. Germany was spent. That Neuer was way up the pitch, trying in desperation to conjure something, when South Korea rolled the ball into an empty net for its second goal summed up the German humiliation. Four years ago in Brazil, this team was “Weltmeister” — masters of the world. Its 7-1 execution of the Brazilian team in the semifinal was almost painful to watch in its terrible perfection. That was the first World Cup victory of a reunified Germany (West Germany won three previous times). It was the triumph of a buoyant nation whose 20th-century anguish had been overcome. Soccer has been a big part of the German national story over the past two decades. It was during the 2006 World Cup, played in Germany, that German patriotism — exuberant displays of the flag, expressions of national pride — became acceptable for the first time since 1945. There was a fabulous spirit across the country. German flags doubled as sarongs. Angst, not a German word for nothing, evaporated. Italy’s 2-0 defeat of Germany in the semifinal, played in the cauldron of the Dortmund stadium, was one of the greatest matches I’ve ever seen. Even in defeat, then, there was pride. All this was extraordinary to witness. When I lived in Berlin between 1998 and 2001, a debate still raged about whether any German could ever express “pride” about the nation of Auschwitz. By 2006, that discussion had been laid to rest. And now? It’s not a good German moment. Merkel’s coalition is teetering on the brink of collapse in a dispute over immigration policy. The Volkswagen emissions furor is the scandal that keeps on giving. The European Union, Germany’s path to postwar salvation, is in crisis. “This evening, we are all very sad,” Merkel said after the defeat. Well, yes. From the start, things went wrong. Löw wanted to train in Sochi, but the German Football Association said it could not afford to build a facility there. There were tensions in the squad. Özil and his teammate Ilkay Gundogan, both Germans of Turkish descent, chose to pose for photographs with the autocratic Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prompting a political row. The team looked sluggish and predictable in friendly matches leading up to the tournament. Löw insisted all would be well once things got serious. In fact, the Mannschaft just got worse. The team lost 0-1 to Mexico in its opener, snatched a last-minute winner against Sweden through a beautiful set-piece goal from the midfielder Toni Kroos in the second match, only to collapse against South Korea. Even its one victory was clouded by appalling behavior from two senior team officials, Georg Behlau and Ulrich Voigt, who made obscene gestures toward Swedish players after the game. They were barred from the touchline for the last match. Only Kroos, the engine room of Real Madrid when he’s not playing for his country, can look back on this humiliation without shame. He showed determination and belief, always the hallmarks of German sides, until now. Italians say of the Mannschaft that they never give up, “not even when they’re dead.” Here, they never even engaged. Löw’s boys went sleepwalking out of Russia. They leave a wide-open World Cup. Croatia, Uruguay, Belgium, Brazil and France all look menacing. Colombia is rising. Ronaldo’s Portugal lurks. If France beats Argentina on Saturday as the knockout rounds begin, I fancy their chances. One thing is certain. Every team still in the competition will be relieved to see the Mannschaft go home. For Germany, the retreat from Moscow will be long and painful — but they will be back.",The New York Times
2018,Germany’s World Cup Is Saved in the Blink of an Eye (and Flick of a Foot),"SOCHI, Russia — The German shots came from the left and the right and, at least once, even off a striker’s chest. They slammed into Swedish legs and Swedish backs and, at least once, right off the goal post. But the go-ahead goal didn’t come. It didn’t seem it would ever come. And then, in the blink of an eye, at the last possible moment, it did. Germany restored its 2018 World Cup hopes with one swing of Toni Kroos’s right foot on Saturday night, snatching a 2-1 victory over Sweden from the jaws of a draw that would have felt very much like a defeat. [Up Next: Follow our live coverage of England v. Belgium] The goal, five minutes into second-half added time, and only moments before the final whistle, gives Germany a strong shot of advancing to the round of 16 on a night that began with the team facing elimination. It came on a night when the Germans produced twice as many shots as Sweden, and enjoyed almost three times the possession, but still had to battle back from a 1-0 deficit at halftime, and then, in the final part of the game, play a man down after Jérôme Boateng was sent off with a red card. But Germany found a way to survive, with Kroos’s goal, on a finely orchestrated free-kick play, giving it a vital three points in its four-team group. Germany is now even with Sweden and three points behind Mexico. A victory in its final group game, against winless South Korea, would put it in a very solid position to advance. A draw against Sweden would have kept Germany’s chances to advance alive, but would have made things far more precarious. “We never lost hope that we could turn the tide and win this match,” said Germany Coach Joachim Löw, who six days ago boldly guaranteed his team would reach the knockout rounds. He said the winning goal was “obviously a bit of luck, but it is also a sign of us believing.” The winner was, in fact, a stunner: a free kick on the left side that Kroos rolled a yard ahead to his teammate Marco Reus, who had scored Germany’s opening goal in the 54th minute. Reus stopped the ball and stepped back as Kroos took his full windup and curled a shot that went over two defenders, around goalkeeper Robin Olsen and then inside the right post. The goal, and the victory, completely altered the dynamic at this World Cup for the Germans, who raced to Kroos at the corner flag and smothered him with a mix of joy and relief. A listless loss to Mexico in its opener had left Germany in an uncomfortable position when it took the field at Fisht Stadium: It understood that a defeat against the Swedes, who had won their first game, would guarantee that Germany, the defending champion, would somehow be out of the World Cup after the first round. But four changes to the lineup and the death rattle of an early exit erased any hint of listlessness on Germany’s part in this game. It was relentless early on, peppering the Swedes and often smothering them. And while Sweden fought hard, and even took the first-half lead, it eventually crumbled under the Germans’ pressure. Over 90 minutes, the German strategy seemed rather simple: Push the ball up the center or the wing, slot it wide, cross it back in and crash the net. If the Swedes cleared, the cycle would start all over: Collect the clearance out top, move the ball wide, cross it in. Even after Sweden took the 1-0 lead, the Germans just resumed their attack. Crosses, shots and more chances. Rinse and repeat. “We didn’t lose our nerve,” Löw said. “We didn’t start breaking down in a panic after going down a goal. We kept our head.” He added: “I told them to keep their calm, to not start panicking and try things out. To not just start to try long, high balls. To keep going with rapid passing shots, to go wider with Timo Werner. ‘We have 45 minutes to turn this around.’ That’s what I told them.” Three minutes into the second half, the strategy finally worked. Werner took a ball in hard on the left and cut back a low cross toward the halftime substitute Mario Gómez. The ball was a yard behind Gómez, and his outstretched trailing leg missed it. But that allowed it to continue on to Reus, and he turned it into Sweden’s net for the tying goal. The Germans rejoiced, the Swedes’ shoulders dropped, and the pattern promptly continued. A pass wide, a cross in, a ball cleared, or blocked, or sent off target. And finally, in the 95th minute, another German goal. Much earlier, in the 32nd minute, it had been Sweden that scored — out of almost nothing and against the run of play. An errant pass by Kroos in the center circle became, in two quick Swedish passes, a chance bouncing off the chest of forward Ola Toivonen in the German penalty area. Coolly controlling the ball under pressure, Toivonen brought it down and then calmly popped it over the charging goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The Germans were stunned, and suddenly far, far closer to World Cup elimination than felt comfortable for a four-time champion playing only its second game here. An hour later, it was the Swedes who sat stunned on the turf. Olsen, their beaten goalkeeper on the free kick, couldn’t bring himself to leave his 6-yard box. They have one group game left, against Mexico, and are still alive. But Kroos’s goal had changed everything. Here’s how Germany defeated Sweden: They’ve done it. What a night. Germany wins, 2-1, and they’re out here bumping chests like wrestlers. Or gladiators. Or linebackers. But mostly, like winners. The Swedes are just devastated, sitting on the turf where they dropped. They can’t believe what’s just happened either. What. A. Goal. What. A. Moment. Kroos rolled the ball ahead a yard to Reus and then put his right foot into it and curled it around Olsen and inside the right post. A stunning moment, and an entire nation roars. (Another one is crestfallen, btw.) Werner drives on the left and is fouled. Free kick just outside the area for Kroos. They play it short, and Gundogan works it over to Brandt — WHO PINGS THE POST! The ricochet is too hot to handle, though, and is turned over the ball. And now it’s Sweden quickly at the other end doing the same!!! Breathless ending here. Five minutes of added time begins ... with a German corner. Germany wins a free kick on the left, Kroos over it. Big moment coming ... Olsen punches it over the touch line! And still the Germans come ... Terrible wasted ball by Muller on the right. He had a team full of players in the center, but slashes a shot over the bar. Neuer now standing in the center circle as the Germans press. He’s effectively the replacement for Boateng now. Cross to Gomez for a point-blank header at the six — Olsen pushes it over!!!! Julian Brandt on for Germany. Fresh legs on the left. Neuer scrambling for a new ball at every whistle now. The Germans know a tie is fine, but a win is what they really need. Here they come again ...... Sweden’s subs earlier, by the way, were Guidetti and Durmaz for Claesson and Toivonen, the goal scorer. This will make it harder on Germany. Boateng sees red for his second yellow, and Germany will finish with 10. With Hummels already out tonight, that means both of Germany’s center backs are gone. Not that they need center backs right now. They need a goal. Another incisive ball finds him near the spot, wide open, but he lifts his shot over the bar. Hands over mouth time for him. He can’t believe it. He’s not alone. Lots of back and forth now, and a couple of subs, but the tenor of the match hasn’t changed. Sweden is defending for its life and trying to break out where it can. The Germans are fighting, and sweating mightily. The game’s pace continues hot as we pass the hour mark. German crosses, Swedish clearances, German crosses, German shots, Swedish clearances ...... You get the idea. Another ball up the middle sprayed wide by Reus. Kimmich fires it back in, but Reus somehow misses the return, and so does Gomez. That was the best chance for 2-1 yet. There will be more. Sweden has weathered the immediate storm, but Germany keeps coming. A draw keeps them alive, but it also means they’d need help to get to the second round. And that’s why they’re pushing for a win. Werner on the left again, cross to Gomez again, shot stopped again. This is not a recording. Now Muller, on service from the right. Over and over and over the balls come in. A YELLOW for Ekdal for a foul on Muller, and then Berg trucks Werner to stop a break. Werner crosses hard from the left, but a yard behind Gomez, who reaches back and misses. But the ball then goes straight to Reus, and he slides it past Olsen. The Germans are alive, and now pressing for a second. Mario Gomez on for Germany; Draxler off. Gomez is a finisher. It’s funny (well, not to Germans) how the Sweden goal was reminiscent of Mexico’s: a quick counterattack that caught the Germans scrambling back, a good first touch and a professional finish. The last action of the half, fittingly for how it went, it Neuer diving full stretch to his right to paw away a glancing header by Marcus Berg. That was headed inside his post, so it’s a good thing Neuer is 11 feet tall. But Sweden, against all odds but not undeservedly, leads by a goal at the break. Jogi Löw better find some answers in that dressing room. But after 90 minutes against Mexico and 45 more here tonight, I’m not sure German fans believe he will. The lead ball finds Claesson on the right. But instead of shooting he tries to cut back, and a well-placed Hector heel breaks up the chance. That was real danger for Germany. Playing with fire late. Germany desperately wants an equalizer before the half, but they are just firing balls now. Kimmich rockets in a line drive of a cross that a center fielder with a glove might not have handled. It hits a teammate hard enough to leave a welt, and ricochets away. Muller is first to the rebound of a long shot parried by Olsen, but wrestling a defender as the goalkeeper comes out, he can’t find a way to get a foot on the ball. Germany will collapse into a vicious cycle of criticism and blame-assigning and then a profound sense of ennui previously seen over the last year in Italy, the United States and the Netherlands. Neuer was furiously clapping his hands to encourage his team after the goal, sensing heads were dropping. That was completely against the run of play, but you know what: no one puts “*-completely against run of play” on the scoresheet. The Sweden fans, fwiw, are dancing. Well, that’s a surprise. It all starts with a lazy Toni Kroos giveaway in midfield. Two quick passes to change direction and cross into the center and the ball is on the chest of Ola Toivonen, who brings it down on pops it over a charging Neuer. Sweden, 1-0, and my, doesn’t that get German hearts racing. That was Ilkay Gundogan, not Khedira, who was warming (apologies, the media sits in the upper deck), and now he comes on. Sweden, temporarily up a man, smartly moving the ball side to side with no real intent. The works for them on two levels: it makes the Germans chase the ball, and it chews up a minute or two without really risking a loss of possession. It’s just long lazy balls from side to side, and the Germans are forced to shift back and forth with the rhythm. No one was warming up for Germany, obviously, but they quickly get what looks like Khedira up. Rudy was a mess; surely he’ll have to come off. Sebastian Rudy, who started in midfield in place of Sami Khedira, is down on the turn after getting kicked in the face as he slid in vain for a ball. He’s bleeding heavily, and that nose sure looks broken. They’ll swap his shirt for now, but that’s going to make it tough to continue. Muller screams to the ref about Sweden’s time-wasting. In the 22nd minute. Giving no quarter. So the story of the first half so far is Germany whaling on Sweden like a dusty rug for 15 minutes, and then the Swedes nearly taking the lead with their first and only chance. Quite the World Cup Germany is having so far. HUGE chance for Sweden there, with a turnover and quick diagonal ball springing Berg free behind the German defense. But Rudinger arrives in the nick of time to deliver just enough of a shove to knock him off, and a charging Neuer smothers the chance like a warm blanket. The Swedes howl for a penalty, or at least a review, and it might have been worth one. But play never stopped, and two minutes later, when it did, it seems the Polish referee, didn’t feel it was worth the bother. Once played stopped and restarted for a Swedish free kick in their end, anyway, he COULDN’T go back and look. We continue ...... Sweden is keeping all 10 field players behind the ball at almost all times. They’re really feeling the German pressure, and seem determined to just hunker down and fight them off. At least for the moment. Sweden has probed the German end just once, but a collapsing defense smothered the chance before it became anything. At the other end, Draxler turns the corner on the left and skims a cross through the goal mouth but no one is there to redirect it and it sails through to safety. Now Reus does the same on the right, but his cutback hits a defender instead of Werner. Good work from Timo Werner at the end line gives Germany two bites at the apple, but Sweden blocks both, then the rebound goes out wide. Cycling it back in, Germany gets two more (slightly deeper) shots. Both are blocked, too. One last time since it seems so strange to type it: Germany will be out of the World Cup if it loses to Sweden tonight. Enjoy the game. Sweden isn’t one of those sexy teams everyone always looks at as a World Cup dark horse. But they’re a solid group, and they’re tight and disciplined. And remember: they knocked out another big brand, Italy, to seal their place in Russia. Coming off a win over South Korea in their opener, they surely see tonight as a chance to announce themselves. Mexico’s victory over South Korea positions them to advance through to the knockout round tonight for the seventh straight World Cup, but it also makes the stakes very clear here: a Germany loss to Sweden and the Germans, the defending World Cup champions, are OUT after only two games in Russia. A win or draw extends their life to the final group game, but here are the current group standings: Mexico 6 points; +2 goal difference Sweden 3 points; + 1 goal difference Germany 0 points; -1 goal difference South Korea 0 points; -2 goal difference And here’s Sweden’s XI tonight: Robin Olsen; Mikael Lustig, Victor Lindelof, Andreas Granqvist, Ludwig Augustinsson; Sebastian Larsson, Albin Ekdal, Victor Claesson, Emil Forsberg, Ola Toivonen, Marcus Berg The lineups are out and Germany has made FOUR changes from the opener. Özil, Khedira dropped in midfielder, Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger in for the injured Mats Hummels at center back. Manuel Neuer; Joshua Kimmich, Jerome Boateng, Antonio Ruediger, Jonas Hector; Sebastian Rudy, Toni Kroos; Julian Draxler, Marco Reus, Thomas Muller; Timo Werner. That’s a manager who knows the stakes and wasn’t happy with the performances on Sunday. • Germany, the defending World Cup champion, sits at the bottom of Group F after dropping its opener against Mexico, 1-0. The Germans seemed put off by the Mexicans’ pace and directness, but they hit the bar with a shot in the second half and nearly grabbed a point. • Still, one combination of results on Saturday — a Mexico win over South Korea and a Germany loss to Sweden — would put the Germany out of the tournament by bedtime. • Germany Coach Joachim Löw guaranteed after the loss to Mexico that would not happen. Told that three recent World Cup champions — France in 1998, Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014 — had celebrating their titles by crashing out in the group stage of the next World Cup, Löw feigned ignorance and confidence at the same time. “I have no idea why that might be the case,” he said. “But we will qualify for the next round.” • Sweden famously qualified for the World Cup by eliminating Italy in a UEFA playoff after finishing second in its group behind France. The Swedes can be tough defensively: they surrendered only nine goals in 10 qualifiers, and none in their two-leg playoff against Italy. • Germany may be without center back Mats Hummels on Saturday — he has a neck injury, the team said — but Sweden may have bigger problems: a stomach bug is sweeping through their camp. The video-assistant-referee system has led to a higher percentage of penalty-kick goals than in each previous tournament. Rory Smith of the Times wrote that Germany’s biggest problem was that it has become entirely predictable. That said, Löw says he isn’t changing anything. “We will not just break apart now and become headless and do something completely different,” he said this week. “There is no need to break out in panic just because we have lost a match.”",The New York Times
2018,Get Gmail to Stop Archiving and Start Deleting,"TECH TIP The mobile app for Google’s service may be set to automatically archive messages you’ve swiped past, but you can change the setting. Q. When I swipe to get rid of a message I don’t want in the Android Gmail app, it says Archived instead of Deleted. I don’t want these messages around, so how do I delete them, and how do I get rid of anything that was “archived”? A. The Gmail app for Android gives its users two choices for discarding a new message: archive or delete. The Archive action removes the message from view in the inbox and puts it in the All Mail area, in case you ever need it again. You can find archived messages by using Gmail’s search function. Messages addressed to a group of people can return to your inbox if someone on the address list replies to the original. The Delete action moves the selected message to the Trash area, where it stays for 30 days before it is permanently deleted. If you do not want to wait that long to dump your mail trash, tap the three-lined menu icon in the top-left corner of the Gmail app, select the Trash icon on the left and tap the Empty Trash Now button at the top of the mailbox window. To make the Gmail app delete unwanted messages instead of archiving them when you swipe the screen, tap the Menu icon again, scroll down the left pane of the window, select Settings and choose General Settings on the next screen. Tap “Gmail default action” and select “Delete” instead of “Archive.” If you want to be warned when deleting messages, select “Confirm before deleting” on the General Settings screen. The steps for changing the setting in the Gmail app for iOS are similar. On the Settings screen, tap your account name, go to the General area, select “When removing messages, I prefer to” and choose “Move to trash.” (If you download mail from your Gmail account through the standard iOS mail app, you can also choose between archive and delete in the account settings.) As for messages that were archived instead of deleted, you can find them by opening the Menu icon and selecting All Mail. Here, you can swipe each message to delete it. If you want to dig up messages from certain people or on specific topics you no longer care about, you can use search operators to round up mail that matches very specific criteria. For example, the search string “-in:inbox -has:userlabel” seeks out messages that are not in your inbox and do not have any custom labels you may have used to sort your incoming mail.

2018,Get a Wi-Fi Tablet on a Cellular Network ,"TECH TIP Even if your iPad or Android tablet does not have its own cellular chip, you might be able to borrow a data connection from your phone. Q. Since I connect to the internet with my phone using my data plan, I wonder if I could do the same with a tablet or laptop? Is it possible to get online with cellular data rather than Wi-Fi while on a tablet? A. Using a cellular-data connection to get your tablet on the internet is certainly possible, but you may have to make an investment in additional fees or hardware. Since you already have a data plan for your phone, contacting with your current wireless carrier to inquire about sharing your phone’s internet connection with your tablet is a logical first step. With the right plan, the tablet can link up over a Wi-Fi connection broadcast by the phone; this is also referred to as using a personal or mobile “hot spot.” You may also be able to “tether” the tablet to the phone over a USB or Bluetooth connection to share the network signal. Most laptops can also use tethered or hot spot connections. Many wireless carriers — including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless — offer hot spot-and-tethering options for their mobile customers. If these options are not already included with your current service plan, you will need to pay extra. Sharing your phone’s connection with other devices can rapidly eat through a data plan and drain its battery more quickly than with normal use, so keep those factors in mind when considering your hot spot or tethering needs. In addition to contacting your carrier about the service, you also need to set up your phone to share its connection. Apple’s site has instructions for using the Personal Hotspot feature on its iOS devices. Google, LG, Motorola and Samsung are among the Android phone makers with setup guides on their own sites. If you often need a portable personal network for your tablet and don’t want to use your phone’s data allowance, you can buy a separate mobile hot spot and service plan. These pocket hot spot devices connect to a cellular data network and provide Wi-Fi access for tablets, laptops and phones. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, now recommends the Verizon Jetpack Mifi 7730L as its pick for the best mobile Wi-Fi hot spot. When it comes time to upgrade the tablet, another option is to pay a little more up front for a model that can use both cellular and Wi-Fi network connections. You might need an additional data plan if your current service does not have data-sharing options, but you have fewer gadgets to wrangle when getting the tablet online.

2018,Getting Down Payment Help Now. Sharing Home’s Gain (or Loss) Later.,"For aspiring homeowners, coming up with a healthy down payment has long been the biggest obstacle to owning a home. With property values soaring in many areas — median prices in San Jose, Calif., and Denver are 60 percent above their prerecession peaks — the barrier is rising. That has some firms promoting unconventional ways to scrape together a down payment, including crowdfunding and using Airbnb rental income. Now, a small but growing number of home buyers are trying something different: asking an outside investor to put down money alongside them. It is called shared equity, and Unison, a company based in San Francisco, is the largest of a handful of firms putting it to work. Unison will provide at least half of a consumer’s down payment in exchange for a piece of any appreciation in the home’s value when it is sold. If the home sells at a loss, the company absorbs a share of that, too. Until the home sells, Unison is mostly a silent partner. The homeowner pays taxes, insurance and all other necessary costs. The idea behind the program is to provide home buyers with more options. It can help those who are short on down payment funds increase their buying power, though it may also work for people who simply do not want to sink every last dime into their homes. But whether it is right for any individual buyer — upfront cash now versus less proceeds later — is a difficult and highly personal calculation. Most first-time home buyers put down only about 7.4 percent, on average, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Although there are plenty of programs that permit small down payments, they can substantially increase monthly housing costs. Unison and its competitors help increase a down payment to 20 percent of a home’s purchase price — the magic number needed to qualify for the best interest rates and to avoid the added cost of private mortgage insurance. But relying on an outside investor challenges traditional attitudes about homeownership, even if the conventional approach may be just as risky: Where else in our lives are we encouraged to plunk a huge piece of our net worth into a single asset? The same sort of behavior would be considered reckless in a retirement portfolio. Shared equity also raises a fundamental question about our overall approach to buying homes, given that the average homeowner moves after about eight years. “Why do households have to choose between renting their homes and buying them outright?” asked Andrew Caplin, an economics professor at New York University who co-wrote a book 20 years ago about how shared equity markets could benefit homeowners. It should not be an all-or-nothing proposition, he said. Giving up a stake in your home to diversify may make sense in theory. The question is at what cost, and whether the average person is in the position to figure it out. For these programs to be adopted broadly, they would need the support of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled entities that buy most conventional mortgages. Both are trying new ways to get people into homes, particularly younger adults coping with student loans, rising rents and increasing health care costs. Freddie Mac is working with Unison on a pilot program, but it is unclear whether it will expand widely. For now, shared equity deals are a droplet in the giant pool of new mortgages. Unison, which operates in 22 states, said it had invested alongside 450 home buyers last year, and was on track to invest with roughly 2,500 to 3,000 more in 2018. It has an investment management arm, and its investors — mostly pension funds and university endowments seeking a return slightly above inflation — provide the money for the down payments. Unison’s costs and approach vary slightly from those of its competitors, including Landed, which offers a similar service for public school employees, and Own Home Finance of San Marcos, Calif. Here is how Unison’s program works. THE BACKGROUND. Shared equity started as a way for people with low and moderate incomes to buy homes. The latest incarnation is geared toward those with solid incomes who can qualify for a traditional home loan or even a jumbo mortgage. Unison began in high-price markets like California, so most people using the program are at least in their 40s with incomes between $75,000 and $150,000. The company said it expected those numbers to fall now that it had branched into different areas. THE PROCESS. Unison teams up with specific lenders that home buyers must work with. Applicants must qualify for a mortgage, and the home must be one that Unison wants to invest in. That generally means it has to be “typical” for its neighborhood. A McMansion on an acre plot amid more modest homes may not qualify. The company will invest in single-family and multifamily homes with up to four units, and in townhouses and condominiums. To discourage the quick flipping of properties for a profit, Unison requres buyers to occupy the properties, but they can sell whenever they want. THE STRUCTURE. Unison’s portion of the down payment is not a loan. No payments are made; no interest accrues. The company’s agreement with a home buyer is structured as an option contract, with its investment effectively giving it the right to buy a stake in the home at a later date, typically when it is sold or after 30 years, whichever comes first. So if the company contributes half of a down payment, it collects over a third of any appreciation in the home’s value (in addition to the original sum it invested). A homeowner can sell at any time, but Unison absorbs a loss only after three years of ownership. Alternatively, the homeowner can buy out Unison’s share — at a price based on an independent appraisal — although that is permitted only after three years. In such instances, Unison does not share in any losses. THE RULES. Homeowners generally cannot draw on their home equity beyond the amount of the original mortgage. And they must cover the entire cost of any renovations, although Unison credits the value the work adds to the home’s ultimate sale price. Conversely, there can be repercussions if a home is not well maintained. In the event of default, Unison — which places liens on the properties it invests in — has the right to foreclose to protect its stake. More often, company executives said, it may step in to help settle arrears and to initiate a more orderly sale — at a price. THE MATH. Consider a family buying a home in Atlanta for $500,000. The home buyer and Unison each put down 10 percent, or $50,000, for a total of $100,000. (The company also charges an origination fee equal to 2.5 percent of the amount it provides, so it would essentially provide $48,750 in this example.) Seven years later, the home sells for $575,556, 15 percent above the purchase price. Unison gets back its initial $50,000, plus 35 percent of the price appreciation, or $26,444, for a total of $76,444. The homeowner walks away with roughly $108,000, after selling costs. That figure includes equity and roughly two-thirds of the increase in value. If the same home sold for $469,000, a loss of $31,000, or 6 percent, Unison would offset some of that. The homeowner would absorb only 65 percent of the loss, keeping $46,600 after the sale versus only $35,720 if Unison were not involved. “In really negative return scenarios, Unison gets wiped out completely,” said Paul Tucker, the company’s director of business operations, “but our loss is capped at our initial investment.” THE CALCULATION. Consumers who apply for the Unison program should consider how much they may save on their monthly payment over the time they expect to stay in the home. The hard part is the back end of the calculation, or what they may give up in appreciation. “You can’t really know the true future cost until the future actually comes,” said Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, which tracks the mortgage market. Brett Theodos, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute, said shared equity appeared to make the most sense for people living in the priciest areas, or for those unable to buy without help. “If you truly can’t afford to do anything other than rent, you will build more equity with shared equity than you would have as renter,” Mr. Theodos said, adding that he was not sure whether such arrangements were the best option for people in more affordable areas. “Whether this makes sense for Wichita and Duluth or even Chicago? I am less sure.” Mr. Theodos also said there was something else that home buyers should not ignore. “Investors are looking for a way to make money — most people’s wealth is in their home,” he said. “That is not a fully tapped market.”",The New York Times
2018,Getting to the Bottom of ‘Thrift Store Smell’,"Have you noticed that every thrift store and neighborhood Goodwill smells the same? And that the clothes also smell the same? With the help of science, we got to the root of why. (And we have tips to help you get rid of it.) That vintage store smell: We all know it, that musty, grandma’s attic-y smell that licks your nostrils the moment you cross the threshold of any vintage, consignment or used clothing store, no matter how high- or low-end. Where does it come from? And more important, how do I get it out of my purchases when I get them home? John Mahdessian, owner of Madame Paulette, a dry- and specialty-cleaning concern in New York that restores high-end vintage garments, says of that smell, “It’s a musty odor, a smell of decay. It’s funky!” Katie McDonnell, owner of Nomad Vintage in Manhattan’s East Village, differentiates between good and bad vintage smells, and steers clear of buying anything that falls into the latter category. “Good vintage smells a wee bit musty, but more like a whiff of wool or your grandmother’s attic,” Ms. McDonnell said. “Maybe just the slightest hint of a cigarette smoke from a party; more like a life well-lived than anything gross.” Vintage items that truly reek, she warns, “can, like bad-smelling food, portend all sorts of other problems — damage, moths or other bugs (shudder)."" She also notes that the garment may simply be made from a fabric that retains odors, holding onto them stubbornly even after washing. But what makes those smells so universal? To find the answer, it turns out, we must only turn to Depeche Mode’s 1984 classic, “People Are People,” because that smell? That smell is us. Modern prophets though they may be, Depeche Mode can take us only so far in explaining why should it be. Enter Science. Specifically, the analytical scientists at Procter & Gamble. P & G, the parent company of Tide, Gain and Downy, devotes no small amount of time and research dollars to the issue of awful smelling clothes, or malodor, as it’s more formally known. I sent a bundle of vintage clothes I purchased at random to be tested at the P & G labs. Mary Johnson, a principal scientist at Tide, explained the testing methods: “Each item was placed into a headspace sampling bag and sealed. Then, using an automated headspace sampling system, the bag was filled with nitrogen to equilibrate at room temperature for two hours before headspace was collected onto a thermal desorption unit (TDU) tube packed with 35-60 Tenax-TA adsorbent resin. The headspace samples on TDU tubes were analyzed via thermal desorption in a chromatography mass spectrometry system. Chemical identification was performed using mass spectral libraries.” Did you follow all of that? Me neither. Essentially, they put the clothes in a big resealable bag, shut it up, pumped it full of some nitrogen and then did a bunch of tests on the resulting gas to determine what the smells were coming from. Here’s what they found: 12 of 18 of the key malodor molecules that contributed to the bouquet of that vintage smell were derived from body soils, which is a gentle way of saying your skin, your sweat, your oils. Distressing! But, perhaps, not nearly as distressing as the list of odor descriptors that accompanied the compounds. Sweet, sour, oily, herbal. Fatty. Whiskey, nutty, cheesy, sweaty. Stinky feet. Fermented. Bready. The source of the remaining compounds that made up that vintage smell were environmental contaminants like car exhaust, gasoline, dry cleaning solvents, food and perfume or, as the team at P & G put it, “the odor molecule peaks form a record of the odors” that the garments were exposed to over its life. When it comes to removing that vintage odor, machine- or hand-washing is ideal. While it may be tempting to outsource the work to a dry cleaner, it’s a temptation you should resist. Dry cleaning is simply not as good at odor elimination as wet cleaning, and that’s especially true when it comes to odors caused by perspiration and other body soils. Mr. Mahdessian explained that “cleaning and odor remediation are two different processes. Cleaning will remove all residue dirt and debris from textiles of most compositions whereas odor elimination involves either masking, encapsulating or changing the molecular structure of the odor molecule that attaches itself to the fiber.” Ms. McDonnell said she had not found dry cleaning to be effective in removing strong odors. Her advice? “If it smells bad, don’t buy it unless it will hold up to a rigorous washing.” There are some best practices to follow when laundering vintage clothing, or anything that’s especially rank-smelling. Machine washing will be the best choice for most garments, and if you go that route, stick with cold water, don’t overstuff the machine and opt to air dry the clothes, or machine dry using the no- or low-heat setting. High heat drying can amplify lingering smells. If the first washing doesn’t completely eliminate the vintage smell, fear not! The team at P & G notes that particularly smelly clothes may need more than one washing. They suggest using a detergent designed to combat malodor, like their own Tide Sport Odor Defense. A better, if offbeat, choice is Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castile Liquid Soap. Dr. Bronner’s is excellent at removing strong odors of all sorts from clothes — I’ve recommended it for washing everything from hand-me-down baby clothes that smell strongly of perfume to coveralls that got soaked in gasoline, and it has worked every time. Dr. Bronner’s is also an excellent choice for hand-laundering, which will be the best option for very delicate or highly embellished items. I recommend a specialty product, Engleside Restoration, for badly yellowed, very delicate or especially old items like wedding dresses or vintage linens. One quirky way to de-funk accessories like beaded clutches, leather jackets and shoes that can’t be machine- or hand-washed is to bury them in kitty litter. Clean litter, please! An ingredient commonly found in kitty litter formulas is active charcoal, and it is an excellent odor absorber. If you are cat-free, you needn’t rush out to buy a giant bag of litter; loose active charcoal can be purchased at pet supply stores in the section devoted to the housing of aquatic life, or even easier, at Amazon. That vintage store smell, complex and bready though it may be, can certainly be removed from your clothes. The bigger challenge is to force your brain not to think about what this means your clothes will smell like when they turn up in a vintage store 30 years from now.

2018,Ghost on the Beach,"N.Y.C. Nature Lady crabs, blue claw crabs and spider crabs all shuttle about the muddy, gritty bottoms of New York City’s shores with familiar clumsiness, but scampering over the city’s sandy Atlantic beaches at almost 10 miles per hour is an anomaly known as the ghost crab. Just a lung or two short of a completely terrestrial life, in fact, the ghost crab rarely enters the ocean, and when it does, it visits only briefly, anchoring itself against the shallowest waves. If it stays submerged for too long, a ghost crab will drown. Though it appears larger standing on strong, pointed legs, the crab measures just a little over two inches across its boxy carapace. It inhabits an impressive range, extending along the Atlantic coast from Brazil to Rhode Island. Though still uncommon north of the Chesapeake, the crab has become established along New York City’s ocean beaches. Ghost crabs are generally nocturnal, but in my experience, they are often inspired to venture forth from their burrows when gathering thunderclouds darken the landscape, generally late on sultry summer afternoons. If it seems inadvisable to hike the open beach before a lightning storm, you can also sometimes observe the crabs just prior to sunset. Of course, where permitted, a flashlight and a little fortitude is all it takes to watch ghosts by night. On a recent late-afternoon walk along the western edge of Riis Beach, I was met with a raucous parade of oystercatchers, and off in the distance, the tiny, plaintive calls of a piping plover were still peculiarly audible over the hiss of a stormy Atlantic Ocean. I found my target, a series of neat, oddly mouselike holes positioned haphazardly between the high-tide mark and the primary dunes. Spread out over the sand at each tiny entrance was an elaborate tracery of crab footprints, as if each crab had woven a fresh lace welcome mat for visitors. In fact, some of these crabs may have had a warm welcome in mind; female ghost crabs initially judge a male’s desirability by his burrow’s entrance. Young crabs and females are not so particular. The ghost crab is named for its cryptic coloration. Overall, it is a tawny gray, highlighted with elegant white claws; the crab seems to vanish when still. Fortunately for human observers, the crabs are often on the move, ranging freely from the vanishing wavelets of the wrack line to the toe of the secondary dunes hundreds of feet away. The animal’s scientific name, Ocypode quadrata, is well earned. “Ocypode” means “fleet-footed.” Though ghosts prefer quiet sandy shorelines, an empty summer beach in New York City is rare, so they have learned to avail themselves of the kindness of strangers; cohabiting the exclosures erected for the protection of piping plover and other threatened coastal species. This is often unfortunate, as ghost crabs have broad culinary tastes, and hatchling piping plovers sometimes wind up on the crab’s menu, along with the crab’s usual fare of insects, dead fish and clams.",The New York Times
2018,Ghosts of a Hospital Rise in the Village,"About New York For those who have lived their entire lives in New York City — and even more peculiarly, in Manhattan — the itch to find something stable and rooted can become an obsession. Cusi Cram, 50, a playwright and lifelong Manhattanite, scratched and scratched until she came up with “St. Vincent’s: Novenas for a Lost Hospital,” which is being workshopped through Sunday at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in Greenwich Village. Not only a play about a unique corner of New York, it is also a search for the substance of what lasts in a city of perpetual flux, framed, ingeniously, around the 161-year history of St. Vincent’s Hospital — a New York institution “that an order of determined women who cared willed into being,” the narrator says. The hospital closed in 2010, the last Catholic medical center in Manhattan. Here the dead and the living have equal claim to the stage, each other, the audience. They speak and argue across centuries. A 19th-century Haitian revolutionary and hairdresser leans over the shoulder of a 20th-century Irish nurse. One doctor faced with a cholera epidemic in the 1840s trades shoptalk with another who is treating AIDs patients in the 1980s. A holy man recalls that in a fury, he intended to burn down the old St. Patrick’s Cathedral until he had a whiskey, neat, on Mott Street and thought better of it. In the early 1990s, dying men have sex in a hospital ward, or imagine that they did, and share their fantasies with the first American-born saint, Elizabeth Bayley Seton, who danced with George Washington at one of his birthday parties and has been dead for about 160 years. “You were my favorite hallucination, next to Marcello Mastroianni,” one man tells her. “The things he did to me on this bed.” Seton replies: “I saw. It was very educational.” The play grew, Ms. Cram said, from discussions with Rattlestick’s artistic director, Danielle Topol, about moving theater outside the walls of a building — “St. Vincent’s” closes with a procession of the audience to a memorial park — and her collaboration with Guy Lancaster, a dramaturge who tracked ironies and graces across centuries. In a note on the research, Mr. Lancaster writes: “Survivors of the Titanic had been brought here. Ambulances rushed to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Babe Ruth had beamed from his St. Vincent’s hospital bed. Dylan Thomas had given up the ghost here. Edna St. Vincent Millay was named after the place. The hospital was an essential hub for survivors of 9/11 and a place where the city spontaneously confronted its communal grief and disorientation. And, pre-eminently, St. Vincent’s became the epicenter of AIDS research and treatment on the East Coast.” Most of those stories are evoked but not lingered on. Instead, a prevailing theme is the complex relationship between science and religion, surfacing in the 19th century when a doctor is officially — though not really — forbidden to do anatomy studies by Catholic scruples over the defilement of bodies. In the 20th century, a doctor wants to apply for a grant to develop a drug that would prevent transmission of H.I.V., saving lives but also removing inhibitions to unprotected sex. The sister in charge tells him that church hierarchy opposes “prophylactic” practices. “But I am trying to prevent infection, not conception,” the doctor argues. The sister replies: “Isn’t there another word we can use?” “This isn’t Scrabble night at the convent,” retorts the doctor. Punctuating her remarks with a profanity, the sister says she lives in an apartment and doesn’t “have time to play board games, Doctor!”” The drama is rendered as a Novena, the Catholic ritual of nine days of devotion and prayer. Throughout, the chief narrator is Seton, daughter of New York’s first chief health officer, who says that she’d rather have been a doctor than a saint. Born in 1774 to an Episcopalian family, she converted to Catholicism as a widow and founded the Sisters of Charity to care for the poor. It became a model for 400 religious orders. “She had lit a fuse,” Mr. Lancaster writes. “These women had pioneered what would become the welfare state as they built hospitals, orphanages and schools. In a world where restrictions on women’s agency could be severe they were remaking the social landscape in critical ways.” The actor Kathleen Chalfant brings Seton to life in this production. The saint’s story was a revelation to Ms. Cram, whose own mother converted to Catholicism. Late in the play, channeling Ms. Cram, a modern character muses about the difficulty of finding roots in the city: “It’s all made for change and turnover. There are starter apartments and short-term leases.” She goes on to ask: “Where are the ending apartments? Or the life apartments?” The Elizabeth Seton of “St. Vincent’s” gives an answer about enduring. “I wasn’t particularly saintly,” she says, “but I was determined — and isn’t it so funny how determination can last and last, and how goodness without determination vanishes.”",The New York Times
2018,Giacometti: Beguiled by Thin Men and Women,"Art Review The Guggenheim mines the wide world of the Swiss sculptor — witty and dripping with sex, or looking into the abyss. There’s despair but humaneness, too. Alberto Giacometti, “Suspended Ball,” 1930–31. His Surrealist sculptures were witty, off-kilter and sometimes dripping with sex. A sphere dangles from a string in a cage, “teasing but never touching a curve. The objects are abstract prisoners trapped in an endlessly unconsummated dance,” our critic writes.CreditCredit2018 Alberto Giacometti Estate/Licensed by VAGA and ARS, New York; Vincent Tullo for The New York Times His studio was more of a shed, really: a leaky, unheated ground-floor room of just 240 square feet in working-class southern Paris. His American biographer James Lord called it “a dump.” Toward the end of his life a tree branch started growing through one of the walls. But Alberto Giacometti found he liked the place, which he first occupied in 1926 and held onto for the rest of his life, rushing back to his Montparnasse garret after wartime exile. Its close, plaster-thickened air was like perfume; its damp gray walls framed an art of grim exactitude. Remember the squalor of Giacometti’s studio as you wend through the retrospective that opens Friday at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In Frank Lloyd Wright’s circular white temple, the art of this Swiss polymath — above all his emaciated humans in bronze or plaster, but also his earlier Surrealist compositions and his ghostly painted portraits in mucky grays and browns — look even more austere than usual. But getting to that stern, drastic style took arduous, day-by-day work, and the results never satisfied him, though they never stopped him either. “The more you fail the more you succeed,” said Giacometti. He did both every day in his filthy studio, driven with a tenacity you might also call love. The Guggenheim exhibition, which runs through September, is the first big outing for Giacometti here since the Museum of Modern Art’s retrospective in 2001, and it’s been organized by Megan Fontanella, a curator at the Guggenheim, and Catherine Grenier, a veteran of the Centre Pompidou who now directs the Fondation Giacometti in Paris. A majority of the works here come from the holdings of the foundation, created in 2003 and at first mired in legal disputes with rival heirs. (It is opening a permanent public home later this month, around the corner from the master’s studio.) The Guggenheim has supplemented them with judicious loans — including his inscrutable gameboard “No More Play,” from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the spindly woman-and-vehicle pair “The Chariot,” from a private collection. The show is handsome, consistent and more than a little timid. It unfolds chronologically up the Guggenheim’s quarter-mile spiral, and his frail anthropoids have generous breathing room in the museum’s bays. It offers a biographically driven account of his artistic development, recounting his embrace and rejection of Surrealism in the 1930s and his later turn to existentialist philosophy. The curators have included a few nice bits of ephemera (copies he drew of Egyptian sculpture, and three sketches of eyeballs done with a blue ballpoint pen), but no real surprises. Nor are expectations overturned in the catalog, which is nearly as thin as one of Giacometti’s gaunt humanoids, with just three essays. This is definitely not an exhibition that deconstructs Giacometti, and any revisionism will have to await a sequel. Yet this clean-cut show deserves your attention all the same, with more than 170 works, and a broad selection from Giacometti’s earlier sculpture, before the thin men took hold. He left his home in Italian-speaking Switzerland in 1922, and in Paris the 20-year-old Giacometti found himself more inspired by Brancusi and Picasso than by his classical instructors at art school. By 1926, having fully imbibed the avant-garde Kool-Aid (or absinthe), he created his breakthrough “Spoon Woman”: a five-foot totem with a concave oval for a belly, topped by a boxy abstract head. This show has one “Spoon Woman” in bronze and another in plaster. They were directly inspired by the sculpture of the Dan people of West Africa, and many other works here, including a 1929 drawing of Oceanic statues he copied from the magazine Cahiers d’Art, express Giacometti’s lifelong admiration for nonwestern sculpture (in the aestheticized, ahistoric manner common to the 1920s avant-garde). He also drew on the example of Cycladic statuary, whose stylized, planar surfaces informed his own abstracted heads and bodies. Soon Giacometti fell in with the Surrealists, and his sculpture and drawings of the early 1930s are witty, off-kilter and sometimes dripping with sex. In “Suspended Ball” (1930-31), perhaps the greatest of Giacometti’s early sculptures, a sphere with a cleft in its backside dangles from a string in a cage — teasing but never touching a tumescent curve below. It’s the first of many cages Giacometti would design, and its abstract prisoners are trapped in an endlessly unconsummated dance, not unlike the sequestered bride and bachelors in Marcel Duchamp’s “The Large Glass.” (New Giacometti fans, by contrast, may see the forms as a peach and an eggplant, the two most august emoji of youthful desire.) “Suspended Ball” is followed by two versions, in wood and bronze, of the still scandalous “Disagreeable Object” (1931), a phallic torture device with a spiked business end. Giacometti’s Surrealist phase comes to a close with “Hands Holding the Void (Invisible Object),” made in 1934 and lent from MoMA, in which a woman with raised hands and pursed lips stays pinned to an armature. Her chevron head takes its shape from an iron mask Giacometti found at a flea market: an archetypical Surrealist translation of machine into flesh. The next year he returned to sculpting from life — which got him thrown out of the Surrealist confraternity, which was outraged that he would not draw strictly from his unconscious. (“Everyone knows what a head looks like,” the Surrealist ringmaster André Breton sniffed. “Not me,” Giacometti retorted.) Ideas, though, were not enough for Giacometti, and the heads in this show, created in the late 1930s and including three of his brother and regular model Diego, testify to a hunger inside the artist to imbue abstract form with the thrill and the anxiety that comes from looking at others. It might have been gratifying to see Giacometti’s Surrealist works with comparative pieces by Parisian colleagues or nonwestern artists, or to look across the timeline to find common themes (the cage, the gameboard) or enduring formal techniques (his emphasis on the horizontal, or his absorption of the pedestal into the sculpture itself). As it is, this show all too neatly cleaves Giacometti’s career into two separate parts, interrupted and wholly transformed by World War II. He was stuck in Geneva during the fighting, where he crafted itsy-bitsy figures standing on relatively large boxes, and when he got back to Paris the figures grew taller, flimsier, more cadaverous. Most of them stand alone. Some walk or point (the men), others are ramrod still (the women). Some have recognizable faces, even painted ones; others appear to be deliquescing into formlessness, their arms and torsos stuck together like tallow. These most famous Giacomettis have become symbols of a postwar generation, not to mention prime art market assets: his “Man Pointing,” an edition of which is on view here, went for $141 million a few years back. And seeing so many at once, especially the less familiar plaster ones, helps to dissolve their auction-house familiarity. Their parallels to existential philosophy are longstanding. Giacometti and Jean-Paul Sartre met at the Café de Flore in 1939 and were friends for decades; a stern pencil drawing here of the philosopher, and a small Roman-style plaster bust of Simone de Beauvoir, attest to their influence. Yet there’s more in these later, more skeletal sculptures than humanity looking into the abyss. One could explore, for example, the endurance of Christian motifs of suffering, which the atheistic Giacometti and numerous other Europeans drew from to express the horror of the Holocaust. Nor is sex absent in these later works; Giacometti was a lifelong worshiper of prostitutes, and a quartet of savagely slathered paintings of his last mistress, Caroline, suggest the carnal urges beneath the late art’s stark surfaces. And then there is the life and work of the studio in Montparnasse where Giacometti made his sitters pose for days at a time: a terrain of sadism, despair, but also total commitment. He worked almost right up to his death in 1966. In the last few decades it’s been fashionable to favor the early Giacometti, with its sex and humor, and to huff that the lanky postwar sculptures merely reiterate that we are doomed to isolation. By my second visit to the Guggenheim, though, I found myself unexpectedly beguiled by the humaneness of the mature Giacometti, whose thin men and women appeared to me more optimistic than I’ve ever found them before. Funny that existentialism doesn’t seem such a downer anymore, now that the omnipresent threat to our humanity is not material privation but informational excess. When all of us are trailed by inescapable terabytes of data, we can almost envy Giacometti’s slender bronze wraiths: stripped to the bone but still human, stripped of their names but still free.",The New York Times
2018,"Giancarlo Stanton Gets Taste of Revenge, but Yankees Can’t Complete a Sweep","DETROIT — It’s been nearly four years since an 88-miles-per-hour fastball from Mike Fiers caught Giancarlo Stanton flush in the face, sending him to the hospital a bloodied mess: a broken nose, cheek and orbital bone, a broken incisor and a half-dozen chipped teeth. After extensive dental and plastic surgery, there is barely a mark on Stanton’s telegenic face. Stanton has also insisted that there are no lingering mental scars — no fear of getting hit again (though he wears a protective flap on his batting helmet) or latent animosity toward Fiers, whom he faced a year ago during spring training and earlier this season. But then, on Monday, Fiers threw an inside fastball that hit Stanton on the forearm, and all those emotions rocketed to the surface. Stanton glared at Fiers, had a few words, and took a few steps toward the mound before Tigers catcher James McCann escorted him to first base. In his next at-bat, Stanton let his bat do the talking — crushing an 0-2 curveball deep into the left-field bleachers, an estimated 456 feet from home plate. Stanton took a moment to admire the home run, then flipped his bat before jogging around the bases. As he crossed home plate, Stanton pointed back with his left hand — a pointed gesture toward Fiers. If it was an expressive moment for Stanton, it was a hollow victory — a mere solo home run — in the Yankees’ 4-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers in the nightcap of a makeup doubleheader. The Yankees won the opener 7-4, by riding eight strong innings from Luis Severino and a three-run home run by Austin Romine. But their final chance for the sweep ended late in the evening with Stanton on deck after the former Yankee Shane Greene struck out Brett Gardner, Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez after allowing a pinch-hit single to Aaron Hicks to begin the ninth. It was a particularly long and grueling day for Judge, who was hitless and struck out eight times, extending a two-week funk in which he has batted .200 with 29 strikeouts in 66 at-bats. But it was the history — and the histrionics — between Stanton and Fiers that made for the day’s most compelling moments. Asked why he pointed back toward Fiers, Stanton said: “Why not?” Asked what the message of the gesture was, he added: “Get the point.” Fiers told reporters in the Tigers clubhouse that he thought Stanton’s actions were “childish” and “immature.” When Fiers, pitching for Milwaukee at the time, beaned Stanton — who was playing for the Miami Marlins — on Sept. 11, 2014, the image of Stanton being carted off the field on his side with a towel covering his bloodied face sent shock waves through baseball. The blow ended his season and might have ended his career. “Obviously, anything like that happens — another ball like that,” Stanton said Monday night. “No matter how many years it is, I’m not going to be happy, not going to just walk to first and everything be O.K.” Stanton said he was simply making a point by taking a couple of steps toward the mound, and had no intention of escalating tensions that might have also been simmering between the two teams, who had a bench-clearing brawl when they met last August. In the bottom of the third, Yankees starter Domingo German buzzed the Tigers’ two best hitters — Nick Castellanos and Miguel Cabrera — with fastballs, but there were no other incidents. As soon as Fiers threw the pitch four years ago, he immediately put his hands over his head, and he later exchanged text messages with Stanton. Before he faced Fiers in April, Stanton said there was no bad blood between the two. He wrote it off as an unfortunate accident. In three hitless at-bats since then, there had been nothing belying Stanton’s words. Fiers struck out Stanton looking at a slider in his first at-bat on Monday, but then fell behind him by 3-1 when Stanton came to bat with runners at the corners and two out in the third. The next pitch, a fastball, tailed inside and hit Stanton in the forearm. As Stanton gestured and glared, Fiers pleaded innocence. “I wasn’t trying to hit you,” Fiers told Stanton. Fiers’s protestations did little to appease Stanton. “If that happened before, you’re going to come in make sure you don’t hit me,” he said. “It doesn’t eliminate in — it’s still in the big leagues. But you’ve got to get over the plate or make sure you don’t hit me.” When Stanton came to the plate again, leading off the sixth against Fiers with the Yankees trailing by 3-1, neither pitcher nor hitter was going to be cowed. Fiers threw a letter-high fastball that Stanton took a mighty hack at and missed. Fiers came right back with a fastball on the inner half of the plate that Stanton hooked down the left-field line. On the next pitch, McCann set up high — as if he was trying to sucker Stanton into thinking a fastball was coming. Instead, a curveball broke over the middle of the plate, and Stanton did not miss it. “It was nice,” Stanton said. “A win would be better. Oh, well.”",The New York Times
2018,"Giancarlo Stanton Homers, Breaking Out of Slump in a Yankees Win","Yankees 8, Orioles 5 BALTIMORE — Giancarlo Stanton, after going 2 for 25 over the Yankees’ previous six games and not hitting a ball out of the park for two weeks, slugged a two-run homer and went 2 for 4 on Saturday as the Yankees defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 8-5, for their fourth consecutive win. Stanton had an infield single and drew a walk in addition to hitting his 12th home run, and he now has 31 runs batted in. When he led the major leagues with 59 homers and 132 R.B.I. last season with the Miami Marlins, much of his power production came later in the year. On June 2, 2017, Stanton had 15 homers and a .291 batting average. His average after Saturday’s game was .248, and he had struck out 73 times. Orioles starter Kevin Gausman struck out nine in five and a third innings, thanks mostly to a hard-diving splitter and a lively fastball. But Gausman left his first pitch to Stanton in the fourth inning up in the zone. Stanton quickly sent a bullet into the right-field seats to give the Yankees a 4-1 lead. Stanton said he has been fighting the slump the way all professionals do. “Working, working, working, getting it right,” Stanton said. “You keep going till you can’t. That’s what I’m going to do. That’s what I’ve been doing, but anyone can throw a good game or two together. I need good weeks, good months. It’s a good way to start it.” Manager Aaron Boone said he had seen progress recently even though Stanton did not find the desired results until this game. Things just came together on Saturday. “I thought he looked really good, actually, for about a week or so now,” Boone said. “The results haven’t been there, but he looks like he’s struggling just to find that rhythm and timing up there. It’s good to see him get some results.” Miguel Andujar, who had collided with Yuli Gurriel of the Houston Astros while trying to field a ball during a win on Wednesday, gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead with a two-run homer off Gausman in the second. Andujar said he felt well enough to play after the collision, but Thursday’s game was postponed, and he did not play Friday. Andujar crushed a low splitter for his sixth homer this season. The Orioles helped the Yankees with errors on three consecutive plays in the sixth that paved the way for two runs and a 6-2 lead. The Yankees added two more in the eighth when Aaron Hicks delivered a run-scoring single followed by a run-scoring double from Andujar that gave the Yankees an 8-4 lead. Masahiro Tanaka (7-2) got the victory despite allowing four runs and eight hits in five and a third innings. The biggest problem again was home runs. He gave up three, bringing his total for the season to 15 in 67⅔ innings. “I feel like I made some quality pitches, but it’s the home runs,” Tanaka said through an interpreter. “I gave up three home runs. That’s kind of been the thing for me, and I feel like I need to do a better job with that.” After Tanaka left, four relievers combined to hold the Orioles, who lost for the seventh straight game, to one run. The game started 1 hour 44 minutes late because of a threat of inclement weather. A tarp was put on the field early, but even though the skies remained dark, the rain never really came, except for a light mist. The forecast for Sunday also calls for rain, near the 1:05 p.m. scheduled first pitch, putting the Yankees at risk for their seventh postponement this year.",The New York Times
2018,Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman Has Lymphoma,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman has lymphoma and will soon begin treatment, and he said he is encouraged by the prognosis. Gettleman, who was hired in the offseason to replace Jerry Reese, released a statement on Tuesday about his health. He said he recently “underwent an annual physical, during which it was discovered I have lymphoma. Over the past week, I have undergone more testing to determine the course of treatment, which is scheduled to start in the very near future. The doctor’s outlook for the treatment and the prognosis is positive, and so am I.” Gettleman said he planned to continue working “as much as the treatment process will allow.” Lymphoma is a cancer that causes mutations in white blood cells, which fight disease. It is not clear which of the two types of lymphoma — Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s — Gettleman has. Gettleman, 67, formerly was the Carolina Panthers’ general manager. When Gettleman was hired by the Giants in December, he said his plan was to come in to the office every day at full throttle. “That’s my plan, O.K.?,” he said. “And I’m going to keep doing it until they either take my key card or the Lord calls me home.” Before joining the Panthers in 2013, Gettleman was a Giants personnel executive for 15 years. He was on the staff when the team won the Super Bowls for the 2007 and 2011 seasons — two of the seven Super Bowls in which Gettleman has been a part in his 30-year N.F.L. career. In his four seasons as Carolina’s general manager, the Panthers won 40 games and three N.F.C. South titles. They lost in the 50th Super Bowl to Denver after finishing 15-1, the best record in the league. For 2015, Gettleman was voted The Sporting News’s N.F.L. Executive of the Year. At the end of his statement, in which he thanked the Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch for their support and encouragement, Gettleman added, “I look forward to being back at full strength and devoting all my energy to helping make this 2018 New York Giants team the best it can be.” The assistant general manager, Kevin Abrams, is likely to assume some of Gettleman’s duties while he is undergoing treatments.",The New York Times

2018,Giuliani Promised a Surprise Before the Election. Comey Delivered One.,"About New York Once, in his days as New York’s chief federal prosecutor and later as the city’s mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani was a master of releasing damaging leaks aimed at the kneecaps of opponents. Sometimes, they were true. Now Mr. Giuliani works the other end of the information slurry, and he has had a hard time keeping his stories straight, one day boasting of his inside sources, then denying that they exist. At a Senate hearing this week in Washington, Democrats took turns at the microphone to ask about the furies that — depending on which version of Mr. Giuliani you believe — ran from the F.B.I. office in New York to Mr. Giuliani during the closing weeks of the 2016 presidential election. One Democratic senator asked the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, if the pipeline was still running. “Can you assure the American people there are no ongoing leaks from any office of the F.B.I. to Rudolph Giuliani?” Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked. “Senator, I’m certainly not aware of any,” Mr. Wray replied. Last week, the Justice Department released a 500-page report on the F.B.I.’s work in its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Most humans would think that 500 pages ought to cover the subject handily, but this report barely touches on the subject of law enforcement information being dished out to the likes of Mr. Giuliani, who then weaponized it. Another report on leaks is apparently still underway. Mr. Giuliani is not mentioned in the first report, but he has said on television that he was interviewed. According to the report, witnesses told the inspector general that a fear of leaks from within the F.B.I. drove the agency’s former director, James Comey, to break with established policy against opening or discussing investigations in the run-up to an election. Two weeks before the 2016 election, Mr. Comey disclosed that the F.B.I. discovered a laptop that had not been examined in the original investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s emails. In speaking with the inspector general’s office, Mr. Comey maintained that the threat of leaks was not a factor in his decision, but few of those involved saw it that way, according to the report. The former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, told investigators that Mr. Comey “said, ‘It’s clear to me that there is a cadre of senior people in New York who have a deep and visceral hatred of Secretary Clinton.’ And he said, ‘It is deep.’” Mr. Comey said he found it “stunning,” Ms. Lynch told the investigators. She replied to him: “I’m just troubled that this issue — meaning the, the New York agent issue and leaks — I am just troubled that this issue has put us where we are today with respect to this laptop.” The self-proclaimed tribune of that F.B.I. antipathy was Mr. Giuliani, now a lawyer for President Trump. On Oct. 25, 2016, three days before Mr. Comey’s stunning announcement, Mr. Giuliani appeared on a Fox morning television show. “We got a couple of surprises left,” Mr. Giuliani said. He chortled, and when asked to expand on the subject, replied, “And I think it’ll be enormously effective.” On Thursday, Oct. 27, Mr. Giuliani appeared on another Fox show and said he was talking about “pretty big surprises.” He added, “We’ve got a couple of things up our sleeve that should turn this thing around.” The news of the reactivated email inspection arrived the following day and may have helped propel Mr. Trump closer to the presidency. Upon inspection by the F.B.I., the emails on the laptop turned out to be much ado about hardly anything — many of them had already been reviewed, and the authorities decided they did not warrant changing the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton’s use of the server should not be prosecuted. In interviews this week, including on Fox, Mr. Giuliani said that the “surprise” he was talking about in 2016 had nothing to do with the email investigation, but was a speech that Mr. Trump was going to give right before the election blasting Mrs. Clinton. It’s hard to imagine that anyone, Mr. Giuliani included, would have classified a Trump campaign speech as a “pretty big surprise.” On the day of Mr. Comey’s announcement in 2016, Mr. Giuliani was so pleased that he blurted out a description of his sources for inside information on the email case. “The other rumor that I get is that there’s a kind of revolution going on inside the F.B.I. about the original conclusion being completely unjustified, and almost a slap in the face of the F.B.I.’s integrity,” Mr. Giuliani said in a radio interview with Lars Larson, the conservative talk show host. “I know that from former agents. I know that even from” — Mr. Giuliani paused, then continued — “a few active agents who obviously don’t want to identify themselves.” The following day, Mr. Giuliani fixed up his remarks, editing out the line about “active agents” when he spoke with Wolf Blitzer on CNN. And now Mr. Giuliani is telling a new version. All his predictions were just speculation by retired agents, he said on Fox Business recently. “We knew just by instinct,” he said, “that the New York office was enraged.”",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani Says Kim Jong-un ‘Begged’ on Hands and Knees to Revive Trump Summit,"Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “got back on his hands and knees and begged” for the United States to revive the Singapore summit meeting after President Trump abruptly scrapped it last month, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Wednesday. The remarks by Mr. Giuliani, apparently intended to portray Mr. Trump as a tough negotiator, may have lobbed a disruptive obstacle into the salvaged meeting less than a week before it is set to happen. The remarks could easily offend officials in North Korea, where a cultlike autocracy exalts Mr. Kim as a deity who cannot be seen as servile and weak. “If the North Koreans needed a reason to cancel the meeting, the Americans just gave it to them,” said Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who specializes in North Korea. Mr. Giuliani made the remarks in Israel during a capital markets conference, where he was explaining the head-spinning sequence of events that led Mr. Trump to cancel and then revive the summit meeting. Mr. Trump abruptly announced the cancellation on May 24 after a North Korean official threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the United States and called Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” for having suggested that Mr. Kim had asked for the meeting under pressure. The North Koreans also were offended by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, who has expressed hostility toward the North and has insisted that it disarm before other issues can be discussed. Mr. Trump said then that under the circumstances, a meeting with Mr. Kim would not be appropriate given what the president called North Korea’s “tremendous anger and open hostility.” Eight days later Mr. Trump just as abruptly said the summit meeting was back on, asserting that “we’re over that, totally over that, and now we’re going to deal and we’re going to really start a process,” after meeting with a high-ranking North Korean envoy who hand-delivered a personal letter from Mr. Kim. “Well, somehow North Korea, after he canceled the summit because they insulted the vice president, they insulted his national security adviser and they also said that they would go to nuclear war against us, they were going to defeat us in a nuclear war,” Mr. Giuliani told the conference in Tel Aviv. “We said, ‘Well, we’re not going to have a summit under those circumstances.’’’ After that, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Kim “got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in.” In an interview later with The Associated Press, Mr. Giuliani rejected suggestions that such comments might spoil the summit meeting, saying that Mr. Kim must understand that the United States is in a position of strength. “It is pointing out that the president is the stronger figure,” Mr. Giuliani was quoted as saying by The A.P. “And you’re not going to have useful negotiations unless he accepts that.” It is not the first time Mr. Giuliani has inserted himself into the Trump administration’s foreign policy, nor the first time his remarks have threatened to stir new issues for the president. Last month, Mr. Trump publicly undercut Mr. Giuliani’s narrative about a payment by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to the actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels. Mr. Trump said Mr. Giuliani would eventually “get his facts straight.”",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani Speaks for Trump. Except When He Doesn’t.,"WASHINGTON — President Trump hired Rudolph W. Giuliani to speak for him. But no less than Mr. Trump’s wife and his chief diplomat spent Thursday explaining that Mr. Giuliani does not always know what he is talking about. Melania Trump, the first lady, let it be known that Mr. Giuliani has no idea how she feels about Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and says she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, while Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, made clear that Mr. Giuliani has nothing to do with North Korea policy. Their pushback came in response to the latest in a series of seemingly off-script moments by Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has joined the legal team representing Mr. Trump in the special counsel’s investigations into his campaign and associates. Mr. Giuliani has been something of a loose cannon, making public comments that surprised other advisers, were later contradicted or touched on matters beyond his ostensible mandate. At a conference in Israel this week, Mr. Giuliani said Mrs. Trump accepted her husband’s denial that he had any sexual liaisons with Ms. Clifford. “She believes her husband and she knows it’s untrue,” Mr. Giuliani said. That drew a sharp retort from the first lady’s office. “I don’t believe Mrs. Trump has ever discussed her thoughts on anything with Mr. Giuliani,” the first lady’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an email to The New York Times. The unusually pointed response from a first lady who rarely engages in conflicts the way her husband does may have spoken to a sensitivity that goes beyond Mr. Giuliani. Even as she rejected Mr. Giuliani as a spokesman for her feelings, Mrs. Trump did nothing to affirm that she did accept her husband’s explanation of what happened with Ms. Clifford. Also left uncertain was the degree to which Mr. Giuliani is freelancing when he says such things or reflecting what the president wants him to say. In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani did not say his client had told him about Mrs. Trump’s feelings. But the president has frequently instructed his lawyer on what to say about topics related to Ms. Clifford and the special counsel investigation. Mr. Trump may not have had qualms about Mr. Giuliani’s public denunciation of Ms. Clifford. At the same conference, Mr. Giuliani said she was not credible because of her career in the sex industry. “I‘m sorry, I don’t respect a porn star the way I respect a career woman or a woman of substance or a woman who has great respect for herself as a woman and as a person and isn’t going to sell her body for sexual exploitation,” he said. Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said Mr. Giuliani was the one with the credibility problem. “My client @StormyDaniels should be celebrated for her courage, strength and intelligence,” he wrote on Twitter. “She is one of the most credible people I have ever met regardless of gender. Period. I would be put her character up against Mr. Giuliani’s any day of the week.” As for Mr. Pompeo, he looked pained when asked at a White House press briefing on Thursday about Mr. Giuliani’s foray into North Korea diplomacy. While in Israel, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump agreed to resume plans for a summit meeting only after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, pleaded with him to do it. “Kim Jong-un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in,” Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Pompeo, who has met twice with Mr. Kim and led Mr. Trump’s efforts to set up a meeting to discuss North Korea’s nuclear program, made clear that he did not find Mr. Giuliani’s intervention helpful. “I know Rudy,” he told reporters at the White House after a meeting between Mr. Trump and Japan’s prime minister. “Rudy doesn’t speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issues.” The often prickly North Koreans did not immediately respond to Mr. Giuliani’s portrayal of what happened, and Mr. Pompeo sought to play it down as a joke. “I took him as being in a small room and not being serious about the comments,” he said. “I think it was a bit in jest. We’re moving forward. We’re focused on the important things.” Mr. Giuliani also ventured into Middle East peace as Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has developed a plan to resolve the decades-old dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Giuliani suggested that the Palestinians should, like Mr. Kim, get down on their knees and beg. “That’s what needs to happen with the Palestinian Authority,” he said. “They have to be seeking peace. You’ve got to change the dynamic and put the pressure on them.” The former mayor told Israeli reporters that he had seen Mr. Kushner’s secret peace plan and that it made “all the sense in the world.” But Mr. Giuliani called The Wall Street Journal afterward to say he only knew what had been in news reports. “I have not seen any secret plan or been told about one,” he said. “I based my comments on the publicly available discussion of the plan.”",The New York Times
2018,Glamping Slips Into the Mainstream,"The Getaway The allure of luxury camping has brought a wave of new destinations this year, and they aren’t always in the wild. Camping in the wild with all the comforts of a deluxe hotel, including real beds, plush furnishings and attending stewards, has been around since 19th-century African wildlife safaris. Now known as glamping — short for glamorous camping — the hybrid of camp and resort has exploded, bringing a wave of new glamping destinations this year in a variety of price ranges. For travelers, the camps offer convenient access to nature without an investment in equipment or the chores of firewood-gathering and the common camping hazards of splinters, sleeping in the rain and waking up cold. “People nowadays desire real change from the grind of their daily commutes, the dreary workplace environment with its ever-present noise pollution and the constant invasion of smartphones,” said George Morgan-Grenville, the founder and chief executive of Red Savannah, a high-end travel company. “Glamping is the ultimate realization of ‘disconnect to reconnect.’” Indicative of glamping’s growth, the biggest American camp collectives are on an expansionist spree. Both Under Canvas and Collective Retreats recently secured new funding, $17 million and $10 million, respectively. The 37,000-acre Resort at Paws Up in Montana, one of the earliest, in 2005, to erect fancy tents with framed art on the canvas walls, rugs on the wood floors and downy duvets on the log-frame beds, introduced glamping’s first three-bedroom, two-bathroom tents last summer. Popular glamping sites are expanding in ways that resemble more traditional hotels, too. Firelight Camps in Ithaca, N.Y., plans to open a Catskills location next fall that will include a restaurant from its co-founder and chef Emma Frisch, who recently published a cookbook, “Feast by Firelight,” which includes recipes served at the camp’s daily breakfasts and occasional dinners. Glamping.com lists nearly 800 locations worldwide, including lodges, tree houses and cabins — essentially, any accommodation in a natural setting with luxury-level service — but the following new glamping sites follow the classic definition: tent-based. Light pollution, noise and nocturnal pests, human and otherwise, haven’t discouraged glamping entrepreneurs from setting up in cities. The most significant camp to put down city stakes, Collective Governors Island, will feature 37 tents on the car-free island in New York Harbor once it’s fully open in July (from $150). The company Collective Retreats has been setting up seasonal camps since 2015 when it opened in Vail, Colo. The New York camp will have its own restaurant, offer massage services and equip some tents with their own bathrooms. Others will share facilities but all will have furnished porches and wood-frame beds with 1,500-thread-count linens. A spate of luxury hotels is newly offering glamping on the private terraces of its top suites, including the Gwen Hotel in Chicago, the Beverly Wilshire, a Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., and Le Méridien Denver Downtown, running between $3,500 and $15,000 a night. Under Canvas operates seasonal glamping resorts near national parks, among them Yellowstone, Zion and Glacier. Last month, it opened Under Canvas Rushmore in South Dakota through Oct. 1. The solar-powered forest compound of 80 four-person tents, each with a wood stove and some with attached bathrooms, offers views of Mount Rushmore (from $209). Guests can eat hearty breakfasts and campfire dinners of smoked, grilled and roasted meats on site, and the kitchen packs box lunches for those heading out to climb, bike or take Jeep safaris. On Aug. 30, Under Canvas Great Smoky Mountains will open in Gatlinburg, Tenn., with 54 tents on 200 acres near the national park (from $199). Collective Hill Country, the second opening this summer of a glamping resort by Collective Retreats, will spring up on a 225-acre ranch near Austin, Tex., offering activities like horseback riding and winery tours. Guests in its 12 tents will dine on campfire dishes like jalapeño and Cheddar grits and wild boar osso buco (from $400). On the Hudson River in Kingston, N. Y., Terra Glamping is slated to open this month at Hutton Brickyards, a riverside event venue, with 25 tents featuring memory-foam mattresses, down bedding, Turkish towels and robes (from $225). Guests can borrow bikes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards, as well as lanterns and flashlights after dark. For beach lovers, Wild Lotus operates a tented camp on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Tents come with blowup mattresses, coolers and ice, and guests have access to showers at a neighboring beach bar (from $149). Or you can glamp at the company’s rain forest camp on nearby Montserrat. Among the truly glamorous new glamping facilities, the Rosewood Luang Prabang opened in March in a forested setting near the Laotian city with six deluxe tents among its 23 accommodations (from $724). While residing closer to nature, guests of the tent suites have access to the resort’s many amenities: a pool, tented spa villas, restaurant and activities such as cooking classes and Mekong River cruises. Like the Rosewood property, the celebrated designer Bill Bensley also designed the new Capella Ubud opening in Bali in June. The Indonesian retreat will host 23 tents, furnished to evoke 19th-century colonial travel. Even the gym will be based under canvas, as will the Officers Tent lounge (from $838, including breakfast). Tents were created to provide shelter in the wilderness and upscale versions can be found increasingly in remote locales accessible on multiday trips. This summer, Off the Map Travel is introducing three-night trips on Norway’s Lofoten Islands, a mountainous and fjord-filled region above the Arctic Circle, based in tepee tents decorated in the style of the indigenous Sami people. Itineraries include kayaking, hiking and whale watching (three-night trips, June through August, from 1,499 pounds, or about $1,995). In September, Peru Ecocamp will open with five deluxe camps strung out along the Salkantay trail leading to Machu Picchu. Guests will hike between the high-altitude, solar-powered camps, which will feature dome-shaped sleeping tents with bathrooms, showers and wood stoves. Each camp will operate a dining dome, organic garden and bar tent (seven-night trips from $3,791). This year, REI Adventures will expand its Signature Camping program, which brings deluxe mobile camps to remote locales, with the addition of Mount Kilimanjaro. Two different routes up Africa’s highest peak will feature overnights in camps set up ahead of arriving guests and include sizable tents with cots and lighting as well as a furnished communal area and staff cooks (10 days from $4,999). To celebrate the spring and fall equinox, Hotel Chaco in Albuquerque, N.M., and the tour operator Heritage Inspirations are offering two-day trips to the Pueblo ruins at Chaco Canyon National Historic Park. After a five-course dinner, stargazing and sleeping in furnished tents, guests rise to track the sunrise, which aligns with the east-west orientation of the astronomically influenced sandstone-and-timber buildings. The next tour departs Sept. 22 ($750), though private tours are also available.",The New York Times
2018,Glasgow Jewel Goes Up in Flames for Second Time in 4 Years,"LONDON — A large fire ripped through the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland overnight Friday, officials said Saturday morning, causing extensive damage to a building considered the jewel in the city’s architectural crown. It was the second time in four years that a blaze has hit the world-famous building, which was under restoration and was set to reopen after a fire badly damaged it in May 2014. The building, widely described as a masterpiece of the Glasgow-born architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was completed in 1909. Peter Heath of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told reporters that the call had come in at 11:19 p.m. Friday, sending more than 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines to the site. Mr. Heath said people should be prepared for what they would see after the blaze had been put out: “The damage to this building, regrettably, is very extensive.” He said that “every part of the building” had been affected and that part of the roof had collapsed. Footage shared on social media showed flames and smoke billowing from the roof. Mr. Heath told reporters that the blaze had “consumed” the building and spread to adjacent structures, including a cinema and shops. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and the cause of the fire was not immediately clear. “Devastated that a major fire has broken out at the Glasgow School of Art tonight,” the shadow minister for Scotland, Paul Sweeney, wrote on Twitter, calling the Mackintosh “the most architecturally important building in Glasgow.” Scotland has deep emotional ties to the building. “In such an iconic building, which has such affection not just for the people of Scotland but for people around the world, any damage in the building has a devastating effect,” Mr. Heath said. The leader of the Scottish government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, said on Twitter that she was heartbroken: “My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people — but my heart also breaks for Glasgow’s beloved @GSofA.” David Mundell, the Scotland secretary in the British government, posted on Twitter that his government was “ready to help, financially or otherwise.” He said he had visited the building only two weeks ago. Garbage, the Scottish-American rock band, tweeted a broken heart. One person on Twitter wrote: “Can’t help thinking how architects in charge of #glasgowschoolofart restoration must be feeling … has a building ever been destroyed so close to reopening before?” Another posted, “I feel a sense of anger that such a thing should’ve occurred again.” The British author J.K. Rowling rebuked the TV journalist Adam Boulton, who tweeted, “Carelessness or insurance job?” Ms. Rowling wrote on Twitter, “Adam, if you knew what a devastating blow this has been to people who’ve worked immensely hard to restore this iconic building, you might think twice before taking such a cheap shot.” The Art Nouveau building, which houses a working art school, is considered a work of art in its own right. It is best known for its library — a multitiered gem, with distinctive fin-de-siècle chandelier lighting; carefully wrought colored balustrades; elongated windows; and ornamental carvings on tables. The 2014 fire started below the library, when an overhead projector ignited solvent in a student’s artwork, and destroyed much of the interior’s western half. As restoration work began, the art school’s director, Prof. Tom Inns, said that the 2014 fire had proved to be “a significant catalyst in how we think about the space.” A new fire-safety system, with a misting infrastructure, was to be part of the restoration work. The campus began a fund-raising appeal with a goal of 32 million pounds (now about $42.5 million) to help restore the building. Celebrities like the actors Brad Pitt and Peter Capaldi were among those who signed up as trustees to help the Glasgow School of Art raise £20 million. Mr. Pitt’s interest in architecture is well known; and Mr. Capaldi, of “Doctor Who” fame, studied at the school in the 1980s. He recorded a tribute to the art students whose works were either damaged or destroyed during the 2014 blaze. The building had been scheduled to reopen in spring next year. Some students had graduated from the school earlier on Friday. People stood on the street in shock as they watched firefighters battle the blaze. A number of roads around the art school were closed while fire crews used water from the Clyde River to tackle the blaze, and residents nearby were evacuated. Later on Saturday, officials said the blaze had been mostly contained. Alan Dunlop, a professor of architecture, told The Times of London that the second fire appeared to have “gutted” the entire building. “Judging by the photographs I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself,” he said. “It looks as if the building is totally destroyed.” According to the BBC, the school has produced many of Britain’s leading contemporary artists, including Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, along with three recent winners of the Turner Prize: Simon Starling, who won in 2005; Richard Wright, 2009; and Martin Boyce, 2011. The building had attracted around 25,000 visitors each year before the 2014 blaze, with tours conducted by art school students.",The New York Times
2018,Glasgow’s Artists Mourn After Fire Rips Through City’s Creative Heart,"LONDON — In the 1980s, Nathan Coley became transfixed by the Glasgow School of Art’s main building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mr. Coley was an awkward teenager who stood out at his high school because of both his 6-foot-2 height and his interest in art. The building offered an escape. “I knew of this strange, romantic building on the hill, and the idea of studying in it was such a powerful promise — the idea that you could go through those beautiful wooden doors and be transported into another world,” Mr. Coley, today a Turner Prize-nominated artist, said in a telephone interview. As a teenager, he went through those doors for Saturday morning drawing classes. Then he got in to study a degree. It changed his life. Mr. Coley started crying as he recalled his time in the building he loved — “I’m not ashamed of you writing I’m crying, as I am” — because it is now in danger of being lost forever. On Friday, a large fire ripped through the school, leaving it gutted. The building was coming toward the end of a restoration that cost 35 million British pounds (about $46 million) following a previous fire four years ago. An investigation into the cause of Friday’s blaze is underway, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, which said no casualties were reported. The 2014 fire was caused by gases from a student artist’s canister of expanding foam. The school’s Art Nouveau building has long been seen as a gem of world architecture, especially its library, which was filled with ornate carving reminiscent of Japan as much as Scotland. Students there have included the artist David Shrigley; several Turner Prize winners, including Simon Starling and Douglas Gordon; and musicians including Robert Hardy of the indie band Franz Ferdinand. The fresh damage is being deplored by architects and politicians, with questions being asked about how the fire could happen in a closed site, but some alumni described the emotional loss as just as significant. “Everyone says it was an eccentric building, but my memory is it was deeply romantic,” Mr. Coley said. “In cold, northern, industrial Glasgow, it’s very unusual for anyone to be deeply romantic, let alone a building.” Liz Lochhead, a onetime national poet of Scotland, studied at the school from 1965-70. On Friday night, she started receiving texts about the fire. “First I thought my phone had gone crazy and was sending me four-year-old messages,” she said. “Then it was, ‘Oh, God, it’s happened again.’” “I feel personally bereaved,” she added. “I feel a great sense of grief. Of course a building isn’t a person, but this is a huge loss to me and to the city.” She was struggling to take in what had happened. “Is there a demon that wants to destroy the art school?” she said. Ms. Lochhead studied painting and drawing, but she also wrote initial drafts of her first poetry collection in the library. She said she did not appreciate what a masterpiece of design it was until one day the room was inundated by Japanese historians who were filming a documentary: “I saw them and suddenly went, ‘Oh, wow.’ I remember the penny dropping.” “It’s like New York without the Chrysler Building,” Ms. Lochhead said. “It’s like Paris without the Eiffel Tower. It’s like London without Big Ben. You can’t underestimate its importance to the city of Glasgow.” Stuart Robertson, director of the Glasgow-based Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said it was hard to put into words how he felt. “You feel like someone’s pulled your heart out,” he said. He felt lucky to have been occupied with interviews on the morning after the fire. “It was therapy for me being asked so many questions,” he said. The fire was particularly hard to take as it came just days after the society had celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mackintosh’s birth. The restoration of the art school was to be completed next year, and the mood around the anniversary was exuberant. Mr. Robertson said the building always surprised people, no matter how much they learned about it. “You go around, and things appear you didn’t notice before,” he said, speaking in the present tense as if the damage had not occurred. “Someone said you didn’t need to go to the school, the building told you everything you need to know about art and architecture.” Mr. Gordon, who won the Turner Prize in 1996, studied at the school in the 1980s. “All the professors were smoking, and all the students were smoking, and there was this joke that it was a bit of a tinderbox and yet it survived,” he said. “Ironically, as soon as the health and safety brigade came, it went wrong.” He loved the library: “It was a little oasis of space and time that could take you out of the everyday and into the special, the place where ideas happen.” But he said the best part of the building was how Mackintosh had filled it with twists and turns, a series of villages that you would discover by accident. “It provided you with opportunities for fantasy,” he added. Mr. Coley said his mood had changed from disbelief to sadness to “absolute rage” at how the fire could happen, given that the building was being restored. “There’s a bit of me that feels it should be left as a ruin to shame us,” Mr. Coley added, “to shame the city of its neglect, to remind us we let this happen.” Mr. Gordon said he was filled with anger and disbelief, but disagreed that the school should be left a ruin or knocked down. “If there’s any way to save it, if it has to be done brick by brick, then it has to happen,” he said. It is clear that the fire’s impact on Glasgow’s cultural scene will take years to play out. “Glasgow has this image of being successful and culturally dynamic, but it’s very fragile,” Mr. Coley said. And, he added, it had just lost its beating heart.",The New York Times
2018,Glenda Jackson to Return to Broadway in ‘King Lear’,"Glenda Jackson, who won a Tony Award this month for her much-lauded performance in Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women,” will return to Broadway next spring as the title character in a new production of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” Ms. Jackson previously played Lear in a 2016 production at the Old Vic in London. The Broadway staging, produced by Scott Rudin, will be a new one, with a creative team that has not yet been named; it is scheduled to begin previews March 6 and open April 11 at an unspecified theater. Ms. Jackson, 82, is a renowned stage and film actress who won two Oscars before taking a two-decade detour to serve in Parliament. She returned to the stage with the British Lear production. The news was first reported in The Hollywood Reporter.",The New York Times
2018,"Glenn Close, Jake Gyllenhaal and Songs of Bob Dylan Are Coming to Public Theater","Glenn Close, Jake Gyllenhaal and the music of Bob Dylan will all be making appearances at the Public Theater over the next year. The Off Broadway nonprofit announced on Tuesday an ambitious 2018-19 season, which also includes a new play by Suzan-Lori Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Topdog/Underdog.” Ms. Close will star in “Mother of the Maid,” a play by Jane Anderson about Joan of Arc’s mother. Although best known as a film star, Ms. Close is a veteran stage actress who has won three Tony Awards, and who last season starred on Broadway in a revival of “Sunset Boulevard,” playing the same role she had originated on Broadway 23 years earlier. The play will be directed by Matthew Penn, who in 2015 directed a production with Tina Packer in the leading role at Shakespeare & Company in the Berkshires. Mr. Gyllenhaal will share a bill with Tom Sturridge in a pairing of two monologues, “Sea Wall,” written in 2008 by Simon Stephens, and “A Life” (previously called “The Art of Dying”), written in 2013 by Nick Payne. Both plays will be directed by Carrie Cracknell. Both actors appeared on Broadway last year, Mr. Gyllenhaal in a revival of “Sunday in the Park with George,” and Mr. Sturridge in “1984.” The season will begin with “Girl From the North Country,” written and directed by Conor McPherson, with songs by Mr. Dylan. The show, a boardinghouse drama set in 1934 in Duluth, Minn., which is Mr. Dylan’s hometown, was produced last year at the Old Vic in London, and then earlier this year in the West End. Ms. Parks’s new play is called “White Noise,” and is about the impact on a group of friends of a racially freighted police incident. The play will be directed by Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public. The Public season will also include three new plays: “Eve’s Song,” about the contemporary racial climate, written by Patricia Ione Lloyd and directed by Jo Bonney; “Ain’t No Mo’,” written by Jordan E. Cooper and directed by Stevie Walker-Webb, about an imagined exodus of black Americans; and “Socrates,” written by Tim Blake Nelson and directed by Doug Hughes, about, as the title suggests, the Greek philosopher. “Wild Goose Dreams,” a play about a South Korean man whose wife and daughter move to America, will be presented at the Public after a run at the La Jolla Playhouse last year. It is written by Hansol Jung and directed by Leigh Silverman. And the season will wrap up with “Mojada,” a contemporary riff on “Medea” by Luis Alfaro and directed by Chay Yew. The play has had several previous productions, including in Chicago, Los Angeles and Oregon. The season will not include a new musical by Stephen Sondheim, based on two films by Luis Buñuel, that the composer at one point had hoped would be ready for a production at the Public Theater last year. A spokeswoman for the Public, Candi Adams, said “it’s a musical in development, and we will happily be doing it when it’s ready.”",The New York Times
2018,"Going for Broke, the Middle Class Goes Broke","Books of The Times It wasn’t long ago that the term “middle class” suggested security, conformity and often complacency — a cohort that was such a reliable feature of postwar American life that it attracted not just political pandering but also cultural ridicule. The stereotype included everyone from men in gray flannel suits to the slick professionals of “Thirtysomething,” stuck or smug in their world of bourgeois comforts. “Squeezed: Why Our Families Can’t Afford America,” a timely new book by the journalist and poet Alissa Quart, arrives at a moment when members of the middle class are no longer a robust demographic but an embattled and shrinking population, struggling to hold on to their delicate perch in an unforgiving economic order. These aren’t the truly poor but those in the “just-making-it group,” or what Quart also calls “the Middle Precariat.” The people she talks to believed their educations and backgrounds (most of them grew up in middle-class homes) would guarantee some financial stability; instead, their work is “inconstant or contingent,” and their incomes are stagnant or worse. “They are people on the brink who did everything ‘right,’” Quart writes, “and yet the math of their family lives is simply not adding up.” Quart describes her own experience of slipping into the “falling middle-class vortex” after the birth of her daughter seven years ago, a time when she and her husband were freelance writers facing new child care costs and hospital bills. She eventually became the executive editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, a nonprofit organization founded by the journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, but her family had a “few years of fiscal vertigo.” Quart includes herself in the group she’s writing about; her book succeeds and suffers accordingly. As she puts it in her introduction, the concerns of her subjects “were not abstract to me.” Quart is a sympathetic listener, getting people to reveal not just the tenuousness of their economic situations but also the turbulence of their emotional lives. A chapter on middle-age job-seekers who once worked as computer programmers or newspaper reporters captures the fallout of a discriminatory job market, which tells older unemployed people they should buck up and start over while also making them feel superfluous. “I’ve tried to reinvent myself so many times,” an aeronautical-engineer-turned-website-designer-turned-personal-chef tells her. “To be honest, it hasn’t worked.” The woman is now in her 50s, with two grown daughters and plenty of debt from culinary school. “The world has evolved beyond me,” she says. One of the most unsettling threads in the book is how a collapsing middle class has prompted new industries to spring forth from the rubble — or to circle overhead, like carrion birds. For-profit colleges like Trump University take advantage of government grants and desperation to peddle what usually turn out to be fantasies of lucrative second chances. (Often the only thing that ends up being real for the students are the monstrous debts.) Gig-economy start-ups encourage cash-strapped professionals to moonlight their way into making ends meet. Some of the examples Quart cites would sound too on-the-nose in a satirical novel. She describes Uber’s active efforts in a number of states to sign up schoolteachers as drivers; in Oregon, the company even notifies riders on the app when their driver is an “UberEducator” (with a tiny emoji of books by the name), bragging that 3 percent of each fare goes to the teacher’s classroom. It’s as if the apocalyptic thinking that Ehrenreich diagnosed in her 1989 book, “Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class,” has finally gained a purchase on reality. The people Ehrenreich depicted were anxious and self-absorbed, terrified of downward mobility; the ones in Quart’s book are anxious too, but now that they know firsthand the kind of profound vulnerability that used to be the domain of the poor, they may be on the cusp, she hopes, of pushing for genuine policy change. Even lawyers, a traditionally risk-averse bunch who tend to choose their profession for its stability, are getting caught in the vise between increasing law school tuitions and decreasing job prospects. Precarity, Quart suggests, can translate into solidarity. Only, that is, if people stop blaming themselves first. Quart repeatedly indicts a system that allows comfort and security to become exclusive perks for the extremely rich (“rigged” is the word she keeps using). “The mantra of this book,” she writes in the opening pages, is “It’s not your fault.” Based on the diligent people she meets, it’s hard to disagree. But then this reassurance is the kind of platitude that feels simplistic in a fully reported book. It still casts the discussion of financial hardship in familiar terms of who deserves help and who doesn’t. People make imperfect, and often just bad, decisions. A truly humane system wouldn’t only accommodate the blameless but would also make room for error — mistakes that, until humans are entirely replaced by robots, are inevitable. Quart knows this. But aside from some sharp points about how workers are expected to “deny their biology” and “how little American businesses and legislators care about care,” the analysis in “Squeezed” is thin and altogether unmemorable. Quart herself can be a distracting presence, telling us how much iced coffee she drinks and cracking flat jokes (“When I write the dastardly word ‘domination’ here, I do not use the word in either the sultry or the not-safe-for-work sense”). At other moments, in what seem to be strenuous bids for lyricism, she comes perilously close to malapropism: “a miasma of physical tasks,” “a palladium of the thoughtful,” “hot aquiline wives.” Her reporting, though, is reason enough to read “Squeezed,” especially as she brings to light how parents try to cope with the financial strain of caring for children. For all that legislators like to sentimentalize family values and hard work, they’ve largely abdicated their responsibility toward families, who are left to navigate a job market that prefers its employees childless and unencumbered. The result is that hardworking parents resort to creative (but complicated and demanding) coparenting arrangements or, as detailed in one unforgettable chapter, 24-hour day care. “Jeans-clad, juice-box-wielding,” Quart writes, “we are trying to find our way out of the maze of our country’s idea of parenthood.” Spare me the jeans and the juice box, but I’ll take the rest; we could all use her expert guidance through the maze.",The New York Times
2018,Goldman Sachs Made Millions in Malaysia. Now Malaysia Wants Some Money Back.,"HONG KONG — Goldman Sachs once made a lot of money in Malaysia. Now Malaysia wants some of it back. The Malaysian government intends to seek restitution from Goldman Sachs, its new finance minister said this week, as it moves to resolve a huge scandal that led to the disappearance of billions of dollars and helped put the country deeply in debt. That could add significantly to the venerable Wall Street bank’s problems in Malaysia, where it has become ensnared in the scandal. It already faces investigations in the United States and elsewhere related to its activity in the country, where it was once a dominant financial force. “We intend to seek some claims from them,” Lim Guan Eng, Malaysia’s new finance minister, said in an interview this week in Kuala Lumpur. The finance minister did not give any details about what kind of claims his government would seek, but he said that the authorities were likely to move cautiously and that the process “will take time.” But he added that Malaysia’s new leaders had reopened communication lines with American authorities that the country’s previous leaders had shut off. “The Department of Justice has been superb,” Mr. Lim said. “I think they have been really helpful.” Malaysian voters last month ousted the prime minister at the heart of the scandal, Najib Razak. The country’s new leader, Mahathir Mohamad, has moved forcefully to investigate the apparent theft of billions of dollars from a state investment fund under Mr. Najib’s watch. Investigators in the United States contend that $4.5 billion was diverted from the fund into the bank accounts of Mr. Najib, his family and his friends. Those investigators have called it a “massive, brazen and blatant” scheme. Mr. Najib has denied any wrongdoing. Goldman Sachs helped the investment fund — called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB — raise $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 through bond sales. Investigators say $2.5 billion of that money was then diverted to senior officials for their personal gain. The bank, which pocketed $600 million in fees for its work selling the bonds, said it was unaware of any wrongdoing. “We helped raise money for a sovereign wealth fund that was designed to invest in Malaysia,” said Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. “We had no visibility into whether some of those funds may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes,” he said. Goldman Sachs was a major player in Malaysia only a few years ago. At its peak in 2016, Goldman had two-thirds of the market in Malaysia for foreign bond offerings, according to data from Dealogic. Now, Goldman Sachs is largely staying away from any business that requires being in the public eye there. The 1MDB scandal made the difference. Mr. Najib created the sovereign wealth fund in 2009 and billed it as an economic development plan to benefit ordinary Malaysians. But Mr. Najib personally received $731 million stolen from the fund, prosecutors in the United States have alleged. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, received $30 million worth of jewelry bought with money that came from 1MDB, including a 22-carat pink diamond necklace that was worth $27.3 million, according to the prosecutors. Government filings say that some $200 million of the stolen funds was spent on paintings by artists like Picasso, Monet, van Gogh and Warhol. Another $250 million was used to buy a yacht with a private movie theater, a helicopter pad and enough space for dozens of crew members. Tens of millions of dollars went to finance Hollywood films like “The Wolf of Wall Street,” through a production studio owned by Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib’s stepson. In his acceptance speech after winning a Golden Globe for his leading role in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Leonardo DiCaprio personally thanked Mr. Aziz and Jho Low, a high-flying financier whom the Malaysian authorities are now seeking to arrest and who helped Mr. Najib set up 1MDB. The scandal over the fund gripped Malaysia and ultimately led to the election victory of an opposition bloc led by the 92-year-old Mr. Mahathir on May 9, an earthshaking event in a country that had been governed by a single coalition for decades. Days after the election, Mr. Najib and his wife were barred from leaving Malaysia and their residences were raided. In scenes that played out on television sets across the country, the authorities hauled out hundreds of boxes that included luxury handbags, watches and jewelry. They also found $28.6 million in cash. In the United States, prosecutors are seeking to collect evidence that could be used to build a criminal case, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case who were not authorized to speak publicly. Malaysian officials may decide to share information that they uncover as they pursue new leads in their investigation. As part of the civil case in the United States, prosecutors have seized assets they allege are connected to the scheme. If they gather enough information to pursue a criminal case, the government could charge individuals and institutions. A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice declined to comment. Speaking about Goldman Sachs and the broader American financial system, Mr. Lim said that “just because of one Goldman Sachs does not mean that the entire financial system of the United States is compromised.” He added: “One bad egg does not mean the whole basket is rotten.”",The New York Times
2018,Good News for Women With Breast Cancer: Many Don’t Need Chemo,"Many women with early-stage breast cancer who would receive chemotherapy under current standards do not actually need it, according to a major international study that is expected to quickly change medical treatment. “We can spare thousands and thousands of women from getting toxic treatment that really wouldn’t benefit them,” said Dr. Ingrid A. Mayer, from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, an author of the study. “This is very powerful. It really changes the standard of care.” The study found that gene tests on tumor samples were able to identify women who could safely skip chemotherapy and take only a drug that blocks the hormone estrogen or stops the body from making it. The hormone-blocking drug tamoxifen and related medicines, called endocrine therapy, have become an essential part of treatment for most women because they lower the risks of recurrence, new breast tumors and death from the disease. “I think this is a very significant advance,” said Dr. Larry Norton, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He is not an author of the study, but his hospital participated. “I’ll be able to look people in the eye and say, ‘We analyzed your tumor, you have a really good prognosis and you actually don’t need chemotherapy.’ That’s a nice thing to be able to say to somebody.” The findings apply to about 60,000 women a year in the United States, according to Dr. Joseph A. Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York, the leader of the study. “The results indicate that now we can spare chemotherapy in about 70 percent of patients who would be potential candidates for it based on clinical features,” Dr. Sparano said. But Dr. Sparano and Dr. Mayer added a note of caution: The data indicated that some women 50 and younger might benefit from chemo even if gene-test results suggested otherwise. It is not clear why. But those women require especially careful consultation, they said. (Most cases of breast cancer occur in older women: The median age at diagnosis in the United States is 62.) The study, called TAILORx, is being published by The New England Journal of Medicine and was to be presented on Sunday at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The study began in 2006 and was paid for by the United States and Canadian governments and philanthropic groups. Genomic Health, the company that makes the gene test, helped pay after 2016. This year, about 260,000 new cases of breast cancer are expected in women in the United States, and 41,000 deaths. Globally, the most recent figures are from 2012, when there were 1.7 million new cases and more than half-a-million deaths. Chemotherapy can save lives, but has serious risks that make it important to avoid treatment if it is not needed. In addition to the hair loss and nausea that patients dread, chemo can cause heart and nerve damage, leave patients vulnerable to infection and increase the risk of leukemia later in life. TAILORx is part of a wider effort to fine-tune treatments and spare patients from harsh side effects whenever possible. Endocrine therapy also has side effects, which can include hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, weight gain and pain in joints and muscles. Tamoxifen can increase the risk of cancer of the uterus. Patients affected by the new findings include women who, like most in the study, have early-stage breast tumors measuring one to five centimeters that have not spread to lymph nodes; are sensitive to estrogen; test negative for a protein called HER2; and have a score of 11 to 25 on a widely used test that gauges the activity of a panel of genes involved in cancer recurrence. The gene test, called Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, is the focus of the study. Other gene assays exist, but this one is the most widely used in the United States. It is performed on tumor samples after surgery, to help determine whether chemo would help. The test is generally done for early-stage disease, not more advanced tumors that clearly need chemo because they have spread to lymph nodes or beyond. The test, available since 2004, gives scores from 0 to 100. It costs about $3,000, and insurance usually covers it. Previous research has shown that scores 10 and under do not call for chemotherapy, and scores over 25 do. But most women who are eligible for the test have scores from 11 to 25, which are considered intermediate. “This has been one of the large unanswered questions in breast cancer management in recent times, what to do with patients with intermediate scores,” Dr. Norton said. “What to do has been totally unknown.” He added, “A lot of patients in that range are getting chemo.” Dr. Sparano said many patients have been receiving chemo because in 2000 the National Cancer Institute recommended it for most women, even those whose disease had not spread to lymph nodes, based on studies showing it could prevent the cancer from recurring elsewhere in the body and becoming incurable. “Recurrences were being prevented, and lives prolonged,” Dr. Sparano said. “But we were probably overtreating a lot of these women. For every 100 women we were treating, we were probably preventing about 4 distant recurrences.” Dr. Mayer said, “We couldn’t figure out who we really needed to treat.” The availability of the gene test in 2004 helped researchers sort out women with very high or very low risk. “But we really didn’t know what to do with women in the middle,” Dr. Mayer said. “Some seemed to benefit and some didn’t. We were back to square zero, safe rather than sorry, giving chemo to a lot who didn’t need it.” Data began to emerge suggesting that women in the middle were not being helped by chemo, and many doctors began recommending it less often. But a definitive study was needed, which is how TAILORx came about. The study began in 2006 and eventually included 10,253 women ages 18 to 75. Of the 9,719 patients with complete follow-up information, 70 percent had scores of 11 to 25 on the gene test. They had surgery and radiation, and then were assigned at random to receive either endocrine therapy alone, or endocrine therapy plus chemo. The median follow-up was more than seven years. Over time, the two groups fared equally well. Chemo had no advantage. After nine years, 93.9 percent were still alive in the endocrine-only group, versus 93.8 percent in those who also got chemo. In the endocrine group, 83.3 percent were free of invasive disease, compared with 84.3 percent who got both treatments. There were no significant differences. But the researchers wrote that the chemotherapy benefit varied with the combination of recurrence score and age, “with some benefit of chemotherapy found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16 to 25.” Bari Brooks, 58, a patient of Dr. Mayer’s from White House, Tenn., learned from a mammogram that she had breast cancer in 2009 when she was 49. Dr. Mayer told her she was a candidate for chemo, and also for the study — in which she might or might not get chemo. Could she handle the risk of missing out on a treatment that might save her life? Or the risk of side effects that might be needless? “It wasn’t even a decision I had to think about,” said Ms. Brooks, who works in human relations for Vanderbilt University. “It was yes, I want to do it.” She added: “You realize how insignificant everything is. Money, it doesn’t matter how much you have. Work, what projects you have, it doesn’t matter. What have I contributed in my life and what do I want to contribute? This was a situation where I could also contribute. I was honored and grateful to be part of it.” She decided that if she was assigned to chemo, “I would approach it that I was being cleansed rather than poisoned.” She did land in the group that got both chemo and endocrine therapy. Did the chemo help? Maybe, maybe not. She has no regrets. And no evidence of cancer. Dr. Mayer said that Ms. Brooks’ philosophical attitude was not unusual, and that women who signed up for studies understood they were taking a leap of faith and might wind up getting the ‘wrong’ or less desirable treatment. “They’re grateful that they helped to advance knowledge for other women,” Dr. Mayer said. “I never underestimate how nice and how altruistic people can be. Women look out for each other.”",The New York Times
2018,Good News: Gardner Returns. Bad News: Yankees Still Fall to Rays.,"Rays 2, Yankees 1 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Brett Gardner, after returning to the lineup for the first time in a week, had his right knee packed in ice late Friday night. But that wasn’t the only sore spot for the Yankees left fielder. Gardner was peeved after grounding into a game-ending double play that prevented Aaron Judge from coming to the plate and that sealed a 2-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. When Gardner grounded a full-count sinker from Sergio Romo up the middle, shortstop Willy Adames gloved the ball, stepped on second and threw to first, doubling up Gardner for only the fourth time in 274 plate appearances this season. “I hit it right to the one spot where I made two outs with one swing,” Gardner said, shortly before cutting off an interview. “Just frustrated with that last at-bat.” The play punctuated a rare fruitless offensive night for the Yankees — who have uncharacteristically scored just one run in their last 17 innings — and wrapped up a day when most of the Yankees’ activity involved their outfielders. In addition to Gardner’s return from an inflamed knee, Giancarlo Stanton turned in the defensive play of the game — leaping at the wall to steal an extra-base hit from C.J. Cron. And the Yankees received a pregame visit from Jacoby Ellsbury, who is the team’s third-highest-paid player but has yet to play this season. Ellsbury, who lost the starting center fielder’s job to Aaron Hicks last season, arrived in training camp with three years and $68 million remaining on a contract that includes a no-trade clause. At the time, Manager Aaron Boone offered an assessment that was somewhere between prophetic and comedic: “I’m certain if he’s healthy we have a good player.” Not long after that Ellsbury strained his right oblique. Then he was troubled by a sore left hip. Next, he was sidelined by plantar fasciitis in his right heel. The latest malady is tightness in the sacroiliac joint in his lower back, for which he is doing exercises and receiving massages and ice. “Moving ahead in the right direction,” Ellsbury told reporters Friday afternoon after he had worked out at the team’s minor league training complex in Tampa. “I’m excited about it. Hopefully will be playing in some games in the near future.” Asked if Ellsbury might be expected back around the All-Star break or early August, Boone said: “I have no clue.” Asked if there was a spot on the roster for Ellsbury if everyone else was healthy, Boone said: “Maybe. I feel like that’s a good bit down the road to even be considering, and so much can happen between now and then. First things first, we want to get him back doing baseball things, and then you start getting into rehab process and playing in games. And then you start to consider where you’re at and what your needs are.” At the moment, there is no need. Stanton, who has started 39 games in the outfield, has given the Yankees a four-strong rotation with Judge, Hicks and Gardner, who had two singles Friday before the game-ending double play. There has been little room for Clint Frazier, the fifth overall pick of the 2013 draft, who was red-hot at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after recovering from a concussion sustained in spring training. Frazier has been recalled three times this season when the Yankees faced a doubleheader, and has done well with his opportunities since he was called up on Monday — going 4 for 11 in three starts and looking composed at the plate. “I’m viewing it as a fun competition,” said Frazier, who is likely to start on Sunday against the left-hander Blake Snell. “I’m thankful that they’ve given me a third chance to be able to continue to prove myself to be on this roster.” The Yankees could have been a little better on Friday night. Stanton’s catch prevented a bigger inning after the Rays took a 2-0 lead in the fifth, and Adam Warren kept the Yankees within range by winning a tense, 12-pitch at-bat, getting Matt Duffy to ground out to end the sixth with the bases loaded. But after Judge singled in Gleyber Torres in the seventh to cut the deficit to 2-1, Chaz Roe retired Stanton on a tapper to the mound, and the left-hander Jesus Alvarado was summoned to face Didi Gregorius, who grounded out. The ninth began promisingly with a Miguel Andujar single off Romo. After Torres flied out to left, Romo fell behind Gardner by 3-0. Gardner took a strike, and then another on a slider — the only one he saw from Romo — before biting on the sinker. “Maybe looking back, I wish I could have found a way to take it,” Gardner said. Gardner had said earlier that he did not want to get too much into what he was thinking at the plate. But he was asked if he had been handcuffed by the slider — which is Romo’s best pitch, but also the type that Gardner feasts on from right-handers. “Good night, guys,” he said, turning toward his locker.",The New York Times
2018,"Goodbye, Denver Post. Hello, Blockchain.","They left The Denver Post amid newsroom layoffs and interference in the editorial process by the newspaper’s hedge-fund owners. And now those reporters and editors are creating their own news outlet, The Colorado Sun. They will be partnering with the Civil Media Company, an ambitious New York start-up that aims to use blockchain technology and crypto economics to start 1,000 publications nationwide by the end of the year. “It is absolutely exciting,” said Larry Ryckman, a former senior editor at the beleaguered Denver daily, who will serve as the editor of The Colorado Sun. “We have been so eager to get moving.” The editor has assembled a team of former Post employees, including five reporters — Kevin Simpson, John Ingold, Tamara Chuang, Jennifer Brown and Jason Blevins — and two senior editors, Eric Lubbers and Dana Coffield. Mr. Ryckman and Ms. Coffield resigned in May from The Post, which has suffered low morale under the ownership of a New York hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. The company took control of the newspaper in 2013, after acquiring its bankrupt parent company, MediaNews Group, and runs it through a subsidiary, Digital First Media. “None of us wanted to continue dismantling the Denver Post newsroom,” Mr. Ryckman said. Tensions between The Post’s newsroom employees and Alden peaked in April, when the paper published a special Sunday opinion section comprising articles that were critical of ownership. The lead editorial in the section was blunt: “Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom. If Alden isn’t willing to do good journalism here, it should sell The Post to owners who will.” Chuck Plunkett, the editor who oversaw the section and resigned from the paper soon afterward, has agreed to contribute to The Colorado Sun. The new publication will have a conventional website whose data will be written permanently into the secure digital ledger known as the blockchain. Expenses for the fledgling outlet will be covered by a grant from Civil, whose sole investor, for now, is ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based blockchain software technology company founded by the Canadian entrepreneur Joseph Lubin. Mr. Lubin is also a co-founder of the Ethereum, a virtual currency and blockchain database platform. As part of its plan to fund new media entities, Civil plans to unveil a new token this summer called CVL. People who purchase the CVL token, a form of cryptocurrency, will have a say concerning the projects hosted by Civil — meaning that they can vote on whether one of its websites violates the company’s journalism standards, which are outlined in the Civil Constitution. Matthew Iles, the chief executive of Civil, said that by selling ownership stakes to the public, the company seeks to eliminate the possibility of one company or a small group of investors exerting power and influence over a journalistic organization and compromising its mission — exactly what many employees of The Denver Post accused Alden of doing. “We hope that Civil is going to become this publicly owned domain for journalism that anyone who’s interested in the promise of sustainable, independent journalism around the world should be in possession of, to maintain and support it,” Mr. Iles said. The Civil chief executive had his first discussions with Mr. Ryckman in April, a time when Alden had ordered more layoffs at The Post. “It felt good to talk to somebody who was trying to do what felt like the right way to support local journalism in a new funding model,” Mr. Ryckman said. Matt Coolidge, a co-founder and the head of communications for Civil, said the company would not disclose how much of the $1 million it had raised for journalism projects was going to The Sun, but added, “Suffice it to say, we are committed to giving them the support they need to get to sustainability.” Mr. Ryckman said he was looking forward to having some resources to work with as he builds a publication on explanatory journalism, feature stories and investigative articles. “We are not trying to create a mini Denver Post,” he said. “We will break news, but we’re not doing breaking news.” Once the grant money runs out, it will be up to The Colorado Sun to sustain itself. But Mr. Iles is confident that the project will succeed. “When we learned about Larry and what he and his team had in mind for The Colorado Sun, it became obvious that this is a project we needed to support and we needed to partner with, because we believe, ultimately, that terrific journalism is the secret here and not blockchain,” Mr. Iles said. Josh Benson, a co-founder of Old Town Media, which has been advising Civil and will work with The Colorado Sun to build a sustainable newsroom, said of the Sun project: “What they want to do is make something that is independent, incredibly useful, long-term sustainable, possibly a model for other things, ruthlessly correct — all the things you want a first-tier news organization to be.” By the end of June, Civil will have started 13 newsrooms throughout the country. “My hope,” Mr. Iles said, “is that people will see The Colorado Sun as the tip of the iceberg.” He added, “I’d like to think that, if your local news organization is struggling, or if you believe that independent journalism is important, but you don’t yet really know what to do about, I’d like you to see how Civil can be home for ideas. “I want newsrooms around the world,” he said, “to see The Colorado Sun as a leader in that regard.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified Ethereum.

2018,"Goodbye, Swimsuit Competition. Hello, ‘Miss America 2.0.’","Fifty years ago, the swimsuit-wearing beauties of the Miss America pageant were confronted with a spectacle on the Atlantic City boardwalk: 100 feminists throwing bras, girdles, curling irons, false eyelashes and other “instruments of female torture” into a trash can labeled “Freedom.” The protesters had planned to set the can on fire but could not get the right permits — so, alas, no bras were burned that summer day, though it is the origin of the term “bra burning.” They were condemning what even then they saw as an antiquated institution, which had mostly male judges scrutinize women’s bodies, women of color at one point not allowed to compete, corporations profiting on the event, and three in four American households watching it all happen on television. “Everybody tuned into Miss America back then — this was like the Oscars,” said the author Alix Kates Shulman, 85, one of the organizers of that 1968 protest. Fifty years later, it appears that #MeToo has done what a protest could not: eradicate one of the most derided aspects of the competition, the swimsuit. The Miss America Organization — whose chief executive resigned in December over lewd emails and whose new chairwoman, Gretchen Carlson, once sued Fox News for sexual harassment — on Tuesday announced it would scrap both the swimsuit and evening gown portion of the competition, replacing them with “a live interactive session with the judges” in which a contestant “will highlight her achievements and goals in life.” Ms. Carlson, the 1989 Miss America, said in an interview that her aim was to “make the event more inclusive” and described it as a “competition,” not a “pageant.” The organization’s new motto is “To prepare great women for the world, and to prepare the world for great women.” And its website indicated a broad rebranding effort: “Miss America 2.0. Coming soon: New website. New show. New experience.” [The Miss America competition will focus more on the contestants’ talents, intelligence and ideas.] The changes will take effect at the national finals, again in Atlantic City, in September. State and local competitions will follow suit after that, but they are likely to continue including swimsuits during the current season. Ms. Carlson said the decision was made in March by a unanimous vote from the organization’s leadership committee. This, of course, is Miss America’s new leadership committee, the one appointed after chief executive Sam Haskell was ousted and replaced by a woman, and a new board was reappointed. Seven of the nine board members are women. “Listen, I’ve talked to tons of young people who’ve said to me, ‘I’d love to be a part of that program, but I don’t want to parade around in a swimsuit,’” Ms. Carlson said. “I get it.” “From the moment I had to put one on and compete, I knew I wasn’t going to be the winner of the swimsuit competition,” she added. “I’m 5-3 and have struggled with my weight my whole life. I’m not a model. But it was 10 percent of my points. This was something that I was thinking about 30 years ago.” [For more discussion of women and gender, subscribe to Gender Letter, a new newsletter, or follow @nytgender on Instagram.] Miss America has long touted itself as much more than a beauty pageant. (Anyone seen “Miss Congeniality”?) Contestants take part in community service, and the organization said it awarded more than $2 million in scholarships last year. But swimsuits have for at least as long defined the pageant — and been at the heart of the debate over its place in American culture. “Speaking for myself, when I competed 20 years ago, I found the swimsuit competition oddly empowering, because once I could walk across the stage in a two-piece swimsuit and high heels I could do just about anything,” said Kate Shindle, the 1998 Miss America who is now a board member of the organization. “But I also don’t think I processed everything at the time. It’s strange — it gives strangers a kind of ownership over your body that you don’t quite anticipate.” The Miss America competition began in Atlantic City in 1921 — one year after women gained the right to vote in the United States — as a way to extend the summer tourist season beyond Labor Day. It “was, literally, about the use of women’s bodies to sell a product — or a place,” the author Jennifer Weiner recently wrote in a column in The New York Times. At the time, it was not only rare to see a woman in a swimsuit in public, it was barred — and so the event, with eight contestants, required the temporary suspension of a ban on revealing beachwear. It was all beauty pageant until 1936, when a talent portion was added. The competition was limited to never-married women ages 18 to 28, and for a time, until 1940, it was written in the guidelines that they must be “of good health and of the white race.” The organization would not have its first African-American winner until Vanessa Williams earned the 1984 crown. “The Miss America state and national process was — and maybe still is — the single largest source of scholarship money for women in the U.S., yet the crucial requirements were physical, not intellectual,” the author and feminist Gloria Steinem said in an interview on Tuesday. “If the same were true for men, people would be saying, ‘No wonder China is winning!’” “It’s not just the bathing suits, it’s physical appearance, irrelevant talents and, until very recently, being white,” Ms. Steinem added. “It’s also less about being unique than conformist.” In 1950, the pageant winner Yolande Betbeze was among the first to break the mold, causing a ruckus when she refused to pose in a swimsuit during her reign. (“I was an opera student and didn’t have good legs,” she explained at the time.) In 1992, Catherine Ann Lemkau, a runner-up, announced that she would like to see the swimsuit competition eliminated. And in 1995, Miss America encouraged its viewers to call a 1-900 number to say whether swimsuits should be scrapped: two out of three said no. “We are not stupid,” Leonard Horn, then the organization’s chief executive, said in 1993. “We are very sensitive to the fact that the swimsuit competition has always been our Achilles’ heel. The swimsuit competition has been controversial since the early 1920s, but it’s been retained because the majority of the people like it.” Appearing on ABC News to announce the change on Tuesday, Ms. Carlson declared, “We are not going to judge you on your outward appearance.” But it is hard to imagine what Miss America would be without conventional beauty standards at its core. [Read more: Miss America appointed women to top positions months after a scandal.] The 2017 Judges’ Manual lists the qualities and attributes required of titleholders, in this order: “beautiful, well-spoken, intelligent, talented, able to relate to young people, reflective of women her age (she should not be a 35-year-old trapped inside a 20-year-old body), charismatic, dynamic/energetic — that ‘IT’ quality that is so hard to define, mature enough to handle the job and all of its responsibilities, comfortable ‘in her own skin,’ manageable, punctual and flexible.” “The American public has an expectation that she will be beautiful and physically fit,” the manual continues. “This is the same expectation they have for all of their celebrities, from music and film to sports, and Miss America is no exception. You must look at her physical beauty as well as her physical fitness.” Margot Mifflin, an English professor who is writing a cultural history of the pageant, wrote recently in The Washington Post that Miss America “has always been deeply invested in protecting the status quo in the face of women’s progress.” “No amount of tweaking over the decades, from adding scholarships to mandating philanthropy, could obscure its bottom line,” she said. “Regardless of how smart or talented a woman is, she’s a loser without the one thing she can’t control or achieve: beauty.” Tuesday’s announcement was quickly added to the lengthy list of stunning changes that have reverberated through Hollywood, politics and workplaces around the world in the wake of #MeToo. It was a ripple effect, so to speak — one that expanded the conversation from sexual harassment to the larger way that women’s bodies are viewed and consumed. Still, it seemed like a small step to some. “If Miss America wants to get out of the sexism game, it should probably end Miss America,” the writer Jill Filipovic posted on Twitter. “Sure, it’s a relatively good thing that in 2018 this organization has realized it’s dehumanizing to compare and judge women’s bodies in front of a vast, international audience,” said Julie Zeilinger, the founder of a feminist blog called FBomb. “But when Gretchen Carlson says we are ‘not going to judge you on your outward appearance,’ the implication is that the competition will still judge women — just not by measures of blatant physical objectification.” As for the women who threw bras and girdles into the garbage can on the Atlantic City boardwalk a half-century ago — and then infiltrated the event itself, draping a giant bedsheet from the balcony that read “Women’s Liberation” — they watched with wonder, and a healthy dose of skepticism. [Read a New York Times article from 1968 about the protest.] “What can I say?” said one of them, Robin Morgan, the author of more than 20 books of poetry and nonfiction, including the 1970 anthology “Sisterhood Is Powerful.” “After 50 years, this is a start.”",The New York Times
2018,Google Is in Europe’s Cross Hairs Again: DealBook Briefing,"Good Wednesday. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) Here’s what we’re watching: • The odds of Athenahealth getting sold just got much higher. • Alexander Nix, the former Cambridge Analytica C.E.O., just got grilled by British lawmakers. • Google’s annual shareholder meeting, where the company’s workplace diversity efforts will come under scrutiny. • ZTE’s rescue may come soon, but what will the U.S. get in return? • The Disney-Comcast battle comes to Britain. Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s antitrust chief, has made it clear that Europe will be one of the tech industry’s biggest regulators. The FT’s reported that her commission plans to fine Google over the dominance of its Android mobile operating system, underscoring that point yet again. More from Rochelle Toplensky of the FT: A penalty is expected in the Android case, but its size is unclear. The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn — which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google’s parent company Alphabet — but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range. The decision will mark an escalation of the commission’s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a €2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google’s business. The issue with Android As the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android. The bigger picture Google has been in the sights of the E.U. for some time. Last year, Ms. Vestager’s commission levied a record $2.7 billion fine over the company’s shopping comparison service. That didn’t do much to dent Google’s core businesses, but the Android case might be a different matter. But in pursuing a business so core to Google’s future, Ms. Vestager is again taking bold action against one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful titans. (Remember that she ordered Ireland to reclaim more than $15 billion in back taxes from Apple.) One last question: Will investors care? So far, shares in Google’s parent, Alphabet, were down less than 1 percent after the FT story was published. Its market value: almost $789 billion. — Michael de la Merced The electronic medical records company just ousted its C.E.O., Jonathan Bush, after a series of new revelations came to light about allegations made against him over inappropriate behavior at the workplace and domestic abuse. When a company undergoes a changeover in its leadership, that often raises the chances of it ultimately selling itself — especially when an activist investor like Elliott Management is knocking on the door, as it is here. (Elliott has offered to buy the company for about $6.9 billion, including debt.) Some shareholders, like Clearbridge Investments, have urged the company to start exploring “strategic alternatives.” Athenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday: To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership. The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth’s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home. • The Daily Mail reported that the executive had been accused of punching his then-wife as part of a 2006 custody battle. Mr. Bush told the publication, “‘I take complete responsibility for all these regrettable incidents involving my dear former wife.” • Bloomberg reported on other allegations, including a 2009 complaint by an Athenahealth employee who described a “sexually hostile environment” at the company. In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit: “I believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country – these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it’s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.” What happens now Athenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale. In the meantime, Mr. Immelt — the former G.E. chief who joined the company in February, and whose entrance Mr. Bush told me was like scoring “a decade’s worth of guitar lessons from Elvis” — became executive chairman. Marc Levine, the company’s C.F.O., is taking a more hands-on role in daily operations. Elliott’s response to the news From a spokesman: “Elliott welcomes the Board’s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth’s shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the company’s strategic exploration process.” — Michael J. de la Merced Members of the British government’s digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didn’t seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O. Things didn’t start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide “few clarifications” about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn’t. Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing: Did Mr. Nix take $8 million from the consulting firm before it collapsed, as the FT reported this morning? “The allegation is false, the facts are not correct.” What about reports that suggested that Cambridge Analytica removed items from its offices, before the British government’s Information Commissioner’s Office searched the premises? “Those boxes were not ours. As far as I’m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.” Did Cambridge Analytica techniques such as bribery, honey traps and extortion to help nations win elections, as Mr. Nix claimed in secret recording made by the British broadcaster Channel 4? “I didn’t represent the company properly, I didn’t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.” Did Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica’s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users. “It was my firm impression that Mr. Collins’ questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data… so I answered no.” “When I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.” “I also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook’s request.” How useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company’s work in the U.S.? “That data was less useful than simply using Facebook’s own advertising algorithms.” — Jamie Condliffe An NYT investigation shows that the Chinese hardware manufacturer Huawei, which has a cozy relationship with Beijing, was one of four Chinese companies that Facebook gave access to its users’ personal data. More from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance: Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends — including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status. According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies’ servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will “look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.” Elsewhere in Facebook news: A new Apple privacy feature will let Safari users block tracking by “like” buttons. Inside the ugly breakup between Facebook and the two founders of WhatsApp. And the NYT Editorial Board asks: Can Facebook be cut down to size? Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau’s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies. By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week. Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group. The consumer advisory board’s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard. The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly. Access to high-quality data underpins most of the recent successes in artificial intelligence, as the software is trained to identify patterns by studying huge quantities of historical information, whether its images, text or something else entirely. Now, MIT Technology Review reports that Michael Kratsios, President Trump’s chief technology adviser, has vowed to help the research community by releasing information to it: “Anything that we can do to unlock government data, we’re committed to. We’d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.” That’s a small, but nevertheless welcome, promise from an administration that has received criticism for placing too little importance on encouraging the development of A.I. America’s A.I. policy: While Mr. Trump’s administration did promise earlier this year to ensure that America remains the world leader in artificial intelligence, the president himself has often been quiet on the topic. That’s perhaps not too surprising. Along with robotics, A.I. is part of the automation trend that could erode many jobs in America — so encouraging its development could be seen as running contra to Mr. Trump’s election pledges. So far, a big part of the administration’s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it’s increased investment in R.&D. for “A.I. and related technologies” by more than 40 percent since 2015 — though it’s not clear what those “related technologies” are. Other nations are making A.I. pushes: Countries such as Britain and France have published ambitious A.I. policies that put in place funding, education, and governance initiatives. Large American tech firms are setting up bases there, where a lot of their fundamental A.I. research takes place. Facebook has a large lab in Paris, for instance, and Google’s DeepMind is based in London. China and Russia have also been outspoken in their desire to be dominant powers in artificial intelligence. In fact, China is already giving America a run for its A.I money: It published more patents and academic articles relating to the technology than the U.S. did in 2017. A big problem for America: Such enthusiasm about A.I. overseas is already luring academics away from the U.S. Most notably, Geoffrey Hinton, an early pioneer of machine learning, has relocated to Toronto to run a Google research center. Other high-profile academics could follow his lead, and Mr. Trump’s immigration rules might make it harder for foreign talent to replace them. Maintaining an edge in artificial intelligence will be incredibly valuable for America. The direct benefits to the economy are huge, if difficult to accurately predict. And the technology is more important than just that, as it will form a huge part of the nation’s military and security operations over the coming years (just ask Google). But until the Trump administration starts making more noise — and bigger policy moves — about A.I. being a priority, it runs the risk of losing first place in the race. — Jamie Condliffe The White House and Beijing are said to be near a deal to save ZTE, one in which the embattled Chinese telecom company would pay a fine of more than $1.4 billion. But it isn’t apparent what else the U.S. would get for pardoning a company that Washington views as an arm of Beijing. Lawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer were infuriated: Many commentators reckon the ZTE talks are aimed at wringing trade concessions from China, though the Trump administration insists otherwise. And China has reportedly offered to buy $70 billion worth of agricultural, energy and industrial products if the U.S. drops its threat of tariffs. But some people in the administration doubt that proposal. Elsewhere in trade • Mexico imposed $3 billion worth of tariffs on American goods like pork and cheese in response to Mr. Trump’s tariff on imported metals. • As the Nafta talks sputter, the White House is seeking separate trade deals with Canada and Mexico. • Senator Bob Corker wants Congress to have the power to block tariffs.

The U.K. government has cleared 21st Century Fox to bid for full control of the satellite broadcaster — so long as it sells Sky News to Disney, or someone else. But something bigger is at work. Comcast is also challenging Disney’s $52.4 billion bid for most of Fox, which includes 39 percent of Sky. (Got all that?) If Comcast could buy the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn’t already own, it would be a considerable blow to the Disney deal. Oh, and Comcast is expected to fight hard for the other Fox assets that Disney wants, too. The only sure winners?

2018,Google Promises Its A.I. Will Not Be Used for Weapons,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google, reeling from an employee protest over the use of artificial intelligence for military purposes, said Thursday that it would not use A.I. for weapons or for surveillance that violates human rights. But it will continue to work with governments and the military. The new rules were part of a set of principles Google unveiled relating to the use of artificial intelligence. In a company blog post, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, laid out seven objectives for its A.I. technology, including “avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias” and “be socially beneficial.” Google also detailed applications of the technology that the company will not pursue, including A.I. for “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people” and “technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.” But Google said it would continue to work with governments and military using A.I. in areas including cybersecurity, training and military recruitment. “We recognize that such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about its use. How A.I. is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,” Mr. Pichai wrote. Concern over the potential uses of artificial intelligence bubbled over at Google when the company secured a contract to work on the Pentagon’s Project Maven program, which uses A.I. to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes. More than 4,000 Google employees signed a petition protesting the contract, and a handful of employees resigned. In response, Google said it would not seek to renew the Maven contract when it expired next year and pledged to draft a set of guidelines for appropriates uses of A.I. Mr. Pichai did not address the Maven program or the pressure from employees. It’s not clear whether these guidelines would have precluded Google from pursuing the Maven contract, since the company has insisted repeatedly that its work for the Pentagon was not for “offensive purposes.” Google has bet its future on artificial intelligence, and company executives believe the technology could have an impact comparable to the development of the internet. Google promotes the benefits of artificial intelligence for tasks like early diagnosis of diseases and the reduction of spam in email. But it has also experienced some of the perils associated with A.I., including YouTube recommendations pushing users to extremist videos or Google Photos image-recognition software categorizing black people as gorillas. While most of Google’s A.I. guidelines are unsurprising for a company that prides itself on altruistic goals, it also included a noteworthy rule about how its technology could be shared outside the company. “We will reserve the right to prevent or stop uses of our technology if we become aware of uses that are inconsistent with these principles,” the company said. Like most of the top corporate A.I. labs, which are laden with former and current academics, Google openly publishes much of its A.I. research. That means others can recreate and reuse many of its methods and ideas. But Google is joining other labs in saying it may hold back certain research if it believes others will misuse it. DeepMind, a top A.I. lab owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is considering whether it should refrain from publishing certain research because it may be dangerous.

2018,Google Will Not Renew Pentagon Contract That Upset Employees,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google, hoping to head off a rebellion by employees upset that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes, will not renew a contract with the Pentagon for artificial intelligence work when a current deal expires next year. Diane Greene, who is the head of the Google Cloud business that won a contract with the Pentagon’s Project Maven, said during a weekly meeting with employees on Friday that the company was backing away from its A.I. work with the military, according to a person familiar with the discussion but not permitted to speak publicly about it. Google’s work with the Defense Department on the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, roiled the internet giant’s work force. Many of the company’s top A.I. researchers, in particular, worried that the contract was the first step toward using the nascent technology in advanced weapons. But it is not unusual for Silicon Valley’s big companies to have deep military ties. And the internal dissent over Maven stands in contrast to Google’s biggest competitors for selling cloud-computing services — Amazon.com and Microsoft — which have aggressively pursued Pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees. Google’s self-image is different — it once had a motto of “don’t be evil.” A number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles, even as its business-minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the Defense Department. About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding “a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” A handful of employees also resigned in protest, while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the Maven contract. Months before it became public, senior Google officials were worried about how the Maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company, The New York Times reported this week. By courting business with the Pentagon, they risked angering a number of the company’s highly regarded A.I. researchers, who had vowed that their work would not become militarized. Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had reached out to tech companies and sought their support and cooperation as the Pentagon makes artificial intelligence a centerpiece of its weapons strategy. The decision made by Google on Friday is a setback to that outreach. But if Google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry, the Pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. Ms. Greene’s comments were reported earlier by Gizmodo. The money for Google in the Project Maven contract was never large by the standards of a company with revenue of $110 billion last year — $9 million, one official told employees, or a possible $15 million over 18 months, according to an internal email. But some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road. In an email last September, a Google official in Washington told colleagues she expected Maven to grow into a $250 million-a-year project, and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more; notably a multiyear, multibillion-dollar cloud computing project called JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. Whether Google’s Maven decision is a short-term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects a more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear. The question of whether a particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have a simple answer. When the Maven work came under fire inside Google, company officials asserted that it was not “offensive” in nature. But Maven is using the company’s artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones, and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots. Google management had told employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting. At Friday’s meeting, Ms. Greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week. Google has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect Google’s pursuit of the JEDI contract. Defense Department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire JEDI contract, which could extend for 10 years, to a single vendor. This week, officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down. Dana White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said this week that the JEDI contract had drawn “incredible interest” and more than 1,000 responses to a draft request for proposals. But she said officials wanted to take their time. ”So, we are working on it, but it’s important that we don’t rush toward failure,” Ms. White said. “This is different for us. We have a lot more players in it. This is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have a great deal of commercial interest.” Ms. Greene said the company probably would not have sought the Maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism, according to notes on Ms. Greene’s remarks taken by a Google employee and shared with The Times. Another person who watched the meeting added that Ms. Greene said Maven had been “terrible for Google” and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when Google was more aggressively going after military work. Google does other, more innocuous business with the Pentagon, including military advertising on Google properties and Google’s ad platform, as well as providing web apps like email. Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who was openly critical of the Maven work, wrote on Twitter that she was “incredibly happy about this decision, and have a deep respect for the many people who worked and risked to make it happen. Google should not be in the business of war.” Even though the internal protest has carried on for months, there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down. Earlier this week, one Google engineer — on the company’s internal message boards — proposed the idea of employees protesting Google Cloud’s conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in July with a campaign called “Occupy Moscone Center,” fashioned after the Occupy Wall Street protests. That engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of Maven and planned for Friday to be his last day. But he said he was told on Friday morning to leave immediately, according to an email viewed by The Times. Peter W. Singer, who studies war and technology at New America, a Washington research group, said many of the tools the Pentagon was seeking were “neither inherently military nor inherently civilian.” He added, “This is not cannons and ballistic missiles.” The same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast-food restaurants or movements on a factory floor. Mr. Singer also said he thought Google employees who denounced Maven were somewhat naïve, because Google’s search engine and the video platform of its YouTube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries, as well as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. “They may want to act like they’re not in the business of war, but the business of war long ago came to them,” said Mr. Singer, author of a book examining such issues called “LikeWar,” scheduled for publication in the fall.",The New York Times
2018,"Google, Rebuilding Its Presence in China, Invests in Retailer JD.com","BEIJING — Google’s best-known products have been blocked by the authorities in mainland China for years. If the American internet giant wants that to change someday, then half a billion dollars’ worth of good will couldn’t hurt. Google will invest $550 million in the Chinese online retailer JD.com, the two companies said on Monday. In return, JD.com will join the Google Shopping advertising platform, and will work with the Silicon Valley company on other e-commerce projects in Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States. The companies did not provide details of the projects. According to a JD.com spokesman, the deal will give Google less than 1 percent of the Chinese retailer’s shares, which trade on the Nasdaq. Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, deciding that it would no longer censor its own search results as required by Beijing. But lately, the company has been looking for other ways to serve the planet’s largest population of internet users. It opened a research center in China dedicated to artificial intelligence and signed an agreement with Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, that will allow the two businesses to work together without fear of patent lawsuits. It made an app version of its translation service available to users in China last year. More recently, it released a Chinese version of an app that helps people manage their files. (Google’s own app store, like its email service, remains inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country’s system of internet controls is known.) The company never quit China entirely, despite its travails. It has hundreds of employees working on research and product development in the country, which has become a major fount of engineering and scientific talent. Its online advertising business helps Chinese companies reach customers overseas. Still, mounting a broader return to the Chinese market would not be easy for Google, even if the authorities were to permit it. In the eight years since the company withdrew from China, local rivals have created formidable products in many areas in which it competes, including search, chat, video streaming and cloud computing. JD.com, meanwhile, is apparently hoping that Google’s global reach will help it sell more products internationally. The company already counts Walmart as a major shareholder. It has extended its reach into Southeast Asia, setting up a local retail business in Indonesia, becoming a partner on an e-commerce venture in Thailand and backing another one in Vietnam. Across the world, however, JD.com will face tough competition. Alibaba, the Chinese internet behemoth, has poured billions of dollars into its Southeast Asian shopping site, Lazada, and is strengthening its logistics capabilities in that region, Europe and the Middle East.",The New York Times
2018,"Google’s Diversity Efforts, Charted","Four years ago, Google became one of the first technology companies to release a race and gender breakdown of its work force. Thursday, Google released its latest diversity report. It revealed that the company’s staff remains largely white or Asian and decidedly male. DealBook decided to chart some of the data to see how things are changing — or not, as the case may be. Google has a lower percentage of white employees than the national average, and a much bigger share of Asian workers. Latinos and black people are underrepresented in Google’s work force. Facebook has a similar dynamic. By comparison, General Motors is more representative of the makeup of the United States. The percentage of Asian workers at Google has increased over the past four years — from 30 percent in 2014 to 36.3 percent this year. The proportion of white workers fell by 8 percentage points over the same period. Over the past four years, the percentage of black and Latino employees is up 0.7 and 0.6 percentage point. Over the past year, they are both up 0.1 percentage point, to 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent. The problem isn’t just in hiring. For the first time, Google has released attrition rates for it work force. Attrition is highest among black and Latino staff and lowest among Asian employees. To that point, Google said in a statement that “to improve work force representation we must focus not only on hiring, but also on developing, progressing, and retaining members of underrepresented employees, and creating an inclusive culture.” Compared with the entire United States population, which skews slightly female, Google is much more male: Over two-thirds of its staff in 2018 are men. The percentage of women on Google’s staff rose to 30.9 percent this year from 30.6 in 2014 — suggesting that the company is still finding it hard to reach gender parity. The percentage of technical roles at Google held by women has risen to 21.4 percent in 2018 from 16.6 percent in 2014, but, again, it still has a long way to achieve gender parity. “Despite significant effort, and some pockets of success, we need to do more to achieve our desired diversity and inclusion outcomes,” wrote Danielle Brown, Google’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, in a statement issued along with the report. “If we want a better outcome, we need to evolve our approach.” Lawsuits have accused Google of doing both too much and not enough to improve diversity in its work force. The latest figures suggest that even if its efforts are felt to be overblown by some people, they don’t appear to be having a huge impact on overall numbers.",The New York Times
2018,Google’s JD.com Deal Shows Silicon Valley Still Wants In on China,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.________ For Google, a half a billion dollars is a drop in the bucket. But that money could have an outsize impact on the American tech giant’s ability to re-enter China. Google said Monday that it would invest $550 million in JD.com, one of China’s biggest e-commerce companies. The investment was a reminder that China, with all its promise, has been largely closed off to American tech giants, thanks to government censorship and fierce competition from homegrown rivals like Alibaba. That doesn’t mean that Silicon Valley moguls have abandoned hopes of building up their Chinese presences. Here’s where some of the top tech companies stand with their forays into China. The company pulled its search services from mainland China in 2010, and its other important businesses have been hobbled. Android, for example, is the most popular mobile operating system in China, but Google services are stripped out for Chinese users. As part of the JD.com investment, the Chinese online retailer will promote products on the Google Shopping platform. The company also has other business lines in that country: • A patent licensing partnership with Tencent, one of China’s biggest internet companies. • An A.I. lab in Beijing, a nod to China’s rapidly growing strength in the field. • Investments in start-ups like Chushou, a Chinese equivalent to the Twitch video game streaming site, and XtalPi, a biotechnology company. • A small set of apps, like ones for file management and language translation. China has blocked the social network in the mainland since 2009. But that hasn’t stopped the company from trying to re-establish beachheads in the country, including with a much-ballyhooed visit by Mark Zuckerberg in 2016, where he demonstrated his Mandarin speaking skills. Late last year, though, the executive who had led much of Facebook’s inroads into China left the company. For now, here’s what Facebook has going in the country: • A partnership with Xiaomi, the electronics maker, on creating virtual reality headsets for its Oculus platform. (Facebook knows Xiaomi well: The current head of Oculus, Hugo Barra, came over from the Chinese start-up.) • Facebook released Colorful Balloons, a photo-sharing app similar to Facebook’s Moments, through a separate local company. (Colorful Balloons reportedly sank soon after its unveiling.) • Though Facebook doesn’t operate in China, it remains an important market for ad spending, with advertising from Chinese companies and — somewhat surprisingly — local governments and state news media appearing on the social network to reach international audiences. Unlike its internet-based rivals, Apple is free to sell its products and services in China, from iPhones to music streaming. With 41 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, there is arguably no American company in China as successful. But it has often found itself trying to strike a delicate balancing act, especially as the United States and China spar over trade. At times, Apple has complied with government demands, like removing apps that help Chinese users skirt censorship laws or opening a local data center in partnership with a local company. Here’s one explanation why: • China is the second-largest market for Apple, contributing 20 percent of overall sales. In Apple’s most recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the company reported $44 billion in net sales within China. (That figure was down from the previous year, thanks to lower iPhone sales.) The company isn’t blocked in China. (Like Apple, it has sometimes bowed to Chinese government censors.) Its business just isn’t very big, dwarfed by Chinese rivals like Alibaba. Amazon has put more money and attention on other emerging markets, especially India. That helps explain why it challenged Walmart over control of Flipkart, the India e-commerce company. But it hasn’t given up on doing business in China: • Its Prime shopping service was introduced in China in 2016. • China-specific versions of Kindles debuted last year. • Amazon’s cloud services offering, known as Amazon Web Services, remains a huge, promising business. But the company has had to sell some physical assets to its local partner to comply with Beijing rules. Ultimately, though, it appears Amazon’s ambitions for China are limited, given that the company has opened an outlet on Alibaba’s Tmall platform and run Kindle promotions across its Chinese rival’s services.",The New York Times
2018,"Gordon M. Ambach, New York Education Chief in ’80s, Dies at 83","Gordon M. Ambach, who, as the New York State education commissioner in the 1980s, drafted what were then the nation’s most demanding academic standards for high school graduation, died on May 25 at his home in New Haven. He was 83. The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Kenneth said. Mr. Ambach developed a reputation for meticulousness during his 10 years as education commissioner, from 1977 to 1987, and later as the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers in Washington. As head of that group he helped preserve the federal Department of Education by lobbying against a Republican campaign in Congress to abolish it. Diane Ravitch, the education historian, said in an email that Mr. Ambach had been “greatly respected for his common sense and wisdom.” The centerpiece of Mr. Ambach’s tenure in Albany was his pivotal role in persuading the state Board of Regents in 1984 to approve a new set of academic standards as put forth in an Action Plan, which he had been instrumental in drafting. It built on minimum competency tests for students that had been introduced in the mid-1970s. In an analysis produced in 2009, Carol Siri Johnson, a professor in the humanities department of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, called the plan “the first official step toward a universal academic curriculum for all students” — one that “made universal competency in all academic subjects required, rather than optional.” The requirements included two years of science and math instead of one, four years of social studies instead of three, and, for the first time, a foreign language requirement. Moreover, the plan also called for periodic performance reviews of teachers and individual schools, letting educators, elected officials and parents measure one school’s performance against another’s and compare richer and poorer districts. A booming economy and a national focus on failing schools generated political support for the proposals. But the Regents rejected as too costly Mr. Ambach’s call for a longer school day and an extended school year. In an article in the Peabody Journal of Education in 1986, Donald H. Layton, of the State University of New York, Albany, wrote, “The Action Plan’s architects realized that in order to capitalize fully on the widespread national interest in education and the likelihood of increased financial support for educational initiatives, a comprehensive approach to reform not only made good educational sense but good political sense as well.” “In retrospect,” he added, “this strategy seems to have been sound.” Gordon MacKay Ambach was born on Nov. 10, 1934, in Providence, R.I., to Russell Ambach, an engineer, and Ethel (Repass) Ambach, a teacher and school administrator. He graduated from Yale in 1956 with a bachelor’s degree in American studies and earned a master’s in teaching and an advanced certificate in education administration from Harvard. Mr. Ambach taught history to seventh and eighth graders at the Wheatley School in East Williston on Long Island for three years, then served in education jobs in Washington and Boston before joining the New York State Education Department in 1967. He retired from the Council of Chief State School Officers in 2001. In addition to his son Kenneth, he is survived by his wife, the former Lucy Emory; another son, Douglas; a daughter, Alison Illick; and 10 grandchildren.",The New York Times
2018,Got a Reluctant Reader at Home?,"Match Book Dear Match Book, I am looking for suggestions for my 13-year-old son, a reluctant reader. His two older sisters were dismayed when he refused to read beyond the second book in the Harry Potter series. His main interests are sports (he is obsessed with sneakers and basketball) and TV comedies like “Arrested Development” and “The Office.” He seems to gravitate toward zany humor. He doesn’t mind reading for school, but does not normally read for pleasure — though he likes Mike Lupica and Carl Hiaasen. Last year I made him read “Bridge to Terabithia,” by Katherine Paterson. His response? “Well, that was depressing!” He’s a great kid and I would love to see him develop a love for reading. KATE MAYBERRY PITTSBURGH Dear Kate, Some kids look forward to filling summer’s idle hours with books. But plenty of others see all those unscheduled days as freedom from reading. When those two kinds of people cohabitate, divergent family vacations will follow. As much as we want to bring the two types together and share our most cherished titles with our kids, I know from experience how this scenario can sour. One reader in my own family does not think that “The Westing Game,” by Ellen Raskin, and “The House With a Clock in Its Walls,” by John Bellairs, are works of genius. That person is wrong, though I admit that his favorites have broadened my tastes. Picture This Most notably, my kids have sparked my appreciation for graphic novels. Ask your son to try Raina Telgemeier’s work, especially her warmly comic theater-oriented novel “Drama,” and a house-favorite anthology of illustrated Native American tales called “Trickster,” compiled and edited by Matt Dembicki: The most slyly funny tales in the bunch will appeal to your son’s comedic sensibilities. He Shoots, He Scores Stacks of modern sports books for kids put nuance in play in the traditionally plot-rich genre. In Kwame Alexander’s psychologically astute novels in verse, it’s the language that makes the action move. Lines of text dart down the page in the Newbery Medal-winning “The Crossover,” a novel about basketball and family. And in “Booked,” the story of a word-bedeviled soccer star whose father is a linguistics professor, the clever turns of phrase will hook anyone accustomed to watching rapid-fire TV dialogue. Then there are the high-stakes basketball stories of Walter Dean Myers, including “Slam!,” “Hoops” and “Game,” and Matt de la Peña’s gritty debut novel, “Ball Don’t Lie.” The books’ heroes play hard, to escape desperate economic and family circumstances. One more shot before the buzzer: You can find “Black Holes and Basketball Sneakers,” Lori Aurelia Williams’s story about childhood deprivation and the hazards of sneaker lust, among the other engaging shorts in “13: Thirteen Stories That Capture the Agony and Ecstasy of Being Thirteen,” edited by James Howe. Funny Business Finding the right book of comedy may be trickier given the incongruity between your son’s youth and his more grown-up tastes. Start with two age-appropriate classics: Roald Dahl’s autobiography, “Boy,” is just as hilarious and gruesome as his treasured novels; and Norton Juster’s punning and playful “The Phantom Tollbooth” appeals to the adolescent’s sense of the absurd. I think he will fall fast for two adult comedy books, though you’ll have to vet the more mature (and immature) content first. An underage element figures into Judd Apatow’s “Sick in the Head”: He conducted eight of the book’s more than three dozen remarkably open interviews with comedians — including those with Jerry Seinfeld and Sandra Bernhard — while he was in high school. In his autobiographical collection “Naked,” David Sedaris’s essay about his childhood bouts with obsessive-compulsive disorder, “A Plague of Tics” — full of artfully told humiliation and family banter — reminded me that listening to the author’s own drolly narrated audio version of the book would link reading to your son’s interest in comedic performance. Turn the Page One last suggestion is more about technique than text. My kids have a glancing interest in the “Choose Your Own Adventure” series, originally published between 1979 and 1998, and still in circulation today from Chooseco. Each installment is narrated in the second person and allows readers to guide the course of the decision-tree tales at critical plot points. But the structure led my family to a new kind of interactive storytelling: They trade tales on car trips, and I use the style as a narrative crutch at bedtime when I am out of ideas in the dark. If you can coax your son into telling his own stories, maybe he’ll open up to books. Yours truly, Match Book Do you need book recommendations? Write to matchbook@nytimes.com.

2018,Governments Explore Using Blockchains to Improve Service,"If you buy a house in Chicago and want to register the deed, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds will accept two kinds of submissions: paper records and scanned images of paper records. No matter which option you choose, the clerks will manually type the information into the county database. Roughly once a week, someone — for example, an addict claiming a home that actually belongs to a grandparent with dementia — will mail in a fake document, and “if they formatted it correctly, we have to record it,” said John Mirkovic, the deputy recorder. “It’s one of the main reasons we’re so interested in blockchain.” Blockchain is a data structure popularized by the digital currency Bitcoin. It’s also one of the biggest buzzwords in Silicon Valley, finance and government, where proponents say it can save money and increase trust in public institutions. In 2017, more than 200 government agencies around the world, including the Department of Homeland Security, were exploring the use of blockchain, according to the Blockchain in Government Tracker compiled by the Illinois Blockchain Initiative. Britain’s National Archives is testing it for storing digital records. Australia is building a prototype system for welfare payments. Estonia is using it to secure health records, court files and wills. Dubai aims to become “the first blockchain-powered government,” weaving the technology into many vital systems. [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here’s what you need to know.] “We’re throwing a lot of things at the wall right now and seeing what will stick,” said Andrew Young, knowledge director at New York University’s GovLab. The term blockchain was first used to describe the public record that exists for every transaction on the Bitcoin network, copies of which are kept by thousands of entities around the world. Now it’s used to describe a wide range of systems that incorporate cryptography or decentralized data storage. “I think it’s important to make clear that there is no one ‘blockchain,’” said Stefaan Verhulst, the co-founder of GovLab. “What we see right now is massive experimentation in different versions of blockchain technologies that provide for different results.” In theory, blockchain can save money and reduce errors by replacing workers, while adding accountability by generating a public record of all activity. This has even greater implications for countries with low trust in government, said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who specializes in distributed systems. “If you look at a government system that is opaque, that’s closed behind doors, versus one where I can inspect what’s going on behind it, it’s an amazing leap forward,” Mr. Sirer said. “It means sleeping better at night.” Blockchain can also enable seamless transactions with people outside the jurisdiction and give residents greater control over their data, advocates say. “We want you to buy a house while you’re lying on a couch somewhere,” said Zeina El Kaissi, head of emerging technology at Smart Dubai, which is leading the city’s blockchain initiative. “Blockchain can make that possible.” When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments. Dubai identified 21 uses for blockchain, including charging electric vehicles, obtaining notary services and ensuring food safety. About 12 blockchain-based services are being built, Ms. El Kaissi said. One goal is to ensure that Dubai residents can submit documentation for common tasks, like buying a home or applying to schools, digitally and only once. The current system often requires multiple visits to government offices. “Today we’re using human beings as data transfer tools,” Ms. El Kaissi said. “That’s just a waste of my human life, to be honest.” Government agencies usually aren’t the first to try new technology, but the momentum around the blockchain industry has spurred adoption. It helps that some vendors are offering their services pro bono or at a discount, avoiding what is typically an arduous procurement process. Still, there are significant challenges. The technology is immature, with problems around speed, volume and security, Mr. Sirer said. The industry is also immature, with new vendors popping up and dropping out. Finally, political bureaucracy can be a hindrance. Some high-profile projects have stalled. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority concluded that a digital currency would “look broadly similar to, and not clearly superior to, existing infrastructures.” The Texas company building a blockchain-based land registry in Honduras gave up because of communication problems with officials. Isle of Man’s plan to secure internet-connected devices with blockchain halted after the start-up behind it shut down because of a founder spat. Perhaps the biggest gap between expectations and reality occurred in Sierra Leone, where the Swiss foundation Agora was widely reported to have powered the first blockchain election. This turned out to be overzealous marketing. The National Electoral Commission denounced the reports as “fake news,” and Agora acknowledged that it had merely been allowed to record some votes in its presidential election on a blockchain as a demonstration. The Cook County Recorder of Deeds worked on a land registry pilot with velox.RE, a California-based start-up, as well as the New York office of the law firm Hogan Lovells, the Chicago law firm Goldberg Kohn, and Onyx Electronics of Valparaiso, Ind., all of which did the work for free. The pilot, which included creating blockchains for more than a million parcels, as well as research and encryption, took a team of nine people eight months. The system is accessible through a rudimentary website. If you look up the property status of 5801 South Ellis Avenue, for example, you will see hundreds of pairs of 64-character strings, which correspond to transactions going back to 1985. The pilot made it clear that some foundational work is needed before Illinois can move to a blockchain land registry, Mr. Mirkovic said. Records must be digitized. Data formats must be standardized. A law must be passed to require that title transfers be registered with the government. Finally, Illinois voters recently decided to merge the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Cook County Clerk’s office, which would delay any decision on blockchains until 2020. The pilot also showed that the agency could solve some problems without blockchain. The pilot inspired the office’s existing software vendor, Conduent, to integrate some blockchain-like concepts into its more conventional design. And in his post-mortem, Mr. Mirkovic pointed to Iowa, where land records were accurate, title insurance was cheap, and citizens could look up information in a statewide online database that did not use blockchain. Mr. Mirkovic hopes that his office can eventually use the technology. “I still believe the idea is too good to ignore,” he said. In the United States, some of the momentum around blockchain comes from a desire to attract blockchain businesses, investment and high-tech jobs. Illinois, which ran six blockchain pilots, promised to create a “welcoming regulatory environment” to draw companies to the state. Arizona, Delaware, Nevada, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming have passed blockchain-related laws. Proponents in those states praised legislatures for acting quickly to keep up with technology, but Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, is concerned that they’re making bad law. “A bunch of states are really in a rush to pass some sort of legislation to demonstrate how crypto-friendly or tech savvy they are,” she said. Estimates vary as to when blockchain will have an impact in government. Dubai’s goal is to have its systems running by 2020, but Mr. Sirer said it would take at least 10 years to see an improvement. “It’s definitely not a fast process,” he said. An earlier version of this article omitted partners in the land registry pilot in Cook County, Ill. They were the New York office of the law firm Hogan Lovells, the Chicago law firm Goldberg Kohn, and Onyx Electronics of Valparaiso, Ind., all of which joined velox.RE in doing the work for free. The article also suggested incorrectly that the pilot involved only creating blockchains for parcels of land; related work also included research and encryption.",The New York Times
2018,"Governors Refuse to Send National Guard to Border, Citing Child Separation Practice","Governors from at least eight states have announced that they would withhold or recall National Guard troops from efforts to secure the United States’ border with Mexico, as the debate over the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from their parents at the southern border seeped into state political battles in an election year. Many of the governors opposed to sending troops were Democrats, from states including New York, North Carolina and Virginia. But two Republican governors who face re-elections this fall in Maryland and Massachusetts also reversed their plans. “Until this policy of separating children from their families has been rescinded, Maryland will not deploy any National Guard resources to the border,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on Twitter on Tuesday. “Earlier this morning, I ordered our four crew members & helicopter to immediately return from where they were stationed in New Mexico.” Some other Republican governors, under growing pressure to weigh in on the much-debated policy, voiced dissatisfaction over the separation issue, though some stopped short of addressing their state’s National Guard assistance. In Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who is expected to face a difficult election challenge this fall, said he opposed the policy and called on President Trump to halt it. (The state did not respond to questions about sending the National Guard to the border.) In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, issued a series of messages on Twitter voicing his dismay: “While there seems to be a lot of misinformation and propaganda regarding the situation on our border, one thing is clear: Children should not be separated from their families.” But other Republican governors in deeply conservative states voiced strong support for the president’s “zero tolerance” policy. “America is a nation of laws, and I am grateful is administration is enforcing them,” said Gov. Phil Bryant, Republican of Mississippi. “Every state must make similar decisions when removing a child who has been neglected or abused by their parents. It is an unfortunate reality of our justice system.” Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican who is close to Mr. Trump and faces a runoff election next week, said he supported the White House and signaled that he would not change his state’s Guard deployment to the border. “The president wanted troops at the border,” Mr. McMaster said on Monday during a campaign stop in Spartanburg. “South Carolina sent troops to the border.” During April and May, federal authorities separated at least 1,995 children from parents facing criminal prosecution for unlawfully crossing the border, the Trump administration announced on Friday. Photographs and an audio tape of crying children caught in the administration’s dragnet stoked new outrage this week, leading members of both parties to express concern. Mr. Trump and two members of his cabinet have forcefully defended the “zero tolerance” policy, with the president repeatedly making the false accusation that only the Democrats, the minority party, were to blame for it. The law does not require the authorities to separate children. The issue, which turns on federal immigration policy, might have been largely a question left to leaders in Washington, not governors. But the Trump administration’s request for National Guard troops earlier this year has thrust the matter into the state-level debate as well. President Trump called in April for the National Guard to be deployed to the border, saying that thousands of troops were needed to stanch illegal crossings, even though they are at a 46-year low. In recent days, Democratic governors from states like Colorado, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island have expressed deep opposition to family separation, and many declared they would not help at the border. For many of the governors, the defiance — which was being embraced by left-leaning constituents in their states — was largely symbolic, since they had not been planning to send large numbers of soldiers in the first place, if they had been asked at all. “Under normal circumstances, we wouldn’t hesitate to answer the call,” said Gov. John Carney, Democrat of Delaware, who said he had declined a request on Tuesday to send troops to the border. “But given what we know about the policies currently in effect at the border, I can’t in good conscience send Delawareans to help with that mission.” Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrat of North Carolina, said that the “cruel policy of tearing children away from their parents requires a strong response” and that he was pulling his state’s small contingent — three troops — from the border. Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia said Tuesday that he was recalling four troops and one helicopter. And for Republican governors up for re-election this year in blue states, like Mr. Hogan of Maryland, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, and Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, the practice has prompted them to remind voters that there are issues on which they disagree with Mr. Trump. “It’s cruel and inhumane, and we told the National Guard to hold steady and to not go down to the border, period,” Mr. Baker, who had initially pledged to deploy two Guard troops and a helicopter, said on Monday. Yet the “zero tolerance” policy was presenting a far more fraught situation for governors in purple states. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, a Republican who is seeking election in November, voiced dissatisfaction with the policy in a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s just horrific that, you know, children are being used as a pawn in this situation,” she said, adding that Congress needed to take action. Gov. Christopher T. Sununu, a Republican seeking re-election in New Hampshire, said that the state’s National Guard had not been contacted by the administration, but that he “will not send our New Hampshire troops to the southern border to separate families.” And Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who is running for Senate in Florida, said in a letter to the Health and Human Services Department that the practice of separating children from their families “needs to stop now.” But McKinley Lewis, an aide to Mr. Scott, suggested there were no plans to change the deployment of three Guard troops to the border. “Governor Scott will not play politics with the National Guard,” Mr. Lewis said. Before Monday, Massachusetts had joined several states, mostly those in the South and led by Republican leaders, in support of the president’s order to dispatch National Guard troops. In Texas, which shares a 1,200-mile border with Mexico, Gov. Greg Abbott has pledged up to 1,400 troops, the largest contingent of all the states. The Defense Department has authorized up to 4,000 soldiers to be assigned to the border. Several governors refused the request at the outset. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, Democrat, said days after Mr. Trump’s order that she would not comply if asked to send troops. Mr. Scott, the Republican of Vermont, said he was not “eager” to send troops, and his spokeswoman, Rebecca Kelley, said Mr. Scott “made clear to the Vermont National Guard Adjutant General at that time that he would not be sending troops in response.” Gov. Jerry Brown of California, also a Democrat, dispatched some soldiers to his state’s southern border but limited their roles, angering the president. An earlier version of this article misstated the political affiliation of the governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",The New York Times
2018,Grammys Expand Number of Nominees in Four Top Categories,"The Grammy Awards will expand the number of nominees in its top categories from five to eight, a move that may help increase gender diversity after the awards were sharply criticized this year for their lack of recognition for women artists. The change, announced Tuesday, will affect the four most prestigious categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. (Record of the year recognizes a single recording, while the song prize is for songwriters.) The new rule will go into effect immediately, with members voting on nominations this fall for the 61st annual show next year. “This change will better reflect the large number of entries in these categories and allow voters greater flexibility when selecting this year’s best recordings,” the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, said in a note to its members. The revision comes after a rough season for the Grammys, when both the show and the management of the academy came under fire. At this year’s ceremony, in January, the sole woman nominated for album of the year — Lorde — did not have a solo performance spot, and just one woman was given a solo award in one of the handful of televised categories (Alessia Cara, for best new artist). In addition, researchers at the University of Southern California published a report showing that women made up just 9.3 percent of Grammy nominees over the past five years in the top four categories, along with producer of the year. The study, released just before the Grammys, served as a grim report card for the music industry over all, but much of the resulting criticism was directed at the awards show. In the aftermath of this year’s show, the Recording Academy appointed a task force to review diversity and other issues. And Neil Portnow, the academy’s president, announced he would step down in 2019 after being severely rebuked for a remark that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers. The announcement on Tuesday included several other updates, including the second tweak in four years to the definition of alternative music. The last change had defined alternative as recordings “that take as a starting point any existing musical genre or combination of genres, and expand and redefine the boundaries of those genres.” The new definition is more expansive, calling alternative “often a less intense version of rock or a more intense version of pop,” which “may embrace a variety of subgenres or any hybrids thereof and may include recordings that don’t fit into other genre categories.”",The New York Times
2018,"Grandma, What Do You Mean There’s No God?","SOCIAL Q’S An atheist wonders whether she should talk to her granddaughter about religion. My daughter and son-in-law send their 6-year-old to a parochial school. They are not particularly religious; I am an atheist. The little girl asked recently why another child wasn’t baptized. Her mother said, “Some people do that, others don’t.” When my sister died, the girl asked if she was in heaven. My daughter said, “Some people don’t believe in heaven.” I’ve been going along with this approach. But at some point, won’t it be in my grandchild’s best interests for me to explain that belief in a fictional deity is a poor substitute for science and rationality? GRANDMA Let’s hold off on the “God Is Dead” banners for now. Judging by the youngsters I’ve met in my life, I’m guessing that Nietzsche’s meaning would sail right over your granddaughter’s head. You would probably also annoy your daughter and son-in-law, who, despite their lack of religious zeal, chose to enroll their child in a church-affiliated school. I’m glad you mentioned the “best interests” of the child. I trust that’s what you’re after here (along with a mild dose of wanting to speak your mind). I suggest deferring to your daughter and son-in-law. They are entrusted with their child’s care. And it sounds as if they’re trying to balance her religious education with age-appropriate lessons that different people hold different beliefs. If you are concerned that your granddaughter’s worldview is too narrow, head straight for her parents. Your daughter sounds open-minded. But you’ve had your turn raising children; now it’s theirs. (And remember how it felt when parents and in-laws offered unsolicited advice to you?) Your granddaughter will probably appreciate hearing your philosophy when she’s older. For now, wait for her to ask you about it. I am a young artist who supports herself (and buys art supplies) with temporary gigs. It’s a struggle, but I’m making it work. Last year, I gave a painting I made to a friend for her birthday. She thanked me and seemed to like it. So, I was really upset when I saw it hanging at an acquaintance’s apartment. I want to tell my friend how insensitive she was. Any suggestions? ANNE I’m doubly sorry, Anne. First, because you’re hurt, and second, because I don’t think your friend did anything wrong. Let’s start with the fact that you were generous to give her one of your paintings. (I’m glad she thanked you.) But it is a sad fact that most of us have limited wall and storage space. So, your friend can simultaneously love you and not want to hang or store your painting. Given the extremely personal nature of your gift — your art! — consider how awkward it would have been for her to tell you she wasn’t crazy about it when you gave it to her. In a way, she honored your generosity by finding a pal who likes the painting well enough to hang it. In the future, consider limiting gifts of your work to people who have expressed real admiration for it or outright desire to own a piece. My husband and I had another couple over for dinner. They just moved into the neighborhood, and our young kids are the same age. (They’re both only children.) After dinner, I asked: “Are you thinking of having more kids?” The wife began crying, and the husband said, “It’s a bit soon to pry, don’t you think?” My husband was mortified. I apologized and sent a note the next day. But isn’t this a pretty typical getting-to-know-you topic among parents of young children? SAVALA I think you already have your tear-stained answer, don’t you? Fertility issues and disagreements about family size can make this topic way too loaded for first dates. Still, I get that it’s a magnetic subject and takes up lots of space for many couples. Wait to raise it until you know each other much better. Don’t be too hard on yourself. But don’t waste time normalizing the question, either. You’ve seen firsthand how hurtful it can be. I am a germophobe, and entertain often. How can I get my guests to wash their hands when they come over, especially if they’ve used public transportation? Once I asked a guest to wash his hands, and he said I sounded like his mother. Clearly, that wasn’t the way to go. But what is? KATE Listen, many of us have eccentricities about people coming into our homes — whether it’s shoes off at the door, hands washed on entry or mandatory greetings to Fido and Princess Kitty. In my experience, owning an issue as my peccadillo (and no accusation of my guest) helps it go down easier. Just say, “I’m a bit of a germophobe. Would you mind washing your hands?” You may get an eye roll or two. But that’s better than squirming around all night, feeling anxious about everything guests touch, no?

2018,Grandmas and Grandpas Are a Kid’s Natural Allies in These Books,"Children’s Books Needless to say, small children won’t be reading this review. It is aimed squarely at the grown-ups who buy picture books, borrow them, give them as gifts and read them aloud to children. Of all these transactions — buying, borrowing, giving and reading aloud — the one that really counts is the last. Reading a book to a small child can create a connection of exquisite intimacy, with the book itself as a vital point of contact. The quality of such a book is inextricably linked to the quality of that interaction. Such thoughts are stirred by these four new picture books featuring a loving relationship between a child and a grandparent. Leafing through each of these books, one tends to step outside the story and imagine it being read by grandparent to child. The fact that the two parties in this imagined scenario are in the earliest and latest chapters of their lives lends each book more than the usual measure of emotion. I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU, GRANDMA (Chronicle, 40 pp., $18.99; ages 3 to 6), written and illustrated by Taro Gomi, was first published in Japan in 1979. Here it is, almost 40 years later, with its spare text translated into English. It hasn’t aged a bit. The book tells the simple story of an old woman and her granddaughter, who set off at the same time to visit each other across a broad valley. Using several modes of transportation, they twice miss each other en route but finally meet halfway for a happy picnic under a tree. The humor of this trifling anecdote is uncannily pitched to 3- to 6-year-olds, and Gomi’s witty one-dimensional illustrations drolly complement his storytelling. A mom, a grandpa, a cabby, a cat, a rampant goat and a face-licking cow expand the lively cast of characters without ever being mentioned in the text. And what fun to see Granny on a motorcycle! The author Minh Le and the illustrator Dan Santat have teamed up for DRAWN TOGETHER (Hyperion, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), another book whose pictures give an extra measure of help telling the story. This time a young Thai-American boy is dropped off to visit his grandfather. The two sit in awkward silence, separated by their gaping age difference and by an impenetrable language barrier (the old man’s dialogue is even scribbled in Thai). Not even a Southeast Asian action video engages the interest of the hapless lad. But when he idly plucks art supplies from his backpack, he and his granddad discover a shared enthusiasm for drawing action figures. At this point Santat’s staid, prosaic images explode into garish, kinetic life as the two create a comic-book epic featuring a ferocious dragon and two embattled heroes modeled on themselves. The heavily symbolic epic, it must be said, makes little sense to this particular grandfather, but it is charged with visual drama. The story ends with the old man and his grandson in each other’s arms, brought together by wordless affection and the power of their shared imagination. This touching lesson in empathy and family love may resonate more with a grown-up reader than a child (no child ever spoke the sentence “my grandfather surprised me by revealing a world beyond words”). Still, the book’s heart is firmly in the right place, and Santat’s illustrations of both the real-life and fantasy worlds of the two main characters are beautifully rendered. Another book also bears the weight of a grown-up message, but this one carries it a bit more gracefully. This is OCEAN MEETS SKY (Simon & Schuster, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), by the Fan Brothers. Sharing the roles of both author and illustrator, these two brothers have taken on the daunting challenge of introducing children to the grave fact of death. The central character in the book is a boy named Finn who lives in a house by the sea. With the gentle device of a verb tense, the authors reveal that Finn’s fisherman grandfather has recently died (he “would have been 90 years old today”). The impact of his absence is suggested by an empty chair in a darkened office. The room is cluttered with the old man’s books, tools and bric-a-brac, objects that fill Finn’s mind with fragmented memories of him. “To honor him,” Finn builds a boat on the beach, using found objects and detritus. Exhausted from his labors, he naps inside his rickety craft and, in a fantastical dream that recalls such books as “Where the Wild Things Are,” he sails it out to sea. From this point on, the book’s lovely, muted illustrations depict a world of melancholy magic. We see a giant golden fish, islands made of books and seashells, a “sea of moon jellies dancing.” Everywhere there are little reminders of Finn’s grandfather, all of them traceable to the objects in that ghostly office. A kind of spirit guide finally appears in the shape of an enormous blue whale, leading Finn through a misty universe of floating and flying memories. Finn’s mother awakens him near the end of the book. As he stands alone on the beach and takes one last look at moon and sky, he appears to contemplate for the very first time the mysteries of life and death. This is moving stuff for a grown-up, though it may be pretty heady fare for a lot of kids. Of these four fine books, the real gem is TINY, PERFECT THINGS (Compendium, 32 pp., $16.95; ages 3 to 7), written by M. H. Clark and illustrated by Madeline Kloepper, whose first name triggers associations with Ludwig Bemelmans, who may well be her stylistic muse. There’s really no story here at all. On the first page we see an old man and his rambunctious granddaughter strolling the sunny sidewalks and leafy yards of a small town. The text begins with a disarmingly simple statement: “Today we keep our eyes open for tiny, perfect things.” Each ensuing sentence has the same deadpan straightforwardness, peppered with a few fun, fractured rhymes. Grandpa and grandchild chronicle everything they find: leaf, snail, apple, crow, spider’s web, bottle cap. The verdant flora in Kloepper’s illustrations teems with hidden insects, birds and neighborhood pets. All of them reappear in a crowded two-page panoply toward the end of the book, setting the stage for a delightful game between old reader and young listener: “How many perfect things can you find?” As night falls, grandfather and grandchild return to the warm, welcoming interior of a clapboard house. Here we meet the girl’s parents. Mom, who is white, hugs her daughter; Dad, who is brown-skinned, serves up supper; Grandpa settles into a comfy chair. The scene sends off several signals that might seem too distinctly politically correct (besides tweaking gender stereotypes the family is racially mixed), but it does so with such unforced sweetness that its familiar sentiments simply warm the heart. You can almost hear the sighs of contentment from a doting grandparent and happy child. An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the illustrator for “Tiny, Perfect Things.” She is Madeline Kloepper, not Madeleine.",The New York Times
2018,Grazing an Entire Country at a Mexico City Market ,"Bites At Mercado Roma Coyoacán, visitors can devour a delicious mishmash of foods and fusions from all over Mexico (and beyond). The best time to visit Mercado Roma Coyoacán — the new three-floor food hall made up of 42 different vendors in the Mexico City neighborhood of Coyoacán — is during a televised soccer game. As the scent of simmering pork and just-heated corn tortillas lingered in the air, the cries of “gooooooaaaaallll!” from the various TVs echoed through the space as patrons fist-pumped and high-fived each other. A 15-minute walk from Coyoacán’s leafy Plaza de la Conchita, the market, like its four-year-old sibling in the Roma neighborhood, is an upscale take on the salt-of-the-earth food stalls that have long existed in various neighborhood markets throughout the capital. Here, though, visitors can devour a delicious mishmash of foods and fusions from all over Mexico and the world. At La Botica del Té you can order a tea infusion based on your astrological sign. An Italian stand serves “Italian tacos” (meat and veggies wrapped in a thick tortilla-like piadina, a specialty of Emilia-Romagna). Or at Kome, you can eat a sushi burrito. Then there are regional offerings: cemitas from Puebla, tacos from Yucatán, and, of course, grasshoppers (a classic market snack). I steered clear of both insects and gastronomical mash-ups. I instead sampled above-average chicken enchiladas smothered in Oaxacan mole and sprinkled with fresh white cheese at Lucy’s. At Kua 32 — the Nahuatl word for “to eat” plus the number of states in Mexico (including the capital) — I scarfed down a taco stuffed with carnitas made from duck instead of the usual pork. At Tacos Áribes Tripoli, I grazed on a taco Arabe: lamb meat shaved off a spit and served on a thick pita-like tortilla, the ancestor of the taco al pastor and a culinary fusion old enough to now be considered “traditional.” I was largely satisfied. Then I plopped myself on a stool at Tetakawi, a spot representing the cuisine of Sonora, a northwest region hugging the United States border and the Gulf of California. Eduardo Arenas, the chef and owner (and one-time contestant on the popular Mexican version of the TV show “Master Chef”), put a taco filled with grilled octopus doused in a barbacoa sauce in front of me. The taste was sensational: a salty fresh sensation of the sea fused with an earthy smokiness from the sauce. Next I tried the chimichanga perrona, a deep-fried burrito filled with marlin, shrimp, güero chili peppers and queso crema. “‘Perrona’ could be loosely translated as ‘extraordinary,’” he said. Indeed. The fried exterior of the tortilla belied a soft and juicy interior: the creaminess of the cheese, the snap of the shrimp, the freshness of the marlin and a slight kick from the chili. “Chimichangas are really popular in Sonora and northern Mexico,” Mr. Arenas said, “and they usually have pork or beef in them but I love cooking with seafood so I did my own take.” I capped off my visit by stopping by Cafexolgía, which marries alcohol and coffee. As I sipped on a cup of a mix of rum, horchata, cinnamon and espresso, the televisions began to blare again with cries of “goooooaaaallll!” Finding Mercado Roma Coyoacán was, indeed, a score.

2018,Greece May Be Turning a Corner. Greeks Who Fled Are Staying Put.,"DÜSSELDORF, Germany — After a decade of economic pain, Greece finally appears to be back on track. Try telling that to the Greeks who left and have no plans to return, like Constantine Kakoyiannis. As Mr. Kakoyiannis raised a glass of pilsner beer, he toasted his girlfriend at a German cafe in Düsseldorf, alongside 40 of their friends. The group, part of a club of expatriate Greek engineers, was welcoming several newcomers who had fled Greece in just the last few months. “The situation isn’t getting better,” Mr. Kakoyiannis said. “When you realize that your country has become a cemetery of dreams, you need to find dreams elsewhere.” While the Continent is finally emerging from the economic crisis, Greece still faces challenges. Nearly half a million Greeks have become economic migrants since the crisis began, one of the biggest exoduses from any eurozone country. And they are still leaving. Among them are doctors, technicians, architects and other skilled professionals as well as recent graduates who continue to stake out Europe’s prosperous north for work. Mr. Kakoyiannis managed to secure a coveted job as an engineer, and his girlfriend followed him here. As Athens prepares in August to exit an eight-year dependency on international financial bailouts and repay those debts, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared a recovery. Growth is showing some signs of a long-awaited rebound. Recently, Mr. Tsipras unveiled a new economic blueprint for Greece and urged Greeks to return to help rebuild the country. European leaders are heralding the symbolic end to a Greek debt crisis that began in 2010. Yet for many Greeks who escaped their fractured economy, the optimism seems premature. A fifth of Greeks are still unemployed, and the economy remains smaller than it was a decade ago. And the political uncertainty in Italy, with the pall it casts over the fate of the euro, has the potential to undermine the progress that Greece has achieved. “When an economy has been destroyed, it takes many years to rebuild,” said Vasilis Kapoglou, who founded the Greek Engineers of North Rhine-Westphalia club after leaving Greece in 2013, as construction projects dried up. “The bailout may be ending, but the problems that drove people away aren’t.” Many who have come here followed a path cut by an older cadre of Greeks in the 1950s, when Germany sought guest workers for mining and construction to rebuild cities after World War II. Today, in North Rhine-Westphalia, a booming industrial region that includes Düsseldorf and Cologne, an estimated 130,000 Greeks ply in-demand modern skills at German technology, telecommunications and construction companies, as well as banks, hospitals and pharmacies. So many Greeks have descended on Düsseldorf in recent years that a mini-Athens is thriving. Near the central train station, Greek tavernas and cafes are filled with cosmopolitan young Greeks sipping frappé coffee and puffing on rolled cigarettes, a scene reminiscent of any Athenian square. A boutique, run by Greeks from the wave of guest workers in the ’50s, offers white taffeta baby dresses and sugarcoated almonds, traditional symbols of Greek Orthodox baptisms. At the Cafe Byzantio, Greeks savor baklava desserts while playing backgammon. Tickets for trains, planes and buses headed home are sold at a busy Greek travel agency festooned with nostalgia-inducing posters of the Parthenon and the sunny Aegean Islands. At the forefront of the continued emigration wave are engineers. While investors are showing renewed interest in Greece, construction, development and technology-related projects there are still struggling to recover. “Engineers are connected to the development of a country,” said Martha Ouzounidou, a chemical engineer from Thessaloniki who came to Düsseldorf in October after landing work at a German maker of electric car batteries. “But there is no development happening in Greece.” Engineers who stay behind tend to be supported by parents, or are finding mainly low-paying jobs working on hotel construction linked to tourism, one of the country’s few growth sectors, Mr. Kapoglou said. At the cafe where his club gathered on a recent Saturday, there were at least five new Greek engineers who had moved to Düsseldorf in recent months. They quickly landed jobs. The club now counts nearly 900 members. “The Germans have welcomed us,” Mr. Kapoglou said. “They want highly skilled people.” That is a bitter irony for families back home. Germany was seen as the lead enforcer of austerity in Greece, demanding debilitating cuts in pensions, salaries and the public sector in exchange for 326 billion euros, or about $380 billion, worth of bailouts from creditors to reduce Greece’s mountain of debt. Many Greeks now blame Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for their plight. The Greeks who left, however, are more angry at their own government, which they say has chronically mismanaged the economy by failing to end corruption, reduce the lumbering state or revive investment. The changes required by Greece’s creditors sought to force improvements to deeply rooted structural problems in public administration, tax collection, the judicial system and business regulations. Those creditors are still pressing Athens to carry out austerity measures ahead of a June deadline to determine whether to grant the country more debt relief. Mr. Kakoyiannis, the engineer who left with his girlfriend, had resisted decamping until 2016, shortly after capital controls were imposed in a chaotic moment when Greece nearly crashed out of the eurozone. Before that, he made ends meet with three research jobs that barely paid the rent. Over family objections, he sent résumés outside Greece and was soon offered two jobs in Silicon Valley. To stay closer to home, Mr. Kakoyiannis opted for a job near Düsseldorf, where he works for a German technology firm with 180 other engineers, designing antennas for cellphones and other wireless devices. His girlfriend, Kalliope Rapti, ran an online language training company in Greece. Despite government pledges to help small businesses, more than half of her time was spent navigating the country’s bureaucracy and shifting tax rules. When she registered her business here after they moved, the process took five minutes online. She plans to hire five employees this year. “In Greece, it was a mess,” Ms. Rapti said. “In Germany, their approach is, ‘If we help you make money, you’ll pay taxes.’” Still, while many Greeks are planning careers and even families in Germany, the transition isn’t always easy. Düsseldorf’s drizzly skies, the direct demeanor of the Germans and the difficulty in making German friends — even after learning the language — can be a struggle. Nevermind homesickness, broken dreams and a gradual acceptance that the lives they wanted to build in Greece may materialize only elsewhere. Mr. Kapoglou and his wife, Katerina, an environmental engineer, are among the few who might dare to return. Although they have little faith in the Greek government, they are betting that they can parlay their engineering experience and international business exposure in Germany into a profitable business. To capitalize on the interest in tourism around their hometown, Ioannina, which lies in a verdant region in northern Greece, they plan to create a consultancy to draw Russian and Chinese investors for building projects. “We’d like to be part of a brain gain,” Mr. Kapoglou said. Yet it may take years, or even another generation, before a groundswell follows them. In their tidy brick apartment complex outside Düsseldorf, Mr. Kakoyiannis and Ms. Rapti settled down after the engineering club meeting and made a Sunday lunch of traditional Greek souvlakia, pita and garlicky tzatziki. Mr. Kakoyiannis let drop that his mother had been pressing him on when they would return to Greece. “Go back to what?” he recalled replying. “To no job and no future?” Sweethearts since they met in university, the couple had put off having children during the Greek crisis. Now, they are planning on having a baby — though not, as their parents wished, back in Greece. “In Germany, we have hope for the future,” Ms. Rapti said. “And so will our child.”",The New York Times
2018,"Greece Prepares to Stagger Back From Debt Crisis, the End of Bailouts in Sight","BRUSSELS — European leaders announced early Friday a plan that would finally take Greece off financial life support, effectively declaring an end to a regional debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro. The deal reduces Greece’s dependence on its fellow European countries and on the International Monetary Fund, more than eight years after the Continent was plunged into a deep financial crisis that created lasting political fissures. Greece and several other countries in southern Europe were forced to impose painful austerity measures in return for bailouts from their richer northern neighbors. The actions included cutting pensions, raising taxes and in some cases even selling off public assets. Those moves cut deepest in Greece, and they drove countless protesters to the streets for demonstrations against successive governments. Since the crisis began, the country has received rescue packages totaling some 320 billion euros, or about $370 billion. “After eight long years, Greece will finally be graduating from its financial assistance,” said Mário Centeno, president of the Eurogroup, which comprises the finance ministers in the eurozone. “Greece joined Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal in the ranks of euro-area countries that turned around their economies and once again stand on their own feet.” Greece’s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said his country was looking to the future after years of depression-like economic conditions. “This government will never forget what the Greek people went through these past years,” he said. “The people must very soon see a difference in their pockets. That is the promise that the Greek government gives.” Greece will receive a final €15 billion in loans for the last two months of the program. After that, it will receive a significant debt relief package: a 10-year extension on loans that were granted during previous bailouts and a 10-year deferral on interests and amortization. A cash buffer of €24.1 billion should cover its sovereign financial needs for the next 22 months. The country will remain closely watched by European institutions and the International Monetary Fund, which will be monitoring its fiscal discipline and the reforms started under the current program. “With all these measures we can safely say that Greek debt is sustainable going forward,” Mr. Centeno said. But Greece still faces daunting challenges. Unemployment is no longer at historic highs, but one-fifth of Greeks are jobless. The economy is growing, though at a relatively slow pace of 1.4 percent last year. Households have seen their incomes chopped by a third, hundreds of thousands of Greeks work low-paying temporary jobs, and more pension cuts and tax increases lie ahead. The country had to impose credit controls in 2015, and there are still limits on how much cash Greeks can withdraw from shaky banks, although those restrictions have been gradually relaxed in recent years. “If you look at the past three years, the Greek economy recovered, jobs were created,” said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels think tank. “But I think you can’t just look at the past three years. You have to look at what happened in 2010, and clearly it was a huge disaster.” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who rose to power vowing to reverse austerity, has acknowledged that the end of Greece’s third bailout program will not bring about a magical transformation. “When you take a patient out of intensive care,” he told a group of Greek entrepreneurs last month, “you don’t make him run a sprint.” Managing the country’s debt, which is equal to nearly 180 percent of its gross domestic product, remains a herculean task. Severe belt-tightening will still be necessary if Greece is to have any hope of regaining credibility with international investors. The country is still years away from being able to sell new debt on financial markets; it still owes staggering sums to banks, financial institutions and other countries, which will be looking over Athens’s shoulder for years to come. Mr. Tsipras’s political opponents, who have been gaining ground in opinion polls, have noted that the country will remain under foreign supervision for years to come and will still be subject to harsh austerity measures, including a package approved by Parliament last week that includes further pension cuts, tax increases and privatization of state assets. That view is often echoed by regular Greeks. “What exit? This is a life sentence,” said Giorgos Amanatidis, a 67-year-old pensioner in Athens. He added, “Taxes, taxes and more taxes.” “Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel?” he continued. “What kind of future do my grandchildren have here?” The consequences of the debt crisis extended beyond Greece. The rest of the region bears scars from the economic turmoil that began there and quickly spread. Investors lost faith not only in Greek assets but also in those of other financially weak European countries. There was even talk that the eurozone would break apart. Economic growth and investor confidence recovered only after the European Central Bank used its power to print money and flood the eurozone with cash. But, the stress of the crisis fueled lingering bitterness between crisis countries, like Greece and Italy, and creditor countries, like Germany. The fallout also played a role in the rise of populist parties in France, Germany and Italy, among others. But Mr. Centeno said he was confident that Greece had turned a corner. “This is it,” he said. “We have managed to deliver a soft landing of this long and difficult adjustment, there will be no follow-up program in Greece.”",The New York Times
2018,Greece and Macedonia Press Ahead With Name Change,"ATHENS — A landmark agreement to change the name of Macedonia and end a decades-old dispute with Greece appeared to be on track on Friday, but it was becoming increasingly clear that few people in either country were terribly happy about it. The announcement of the agreement on Tuesday prompted the main conservative opposition party in Greece, New Democracy, to call for a vote of no-confidence against the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, plunging Parliament into an acrimonious debate that forced Mr. Tsipras on Friday to abandon plans to brief lawmakers on the naming deal. Greece has long objected to its northern neighbor’s use of the name Macedonia, arguing that it implies territorial aspirations against a northern Greek region with the same name, and represents an attempt to appropriate the ancient civilization of Macedonia, the center of the kingdom of the Greek warrior king Alexander the Great. There have also been more far-reaching implications: The dispute has kept Macedonia out of the European Union and NATO. The no-confidence vote was lodged by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of New Democracy, who described the agreement as a “bad deal which harms our country’s interests,” although his political maneuvering was unlikely to have much practical effect, at least in the short run. The no-confidence vote, now scheduled for Saturday, is unlikely to pass, with Mr. Tsipras’s coalition partner saying it opposes the Macedonia agreement, but not to the extent that it is willing to threaten the government’s stability. There were more extreme reactions. Konstantinos Barbarousis, a lawmaker for the ultraright party Golden Dawn, caused an uproar that led his party to be ejected from the debate, after he accused Mr. Tsipras, as well as the country’s president and defense minister, of treason and called on the Greek Army to arrest them. (The Greek justice minister, Stavros Kontonis, asked a prosecutor to investigate whether Mr. Barbarousis should face criminal charges for his rant.) Outside Parliament, protesters waved Greek flags and condemned the deal as a “national betrayal” and suggested that the compromise was a final straw after years of what they regarded as humiliating austerity measures. “They’ve taken everything, but not our Macedonia. We’re not giving it away,” said Aliki Voutsa, 63, a retired schoolteacher. “They have no right to give up our history, our heritage.” In recent months, there have been large rallies against a compromise on the issue of Macedonia’s name in Athens and other major cities — including Greece’s second city, Thessaloniki, the capital of the Greek region Macedonia. Organizers of the rally in Athens on Friday called for a referendum on the deal and promised an “unending struggle.” “Fellow Greeks, this is the last chance for us to save our Macedonia,” Michalis Patsikas, one of the rally organizers, said in a recorded message outside Parliament that was posted on social media. “Do your patriotic duty,” he said, calling on Greeks to “leave obligations and work” and join the rally in central Athens. The agreement has also prompted protests and political opposition in Skopje, the Macedonian capital. President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will oppose the agreement, and on Friday, a meeting between Mr. Ivanov, Mr. Zaev and Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov ended almost immediately after it started. The fragile deal, which is subject to a referendum in Macedonia and approval from parliaments in both countries, has long been in the making. After years of mediation by the United Nations, negotiations intensified in recent months, propelled in part by a moderate government in Macedonia that replaced hard-line nationalists last year. And on Tuesday, to widespread surprise, Mr. Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart, Zoran Zaev, said they had agreed to rename the country the Republic of North Macedonia. The two men hailed the deal as a historic, dignified solution for both sides, as did European officials. But leaders of both countries were quickly accused of capitulation. In Macedonia, protesters objected to what they perceived as an imposed change. In Greece, critics deemed that the geographical determinant would not protect the country against irredentist claims, and took issue with the recognition of the Balkan country’s language and nationality as “Macedonian.” Mr. Mitsotakis called that “an unacceptable national concession.” Mr. Tsipras has said he is “proud” of the deal, contending that it ends a longstanding dispute while protecting Greek interests. He told Parliament on Thursday that the agreement “takes back the history of ancient Greek Macedonia” by stipulating that the Balkan nation can have no claim to it, and he accused the political opposition of “trading in patriotism” for suggesting otherwise. The agreement was expected to be signed on Sunday by the two countries’ foreign ministers, in the presence of their prime ministers, in the region of Prespes, on the shore of the Prespa Lake district, which the two countries share, along with Albania. European and United Nations officials are expected to attend. Reflecting the tensions surrounding the deal, however, details about the exact location of the event have not been revealed because of security concerns. “Your heads at Prespes!” said Mr. Barbarousis, the Golden Dawn lawmaker.

2018,Greek Government Survives Vote Over Deal to Rename Macedonia,"The government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Saturday called over a landmark agreement to change the name of Macedonia and end a decades-old dispute with Greece. But the government’s parliamentary majority was reduced to three after a lawmaker, Dimitris Kammenos of the nationalist Independent Greeks, the government’s junior coalition partner, voted in favor. He was kicked out of the party immediately. Lawmakers in the 300-member Hellenic Parliament voted 153 to 127 against the motion brought by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the conservative main opposition New Democracy party, over the deal to rename the former Yugoslav republic the Republic of North Macedonia. The agreement also calls for Athens to drop its opposition to the renamed country’s joining NATO and the European Union. Thousands of protesters rallied outside Parliament during the debate, waving Greek flags and chanting anti-government slogans. Scuffles broke out, with riot police firing tear gas to stop protesters from breaching police lines. The deal reached on Tuesday by Mr. Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart, Zoran Zaev, was to end a bitter dispute that has inflamed the two countries’ relations since shortly after Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece had argued that the term “Macedonia” implied territorial claims on its province of the same name, which is the birthplace of the ancient warrior king Alexander the Great, and usurped its ancient Greek heritage and history. Critics in both countries greeted the deal with fury, accusing their respective prime ministers of conceding too much. “Hatred toward the country of another is not patriotism,” Mr. Tsipras said during his speech in Parliament. The agreement is expected to be signed Sunday morning by the two nations’ foreign ministers at Lake Prespa near their common border. Both prime ministers are expected to attend the ceremony, as are European officials. Protests have been scheduled in both countries. During the debate on Saturday, Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, the head of the Independent Greeks party, stressed that voting against the no-confidence motion was not a vote in favor of the deal to rename Macedonia, which he vowed to reject when it is brought before Parliament. Mr. Tsipras stressed that the deal met all of Greece’s demands and would close “the open wound that has been troubling our country for more than 26 years.” Mr. Mitsotakis, who had brought the no-confidence motion, argued that a vote in favor of the government was a vote in favor of the name change. “Today you are all mortgaging the future of the country,” he told lawmakers. Across the border in Macedonia, Mr. Zaev has also met with opposition, with President Gjorge Ivanov saying he will not sign off on the agreement. He has said he would put it to a referendum in the fall. “With the signing of the agreement between Macedonia and Greece, everyone will benefit,” Mr. Zaev said Saturday. Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, said the deal would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union. “We have forces that are fighting for the future, we have forces that are fighting for the past,” Mr. Dimitrov said in Skopje. “We cannot change the past, we could the future.” A ratification process will take months. In Macedonia, parliamentary ratification, a referendum and a constitutional amendment is required for the change to take place. If Mr. Ivanov refuses to sign off on the deal, it will be sent back to Parliament for a second vote. If it passes again, the president must sign it. In Greece, the deal faces ratification in Parliament only after Macedonia has completed its part of the process.",The New York Times
2018,Grief and Self-Doubt Follow Shooting at Trenton Arts Festival,"TRENTON — Trenton is a capital city of more than 84,000 people that can often feel like two urban areas rolled into one. On State Street, beyond the State House with its golden dome, sit clean brick buildings that house deep-pocketed lobbying firms and a cafe where state employees in business suits were having lunch at outdoor tables on Monday afternoon. Yet a short drive in nearly any direction reveals boarded-up houses, sagging roofs, vacant lots and cracked roads. Signs pledging to buy homes in any condition for cash hang from the utility poles. In this bleak landscape, Art All Night has been a bright spot — an annual 24-hour art show featuring the paintings of children alongside works by the city’s growing artists’ community. A point of local pride, it has also been the centerpiece of an effort to revitalize downtown and repurpose its warehouses as art galleries, studios and event spaces. That light was dimmed over the weekend when the festival became the site of a mass shooting early Sunday — leaving one dead and around two dozen injured — in what the authorities described as a showdown between rival gangs. “It was our worst nightmare,” said Lauren Otis, the executive director of Artworks Trenton, the nonprofit that produces the event, now in its 12th year. “It was horrible. It’s something that would be inexplicably horrible wherever it happened, but to have it happen in what was the most diverse event in Trenton, perhaps in New Jersey, at an event that was so popular — it was tragic. It eviscerated us.” He went on: “What occurred there is what a lot of people’s impression of our city is, violence, urban decay, lack of economic opportunity. That’s why Art All Night was so important. It provided this beacon of hope.” As law enforcement officials investigated and event organizers waited to retrieve art from the crime scene, the shooting raised questions not just about the future of Art All Night, but the well-being of the city itself: a place where some 20,000 government workers flood in every day only to disappear by dusk, leaving behind an expanse of dilapidated warehouses and a famous sign, “Trenton Makes, the World Takes” — reminders of its heyday as a hub of manufacturing. Over the past several years signs of revitalization have appeared. The city may not have a major port or proximity to a major metropolis, assets that other once-industrial New Jersey cities have used to reinvent themselves. But it does have what is a rarity in New Jersey, said George D. Sowa, the chief executive officer of an organization called Greater Trenton: affordability. Mr. Sowa’s group has spearheaded economic development in Trenton, recruiting companies and even pitching Trenton as a location for Amazon’s second headquarters. As he ran his hand over a map, Mr. Sowa spoke of how the city could attract a company like Amazon, pointing to Trenton’s many train lines and proximity to Newark Liberty Airport, but also to its old warehouses, vast brick relics of the city’s past. “You can almost get a building here in Trenton for free,” he said. Mr. Sowa cited the Chambersburg neighborhood, where an industrial property was recently transformed into the Roebling Lofts, as proof that the adage of developers — bring the artists and the money will follow — could prove true in Trenton, too. The Art All Night event has played a central role in that transformation. “When we started this 12 years ago, Trenton was a little bit of a different town,” said Joseph Kuzemka, the event director. “Art All Night was the initial event that brought all those great minds together — the catalyst that brought these artists and art groups to work together in other projects as well.” Those projects have included a concert series and the Trenton Punk Rock Flea Market. This year, more than 25,000 people were expected to attend Art All Night, which was held at the 50,000-square-foot Roebling Wire Works, once a factory that supplied wire cables for the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges. Still, Trenton faces a host of issues — a poverty rate of nearly 28 percent and a median household income of around $34,400, well below the state average. The city has also suffered from chronic disinvestment from the state. State aid was slashed under former Gov. Chris Christie even as he poured millions into the renovation of the State House. Its only hotel shut down in 2017. Many of the city’s restaurants and bars, including Pete Lorenzo’s Cafe, a well-known steakhouse, also vanished. Mayor Eric Jackson pointed to a major accomplishment of his tenure: the city’s first Starbucks. The mayor’s office noted that Trenton is also hurt by the state’s exemption from paying property taxes on the large tracts of land it owns downtown. The city has also been hobbled in its efforts to stem crime by policing cutbacks. In 2011, 108 police officers were laid off, leading to a big spike in crime in 2012. Today, the Trenton Police Department has 290 officers, down from 379 about a decade ago — a number that some say is insufficient to confront a steady stream of weapons coming in from out-of-state. “They’re short-handed. They’re spread thin,” said Regina Thompson-Jenkins, 51, an educator and a volunteer for Everytown for Gun Safety whose 19-year-old son was killed by gunfire in Trenton six years ago. The police director, Ernest Parrey Jr., pointed to a recent decline in the number of homicides and shootings. Still, gun violence has continued to plague the city. In a 2017 report, the mayor’s office said that since 2014 the authorities collected more than 1,700 firearms in a state-funded buyback program and seized more than 230 in arrests and investigations. Gangs were once a larger menace in the city, but still remain a presence. On Sunday morning, the forces shaping Trenton collided. The arts festival grew rowdy after midnight, the Mercer County prosecutor’s office said, and had to be shut down by the police after fistfights broke out. Then shots rang out shortly before 3 a.m. The one fatality, Tahaij Wells, 32, one of the gunmen, was shot by the police. He had a long arrest record and had been released from prison in February on parole, the prosecutor’s office said. Officials said another suspect, Amir Armstrong, 23, had been charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and was being treated for injuries from the shooting. A third suspect, whom officials did not name, was also injured in the shooting, but there were not yet charges filed against him. About two dozen people were injured, two of whom were in critical condition, according to hospital officials. The day after the event, questions remained unanswered over the nature of the confrontation and how the police and officials responded to a warning that had gone out on Facebook the night of the event. “Please, please don’t go to Art All Night!,” it said. “They’re going to be shooting it up!” The shooting came days after Governor Philip D. Murphy signed six new gun laws making New Jersey’s restrictions among the most stringent in the country. Ana Lozada, a kindergarten teacher whose friends attended the event, recalled their accounts of the mayhem. “Everyone was screaming,’’ she said. “One lady instead of going out, she found a little hiding place inside and locked the door. She was with her child.” “We try to be positive but you see, suddenly, your life could be over,’’ she added. “Your life could be over just because some crazy people came to the event where we go every year.” On Monday, Mr. Murphy vowed to focus on the needs of the city where he works, telling reporters, “I’m not going to turn my back on Trenton.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Grifters Gonna Grift,"Editorial The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. This is shaping up to be another red-letter week for Draining the Swamp. On Monday, Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, splashed back into the news when members of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s team accused him in court papers of witness tampering. Swamp-watchers will recall that Mr. Manafort is facing a smorgasbord of charges related to tax, lobbying and money-laundering violations. Prosecutors now say that he has been using his free time while awaiting trial to try to contact some former European business associates in order to coach them into lying about his work on behalf of pro-Russia political interests in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort’s secret lobbying scheme is alleged to have been impressively elaborate — as, also, efforts to cover it up. But the straightforward phrase that leaps out from this latest court filing comes from a witness telling the F.B.I. that Mr. Manafort had tried to “suborn perjury.” Such an effort would qualify as a definite legal no-no. Meanwhile, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has once again burnished his reputation as the Trump administration’s biggest grifter. On Monday, Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, to subpoena the E.P.A. for documents relating to Mr. Pruitt’s “multiple abuses of authority in using agency staff for his own personal purposes.” Specifically, Democrats want to know more about Mr. Pruitt’s reportedly asking his agency scheduler, Millan Hupp, to handle various tasks for him, including finding him a new place to live last summer — a monthslong, labor-intensive process — and trying to help him buy a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The mattress caper was, at least, more exotic than Mr. Pruitt’s usual shopping misadventures — the nearly $10,000 to decorate his office, the dozen customized fountain pens for $1,560, the $43,000 soundproof phone booth. It even could be seen as a positive sign that he has abandoned his spendthrift ways. No matter: By Tuesday, Mr. Pruitt’s furnishing needs became old news when it was revealed that he had also asked an aide to help his wife, Marlyn, procure a Chick-fil-A franchise. Calls were arranged and the application process begun, but Mrs. Pruitt never did open a restaurant. Now, as delicious as Chick-fil-A may be, using the agency’s staff to run one’s personal errands is, of course, a breach of ethics rules. Which may explain in part why, as The Washington Post reported, Mr. Pruitt took it upon himself to contact the C.E.O. of Concordia, a nonprofit in New York, to scare up work for his wife. According to its chief executive, Matthew Swift, Mrs. Pruitt received a few thousand dollars to help organize Concordia’s annual conference last year. And so Mr. Pruitt continues to dazzle with his inventive capacity for misusing his position. To be fair, the E.P.A. chief is hardly the only official in Washington who’s been testing ethical boundaries. Just a few days before he announced last week that he would not seek re-election, Representative Tom Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, was publicly accused by former aides of turning his staff into “personal servants.” Likewise, Mr. Manafort is not alone in playing fast and loose with lobbying rules. One of the more enlightening aspects of his indictment, in fact, was how it revealed the extent to which the K Street crowd dismisses as a joke the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires Americans lobbying on behalf of foreign entities to disclose who is paying them. Mr. Manafort’s experience prompted nervous chatter among his fellow lobbyists as to whether his high-profile case would bring greater scrutiny of, and a crackdown on, FARA abuses more broadly. More often than not, however, such misbehavior stays in the shadows. Or, when it comes to light, it’s shrugged off as politics as usual. It takes something — or someone — pretty special to cut through the white noise of cynicism that surrounds Washington. Which is precisely what the Trump era is providing: a breathtaking, overly vivid circus of conflicts of interests, abuses of office, ethical lapses and breaches of democratic norms that has captured the public’s attention with its audacity. Some of this stems from the Russia investigation. In examining how Mr. Trump’s inner circle operates, Mr. Mueller is uncovering all manner of questionable dealings — some of them illegal, others merely appalling. That said, the Trump Effect extends beyond the Mueller inquiry and into the shameless, often hapless characters with whom this president surrounds himself. Let’s not forget, among others, Tom Price (private jets), John McEntee (financial crimes) or Rob Porter (spousal abuse) — and down, down the drain they go. When candidate Trump vowed to drain the swamp, he most likely didn’t do so with the thought of targeting his own cadre of aides and advisers. But whatever his intentions, the Trump era is proving to be a master class in the many ways to abuse power — and the many ways to get busted for it.",The New York Times
2018,Grilling Turns Back to an Ancient Fuel: Wood,"When the Miami restaurateur Michael Schwartz opened his South American-inspired restaurant, Amara at Paraiso, in January, he made a wood-burning Jade grill the focal point of the kitchen. When Curtis Stone, the Australian butcher turned chef and TV host, opened Gwen in Los Angeles, he installed not one, but two wood-burning grills — an Argentinian fire pit and a Uruguayan-style braseiro — alongside a charcoal-burning Josper oven. And when Missy Robbins conceived her Brooklyn restaurant, Lilia, she situated the hearth — complete with a Grillworks wood-burning grill — on the path to the dining room. “People gather around it the way they would at a fireplace in someone’s home,” she said. The world’s oldest cooking method has become one of its newest culinary quests. While there’s nothing novel about wood-burning grills in restaurants (Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters have used them for decades), what is new is the zeal of the chefs using them, the variety of equipment now available, and the growing number of American home cooks who are forsaking gas and charcoal to master the ancient art of grilling over a wood fire in their backyards. One such convert is Marco Birch, a Manhattan financier by day and ardent wood griller on weekends. “We discovered parrilla grilling during a bike trip to Argentina,” he recalled. “The sparks and flames grabbed our attention; the unique earthy smoke flavor of the meat sealed the deal.” So Mr. Birch bought a 48-inch NorthFork Ironworks parrilla (an Argentinian-style wood-burning grill) from Brendan McCarthy, a grill builder and fly-fishing guide in Greenport, N.Y. Mr. McCarthy had experienced his own wood-fire epiphany during an outing with the grill maestro Francis Mallmann, who has restaurants in South America, France and Miami. “Propane has no flavor, and charcoal isn’t much better,” Mr. McCarthy said. “The aroma and flavor of wood are in a league of their own.” That flavor comes from the high, dry heat of a wood fire (1,000 degrees or more), which caramelizes the proteins in meats and the plant sugars in fruits and vegetables. But wood-grilled foods get even more of their distinctive flavor and edge from the fragrant smoke. “Wood smoke contains more than a thousand flavor-producing compounds,” said Nathan Myhrvold, the former Microsoft executive who has become an evangelist for modernist cooking. That list of chemicals includes creosol (associated with the smoky peat flavor of Scotch whisky), syringol (responsible for clovelike flavors), and vanillin (source of a vanilla-ish sweetness in smoke). By the time wood becomes charcoal, Dr. Myhrvold said, 99 percent of those compounds are lost. That’s why a wood fire delivers so much more flavor than charcoal. “Almost any hardwood is good for grilling, but avoid evergreens, like spruce and pine, which put out a black sooty smoke that tastes like turpentine,” he said. Wood grilling is very different from traditional barbecue, although both start with burning logs. In a barbecue pit, the food smokes at a low heat away from the fire for intervals measured in half-days. Grilling is a rapid process in which the food sizzles directly over the fire. “Grilling gives you loud, sharp Maillard flavors you simply can’t achieve in a smoker,” said the Texas barbecue expert Aaron Franklin, referring to the Maillard reaction, which produces complex savory flavors as food browns. (Mr. Franklin and his partner Tyson Cole installed a state-of-the-art 72-inch Grillworks wood-burning grill, and two traditional J & R Oyler barbecue pits, at their Austin restaurant Loro, which opened in April.) Traditionally, people grilled with the wood that grew in their area. In much of North and South America and Europe, that means oak — a clean, hot-burning wood with a smoke that’s robust enough to stand up to red meat, yet mild enough not to overpower poultry or seafood. Southerners burn hickory; Californians use almond wood; Pacific Northwesterners burn cherry and alder. Mesquite — the go-to wood in Hawaii, the American Southwest and northern Mexico — emits a strong-tasting smoke and pyrotechnic sparks that, depending on your level of pyromania, you’ll find thrilling or disconcerting. Grill with a single wood, Mr. Franklin suggested: “When you mix woods, you can’t really pinpoint the flavor.” The cooking properties and smoke flavor vary subtly from wood to wood, but less than you might think. For Ben Eisendrath, the chief executive of Grillworks, the species matters less than using split, seasoned, appropriate-size logs — seasoned because dry wood burns more efficiently than green, split because the wood ignites more easily, and sized to fit in your grill, which means smaller than what you generally burn in your fireplace. Mr. Eisendrath recommends logs that are 10 to 12 inches long and two to three inches wide. He also recommends mixing lump charcoal with wood in a ratio of about 30 percent to 70 percent to produce a hotter, more even-burning fire. When it comes to lighting the fire, channel your inner Scout. Stack the wood log-cabin style with plenty of air space between logs. Light twisted newspaper and kindling in the center. Another popular method is to light natural lump charcoal in a chimney starter, then arrange the wood (smaller pieces first, then larger) atop the embers. Speaking of chimney starters, there is a stunningly simple way to grill over wood that requires little more than a common kettle grill. Fill your chimney not with charcoal, but hardwood chunks (oak, hickory, apple, cherry and such, the sort sold at hardware stores for smoking). Light the chimney as you would for charcoal: in 20 minutes, you’ll be grilling over wood embers. Wood chunks burn faster than charcoal, so you’ll need to replenish them often. Lighting a second chimney will give you more hot coals at the ready. (When wood-grilling in a kettle grill, never close the lid, or your food will become unbearably smoky.) The chief challenge in grilling over wood is heat control. To increase or decrease the heat on an Argentinian-style parrilla grill, like the Grillworks or NorthFork, simply raise or lower the grill grate with the flywheel. When wood grilling in a fixed-grate grill, like a kettle grill, build a tiered fire with embers piled thicker to one side or at the back of the firebox and spread more sparsely in the center, with an ember-free safety zone away from the coals. Control the heat by moving the food closer to or farther away from the fire. On a fixed-grate grill with a braseiro (an open metal basket for burning logs to embers), simply rake more or fewer coals under the food. Another way to boost the heat is to oxygenate the fire. Mr. Stone uses an ingenious tool called a Blow Poke, a long metal tube you blow through to direct air to a specific part of the fire. (It also comes with a claw at the end for raking the coals.) You’ll look like you’re playing trumpet to some deity of fire. Alternatively, ventilate the fire with a fan or a hair dryer. Remember this simple formula: more air, hotter fire; less air, cooler fire. Wood-burning grills are incredibly versatile. You can grill over flaming logs, the way you might roast marshmallows over a campfire. Or grill over glowing embers, much as you would over charcoal. Use a flame-forward fire for chicken breasts, fish fillets, thin steaks — foods that benefit from high heat and a pronounced smoke flavor. The ember method gives you a steadier, more predictable heat source, well suited to grilling bread, pizza, thick steaks and chops, and high-moisture vegetables. Most chefs use both techniques. Mr. Franklin slow-smokes bavette on a rack high above the fire, then sears it over embers. Mr. Schwartz does most of his grilling over embers, periodically adding fresh logs to the fire to maintain a steady stream of flavorful smoke. Ms. Robbins roasts potatoes in front of the fire for a soulful twist on baked potatoes, and often grills caveman-style — directly on the embers. “A wood burning grill is such a simple piece of equipment,” she said. “But even after two years, we’re still finding new ways to use it.” Whichever fuel you use or method for controlling the heat, be prepared to take your time. “This is not like cooking on a conventional grill,” Mr. Birch said. “It’s a mesmerizing process and a communal ritual that takes the better part of the day.” Recipes: Grilled Swordfish Kebabs With Golden Raisin Chimichurri | Grilled Summer Beans With Garlic and Herbs | Grilled Pork Chops With Peanuts, Sesame and Cilantro Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,Opinion | Grim Trends in Good Times,"Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist In the United States in the years after the Great Recession, pessimists had a lot of material to work with. Economic doomsayers looked at the stubbornly elevated unemployment rate and discerned a depressing new normal, in which technological and social change had rendered many Americans simply unemployable, and stagnation and sclerosis loomed ahead. Social pessimists looked at the disarray in working-class culture, the retreat from marriage and child rearing and civic and religious life, the spread of loneliness and depression and addiction, and saw a society where ordinary forms of flourishing were slipping out of reach. Five years ago it was easy to tell a story where these two problems were straightforwardly conjoined, with economic disappointment driving social dysfunction and vice versa. More recently, though, the problems have partially decoupled. The deepest economic pessimists have turned out to be wrong, for now at least, about how fast the 21st-century American economy can grow and how many jobs it can create. But as the economic picture has improved, the social picture hasn’t. The birthrate keeps declining, the opioid epidemic is dragging down American life expectancy, young people’s mental health seems to be worsening, and new data showing a rising suicide rate offered a grim accompaniment this week to the tragedies of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain. Since this column sometimes inclines to grim readings of our situation, it’s important to stress how genuinely good recent economic trends have been. Yes, structural problems are still present — wage growth should be faster, work-force participation should be higher. But a lot of commentary circa 2012 seemed to assume that unemployment might never get down below 4 percent, either because Obamacare was killing jobs and a debt crisis was looming, or because Republican obstruction was sabotaging the economy, or because technological change was automating too many jobs and dooming the less-skilled to the dole. Most of this looks wrong now. Deficits haven’t crushed growth and Obamacare hasn’t kept people from going back to work. Economic inequality isn’t throttling the economy; indeed, as Michael Strain pointed out for Bloomberg News this week, inequality has stopped rising over the last decade or so, and if you include government transfers it’s going down. The robots may take all our jobs eventually, but not just yet. The idea that only some truly radical move — a federal job guarantee, some sort of libertarian shock therapy — could deliver us back to full employment looks less persuasive than it did five years ago. And yet: The hope that material growth would heal our social problems hasn’t been vindicated so far. And as long as that’s the case, the improved economy shouldn’t be treated just as an end unto itself, but as an opportunity to look for social cures as well. For policymakers, that quest for healing starts with not doing any harm. If the economy is really cooking for the first time in almost 20 years, well, then let it cook. Don’t freak out about deficits in the absence of inflation; don’t draw up plans to nationalize the labor force; don’t start an ill-conceived trade war; don’t revive centrist dreams about cutting Social Security or suddenly increasing low-wage immigration. Instead, see how far this expansion can go and how high it can lift people before making any sweeping, ideologically driven moves. And to the extent that you do make moves, design them for the social crisis — whether that means wage subsidies or a larger child tax credit or opioid-related interventions or something else that might shore up Middle America’s crumbling foundations. Then, beyond the realm of legislation, there are various ways our civic institutions can take the grimmer social trends more seriously. For instance, instead of just letting themselves be carried along by information-age propaganda, our schools and colleges should look harder at the ways in which the smartphone era might be making social life worse among the young — increasing isolation, worsening depression and anxiety and suicidal ideation, bringing up a generation that’s well behaved in certain ways but strangely ill equipped to befriend and mate and marry. Likewise America’s churches, whose weakening is part of the story of growing anomie, should recognize the new mission fields that social disintegration has created here at home — in once-pious working-class neighborhoods, or among the lonely late-middle aged and isolated elderly. (Pursuing these new missions would also be easier if liberals could recognize that their post-Obergefell culture war against conservative religious institutions does its own kind of damage to the social fabric.) Of course, the wall-to-wall frenzy of the Trump era, in which everyone is constantly being asked to take sides in a battle to the death, makes these kinds of cultural efforts harder to formulate and pursue. But they’re what our moment, with its partially regained prosperity and ongoing cultural crisis, may be asking of us — because this welcome growth won’t last forever, and social problems unsolved now will be that much worse when it is gone.",The New York Times
2018,Group of 7 Looks for Relevance as It Gathers in Canada,"Seven nations are getting together to discuss gender equality with a leader who once bragged about grabbing women’s genitals, pluralism and tolerance with politicians who have promised to turn away refugees, and economic cooperation with a country severing ties with its neighbors. What could go wrong? Welcome to the Group of 7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, a gathering of the leaders of seven countries that once dominated the world economy, but now struggle with the forces of globalization they helped to unleash. Expectations are low that the summit meeting on Friday and Saturday will produce much more than photo ops of Quebec scenery. It is likely to highlight a decline in the effectiveness of organizations designed to resolve international conflicts, like the World Trade Organization or the United Nations. “Multilateralism is in crisis,” said Dennis Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany. “We have a number of international organizations that are either stalemated or their representation is not fit for the present day.” The members of the Group of 7 — the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — once stood together against communism. But now they are often in conflict with each other and struggling to prove their relevance amid China’s growing power. The agenda put together by Canada, this year’s host, would not have provoked much controversy a few years ago. Women’s empowerment. Climate change. Adapting to the changing nature of work. But the old assumptions about shared values no longer apply. This is the era of a president who is reputed to have had an affair with a pornographic film actress and left the Paris climate accord. It is a time of surging populism in Europe. President Trump did not do much to promote a feel-good atmosphere in Charlevoix with his plans to impose punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the other six Group of 7 members. Late in May, Mr. Trump went even further, taking steps to impose tariffs on imported automobiles, a measure that would strike Germany especially hard. But Mr. Trump is not the only source of tension. Europe is also divided from within. Britain is in the midst of a divorce from the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will attend the summit meeting on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, as will Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, which consists of the heads of states of European Union countries. In Italy, the two strongest parties in recent elections were a protest party and hard-right nationalists who promised to crack down on illegal immigration and end sanctions against Russia. They, too, were on a collision course with the European Union after threatening to violate its budget rules to fulfill populist campaign promises. Even without those tensions, the group’s relevance has been declining. The members of the club once ruled the world stage. But their share of the global economy has fallen from more than two thirds in the early 1990s to less than half. The group accounts for only about 10 percent of the world’s population, and many Group of 7 societies are aging. The diminished stature of the Group of 7 countries raises questions about their claim to make decisions on global issues. The Group of 7 has already largely been eclipsed by the Group of 20, which includes China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, and more closely represents the way that wealth and people are distributed. “What can the G-7 do that the G-20 cannot?” said Mr. Snower, who is president and founder of the Kiel Institute’s Global Solutions Initiative, an alliance of research institutes around the world that aims to provide advice to the Group of 20. “Where is the G-7 more legitimate than the G-20?” Mr. Snower said. “That’s not obvious at all.” Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did not even mention the Charlevoix meeting at a conference organized by Mr. Snower’s group on May 28. “Global issues can only be solved globally,” Ms. Merkel said, adding that her view “is not shared by everyone.” In an obvious reference to Mr. Trump, Ms. Merkel said: “Multilateral action is currently under pressure, indeed in crisis. It is challenged by protectionism and isolationist thinking.” Is there any point in getting together at all? The Canadians, who last hosted the Group of 7 summit meeting in 2010, will try to find enough common ground to reach agreement on enough issues to claim success. The themes of the meeting, which Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, announced on Facebook in December, are vague enough to leave some leeway. Who could possibly be against “building a more peaceful and secure world”? “We must work together to create meaningful solutions to the problems we face as a planet,” Mr. Trudeau said in a statement as part of a pre-meeting report by the G-7 Research Group at the University of Toronto, a network of people who study the gatherings. Even though the Trump administration has repudiated the Paris climate accord, there could be agreement on issues like curtailing plastics pollution in the oceans, or protecting coastlines from hurricane damage, said John Kirton, director of the research group. According to Mr. Kirton, there may even be progress on gender issues, despite the Trump administration’s attempts to deny funding for birth control programs. Last year’s summit meeting in Taormina, Sicily, last year, may serve as a guide. Afterward, the leaders, including Mr. Trump, issued a communiqué in favor of promoting more women to leadership positions in government and business, and promoting entrepreneurship by women. The Taormina communiqué avoided terms like “reproductive rights” that would rile Mr. Trump’s right-wing base. “One can think of it as the Ivanka Trump agenda,” Mr. Kirton said, referring to the president’s daughter. “There is more to be done,” he said, including promoting better education for girls. Mr. Kirton, who takes an optimistic view of the summit meeting, even sees potential in its goal of “growth that works for everyone,” a slogan that can be given a Trumpian, populist spin. “There Trudeau and Trump are very much aligned — bringing economic benefits to the working class,” Mr. Kirton said. Even when they dislike each other, the group’s leaders usually manage to issue communiqués that gloss over their differences. It may help that, except for a limited number of pool reporters, the news media will be in Quebec City, about 50 miles from Charlevoix. The meeting’s venue is so rural that much of the surrounding region had little or no cellphone coverage or broadband internet until local infrastructure was upgraded for the event. The distance between the leaders and the media may make it harder for journalists to report on points of conflict and harder for political leaders to grandstand. But some leaders have signaled that they do not plan to avoid sensitive topics like trade or the Paris accord. In a statement for the G-7 Research Group’s report, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but alluded to areas where Europe and Mr. Trump disagree sharply. Mr. Macron said the Paris agreement was “a vital necessity,” that “we must have free and fair trade,” and that the leaders should “defend the achievements of multilateralism.” “A century after the end of the Great War, let us not repeat the errors of the past,” Mr. Macron said. “Let us remain vigilant, moved by a desire to take collective, pragmatic and effective action.”",The New York Times
2018,Growing Up Getty,"A fabled family finds their showbiz portrayals “demonizing,” “disgusting” and unrepresentative of their super-L.G.B.T.Q. values. BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — The Getty family is known for many things. A welcome to prying eyes is not one of them. Invite a reporter to run a tape recorder in the living room? Are you insane? Like other journalists over the decades, he will delight in dredging up their darkest stuff — the drug addictions, the Shakespearean dysfunction, the tragic kidnapping and ransom drama that they’ve spent 45 years trying to forget. Yet there I was, sitting across from Ariadne Getty, 55, at her dining room table as she took careful sips of chicken noodle soup. She was flanked by her son, August, a budding fashion designer with a substantial spray tan, and by her daughter, Nats, a tattooed, terrifyingly no-nonsense artist and street wear entrepreneur. Also seated at the table on this spring day were two publicists, a brown Chihuahua named Bandit and Sarah Kate Ellis, the chief executive of Glaad, the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group. “I’m a super-shy introvert — this is not my comfort zone,” Ms. Getty said in a light Italian accent when I mentioned that she seemed nervous. (Why all the reinforcements?) She took a deep breath as Auggie, as she called him, gave her a back rub. “But I do want to change the narrative of what’s out there about us,” she said. “Our family has been under attack.” Ms. Getty’s grandfather, the infamous oilman and art collector J. Paul Getty, built the family dynasty in the 1950s. Her brother, J. Paul Getty III, was the one held for ransom. In 1973, when Ms. Getty was 11 years old, he was abducted by a crime syndicate and chained to a stake in a cave. He was eventually released (his grandfather begrudgingly agreed to pay a reduced ransom), although not before having one of his ears sliced off and mailed to an Italian newspaper. He died in 2011. Over the last six months, that tragic episode has twice been repackaged and sold as entertainment. First came Ridley Scott’s “All the Money in the World,” a film marketed with the snarky tagline “Everyone Wants a Cut” and starring Christopher Plummer, who was nominated for an Oscar. (He stepped in at the last minute, replacing the disgraced Kevin Spacey.) Then FX rolled out “Trust,” a series starring Donald Sutherland as Grandpa Getty, complete with pet tiger, and depicting the family as greedy schemers. “It’s demonizing,” August, 24, said. “It’s disgusting,” added Nats, 25, almost in a hiss. Ms. Getty pressed her hands to her forehead like it was all too much. “It doesn’t represent our values,” she said of the FX series in particular, noting that she had hired Hollywood’s foremost legal pit bull, Marty Singer, to battle the network, which is weighing a second season. (FX did not respond to requests for comment.) Ms. Getty and her children — it’s just the three of them, after Ms. Getty’s divorce from Justin Williams, an actor, more than 15 years ago — also feel under attack in a political sense. August and Nats are gay. Loudly and proudly. And they are none too happy about efforts by the Trump administration to roll back civil rights for gay and transgender people. Neither is their mother, who has quietly become a major financial supporter of gay-rights organizations like Glaad — sort of a modern-day Judith Peabody, who hailed from an old-money family and who went all-in for gay causes in New York at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. “I’m terrified by the hate that has been unleashed by this administration,” Ms. Getty said. “People who have hated in the shadows but who now feel that they can be more public — there has been a big increase in L.G.B.T.Q. discrimination. I’m so upset about it that I can’t sleep at night.” In addition to donating millions of dollars to organizations like the Los Angeles LGBT Center in recent years, Ms. Getty pledged $15 million to Glaad in February as part of a campaign by Ms. Ellis to raise $100 million. Ms. Getty’s gift will go to the newly created Glaad Institute, which trains volunteers across the country to use the media (social media in particular) to push for equality and battle homophobia. “She’s building us an army,” Ms. Ellis said. Ms. Getty’s eyes welled up. “I don’t think that I have many people that I would be able to call a friend,” Ms. Getty said. “But with Sarah Kate she’s proven to me time and again that friendship comes first, which is a great feeling. I haven’t had that in a long time.” Although she eventually loosened up, Ms. Getty proved maddeningly adept at avoiding certain topics. If you want to know what her childhood was like, you will not find the answer here. But she lived up to her offer — to open her door a crack, offering a glimpse of the Gettys as you have never seen them. Ms. Getty’s primary residence these days is a 6,000-square-foot, $24.5 million apartment atop the Montage Beverly Hills, a luxury hotel with a Spanish Colonial design. On the March day when I first visited, a powerfully built security guard greeted me in the hallway. Bags from designer boutiques like Maxfield cluttered the foyer. There was a photo of Ms. Getty and Ms. Ellis at the last World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where they presented Glaad research showing that social acceptance of homosexuality is declining. The living room exuded a fun eccentricity. A pair of teacup Jeff Koons balloon dogs in silver and copper frolicked on a monumental coffee table. Positioned in a corner of the room was a white flocked Christmas tree with ribbons cascading from its tip. Three stuffed polar bears (a mother and her cubs) stood next to the tree on a dark antique rug. “It’s not still up because I’m depressed,” Ms. Getty said. “Auggie did the tree as a present, and it’s just too cute to take down.” Ms. Getty, who has a longtime life partner, Louie Rubio, a successful music producer and songwriter, is extraordinarily close to August and Nats, whose names are tattooed on her body. In addition to her philanthropic work, Ms. Getty is the chief executive of August’s fashion business, August Getty Atelier, and serves in the same role for Strike Oil, a street wear line with a philanthropic twist that Nats will introduce in the fall. “All of our friends call her Mama G,” August said. “It’s not uncommon for one of us to walk into the living room and see one of our friends who we haven’t seen in a solid three months, and they’re just watching TV with my mom.” Nats said, “Once, I came out at, like, midnight, and there were six drag queens. They were like, ‘We’re here to see your mom. Go back to bed.’” (Nats and August have their own homes in Los Angeles but often sleep over.) The extra-close connection between Ms. Getty and her children did not strike me as weird. It must be difficult to find people who understand what it means to live as a Getty. Not only do they breathe rarefied air, they also must contend with “the curse” — the stubborn tabloid narrative that wealth has forever doomed the family to tragedy and scandal. Ms. Getty clearly feels pressure to avoid adding proof points. “Any parent could take a lesson from Ari in raising children — her love, her compassion,” said Caitlyn Jenner, whose work for transgender rights has brought her into Ms. Getty’s orbit. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but her kids are remarkable. Unapologetically themselves.” It’s a little hard to miss. Nats has an unmistakable energy, kind of a magnetic force, that makes her seem exciting and a bit dangerous: Come too close and you might get zapped, for better or worse. Tattoos on her arms read, “Forgive me father, for I have sinned” and “Things turned out so evil.” She is engaged to Gigi Gorgeous, who became a YouTube star by documenting her gender transition. August, who is single, has compared himself to a unicorn, “halfway between fantasy and reality,” as he told Los Angeles Confidential magazine in early 2015, not long after unveiling his first collection at New York Fashion Week. (He has since dressed celebrities including Katy Perry, Miranda Kerr and Rachel McAdams.) Like his sister, whom he calls his muse, August has a brooding intensity. But I found him more eager to please. “Growing up, I was swinging from trees and skateboarding and, like, busting my teeth the day before school pictures,” Nats said. “And August would be inside making these incredible, whimsical fantasies for his Barbies. He’s my best friend, my father figure, my mentor.” August and Nats, which is short for Natalia, let it all hang out. He readily shared his coming-out story with me. (He was 15, and it involved a room-service waiter at the Sunset Tower Hotel.) She displays an affinity for pasties and cigarettes on Instagram, where she has 130,000 followers. Their mother is more of an enigma. At times, details would pour out of Ms. Getty, as when she told a story about living with Cher in the 1980s. They met through a mutual friend. “She said, ‘Mi casa es su casa,’ and I took it literally and moved in,” Ms. Getty said. “But there was one catch that I learned the hard way. You couldn’t so much as say the F-word. I’m talking about ‘food.’ The refrigerator had to be bare. I finally moved out because I was starving.” Born in Rome, Ms. Getty spent much of her time as a child outside Siena. She attended Bennington College in Vermont and initially pursued a career as an artist, exhibiting hand-colored photographs at a SoHo gallery in 1988. But Ms. Getty, who has none of the arrogance so often oozed by the ultrarich, was not willing to talk about her childhood. Nor about her ex-husband. Nor about the rest of the Getty clan, including her nephew, Balthazar, the actor, or her brother Mark, a founder of Getty Images. (Ms. Getty has a close relationship with all of her relatives, according to a spokeswoman.) Every once in a while, a revealing tidbit would slip through. When I asked her why she had become so involved with Glaad — a member of the board, she will soon host a series of fund-raising dinners around the world — Ms. Getty spoke about the need to bring down some of her own walls. “I have said ‘no’ so many times in my life,” she said. “It left me isolated. Lonely.” And there was this tiny comment, given as she talked about encouraging August and Nats to embrace their authentic selves: “When you are raised in a family like this one, who you are as a person … you can be overshadowed.” Ms. Getty and her brood use a converted warehouse in Culver City, not far from where “Gone With the Wind” was filmed, for their offices. You will know that you’re in the right place if you see racks of red-carpet gowns and a pink, blue and red neon sign on the wall: AUGUST GETTY ATELIER. The rear of the sun-filled building serves as Nats’s studio. There are cans of spray paint, markers and a printer that looks big enough to spit out an entire billboard. This is also home to Strike Oil, an incipient street wear line overseen by Nats and featuring her artwork. Items will range from trucker hats ($48) to hand-painted clothing “priced upon request.” After I begged to see Ms. Getty in motion, she invited me to sit in on a Strike Oil meeting in April. Another session, one dedicated to her philanthropic work, would follow. When I arrived, the first meeting was already underway. Nats slouched at one end of a glass table scrutinizing photos of planned merchandise. William Anzevino, the chief brand director, was there, as were four more employees. Instead of attending in person, Ms. Getty appeared over video feed from the Montage. (August was sitting behind his computer across the room, drinking water from a goblet.) My ears perked up when Ms. Getty started grilling the group about expected costs. “Just so you know,” she told Nats, “I’m not going to give any wiggle room.” Then came a long discussion about how to make Strike Oil “synonymous with inclusion and social change,” as Nats put it. (Something of a brand tagline appears on the Strike Oil website: “It’s not just a lifestyle. It’s a thought process.”) They agreed that a portion of sales would go to charity, but they decided to postpone selecting one. “I feel good about this,” Ms. Getty said at the conclusion. Nats also deemed the meeting a success. “Gangster,” she said, grinning and decamping for a smoke. I drove to the Montage, 15 minutes away, for the second session. I arrived to find Ms. Getty and Leigh Vales, the vice president of the Ariadne Getty Foundation, camped on sofas in the back of the hotel’s Garden Bar, where they were discussing logistics for the series of Glaad fund-raising dinners. “Another Bellini for you, Ms. Getty?” a server asked. She declined. The platter of cubed salami could stay, though. I blurted out a comment about the eye-popping Boucheron ring Ms. Getty was wearing. It was in the shape of a polar bear, with white diamonds as fur. “Mama protecting her cubs,” Ms. Getty said with a smile. The Getty family is well known for its philanthropy. Ms. Getty’s father, for instance, gave hundreds of millions of dollars to British art institutions. Ms. Getty delved into charitable work after his 2003 death. Her first foundation, Fuserna, gave small amounts of money to a wide range of organizations. (One was Big Apple Greeter, a nonprofit that offers tours of New York neighborhoods to tourists.) She retrenched in 2016, renaming the foundation and focusing on bigger gifts to a smaller number of causes. Glaad has been the primary beneficiary. Ms. Getty plans to host the Glaad dinners in seven cities around the world this year, expanding to 14 next year. “One should be in China,” she said, as Ms. Vales took notes. “About 15 people at each. We don’t want the intimacy to be lost.” The conversation wandered to Ms. Getty’s work with the Better World Fund, which supports United Nations causes like refugees and gender inequality. She joined the Better World board in 2016 and has traveled to refugee camps in countries including Uganda, where she financed the purchase of 280 generators called “solar suitcases” that medical workers use — in particular to deliver babies — in areas with no electricity. Ms. Getty made that gift contingent on Uganda reversing a December 2013 law criminalizing homosexuality. A Ugandan court struck down the anti-gay law in August 2014. But enough of that talk. Ms. Getty wanted to return to the topic of Glaad. The Glaad Media Awards, a major fund-raising moment for the organization, were set to take place in a few days. Would I attend as Ms. Getty’s guest? I politely declined. She kept pushing. “What if we make you up as a drag queen?” she said. “My son is great with wigs. How big do you want it?” I told Mama G that I would think it over. She gave me a bear hug. In the end, I attended the banquet and Ms. Getty did not. She fell ill, her publicist told me after I arrived. But the Gettys still made a splash. Nats and Gigi glided back and forth between their center ballroom table and the smoking patio, accompanied by a bodyguard. August was a fervent participant in the auction, gleefully bidding hundreds of thousands of dollars on items like a trip to Australia and a session with a jewelry designer. And Ms. Ellis, the Glaad chief executive, singled out Ms. Getty during an emotional speech asking for help in battling homophobia, including “sinister strikes, like when Trump said businesses can hang signs that read, ‘We don’t serve gay people.’” “You know who stepped up?” Ms. Ellis said. “Ari Getty.” An earlier version of this article misstated Mark Getty's role in the founding of Getty Images. He was a co-founder, with Jonathan Klein; he was not the sole founder.",The New York Times
2018,"Growing, Faltering, Changing, Growing: Lessons From Kay WalkingStick","Last Chance MONTCLAIR, N.J. — An artist’s career retrospective, if shaped with care, is more than a look at a life of labor. It’s also a record of contingent lives, cultural changes and a political passage in time. This is true of “Kay WalkingStick: An American Artist,” an era-spanning survey of this 83-year-old painter at the Montclair Art Museum here. Yet what powers the chronologically arranged show, first and last, is the personal: the sense it gives of one worker growing, changing, faltering, then growing and changing more. Born in 1935 in Syracuse, Ms. WalkingStick was the child of a biracial marriage: “Syracuse Girl Weds Cherokee Indian” was the headline on the report of her parents’ wedding in the local newspaper. As it turned out, she saw little of her father over the years, though her mother, Scottish-Irish by descent, made a point of instilling pride in her daughter’s Native American heritage. Ms. WalkingStick studied painting in college, and as a young wife and mother in suburban New Jersey in the 1960s, she continued to paint, keeping a close eye on what was happening in Manhattan. Among the earliest pieces in the show, from 1971, are two crisp, Pop-ish silhouette images in bright colors of female nudes. The artist herself was the model, and feminism — or at least the loosened-up spirit of it — a spur. Two years later, in 1973, at 38, she enrolled in the graduate studio program at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and started experimenting, complicating. A painting from that year called “Hudson Reflection VI,” of undulating water patterns, retains a Pop palette, introduces a landscape theme, and moves in an abstract direction. Soon afterward, now in full abstract mode, she adds political content. In the 1970s, after the 19-month occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists, the American Indian Movement was in the news. And it may have been partly in response to this, and to her father’s death at that time, that Ms. WalkingStick — an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation — introduced allusions to Native American history into her art. Her project, “Chief Joseph Series,” composed of 36 small rectangular abstract paintings, refers to the Nez Percé leader who, in 1877, after refusing to sign away Indian land to the United States government, led his people on an arduous and ultimately thwarted exodus toward Canada. Ms. WalkingStick’s series took three years to complete, largely because of its labor-intensive demands. After plotting the series in drawings, she covered each canvas with colored inks; then, using a palette knife, with multiple layers of encaustic mixed from acrylic paint and wax. Finally, she cut linear patterns into the surface to expose color strata beneath. The process, which had the repetitive rhythm of ritual, must at some points have felt like a forced march. What came out of it, though, was a complex art: abstract, but topical, even autobiographical. (Chief Joseph had been a hero to her father.) With its built-up surfaces, the series was as close to relief sculpture as to painting. Through the ’70s and into the ’80s, the heft of paintings increased with addition of more and different materials: crushed seashells, pebbles, glitter. Incised symbols became multivalent: In the large, scarlet-red “Cardinal Points,” a cross served equally as a Native American directional sign, the Morning Star and a Christian emblem. Suggestions of landscapes returned: Two 1983 paintings done in Montauk, Long Island, allude to the changing play of sunlight on sand. After spending time in the Colorado Rockies, Ms. WalkingStick began to separate out abstraction and straightforward landscape painting onto pairs of canvases joined as diptychs, a format she continues to use. The most dramatic early example was a product of personal calamity. In 1989, the year she began teaching at Cornell University, her husband of 30 years, Michael Echols, died suddenly. Plunged into grief, Ms. WalkingStick clung to painting as a steadying force and an outlet for emotions. In a diptych from that time, called “The Abyss,” the left-hand panel is an image of churning blood-red water — the “unstoppable onrush of time,” as she later described it. In the right-hand panel, a crimson escutcheon hovers, like a danger signal, against a vortex of tangled, scribbled lines. Much of the work for the next several years is somber, under a shadow. Then in the late 1990s, the mood starts to lift, around the time Ms. WalkingStick was making regular visits to Italy. She began to favor brushed-on oil paint over troweled-on or finger-worked encaustic. She introduced light-reflective gold leaf as a medium. For the first time in decades, figures appeared, some from Italian Renaissance art, others imaginary; all sensual. Diptychs were no longer necessarily divided into unalike images. In some, a single landscape stretched over both panels, and had the swells and torsions of a nude body. A charge of sexuality, explicit in the early 1970s nude self-portraits, returned. And the aura of spirituality implicit in the many radiant abstract shapes that had, for decades, floated like power generators through the work, remained ever-present. (Raised Presbyterian, Ms. WalkingStick converted to Roman Catholicism in 2000.) Present too was contact with history, personal and political. A two-panel charcoal drawing, “My Memory” (1997), records, with piercing frankness, a vision the artist had in Italy of her dead husband. The work’s unguarded anguish is like a return to the mourning diptychs of eight years earlier. And an oil stick painting, “Howitzer Hill Fusillade” (2008), with its image of a river of fire flooding a landscape, brings us back to the Chief Joseph saga in one of its most violent episodes. In the 21st century, Ms. WalkingStick has been revisiting the grand landscapes of the American West in her art, and visually reclaiming them for their rightful, Native American owners. In the diptych “Our Land” (2007), she interrupts an Alfred Bierstadt-style vista with Native American weaving designs. And in “New Mexico Desert” (2011), bands of traditional Navajo patterning float across scrub land and mesas as if surveying and protecting them. It’s the visual equivalent of hearing two very different languages, carrying the same assured and assertive message, spoken simultaneously. As if to set that tone, this beautiful painting, done with a fluidity new to Ms. WalkingStick’s art of the past decade, opens the retrospective, which originated at the National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, in 2015, organized by Kathleen Ash-Milby and David W. Penney, scholars and curators at the museum. In Washington, the show was almost twice the size of the traveling edition, which is making its final stop at Montclair. (Gail Stavitsky, the museum’s chief curator, has coordinated the installation there.) In the compressed version you inevitably lose a certain historical depth, particularly in the early phase of Ms. WalkingStick’s career, when she was first involved in the New York scene. At the same time, Montclair, by virtue of its superb permanent collection, places her in the context of 19th-century American landscape painting and 20th-century modernism in a way the Washington museum couldn’t, and that’s a gain. Most important, her essential work is here, and the chronological shape of her career is intact. The show lets us see an artist of deep curiosity and poised discipline developing an art that will let her give politics and personal history, reality and memory with equal, and eventually undivided weight. A successful retrospective should feel like a marriage of personal journal, time capsule and moral tale. This one does.",The New York Times
2018,"Guangzhou, Facebook, Kim Jong-un: Your Thursday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trouble in Guangzhou, a crackdown in Pakistan, and a stranded superluxury yacht in Dubai. Here’s what you need to know. • U.S. consulate workers fall ill in China. A crisis over a mysterious ailment sickening American diplomats and their families — first reported in Cuba — is widening. The State Department has evacuated several Americans who fell ill in Guangzhou after hearing strange noises at their apartment complexes, officials said. One of the residences is pictured above. Those stricken have reported headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other problems. Last month, one worker was reported to have brain trauma. Others are being tested. The new episode has prompted American officials to focus suspicion beyond Cuba, to perhaps China or Russia.____ • Facebook’s data sharing extended to at least four Chinese companies, our investigative team found. One is the smartphone giant Huawei, which has been flagged as a security threat by U.S. intelligence. The revelation comes on the heels of the team’s report that Facebook opened data spigots for device makers including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung, raising concerns about whether it is adhering to even its own privacy policies. Facebook, banned in China since 2009, and Huawei denied improper use or storage of the data, but Facebook said it would end its arrangement with Huawei within a week. _____ • Pakistan’s military is on a warpath. A month and a half before national elections, social media is being suppressed, media outlets disrupted and expressions of support for the civilian governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, censored or punished. Many reporters and analysts are so terrified they won’t discuss the crackdown on the record. On Tuesday, the newspaper columnist Gul Bukhari, above, was seized by armed men in a military cantonment. She was hauled off and the driver was beaten, according to the news station she had been on her way to. “This is somehow far more suffocating than martial law,” said the editor of Dawn, an English-language paper whose circulation has been impeded. “This time, the facade of democracy is there.” _____ • Kim Jong-un’s new image. Since assuming power in 2011, the young North Korean leader has cemented his grip on power with a hard-line rule that included executing and assassinating relatives and threatening the world with hydrogen bombs. But, in what our correspondent calls “one of the most striking transformations in modern diplomacy,” he’s restyling himself as an amiable diplomat and peacemaker. His popularity is surging in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in meticulously choreographed the theatrics of one of their recent meetings. And President Trump, whom he is set to meet with June 12, has gone from calling Mr. Kim a “sick puppy” to “very honorable.” _____ • In the U.S., some of the dust has settled after a bustling Primary Day in eight states.

In a recent reference to the volcanic eruption in Hawaii, the U.S. version of our Morning Briefing confused tea leaves with ti leaves. (A special mahalo to our readers in Hawaii and elsewhere who alerted us.) After correcting our mistake, we wanted to learn more. The ti plant, or lau-ki, is known scientifically as Cordyline fruticosa. It was taken to Hawaii by ancient Polynesian settlers, who believed that it had protective power. But it has been used in just about every way imaginable. Its narrow leaves grow up to two feet long and can be green, red, purple and other colors — attractive additions to leis, table settings and floral arrangements. Water runs off their waxy surfaces, so the leaves are useful for thatched roofs and footwear (and hula skirts). The plant serves both as a food wrapper and as food itself: The roots can be turned into liquor or a sweet. It has medicinal uses as well. Ti leaves are also used as offerings to Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes, in the hope of halting lava flows. Plants are placed around homes to dispel evil. Both Pele and ti leaves also play a role in a traditional sport: lava sledding. Jennifer Jett wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"Guatemala Volcano Erupts, Killing at Least 6","GUATEMALA CITY — One of Central America’s most active volcanoes erupted in fiery explosions, killing at least six people and injuring at least 20 while a towering cloud of smoke blanketed nearby villages in heavy ash. Guatemala’s national disaster coordinator, Sergio Cabañas, said an undetermined number of people were missing following the eruption of the Volcán de Fuego, about 30 miles from Guatemala City. Four people, including a disaster agency official, were killed when lava set a house on fire in El Rodeo village, Mr. Cabañas said, and two children were burned to death as they watched the volcano’s second eruption this year from a bridge. David de León, spokesman for the disaster agency, said about 300 people had evacuated the area around the volcano. Ash was falling on the Guatemala City area as well as the departments of Sacatepéquez, Chimaltenango and Escuintla, which are in south-central Guatemala around the volcano. Streets and houses were covered in the colonial town of Antigua, a popular tourist destination. Aviation authorities closed the capital’s international airport because of the danger posed to planes by the ash. The conical Volcan de Fuego is 12,346 feet (3,763 meters) above sea level at its peak.",The New York Times
2018,"Guatemala Volcano Stirs Anew, and Survivors Wait for News","ALOTENANGO, Guatemala — First the fury of the eruption, then the waiting. Two days after the Fuego volcano exploded in an undulating tower of ash, sending burning lava, rocks and gas cascading down its slopes, those who escaped waited on Tuesday for news of those they could not save. Crammed into shelters, they waited to hear if the bodies of hundreds of their missing relatives had been found — and they waited to say goodbye. A few families held funerals for loved ones, including Juan Fernando Galindo Hurtarte, the local representative for the government’s natural disaster commission, who was overtaken by the ash as he warned residents to evacuate before the eruption. In Alotenango’s town square, residents laid out a Mayan altar, placing flowers in a circle around a central flame. People left notes of condolence to the survivors. “Our faith has not been buried,” read one of them. The village whose residents Mr. Galindo had been trying to save, San Miguel Los Lotes, lay in the path of the flows that tore down the hillside on Sunday, crushing houses and tossing trucks. “This could have happened to any of us because there were too many people who shouldn’t have been there and he stayed to the last,” said a colleague, Julio Francisco Palma Figueroa, 47, at Mr. Galindo’s funeral. Firefighters who reached the hardest-hit parts of the village on Tuesday found an eerie, desertlike landscape strewn with boulders. The rescuers walked single file behind a leader testing the unstable ground with a stick, their orange uniforms a jarring contrast with the pallor of the ash. “Those people didn’t stand a chance, they were just lying there like statues,” said Armando Paredes, a 55, a volunteer firefighter who was among the first to reach the disaster zone on Sunday. ‘Their houses became their tombs.” The recovery efforts were interrupted Tuesday as a fiery mix of hot lava blocks, ash and volcanic gas coursed down the south side of the volcano. The government issued warnings that rainfall could create dangerous new flows of ash and debris down the mountainsides. Rescue workers, police officers and journalists hurried to leave the area, The Associated Press reported. Above it all, the volcano was shrouded in smoke and clouds. The death toll stood at 70 on Tuesday, but officials feared that it could grow much higher. Many of the recovered bodies were too badly burned to be identified. The nation’s disaster response agency said it knew of 192 people who were missing, and it created a website for people to report missing friends and relatives. Some asked whether the authorities had moved quickly enough to order evacuations, and whether volcano victims in villages around the mountain had been neglected. La Reunión Golf Course and Residences, a luxury resort on the volcano’s slopes, was destroyed. But unlike the villages, the resort was evacuated in time. Karin Slowing, a former planning and budget secretary for the Guatemalan government, said an independent study would be needed to determine why the evacuation did not occur earlier. One problem is that government corruption over the past decade has led to a deterioration of institutions. “There is not even a census,” Ms. Slowing said. “What evacuation plans can you have when you don’t know how many communities there are, how many people there are, how many children, how many elderly people?” Without protocols and regular drills, it is impossible to organize a swift evacuation when an eruption hits. “These aren’t things you can improvise,” she said. Fuego is one of three active volcanoes that present a risk to the communities living nearby, Ms. Slowing said, but Guatemala faces the risk of natural disaster across its territory — from earthquakes to floods — and its poorer citizens often settle in risk-prone areas. In 2015, about 270 people were buried when the wall of a ravine collapsed onto a community on the outskirts of the capital, Guatemala City. The risks to the settlement, El Cambray II, had long been known to the authorities.",The New York Times
2018,"Guatemala Volcano’s Death Toll, Now at 65, Is Likely to Rise","ANTIGUA, Guatemala — Rescue workers searched for survivors amid a desolate landscape of ash and mud on Monday, a day after a volcano erupted near the capital of Guatemala, killing at least 65 people. The number of missing after the Fuego volcano’s eruption was still unclear, according to officials with Guatemala’s natural disaster commission, known as Conred. Volunteer firefighters waded though layers of ash that reached knee-deep in places, only to find the charred remains of those who had been unable to flee the torrent of burning rock and ash that poured down the slopes of the volcano, whose name means “fire.” “We saw bodies totally, totally buried, like you saw in Pompeii,” said Dr. Otto Mazariegos, president of the Association of Municipal and Departmental Firefighters. The death toll was expected to rise, “probably in the hundreds,” Dr. Mazariegos said. Rescue workers had yet to reach sites on the south side of the volcano, which were inaccessible. As the day wore on, officials were forced to suspend some rescue operations because of the fear that the volcano might erupt again. The deep ravines on the volcano’s slopes were already filled with lava, Dr. Mazariegos said, and there was no way to tell how a new flow might spread. Published photos from morning visits to the disaster zone showed images of ordinary life frozen under a coat of gray dust. In one house, balloons and chairs were arranged for a child’s birthday party. The stillness belied the chaos of the day before, as people fled in terror before a roaring wave of destruction. Survivors who went back to the village of San Miguel los Lotes on Monday morning encountered a village turned to rubble by the force of the eruption. “My mother is buried there,” Inés López told a Guatemalan newspaper, Prensa Libre, standing amid the wreckage of his home. He was numb with grief. “What can I do to cry? My heart is hard, hard. All our family is here, buried,” he said waving his hand over the ruins. President Jimmy Morales declared three days of mourning and toured shelters and the disaster area. As he left the buried village of El Rodeo, a weeping woman approached his van and he got out to listen. “Mr. President, my family is missing,” the woman, Eufemia García, said, sobbing. “Send a helicopter to drop water from above because it is burning there. I have three children, a grandchild, all my brothers and sisters, my mother — more than 20 are missing.” The volcano, which sits less than 30 miles from Guatemala City, the capital, has been erupting since 2002, according to the Global Volcanism Program. It is a stratovolcano, like Mount St. Helens, with viscous lava that allows gas pressures to build and leads to more explosive eruptions. The intense activity began on Sunday morning, with a strong explosion shortly before noon. The volcano then continued to spew ash, rocks and gas into the air. A second powerful eruption followed at 6:45 p.m. and the activity finally subsided after 16½ hours, Guatemala’s seismology and volcanology institute said. The explosion created what is known as pyroclastic flows, mixtures of hot gas and rock that course down the slopes of the volcano at great speed, according to the Global Volcanism Program, and their high temperatures and “great mobility make them lethal to anything in their path.” At its height, the ash billowed more than a mile above the volcano’s cone, and dispersed around a radius of 15 miles, the volcanology institute said. “We heard a whoosh of the volcano, a sound we hadn’t heard before, and really strong vibrations,” said Fernando Aragón, a science teacher at a school in Antigua who lives close to the volcano outside the town of Alotenango. “We could see the people fleeing the eruption on the road outside and the heavy machinery and rescue teams making their way up,” Mr. Aragón said. Although he had been told to remain at home on Sunday because the highway was covered in ash, Conred officials asked his family to evacuate on Monday. The speed of the volcano’s flows took many people by surprise. Some stopped on the road to watch the advance of the giant ash plumes — then broke into a sprint as they realized how fast the plumes were approaching. Video posted on social media showed people speeding in cars and motorcycles down Highway 14 just ahead of great clouds of ash, which looked as though they might swallow the fleeing residents. Dr. Mazariegos said the eruption was the first in Guatemala to release such high volumes of pyroclastic flow and its accompanying gases. The gases were likely to create new hazards of eye infections and respiratory illness. The area was also at risk for acid rain, which could lead to lead poisoning as rain falls on debris, Dr. Mazariegos said. More than 3,000 people were evacuated, and 1,689 found space in shelters in the towns of Escuintla and Alotenango, Conred said. Forty-six people were hospitalized, some of them with severe burns.",The New York Times
2018,"Guatemala, North Korea, Apple: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is asserting a broad view of executive power. On Twitter, he called the appointment of the special counsel in the Russia investigation “totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!” and said he had the ability to pardon himself. Whether he has that power is unclear; no president has ever tried it. His comments followed our report on a confidential memo in which his lawyers laid out their case to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that Mr. Trump could not have obstructed justice because he has complete authority over federal investigations and could terminate the inquiry at any time. _____ 2. When Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, meets with President Trump in Singapore on June 12, infinitesimal details will be decided by tricky diplomatic negotiations. Mr. Kim also plans to meet with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, according to North Korean state media. But if diplomacy is on the move, trade issues are growing thornier. Weekend talks between the U.S. and China ended in an impasse, and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Canada issued a rare rebuke to the U.S. for hitting even allies with tariffs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in the unenviable position of trying to be a voice of moderation. _____ 3. The Supreme Court sided with a baker in Colorado who refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple in 2012. Writing for the majority in the 7-2 decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy said a state commission had “some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.” At the same time, the decision strongly reaffirmed protections for gay rights, and left open the possibility that cases raising similar issues could have a different outcome. _____ 4. The results of California’s primary elections on Tuesday will echo across the nation, with Democrats hoping to flip several congressional seats there. We’ll have live updates from 30 Times journalists throughout the state. National Democrats have poured millions of dollars into the state, hoping to avoid disaster. Here are the races to watch, and an explanation of California’s unusual “jungle primary” system. Howard Schultz announced that he would step down as executive chairman of Starbucks, adding to speculation that he is considering a presidential run in 2020. _____ 5. Facebook gave dozens of device makers, including Apple and Samsung, access to vast amounts of user data, our reporting team found. Facebook disputed some of their conclusions, including that the partnerships allowed device companies access to the data of users’ friends without their explicit consent. Our report shows you how pervasive the data sharing is. And at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference this week, Apple will likely tackle issues of privacy, digital security and tech addiction. Here are today’s highlights. _____ 6. The death toll jumped to 62 in Guatemala, where a volcano erupted twice about 30 miles away from the capital on Sunday. The hunt for an unknown number of missing people continues. Ash spread over a nine-mile radius, affecting some two million people. Janine Krippner, a volcanologist, stressed the extreme danger of the Guatemalan eruption’s quickly moving avalanches. In contrast, the slow-and-steady lava flows at Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano are exacting a largely economic toll. _____ 7. Tens of thousands of women with early-stage breast cancer can safely forgo chemotherapy, a major study found, sparing them a toxic treatment. Tests on tumor samples can show whether certain genes are more or less active. The study, which included women like Bari Brooks of White House, Tenn., above, raised the cutoff level so that many more women can skip chemotherapy, instead taking a drug that blocks the hormone estrogen or stops the body from making it. As one doctor put it: “I’ll be able to look people in the eye and say, ‘We analyzed your tumor, you have a really good prognosis and you actually don’t need chemotherapy.’ That’s a nice thing to be able to say to somebody.” _____ 8. Senior officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regularly overrule their inspectors’ recommendations that gun dealers lose their licenses. Our report is based on interviews with more than half a dozen current and former law enforcement officials and a review of more than 100 inspection reports. Scrutiny of gun regulation and enforcement has been heightened by the frequency of school shootings. On Sunday, the families of four students killed in February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., accepted diplomas on behalf of the students. Patricia Oliver, the mother of Joaquin Oliver, wore a shirt that read in bold letters: “This should be my son.” _____ 9. Serena Williams withdrew from the French Open shortly before her match with Maria Sharapova, saying she was unable to serve because of an injury to her right pectoral muscle. It was the latest setback in her return from giving birth to her daughter in September. Tonight, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals, the Las Vegas Golden Knights hope to even their series with the Washington Capitals. The puck drops at 8 p.m. Eastern on NBC. _____ 10. Finally, happy birthday to Dr. Ruth. A Times reporter sat down with the dynamo therapist, who is hitting 90, to talk about everything from the royal wedding to her new TV show.

Facebook’s latest fire, Tiananmen Square’s memory and another Chinese crime novel’s breakout moment. Here’s what you need to know: • In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists gathered to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing, an event that goes largely unmentioned in mainland China. The protesters have seen their numbers dwindle, from as many as 180,000 in 2014 to last year’s 110,000. Many student organizations are unwilling to join, preferring to focus on democracy in Hong Kong rather than a massacre in mainland China. But not all students agree. “They are letting the events that happened in Tiananmen fade,” one said. _____ • Facebook shared vast amounts of its users’ personal information with at least 60 companies — device makers including Amazon, Apple, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung — over the last decade. The scope of the partnerships, most of which remain in effect, has not been previously reported. Our reporting team shows how the partner companies could obtain data about a user’s Facebook friends, even those who blocked third-party sharing. Facebook disputes the findings, and says its data sharing is in line with its privacy policy, federal agreements and pledges to users. (Read the company’s post here.) Facebook’s stock slipped on Monday. _____ • The U.S. Supreme Court sided 7 to 2 with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for two men who were planning their wedding reception in 2012. The decision relied on narrow grounds, saying a state commission had violated the Constitution’s protection of religious freedom in ruling against the baker. It left open the possibility that other cases raising similar issues could be decided differently. Separately, President Trump declared that the appointment of the special counsel in the Russia investigation is “totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!” and asserted that he has the power to pardon himself. _____ • The Pentagon is undertaking a sweeping review of its Special Operations Command, as the military begins shifting its focus to growing threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. The new strategy, outlined by the Trump administration in January, could result in slashing counterterrorism forces in Africa by as much as half over the next three years. Above, training in Niger. Nearly a decade ago, almost 13,000 Special Operations troops were deployed around the globe. Now, about 7,300 American commandos operate in 92 countries — many in shadow wars against terrorists in Yemen, Libya, Somalia and other hot spots. _____ • “Being a medic is not only a job for a man,” Razan al-Najjar, 20, said in an interview at a Gaza protest camp last month. “It’s for women, too.” But an hour before dusk on Friday, the 10th week of the Palestinian protest campaign along the fence dividing the Gaza Strip from Israel, Ms. Najjar ran forward in her white paramedic’s uniform for the last time. Israeli soldiers fired two or three bullets from across the fence, according to a witness, hitting Ms. Najjar in the upper body. The Israeli military said her death would be examined. • Microsoft is buying GitHub, a software developer used by 28 million programmers.

American servicemen attacked Mexican-American and black men who had embraced flamboyantly draped suits, padded at the shoulder and pegged at the ankle. Known first as “killer dillers,” zoot suits had become an expression of pride in minority communities. The military barred personnel from leaving their barracks, and the City Council voted to ban zoot suits. A Times report that week traced the suit’s origins to Gainesville, Ga. In the years after, it came to be seen as a symbol of pride, swagger and resistance. The bandleader Cab Calloway once called it “the only totally and truly American civilian suit.” “Zoot Suit” also became the title of a play and movie, based on the true story of a group of Latino youths unjustly convicted of murder. Last year, we sent a photographer to shoot portraits of Angelenos at a restaging of the 1979 play. Many had donned zoot suits or ’40s-style dresses. “When I wear a zoot suit I feel empowered, kind of like it’s a suit of armor,” said Luis Guerrero, then 25. “It’s not only honoring those in the past, but it makes you look sharp.” Karen Zraick wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,Gunman’s Rampage Turned Quiet Newsroom Into Chaos,"When the first shot went off, shattering the glass doors to the newspaper office, people at their desks struggled to grasp what was happening. Anthony Messenger, a sports intern, thought the popping sound might be fireworks. He couldn’t see anyone. Then came more blasts, one after the next. He and another reporter, Selene San Felice, raced to the newsroom’s back door that was always unlocked. This time, it was jammed shut. The pair crept beneath a desk as far away from the front door as they could and waited. They huddled together — silent but urgently texting a parent, sending a tweet (“Active shooter 888 Bestgate please help us”) and calling 911, but never speaking into the line for fear of being heard. “It was insane,” Mr. Messenger, who had worked at the Capital Gazette for four weeks, recalled Friday morning in an interview on the Today Show. “In that moment, I thought I was going to die.” Thursday had begun as an ordinary day in the Capital Gazette’s first-floor office, where a framed copy of the Maryland Gazette from the 1700s hangs on one wall. Calls were being made and stories filed, as one TV monitor played national cable news and another showed how many people were reading the Capital Gazette’s website. Just after 2:33 p.m., a gunman’s rampage turned the often quiet newsroom into chaos. The entire chain of events — from the first crashing of the glass doors to the removal of a suspect by the authorities — lasted only minutes, but left five newspaper employees dead and others cowering beneath desks. Normally, to get inside the newsroom, workers used key cards or got buzzed through the glass doors. But after the gunshots shattered the glass, employees who sat closest to the doors were hit first. The Capital Gazette’s looks like many other newsrooms around the country: a wide open layout and waist-high dividers separating clusters of L-shaped desks, covered in a sometimes untidy mix of old newspapers, pads of paper and more. “You can see from the front of the office to the back,” said Joshua McKerrow, a photographer there. [Accused gunman in newspaper shooting left a trail of conflicts.] Those who sit near the back of the newsroom scrambled to the floor, hoping to go unnoticed beneath their desks. The gunman, said Phil Davis, a crime reporter who was among those to hide under a desk, was silent. “He never said anything,” Mr. Davis said. At one point, the gunman reloaded his weapon. The authorities say the gunman made his way from the front of the room to the back. Prosecutors say he had barricaded the rear door, apparently to prevent workers from fleeing through the only other exit. One of the people who was shot, the authorities said, had tried to escape through that back door — the one Mr. Messenger had been unable to open in those first moments. Soon after the attack began, word was spreading to those away from the newsroom. Danielle Ohl, the paper’s local government reporter, was on vacation in the Outer Banks of North Carolina when a puzzling message came in. An editor who was not in the building was pleading, on the newspaper’s Slack messaging system, for someone inside the newsroom to call him right away. Ms. Ohl texted one of her colleagues, but got no response either. Something was clearly wrong. She finally reached Mr. Davis, who told her there had been a shooting and that two colleagues were probably dead. The Capital Gazette newsroom publishes two related newspapers: The Capital, which appears daily; and The Gazette, appearing Wednesday and Saturday and focusing on northern Anne Arundel County. A website combines the coverage. [Shooting shows the widening use of facial recognition.] The operation has a close, longstanding relationship with Annapolis, the Maryland state capital, and the surrounding Anne Arundel County. Its front page stories sometimes send national events inside, favoring local happenings. An array of recent front page stories included: a police officer placed on leave for shooting at an unarmed suspect; a 12-year-old girl who organized a Pride walk; an increase in property taxes the City Council recently passed at 3 a.m. In turn, it is embraced as the hometown paper in a region that includes some major institutions, including the U.S. Naval Academy and Maryland state government. The Naval Academy recognized the relationship in a tweet from its official account on Thursday: “The Capital Gazette is our local newspaper and is often the first to tell our story. We are grieving with their staff and loved ones after the tragic events that occurred today.” As quickly as 60 seconds after the shots began, law enforcement authorities arrived at the newspaper office. Reporters and other workers began emerging from under desks — hands up — shouting: “We’re not him.” Employees filed out of the newsroom, hands still up, having to pass the bodies of several co-workers to get out the front door. “The office, it was kind of in shambles,” Mr. Messenger, the intern, recalled. “We tried to keep our eyes off of the ground,” he said, adding later: “It was sickening.” Mr. Davis, the crime reporter, said that he was the last to leave the office. Police found the gunman hiding under a desk, amid the journalists in their newsroom. Mr. Davis said the gunman was calling out to the police: “He surrenders. He surrenders.”",The New York Times
2018,HGTV’s Chip and Joanna Gaines Will Pay Fine Over Lead Paint Violations,"Chip and Joanna Gaines, the stars of the HGTV television show “Fixer Upper,” have settled with the United States Environmental Protection Agency over allegations that they violated rules for the safe handling of lead paint during home renovations. The Gaineses have agreed to pay the E.P.A. a civil fine of $40,000 and to inform their audience about the dangers of lead-based paint. Under the agreement, they will also take steps to ensure that their home renovation company, Magnolia Homes, is in compliance with E.P.A. regulations, the agency said. “Through this settlement, Magnolia is putting in place safeguards to ensure the safety of its renovation work and making meaningful contributions toward the protection of children and vulnerable communities from exposure to lead-based paint,” Susan Bodine, the assistant administrator in the E.P.A.’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, said in a statement. Magnolia Homes was contacted by the E.P.A. three years ago and “took immediate steps to bring its activities into compliance,” John Marsicano, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement. As part of the settlement, Magnolia Homes will also spend $160,000 in Waco, Tex., where the company was founded, to decrease lead-based paint hazards in homes where residents are at high risks for exposure to dust from such paint, according to the E.P.A. In “Fixer Upper,” the Gaineses make over newly purchased homes. During an hourlong episode, they demolish parts of the house, renovate it and reveal it to the homeowners. The Gaineses have used the final season of their show to talk about the dangers of having lead-based paint in homes. In one episode, Mr. Gaines discusses testing an old home for lead-based paints and talks about the E.P.A.’s lead renovation, repair and painting rule, known as the R.R.P. rule. The couple is also producing an online video about renovating homes that have lead-based paint. The E.P.A. banned the use of lead-based paint in homes in 1978, but homes built before that year probably still have such paint, making safety during home renovations a top priority of the agency. The R.R.P. rule requires that companies renovating homes and schools built before 1978 are certified by the E.P.A. and “follow lead-safe work practices to contain dust in the renovation work area and contain the waste during its disposal,” according to the agency. Mr. Marsicano said Magnolia Homes would continue “to be proactive with our efforts to ensure total compliance moving forward, and remain committed to raising awareness in our community and our industry.”",The New York Times
2018,Haley Blames Watchdog Groups for U.S. Withdrawal From U.N. Rights Council,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rebuked human rights watchdog organizations on Wednesday, blaming them in part for its decision this week to withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council. In a scathing letter, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, criticized the organizations for opposing her failed push last month for a General Assembly vote on changes to the council, the world’s most important human rights body. “You put yourself on the side of Russia and China, and opposite the United States, on a key human rights issue,” she wrote to 18 organizations that criticized her attempt. “You should know that your efforts to block negotiations and thwart reform were a contributing factor in the U.S. decision to withdraw from the council.” The United States withdrew from the council on Tuesday to protest its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. The United States now joins Iran, North Korea and Eritrea as the only countries that refuse to participate in the council’s meetings and deliberations. It was the first time a member has voluntarily left the council. Several recipients of Ms. Haley’s broadside said that her proposed changes could have led to amendments from Russia, China and other nations to weaken the council. Human Rights Watch was among the nongovernmental organizations that opposed Ms. Haley’s push for a General Assembly vote. “The risk was that it would have opened a Pandora’s box of even worse problems,” Louis Charbonneau, the group’s United Nations director, said in an interview. “The idea that human rights groups were trying to undermine genuine attempts to reform the council, or that we were working with countries like Russia, is outrageous and ridiculous,” Mr. Charbonneau said. Western governments largely agreed with the watchdog groups’ view on the issue, derailing the American overhaul effort. “To this date, we have received not one written edit from a single member state,” Ms. Haley wrote in the letter on Wednesday. State Department officials said Ms. Haley’s rebuke grew out of intense frustration that the groups banded together to oppose her efforts without talking to her first. She was also frustrated that a year of work and consultations had so far yielded few results, they said. In a speech on Tuesday, Ms. Haley said she would continue to work to overhaul the council. But without the United States, changes are far harder to achieve, according to the rights organizations that said the Trump administration has a poor track record for such negotiations.",The New York Times
2018,Hanging Around in a Deli,"Caleb Madison takes us into our solving weekend. FRIDAY PUZZLE — It was that center square that kept bothering me as I solved Caleb Madison’s puzzle. There was lots to like about his crossword, but it just didn’t perform that high-wire act I like to see in our first themeless grid of the week. It had some very decent 10-letter stacks at the top and bottom, but I kept wondering what might have been had Mr. Madison removed that square and gone for an even better staggered stack right in the center. He already had TRANSGENDER and PIANO SONATA, which are both terrific. And then the center is broken up into so-so fill. Granted, that would have required a tricky 15-letter entry fill down the center, but I like to see constructors think big on Fridays. And having DNA LABS and OSSICLE going down the center is also so-so. But we have those longish entries in the stacks, and yes, GO COMMANDO still makes me giggle because I’m 12. I loved seeing BEATS BY DRE and THE MET GALA debut, as well as the great entry FRIZZLES, which thankfully is a cooking term, and not a horrifying reference to curling one’s hair, as I originally thought. 1A: Most people don’t know one brand of headphones from another, unless they are made by a major manufacturer, but BEATS BY DRE got a lot of press when the company was founded by the rap artist Dr. Dre and the music producer Jimmy Iovine in 2006. 11A: Just to show you how I’ve been trained to think, I thought this might be a veiled capital clue, with “Sellers” of the clue “Sellers of buckets” being a person’s name. But I couldn’t think of anyone named Sellers who sold buckets, so I reverted to thinking about them as retailers, yet who makes buckets? Well, they’re not the kind of bucket that you use for water; they’re the paper buckets that hold Kentucky Fried Chicken, or KFC. 17A: You wouldn’t think of something like THE MET GALA as a fashion event, yet that’s exactly what it turns out to be. This year, celebrities showed up dressed as works of art. 24A: Hi, Mom! Venmo is an app that allows you to PAY for things electronically and reimburse your friends when you split the bill in a restaurant. 30A: I’m more a fan of the word “pollster” for someone who takes surveys. POLLER is a real word, but it has another meaning: It’s an archaic way to describe someone who plunders. 52A: TIL that left-handed people have a difficult time playing polo. 55A: Yes, GO COMMANDO has appeared in The New York Times Crossword before. Feel free to fan yourselves. 1D: “Fifth place?” is not a great showing in a race, but if you think about a fifth as liquor, the place for that would be a bottle, or else it would get all over the bar. 39D: Hi, kids! James F. BYRNES was the U.S. secretary of state from 1945-47 under President Harry S. Truman (ask your grandparents!). The website of the Department of State says that he “led the [department] during the significant transition from World War II to the Cold War.” Wordplay welcomes Mr. Byrnes back to The New York Times Crossword after a hiatus of 28 years. As usual with themeless crosswords, the entire puzzle came to me in a dream. When I woke up, I remembered the completed grid exactly how it was in the dream, except in the dream, instead of black squares, there were framed pictures of my fourth-grade chorus teacher. Anyone have any idea how to interpret this? Anyway, I am required by law to tell you this puzzle is not sponsored content for 1-Across, although if a certain Doctor is reading this, my headphone size is medium, and that I am in no way involved in the 58-Across, although if I was, I couldn’t tell you directly but rather would have to communicate it through some sort of … puzzle.

2018,Hannah Arendt and Walter Benjamin Don’t Talk. They Sing.,"Critic’s Notebook HAMBURG, Germany — Opera and philosophy make strange bedfellows. The larger-than-life theatricality and emotionalism of Puccini and Verdi don’t exactly lend themselves to clarifying complex, precise ideas. Yet by coincidence, not one but two new music dramas about major 20th-century thinkers — two German-Jewish intellectuals who fled the Nazis — have their premieres in Germany this season. Few would have predicted that Walter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt would be joining the ranks of Don Giovanni and Carmen. “There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism,” Benjamin wrote in 1940, the year he committed suicide in the Spanish border town of Portbou. Peter Ruzicka’s powerful third opera, “Benjamin,” written for the Hamburg State Opera, where it ran through June 16, takes us through the various stations of the philosopher’s exile in 90 feverish minutes. From beginning to end, it feels like the music of cataclysm: anguished, outraged, hellishly surreal. Mr. Ruzicka, a former artistic director in Hamburg, is one of a handful of living opera composers who can write music this ambitious and affecting. (Jörg Widmann, Wolfgang Rihm, Thomas Adès and George Benjamin come to mind among the Europeans.) The nonlinear, associative libretto by Yona Kim — who also directed the gripping staging, set in what seems to be a decaying 19th-century salon — swerves from Berlin to Moscow and from Paris to Riga. Its seven scenes form a hallucinatory series of episodes from Benjamin’s life. He plays chess and talks Marxism with Bertolt Brecht (the imperious tenor Andreas Conrad), quarrels over Zionism with the kabbalah scholar Gershom Scholem (the insistent bass Tigran Martirossian) and dreams of proletarian children’s theater with his Latvian mistress, Asja Lacis (the charged coloratura soprano Lini Gong). Benjamin himself is a hounded, haunted figure, sung with panic by the baritone Dietrich Henschel. (Mr. Ruzicka bifurcates Benjamin’s personality by adding a spoken double, played by the actor Günter Schaupp.) Written for a large orchestra, offstage musicians, a full chorus and a children’s chorus, “Benjamin” is a major undertaking. With the composer in the pit, the score hissed and crackled with furious energy. Mr. Ruzicka’s musical language is heterogeneous and fluid — by turns lyrical, dissonant, shrill and sparse. At times the jagged vocal lines seem lacerated by furiously driven strings; at others, soft winds and strings support sustained notes by the soloists or chorus. The opera’s centerpiece is an infernal chorus adapted from Mr. Ruzicka’s 2001 opera about Paul Celan, the Eastern European Jew and Holocaust survivor who is considered one of the 20th century’s greatest German-language poets. The piercing cries of “Jerusalem!” seem to express both a longing for escape and the messianic tendencies in Benjamin’s unorthodox thought. The work will be performed next season in Heidelberg, Germany: An opera this robust and impressive deserves to be seen widely. Hannah Arendt has a cameo in Hamburg, singing a Baudelaire setting to Benjamin as he takes his life, but she’s the leading lady in the picturesque Bavarian city of Regensburg, where the Israeli composer Ella Milch-Sheriff’s new opera, “Die Banalität der Liebe” (“The Banality of Love”) dramatizes the famous — or infamous — romance between Arendt, the great political theorist, and Martin Heidegger, the towering German philosopher and member of the Nazi Party. Unlike Mr. Ruzicka, Ms. Milch-Sheriff opts for a straightforward narrative, and music to match. At various points, the music is lush, ironic and quotation-heavy; there’s quite a bit of Wagner, Mahler and even Bernstein in the score. But the lack of a unifying harmonic or melodic language is only part of what makes this moderately entertaining, frequently infuriating two-hour work a bumpy ride. One of Ms. Milch-Sheriff’s odder inspirations is making the young Heidegger a lyric tenor (the robust Angelo Pollak). We meet him, along with Arendt (sung as a young woman with virginal purity by Anna Pisareva and in middle age by Vera Semieniuk, a toughened mezzo), in 1924, during a philosophy lecture in Marburg. In a witty classroom scene, Ms. Milch-Sheriff sets a passage from Heidegger’s “Being and Time” to music that is a parody of a serenade, complete with mandolin accompaniment. The scene is played primarily for laughs — Heidegger’s language is notoriously complex — and there isn’t much discussion of his philosophy in what follows. He comes across less as a thinker than as a Svengali who seduces and humiliates his young Jewish pupil. Their onstage romance is full of kinky, S&M touches. The libretto by Savyon Liebrecht, based on her play, leaps fluidly from the 1920s to the 1970s and from Germany to Israel and America. In 1933, when the Nazis appoint Heidegger as rector of Freiburg University, Ms. Milch-Sheriff replaces the rakish tenor with a Mephistophelean baritone (Adam Kruzel). Itay Tiran’s production does a fine job handling the frequent geographical and temporal displacements. While his images are often striking, the production has its excesses. During Heidegger’s Nazi-extolling inaugural address in Freiburg, yellow stars of David rain down on the audience, and the Adolf Eichmann trial scene is a piece of kitsch worthy of Ken Russell. Gideon Hausner, the Israeli chief prosecutor, has a star of David emblazoned on his forehead, while his hands are outstretched in the manner of the Jewish priestly blessing (not unlike the Vulcan salute, which it inspired). He is a bloodsucking caricature straight out of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Ms. Milch-Sheriff scores the scene with organ, making the trial seem like an auto-da-fé. Meanwhile, it is Arendt, not Eichmann, who occupies the famous glass box, answering to the claim that she “defended” Eichmann out of love for Heidegger. The opera stops short of accusing Arendt, who coined the controversial phrase “banality of evil” to help explain the crimes of the Third Reich, of giving the Nazis a free pass because she worshiped German culture (and its great personification, Heidegger). But in a program note, Ms. Milch-Sheriff writes that her opera is meant to indict, among others, those Jews who continued to “venerate German culture and thus their own murderers.” It’s a false dichotomy: Jewish thinkers like Arendt, and Benjamin, were a fundamental part of the culture whose brilliance the Nazis sought to extinguish. That’s the pity of it all. OpinionRichard J. Bernstein",The New York Times
2018,"Hannibal Buress, Racing Beyond Cosby to a Starring Role in ‘Tag’","A Word With It’s not like Hannibal Buress wasn’t busy enough already. As he was surfing a wave of popularity, his schedule was crammed with stand-up dates and comedy club pop-ins; his podcast, “Handsome Rambler”; a supporting role in Comedy Central’s “Broad City”; and small parts in movies like “Neighbors,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming” and “The Secret Life of Pets.” But in his early 30s, he knew it was time for some major action. And “Tag,” opening Friday, with his biggest role yet, was it. As Sable, Mr. Buress plays one of five lifelong friends (his co-stars include Jon Hamm, Ed Helms and Jake Johnson) who, each May for 30 years, have set aside all other responsibilities to partake in a no-holds-barred, violence-prone, cross-country game of tag. And now they’re out to snare the sole member (Jeremy Renner) who has never been caught before he can retire. On his wedding weekend, no less. “I just knew that with the cast and the role being bigger, it would be a good opportunity to show what I can do throughout a film rather than popping into a couple of scenes,” he said. “It was a little overdue for me to have that kind of lead.” The starry gig is also a welcome distraction from the subject Mr. Buress, 35, is increasingly loath to discuss (and which he now asks journalists to agree not to broach; we didn’t agree): the 2014 routine in Philadelphia where he called Bill Cosby a rapist, prompting dozens of women to come forward with their stories of sexual assault. Mr. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault in April. In an interview at a Lower East Side hotel, the affable Mr. Buress — who’d spent his downtime that afternoon yelling, “Hey, come here!” to passers-by as he and a videographer created an impromptu man-on-the-street talk show — spoke about what he brings to moviemaking, his relationship with fame and why he stopped drinking. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. In a group like this, is there competition to be the funniest or were you sticking to the script? No, I don’t follow the script all the time, just because sometimes the script isn’t as funny as what I’m going to say. Everybody was improvising. People weren’t veering off and destroying scenes, but you switch the words around to try to make it funny and catch people off guard. It wasn’t a competition, but when I’m doing a comedy movie, they didn’t bring me there to read every single thing. Of course, they want me to follow the guidelines, but if something can be improved, then it makes everybody look better. You’ve written for “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock.” Are you a better comedy writer than most of what you read? I’m better at coming up with a joke for myself. I know how to come up with stuff on the spot that fits that situation, that will feel fresher because it’s thought up in that moment. People watching can see that we’re making that part up as it goes along. It adds an energy and fun to it. The same way in stand-up, where the crowd can see when you’re making up something. It gets a more electric reaction. How much of your stand-up is scripted? Most of it is scripted. I would say 85 to 15 [percent], written to riff. You’ll let the audience guide you. But if a lady gets weird or a drunk yells, then they might end up being a part of the show for 10 or 15 minutes. That’s kind of horrifying. I mean, don’t yell. Don’t try to make yourself the show. Don’t yell stupid [expletive] at me and interrupt. “Hannibal!” “Eric Andre Show!” “Broad City!” It’s not helpful. I get that you’re excited, but I already assume that you’re excited because you paid money to watch a man talk. [Laughs] You recently stopped drinking. Why? It was just that I’d done enough. I feel like I accomplished most of what you can accomplish as a drinker. I did it around the world. Many different countries. Different situations. I’ve done it morning, noon, afternoon, evening, nighttime. I’ve done it in houses, hotels, apartments, trailers, outside at festivals. I feel like I peaked and I had nothing else to accomplish in the drinking game, so I retired. [Laughs, a lot] Did you need that alcohol to help your stand-up? I think over time I kind of fooled myself into thinking I needed it. But it’s just ingrained in comedy, before you even get paid money. “We can’t pay you for this, but you get two drink tickets.” So drinks early on I kind of viewed as currency in comedy. It’s always around and you just take advantage. And is that healthy? Especially living in a city like New York, it can get real dicey. You play Ilana Glazer’s boyfriend, Lincoln, in “Broad City,” which will return next year with its final season. If you were writing it, how would the couple end things? If I was writing it? I guess you would finish it up. It wouldn’t be an official marriage because it’s Ilana. I don’t know if she’d want to be a part of the archaic custom of marriage. But some special ceremony of them getting married somewhere. An art gallery or something. You became a kind of hero to a lot of women after your Cosby joke. What has that been like, and how do you feel about the end result? [So quiet it’s barely audible] No I don’t want to talk about that. You don’t really know? [Shakes head] No. [Silence] So . . . [waiting for something, anything]. Is that a “no comment”? Yeah. You’ve occasionally had a prickly relationship with fame. Has it gotten any easier? I’ve actually dealt with it better since I’ve stopped drinking, and I’ve been working out and that’s been helping me. I’m way more relaxed and patient with people. There’s lots of people out there that have probably got some story of me being an [expletive]. If you catch me at the wrong moment or say the wrong [thing], yeah, I might say [expletive] back to you. An earlier version of this article misquoted Hannibal Buress when he was asked about the conviction of Bill Cosby. He said, “No, I don’t want to talk about that.” He did not say, “Oh I don’t really know how I feel.”",The New York Times
2018,Hantavirus Was Not the Cause of Belmont Park Worker’s Death,"The death of a worker at the Belmont Park racetrack this month was the result of bacterial sepsis, not hantavirus, a rat-borne illness that was initially suspected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the man collapsed on June 1 on the track grounds beside the ramshackle employee housing run by the New York Racing Association, and died less than a week later, state health officials suspected hantavirus. A commercial laboratory found the man, whose name has not been released publicly, tested positive for hantavirus antibodies, according to the New York State Health Department. But subsequent testing by the C.D.C. concluded that sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood, was the true cause of the man’s death; the results were released on Friday. Hantavirus is primarily contracted by breathing air contaminated with rat feces and urine. Inspectors and epidemiologists for the Health Department who arrived last week at Belmont Park in Elmont N.Y., found signs of the vermin, as well as bedbugs, in the squalid cottages and barracks where the grooms and tack are housed. The department has ordered the relocation of 32 workers. “We were left with severe concerns with the conditions that were found upon inspection that still leave us with the possibility of rodent-borne diseases, regardless of the cause of this poor individual’s death,” said Brad Hutton, the department’s deputy commissioner for public health. The New York Racing Association has begun the cleanup, patching holes where rats travel unimpeded into the workers’ quarters, securing refuse and feed bins. “N.Y.R.A. is committed to modernizing backstretch facilities at Belmont Park to support the health and well-being of the backstretch community,” Patrick McKenna, a spokesman for the racing association, said in an email. “N.Y.R.A. will continue to address pest-control measures throughout Belmont Park and will implement all of New York State’s recommendations.”",The New York Times
2018,"Happy Birthday to Q’s! Ten Years In, an Advice Columnist Reflects","Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Social Q’s is turning 10. For readers who haven’t been keeping up with the advice column in Styles — for 520 weeks and counting — that adds up to about 2,100 social tangles. They’ve ranged from the traditional (trash-talking exes) to the timely (white privilege in middle school) to the bizarre (lying about being Jewish on a dating app and looking for tips to keep up the ruse). I try to put four of them right every week. Occasionally, I succeed. Not bad for 10, right? When I was 10, back in the ’70s, I was less of a fixer and more of an acrobat, leaping away from something bad inside me. I had no name for this terrible thing, and only flashes of awareness that it was linked to my feelings for a fellow fourth grader named Todd. I didn’t get that it was a crush, or that the only thing separating mine from the garden variety on TV shows and songs on the radio was that its object was another boy. Still, I felt stabs of shame and back-flipped away from them as convincingly as I could. We’re all ashamed of something. But shame is particularly good training for advice columnists. It teaches us to look beyond the surface. Back in fourth grade, I was cruel to Todd as a cover for my feelings. People in hiding learn to deflect. But they can also come out of hiding if they feel safe. That’s what happened to me in college (after a spell of being treated much worse than anything I’d dished out to poor Todd). That’s the spirit of Social Q’s, too: looking hard at villains until we see people just like us. Fear and shame bring out the worst in anyone, and compassion — even for our rudest in-law or nastiest neighbor — can often make things better. Of course, victims need comforting, too. That’s the basic recipe. But it took more than grade-school wisdom for The Times to commission Social Q’s. It took the worst tragedy of my life to get my big break. When I was 23, a fledgling gay man testing the waters in New York, one morning, just before dawn, my father picked up a rifle in Vermont and shot himself. No one had an inkling of his despair, much less his ability to muster such violence. We struggled for years, my mother and brothers and I, to understand how we could have missed something so big. We blamed ourselves; we blamed each other. Our hearts broke for him and raged at him. But none of these postures satisfied for long. So, we persisted. I even wrote a novel in a comic voice that paired my burgeoning sexuality with my father’s death. Humor was the only vehicle I could find to make so much guilt and grief and shame palatable. That book, “Father’s Day,” somehow landed on the desk of Mary Suh, then the deputy editor of the Styles section. She liked its voice. And after clearing more than a few administrative hurdles, we were collaborating on the particulars of an advice column: the breadth of questions, the length of answers, its sweet-and-salty tone. It was an accident that Social Q’s debuted on Father’s Day in 2008, but its anniversary strikes me every year. In a split second, or maybe longer, my father decided that life wasn’t worth living. But Social Q’s begs to differ. The questions keep rolling in — some silly, some tricky, some painful — often as many as 100 per week. But every one of them reflects an engagement with life: the elderly woman trying to process the #MeToo movement; the teenager grappling with Confederate flags in his neighborhood; the mother struggling with unexpected condolences for the loss of her child. I keep answering them, and readers keep recording their enthusiastic objections and agreement and thoughtful amendments. (Just try to stop them, or take a look at the flood in my inbox on Monday mornings.) Still, I’m grateful to every one of them. We will never agree on how to live in the world. But by engaging with Social Q’s, readers are proof positive that how we live, and the fact that we choose to live, makes all the difference.",The New York Times
2018,Happy Flag Day. But Are You Flying It Wrong?,"If you are displaying an American flag today, good for you. It’s Flag Day in the United States, after all. But still, you might be doing it wrong — and veterans are likely to have noticed. While there are no legal penalties for running afoul of the United States Flag Code, many veterans do frequently spot violations, said Joe Plenzler, a spokesman for the American Legion, a veterans organization. Following the code is entirely voluntary, but “it’s a significant emotional issue for many of our veterans,” he said. To be sure, mistakes are often made with the best of intentions or without knowledge of specific details in the extensive code. “I think it’s just because they don’t know any better, and that’s where we come in as veterans to help them understand,” said Lynn Rolf, programs director at Veterans of Foreign Wars. If you want to avoid offending someone, here are some of the most frequent mistakes people make with their flags. If a flag is dirty, tattered or faded, don’t bother flying it. “In their patriotism, people many times forget that displaying a soiled flag is not the way to go about it,” Mr. Plenzler said. “We like to encourage people to buy new flags, and make sure the flags they have are in presentable condition.” Don’t just throw it in the garbage. The code says: The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. The code offers no specific guidance on how to burn it. A 2008 report by the Congressional Research Service wrote that “any procedure which is in good taste and shows no disrespect to the flag would be appropriate.” Many American Legion posts hold public ceremonies to dispose of old flags on Flag Day. Mr. Rolf said most V.F.W. chapters will accept flags, and will often work with local scout troops to properly dispose of them. If you do it yourself, the legion suggests burning it in private, so others don’t confuse your action with a political protest. That said, it should be noted that burning the flag in protest, while offensive to many people, remains constitutionally protected under a Supreme Court ruling in 1989. From time to time, Congress has tried and failed to reverse that ruling. One thing to note: Some people mistakenly believe a flag must be burned if it touches the ground. That’s a myth that pervades even active service members, Mr. Plenzler said. You should try to avoid letting the flag touch the ground, but it can still be flown if it remains in good condition, he said. If you do so, it should be well-lighted. According to the code: “It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flag staffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed twenty-four hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.” The American Legion defines “proper illumination” as a light specifically placed to light the flag, or bright enough so the flag is “recognizable by the casual observer.” The code states: “The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free.” There’s some debate among veterans about how disrespectful it is to wear clothing with a motif based on the flag. You wouldn’t want to cut up an actual flag to fashion a shirt, but Mr. Rolf said he considered items based on the flag to be welcomed expressions of patriotism. “We love people showing pride in our country, and right now I’ve got stars and stripes socks on,” Mr. Rolf said. That said, you should be aware some veterans disagree and may tell you so, he said. A similar logic applies to items designed like the flag, including beer cans or napkins, for your patriotic backyard barbecue. According to the code: “The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkin or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.” That said, maybe don’t buy a doormat that would require people to step on wipe their feet on the flag. (Lowe’s, a home improvement chain, found itself in a stir in 2012 when it sold a doormat that included elements of the flag.) Flag Day celebrates the anniversary of June 14, 1777, when Congress established the first design of the American flag with 13 stars and stripes.

2018,"Harlan Ellison Dies at 84; Prolific, Irascible (Science) Fiction Writer","Harlan Ellison, a furiously prolific and cantankerous writer whose science fiction and fantasy stories reflected a personality so intense that they often read as if he were punching his manual typewriter keys with his fists, died on Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 84. His wife, Susan Ellison, confirmed his death but said she did not know the cause. He had had a stroke and heart surgery in recent years. Mr. Ellison looked at storytelling as a “holy chore,” which he pursued zealously for more than 60 years. His output includes more than 1,700 short stories and articles, at least 100 books and dozens of screenplays and television scripts. And although he was ranked with eminent science fiction writers like Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov, he insisted that he wrote speculative fiction, or simply fiction. “Call me a science fiction writer,” Mr. Ellison said on the Sci-Fi Channel (now SyFy) in the 1990s. “I’ll come to your house and I’ll nail your pet’s head to a coffee table. I’ll hit you so hard your ancestors will die.” Mr. Ellison’s best-known work includes “A Boy and His Dog” (1969), a novella set in a postapocalyptic wasteland of the United States, which was made into a 1975 movie; “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” (1967), a short story about a computer that tortures the last five humans on earth; “The City on the Edge of Forever,” a beloved back-in-time episode of the “Star Trek” television series in 1967; and “ ‘Repent, Harlequin!’ Said the Ticktockman” (1965), about a futuristic society in which time is regimented by a fearsome figure called the Ticktockman. “But no one called him that to his mask,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “You don’t call a man a hated name, not when that man, behind his mask, is capable of revoking the minutes, the hours, the days and nights, the years of his life. He was called the Master Timekeeper to his mask.” Mr. Ellison was a fast-talking, pipe-smoking polymath who once delighted talk-show hosts like Merv Griffin and Tom Snyder with his views on atheism, elitism, violence and Scientology. He could be wild, angry and litigious. He said that he lost his job with the Walt Disney Company — on the first day — when he stood up in its commissary (with company executives watching) and described how he wanted to make an animated pornographic film starring Mickey and Minnie Mouse. He is said to have sent a dead gopher to a publisher and attacked an ABC executive, breaking his pelvis. He frequently criticized studios and television producers when he believed they had copied his stories. His many lawsuits included one against the makers of the movie “The Terminator,” which accused them of plagiarizing “Soldier,” a script he wrote in 1964 for the TV series “The Outer Limits.” And he remained upset for years that Gene Roddenberry, the creator of “Star Trek,” and others had made rewrites to his script for “The City on the Edge of Forever.” Decades later, he sued CBS Paramount TV for merchandising royalties that he felt he was owed from the episode. Ms. Ellison said that her husband eventually put his “Star Trek” imbroglio behind him. But he would never watch the classic episode. “Let’s not go that far,” she said in a telephone interview. Harlan Jay Ellison was born on May 27, 1934, in Cleveland. His father, Louis, was a dentist and jeweler, and his mother, Serita (Rosenthal) Ellison, worked in a thrift store. Growing up, partly in Painesville, Ohio, about 30 miles northeast of Cleveland, he was bullied in school, largely for being Jewish. The experience made him feel like an outsider and fueled his anger. “I survived their tender mercies with nothing more debilitating to show for it than a lifelong, blood-drenched obsession for revenge,” he wrote in “Harlan Ellison’s Watching,” a collection of film reviews first published in 1989. That anger imbued his writing, said James Gunn, the founding director of the Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. “Some writers were able to detach themselves and write objectively,” Mr. Gunn said in a telephone interview, “but you could always sense that Harlan was in there yelling. You could hear Bradbury in his stories, but he was not violent at all; he had a melancholy attitude.” After his father died, Harlan moved back to Cleveland with his mother and his sister, Beverly, in 1949 and started the Cleveland Science Fiction Club, became a frequent moviegoer and worked as a runner for local mobsters, he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. He left home several times, traveling around the country and variously working on a tuna boat, as a truckdriver and as a short-order cook, among other jobs. Mr. Ellison attended Ohio State University but left after two years. At one point he punched an English professor who had told him that he did not see any writing talent in him. Thereafter, Mr. Ellison sent copies of his published stories to the professor. In the mid-1950s he began publishing a torrent of work — in publications like Galaxy and Fantastic Science Fiction — that would continue for years. He wrote stories, novels and novellas. He edited anthologies like “Dangerous Visions” (1967) and a sequel. And he wrote episodes of television series like “Route 66,” “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” “The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,” the 1980s revival of “The Twilight Zone” and, improbably, “The Flying Nun” (an episode in which Sally Field’s character, Sister Bertrille, and two other nuns land on a remote island). In 1965, he found he had become a character in Gay Talese’s celebrated New Journalism article “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold,” published in Esquire magazine. By Mr. Talese’s account, Sinatra, annoyed at the boots that Mr. Ellison was wearing in the pool room of a private club in Beverly Hills, asked him what he did for a living. “I’m a plumber,” Mr. Ellison answered. When someone interjected that Mr. Ellison had written the screenplay of “The Oscar,” a forthcoming film, Sinatra replied: “Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve seen it, and it’s a piece of crap.” Mr. Ellison then said, “That’s strange, because they haven’t even released it.” (It was released in 1966.) He left after few more testy exchanges with Sinatra. (Sinatra, coincidentally, had a cameo role in “The Oscar.”) By the time he encountered Sinatra, Mr. Ellison was already reviewing movies and writing essays about buddy films and other genres. Most of the movies he reviewed were mainstream productions like “Rosemary’s Baby” (which he loved) and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” (which he called “stultifyingly predictable”). In a review of “Harlan Ellison’s Watching” in The New York Times in 1989, Robert Moss wrote that “one is never tempted to stop reading” despite Mr. Ellison’s occasional windiness. His criticism, Mr. Moss added, “has some of the spellbinding quality of a great nonstop talker with a cultural warehouse for a mind.” In recent years, Mr. Ellison wrote a graphic novel, “7 Against Chaos” (2013),” with the artist Paul Chadwick for DC Comics. About 30 of his stories were reissued digitally. He published “None of the Above,” an unproduced screenplay based on “Bug Jack Barron,” a story by Norman Spinrad, a science fiction writer who had been his friend since the 1950s. Mr. Ellison was also the star of “Dreams With Sharp Teeth” (2008), a documentary feature about his life directed by Erik Nelson. In the film, which showcases Mr. Ellison’s fierce, volcanic and argumentative personality, he is described as a “hurricane,” “an alternately impish and furious 11-year-old boy” and, by his friend Robin Williams, “a skin graft on a leper.” In describing her husband’s friendship with Mr. Williams, Ms. Ellison said, “Talent will find talent.” His marriage to Susan Toth, his only immediate survivor, was his fifth; his four previous marriages ended in divorce. Isaac Asimov once called Mr. Ellison “one of the best writers in the world.” But he lamented that Mr. Ellison had too often been sidetracked by his furies. “It is simply terrible that that he should be constantly embroiled in matters which really have nothing to do with his writing and which slow him down tragically,” Mr. Asimov wrote in 1994 in his autobiography, “I, Asimov.” He added: “He claims he is five feet four inches tall, but it doesn’t really matter. In talent, energy and courage, he is eight feet tall.”",The New York Times
2018,Harley-Davidson Shows Why Corporations Cannot Keep Silent in Trade Wars,"Corporate America has largely avoided sticking its head over the parapet in the trade war. That’s going to become harder as the bellicose rhetoric transforms into action. Case in point Harley-Davidson: The company on Monday announced it was planning to shift some production out of the United States to lessen the cost of tariffs that the European Union imposed in response to those put in place by the Trump administration. Harley-Davidson’s move reveals the uncomfortable choices companies face as they navigate escalating trade tensions. The company, by making more motorcycles beyond its United States factories, could draw criticism from President Trump and his supporters. But if Harley-Davidson does not adapt to the rising trade barriers, it stands to sell fewer motorcycles, which could harm its profits. So far, large companies have mostly left it to their trade groups to speak out against Mr. Trump’s trade policies. But when financial pain threatens to become consequential, public companies are obliged to publicly quantify it. Almost by default, then, they are forced to enter the fight. And as more companies do what Harley-Davidson did, the debate over trade wars will focus on the nitty-gritty. The European Union last week raised tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles to 31 percent from 6 percent. The company said the increase would add $2,200 on average to the cost of a motorcycle exported to Europe from the United States. Harley-Davidson said it would not raise the suggested prices of its motorcycles to cover the cost of the tariffs. It expects, at least for a little while, to bear the additional expense of the tariffs itself, which would cost the company an estimated $90 million to $100 million a year. Over the longer term, Harley-Davidson, based in Milwaukee, intends to make more motorcycles in countries that are not subject to the tariffs. That plan could take nine to 18 months to put into effect, the company said. A year ago, Mr. Trump lauded the firm for manufacturing in the United States. “We’re proud of you! Made in America, Harley-Davidson,” he said, when executives from the company drove motorcycles onto the White House lawn. Harley-Davidson’s announcement may make it more likely that Mr. Trump imposes tariffs on European cars, to further pressure the European Union to make trade concessions. But such actions may invite more retaliation from the bloc, and, in turn, more of the sorts of announcements that Harley-Davidson made. The administration may hope that the strong United States economy will allow American companies to better weather the trade battles — and that other countries will ultimately cave because they cannot afford to lose access to the United States market. Still, negative corporate announcements bring a jarring specificity to trade wars that can spread through financial markets and the wider economy. Harley-Davidson’s stock was down over 7 percent on Monday. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.8 percent. The benchmark is now only up 1.1 percent since the end of 2017 and down 5.9 percent from its all-time high. The trade war appears to have halted the Trump rally. And there are a lot more Harley-Davidsons on the stock market.",The New York Times
2018,"Harley-Davidson, Blaming E.U. Tariffs, Will Move Some Production Out of U.S.","WASHINGTON — As President Trump pursues a protectionist trade policy, he has pointed repeatedly to Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer, as a company that will ultimately benefit. Instead, it is getting caught in the crossfire. The Wisconsin company said on Monday it would shift some production of its bikes overseas to avoid stiff retaliatory tariffs imposed by the European Union in response to Mr. Trump’s trade measures. The company said the move “is not the company’s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the E.U. and maintain a viable business in Europe.” Mr. Trump’s trade war is beginning to ripple through the United States economy as companies struggle with a cascade of tariffs here and abroad. While Mr. Trump says his trade policy is aimed at reviving domestic manufacturing, Harley-Davidson’s move shows how the White House approach could backfire as American companies increasingly rely on overseas markets for materials, production and sales. The White House is waging several trade wars at once, engaging in fights with China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which have each responded with their own retaliatory measures. The trade spats have triggered a range of unintended consequences, including a profit warning last week by Daimler, which blamed retaliatory Chinese tariffs for a slump in the sales of the S.U.V.s it builds in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Mid Continent Nail Corporation, a Missouri-based manufacturer of nails, said last week that it had laid off 60 of its 500 employees and might be forced to close as it struggles to absorb the higher cost of the steel it imports from Mexico to produce its nails. Stock markets have swooned over the prospect of an escalating trade war that could further hurt American companies, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ending down 1.4 percent on Monday. Mr. Trump accused Harley-Davidson of using the tariffs as “an excuse” to move production out of the United States but insisted in a tweet on Monday that his trade strategy would still work. “Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag,” he said. “I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade.” Last week, the European Union hit back against Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs with penalties on $3.2 billion worth of American products, including bourbon, orange juice, playing cards and Harley-Davidsons. On Monday, the company said the tariffs on its motorcycles had increased to 31 percent from 6 percent, adding, on average, $2,200 to every motorcycle exported from the United States to Europe. With United States sales slowing and Europe an increasingly vital market, the company said it would shift production to its overseas facilities to avoid raising costs. “Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed on to its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers’ businesses,” the company said in a public filing. Mr. Trump has frequently championed the company as a success story in domestic manufacturing. Soon after taking office in 2017, Mr. Trump hosted Harley-Davidson executives at the White House, where he called the firm a “true American icon” and thanked it “for building things in America.” Like many American companies, Harley-Davidson has increasingly relied on overseas markets for sales and has shifted some production as a result. The company now produces some bikes and parts at facilities in Brazil, Australia, India and Thailand, and has shifted production to India and Thailand specifically to avoid high import tariffs in those countries. The company sold about 40,000 new motorbikes last year in Europe, equivalent to a sixth of its worldwide sales, making the region its most important market after the United States. [Read more: Even Harley-Davidson can’t avoid the tug of overseas factories.] Harley-Davidson did not specify how many jobs it might shift to its overseas facilities as it ratchets up European production, and a spokesman for the company said it was “still evaluating” the need for job cuts in the United States. The company has been consolidating its United States operations, eliminating hundreds of jobs in the process. Shares of Harley-Davidson fell nearly 6 percent in afternoon trading. Moving production abroad could draw the ire of Mr. Trump, who as a presidential candidate publicly assailed companies such as the furnace and air-conditioner maker Carrier, which planned to close a plant in the United States and shift manufacturing operations to Mexico. Mr. Trump regularly tells his supporters that American manufacturing is making a comeback and lavishes praise on companies that build domestically. But that was before Mr. Trump followed through on his plans to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, a move he says will force other countries to lower their trade barriers. So far, the opposite has happened, as the European Union, Mexico and Canada respond with their own levies, many of which are aimed at products from politically important states that supported Mr. Trump, like Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said on Monday that Harley-Davidson’s decision was evidence that raising trade barriers was a bad idea. “This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,” Mr. Ryan said. “The best way to help American workers, consumers and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.” Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that he expected more companies to follow Harley-Davidson’s lead as they wrestled with higher production costs from tariffs on raw metals and levies on the finished products they sell overseas. “This is incredibly self-defeating,” Mr. Bown said. “There may be some increased domestic production of aluminum and steel because of the tariffs, but now there is going to be less motorcycle production in the United States for exports.” He added: “I think we can expect to see this same kind of activity every time that President Trump tries to impose new tariffs.” A labor union representing Harley-Davidson employees condemned the move on Monday and accused the company of seizing on Mr. Trump’s trade policy as an excuse to move jobs offshore. “Harley-Davidson’s announcement today is the latest slap in the face to the loyal, highly skilled work force that made Harley an iconic American brand,” said Robert Martinez Jr., the international president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. “This latest move is in keeping with Harley’s past decisions to open plants outside of North America.” Sharon Zackfia, an analyst with William Blair, estimated that fewer than 10 percent of Harley-Davidson’s motorcycles were manufactured abroad. She said that it was hard to predict what the shift might mean in terms of lost jobs, but that the company would be under pressure to spur more domestic demand with its new lines of motorcycles to keep workers at its American plants busy. The best solution, she said, would be for a truce to be called to avert the trade war. “Ultimately everyone is hoping that these tariffs or trade wars are transitory, that what happened can be reversed,” Ms. Zackfia said. At the White House press briefing on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, rejected the idea that Mr. Trump’s trade policies were hurting American businesses and blamed the European Union for punishing American workers with its “unfair trade practices.” And Mr. Trump has shown no signs that he will back down. In a tweet on Sunday, he threatened even more tariffs, saying the United States would retaliate “with more than Reciprocity” if “artificial” trade barriers were not removed.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Harley-Davidson’s Decision,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Facing Tariffs, American Icon Retreats in U.S.” (front page, June 26): After reading about Harley-Davidson, and its announcement that it is going to move some production of motorcycles overseas to avoid stiff tariffs, I wondered what kind of a businessman President Trump really is, especially with his comment about Harley-Davidson raising the “white flag.” It seems to me that Harley-Davidson made a good business decision. It answers first to its shareholders, who should applaud the decision, however unfortunate it is. The president should be reconsidering all of his tariffs, and especially those that affect our friends. STEPHEN BRILL COTTAGE GROVE, MINN.",The New York Times

ATTICUS FINCH The Biography By Joseph Crespino 248 pp. Basic Books. $27. When “Go Set a Watchman” was published in 2015, an Alabama lawyer called me with a catch in his voice. Had I heard that his hero Atticus Finch had an evil twin? Unlike the virtuous lawyer who saved an innocent black man from a lynch mob in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” the segregationist Atticus organized the white citizens council, figuratively speaking, in Boo Radley’s peaceful backyard. Three years later, my friend still believes that Harper Lee was tricked, in her dotage, into shredding the image of perhaps the only white Alabamian other than Helen Keller to be admired around the world. Never mind that this better Atticus is fictional; my home state has learned to grab admiration where it can. Atticus-worship is not confined to Alabamians who revere the saint portrayed in “To Kill a Mockingbird” and then enshrined in 1962’s movie version by a magisterially virtuous Gregory Peck. By winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 and selling more than 40 million copies worldwide, Lee’s novel created a global role model for a virtuous life. Even the gifted Northern novelist Jonathan Franzen cited the original Atticus as the epitome of moral perfection in a New Yorker essay on Edith Wharton. Although dismaying to some Lee fans, the belated publication of “Watchman,” an apprentice work containing the germ plasm of “Mockingbird,” cast light on the virtues and limitations of the author and her canonical novel. It also opened the door to serious scholarship like “Atticus Finch: The Biography,” Joseph Crespino’s crisp, illuminating examination of Harper Lee’s dueling doppelgängers and their real-life model, Lee’s politician father, A. C. Lee. Crespino, who holds a wonderful title — he is the Jimmy Carter professor of history at Emory University — displays a confident understanding of the era of genteel white supremacists like A. C. Lee. He understands that the New South still labors, as Lee’s daughter did throughout her long, complicated life, under an old shadow. This book’s closely documented conclusion is that A. C. Lee, who once chased an integrationist preacher out of the Monroeville Methodist Church, and his devoted albeit sporadically rebellious daughter, Nelle Harper Lee, both wanted the world to have a better opinion of upper-class Southern WASPs than they deserve. These are the people Harper Lee and I grew up among — educated, well-read, well-traveled Alabamians who would never invite George Wallace into their homes, but nonetheless watched in silence as he humiliated poor Alabama in the eyes of the world. This book opens a window into “Mockingbird’s” scrubbed-up Alabama of memory, into the literary politics of the modern South, and into the argument that existed in Lee’s imagination when she arrived at 19 on the University of Alabama’s campus in 1945 and when she died in a Monroeville nursing home in 2016. Her student journalism seethes with outrage over Montgomery’s pack of political thugs, but it also reflects the signature neurosis of her class — that educated white Alabamians are looked down upon as ignorant rednecks because the state’s “good people” are unfairly demonized over the racial brutality that is only part of the Alabama story. What the world saw as a hideous carcinoma on Alabama’s face in the days of “massive resistance” was, in fact, only a wart on the public visage of respectable white segregationists struggling with an unfixable inheritance of white trash on the one side and a fractious black minority on the other. [ Our review: “Why ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ Matters” | Our review: “To Kill a Mockingbird” | The Life, Death and Career of Harper Lee ] Lee’s fictional snapshot of a strait-laced lawyer gave Alabama a civic mythology it could live with, but non-Southerners may not appreciate the role of the “Mockingbird” industry in the region’s endless literary wars. Georgia still basks in the imperial grandeur of “Gone With the Wind.” Mississippians lord it over their Bama cousins because “Absalom, Absalom!” put William Faulkner on a lonely pinnacle no other Southern writer can scale. But when “Mockingbird” won the Pulitzer and then swept the Oscars in 1963, Alabama had what its psyche needed most — an internationally accepted statement that we are better than the rest of America (not to mentions its journalists, historians and preachers) has been willing to admit. Crespino is not timid about exposing the fact that “Mockingbird” approvingly dramatizes the class bigotry that still prevails in white Alabama. Its corporate and landowning oligarchs monopolize economic and political power, but the state’s ills are always laid at the feet of lower-class whites like Bob Ewell and his troubled daughter Mayella. Peck’s spotless, prejudice-free version of Atticus appeared in New York movie theaters a month after Wallace delivered his “Segregation Forever” inaugural address. Thus did “the id and superego of the descendants of the Confederacy enter together the mainstream of American political and cultural life.” In villainizing rednecks, Lee was doing what her generation of educated Alabamians was forced to do in the 1960s: showing where she stood on racial violence while begging the world for some leniency. There’s a nice question here for literary critics. Were Lee and, for that matter, Birmingham-born Walker Percy unwilling to surrender the vestige of Alabama-ness that haunts their novels — the conviction that the Southern gentry’s antique, upper-class posture of respectability actually mattered in the face of their crimes, first against Native Americans and then against enslaved blacks? Crespino’s answer as to Lee is an unequivocal yes, and he links Lee’s split vision to the lifelong game of hide-and-seek between Nelle Lee, the down-home fisherman, and Harper Lee, the literary expat who was happiest in Manhattan. Jean Louise Finch, the protagonist of “Go Set a Watchman,” speaks for the worldly Lee when she condones integration with a people her father disdains, saying, “Atticus, the time has come when we’ve got to do right.” But Crespino demonstrates that “To Kill a Mockingbird,” while it is the superior storytelling book, wobbles morally in comparison to “Watchman.” Atticus’s pedantic reverence for the rule of law communicates to Scout and Jem a message that has misled generations of “honorable white Southerners.” Atticus shows them “how one could be in Maycomb without being of it.” Atticus may have convinced the children, but if Harper Lee really believed that, why did she keep the railroad tracks hot between Alabama and New York?",The New York Times
2018,Harriet Tubman on the $20? Trump’s Treasury Dept. Won’t Commit,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has tried to undo as many Obama-era policies as possible during his first 500 days in office, but his administration has remained curiously circumspect when it comes to one of his predecessor’s initiatives: putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. In a letter to Congress that was released on Tuesday, the Treasury Department praised Tubman, a former slave and abolitionist who is a civil rights hero, but made no commitment as to whether she would one day be the new face of the $20. In 2016, former Secretary Jacob J. Lew announced that the currency was being redrawn, adding Tubman to the front and moving President Andrew Jackson to the back. The new designs were expected to be unveiled in 2020. The letter, which was in response to a formal inquiry from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said Tubman’s “courage and persistence” were emblematic of America’s ideals and values. But it did not say if she was still part of the redesign. “The redesign of the next currency series is still in the early stages, and neither the final designs nor all features have been finalized for the new notes,” wrote Drew Maloney, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for legislative affairs. “For this reason, the department is unable to provide additional information regarding the potential designs at this time.” It was also unclear when the redesign would be made public or be ready for circulation. Mr. Maloney said it would likely be more than 10 years before the new $20 note is released. Ms. Shaheen took the response as a bad sign for the plan to put Tubman on the $20 bill. “I am severely disappointed by the Trump administration’s failure to prioritize the redesign of the $20 bill to honor Harriet Tubman, and other trailblazing women and civil rights leaders,” Ms. Shaheen said in a statement. “Now that plan has been shelved without notice or reason.” She added: “I’ll continue to press the Treasury Department to expedite the redesign of the $20 bill and keep its promise to the American people.” A Treasury spokeswoman had no additional comment. Lydia Washington, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which is overseen by the Treasury Department, said she had received no new guidance beyond that set forth by Mr. Lew. She said that the redesign process remained on schedule, but that the ultimate timeline would be dictated by the agency’s ability to design security features needed to prevent counterfeiting, and by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. “The secretary of the Treasury approves all final currency designs,” Ms. Washington said. “Overall, the currency design process is complex, and significant testing is required for the notes and features to be production ready.” Mr. Mnuchin has been cryptic about Tubman’s fate. The subject is sensitive, as Mr. Trump has expressed deep admiration for Jackson, a rich populist who appealed to working-class white voters when he was elected in 1828. “People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC last August. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.” Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington in January, Mr. Mnuchin said he was still on the fence: “We haven’t made any decisions on whether we will change the bill or won’t change the bill.” Images of Tubman, which were featured prominently on the Treasury Department’s website at the end the Obama administration, were removed when Mr. Trump’s Treasury Department overhauled its website last year. The decision by Mr. Lew to add Tubman to the $20 came after months of public debate about putting a prominent woman on a commonly used note. Groups such as Women on the 20s launched grass-roots efforts to make the case that Tubman was the best choice to replace Jackson, a slave owner, and they continue to hope that the Trump administration will not reverse course. “Their voices were heard and now they deserve to know whether and when their wishes will be realized,” the Women on the 20s group said.",The New York Times
2018,Harry Kane Rescues England. Tune In for the Next Episode.,"VOLGOGRAD, Russia — And on the fifth day of the 2018 World Cup, that great, recurring soap opera of international sports finally got its chance to begin again: The not-so-mighty but ever-hopeful English national team took the field. Thousands of red-and-white clad fans had descended on this riverside city once known as Stalingrad for England’s Monday-night match against Tunisia. What they got was a nail-biting 2-1 victory that suggested that this time, as they have been promised, it really is going to be different for England. Harry Kane’s header from four yards out off a corner kick, just seconds into stoppage time, salvaged a game that seemed destined to become one more painful chapter in England’s major competition melodrama. At the start, England took control of the match. A team that for years has relied on 60-yard balls down the wing that rarely connected put on a dizzying display of cutbacks, through balls and slotted passes. Tunisia could barely breathe, much less compete. [Up Next: Follow our live coverage of England vs. Colombia] When Kane gave England the lead in the 11th minute, knocking in the rebound of John Stones’s header off a corner kick, England looked well on its way to a dominant victory. Uncomfortable heat in the stadium? No problem. Swarms of pesky bugs? No big deal. England had so much of the ball in the first half hour of the game, it seemed as if the Three Lions would be able to win with just a single defender rather than the aggressive three-man setup it used. But then, battling for a cross on one of Tunisia’s few ventures into England’s half, Kyle Walker put his arm in the face of Tunisia attacker Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. When Ben Youssef hit the turf, the Colombian referee Wilmar Roldán blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty spot. Ferjani Sassi nailed his kick past a diving Jordan Pickford, and the script looked eerily familiar. “It goes to 1-all and the momentum changes a bit,” Kane said. “It’s always in the back of your mind that it’s going to be one of those days.” If the World Cup’s substance mostly lies in the conversation that surrounds it, then it appeared that the talk about this match for years would be how England could have possibly have missed so many chances early on to put the game away. In the first minutes, midfielder Dele Alli missed a clear chance from close range. Raheem Sterling couldn’t tap a crossing pass into an open net. Jordan Henderson bounced a header just wide. Later, Alli’s wide-open shot from 12 yards deflected out of bounds. Jesse Lingard’s poke past the charging substitute goalkeeper, Farouk Ben Mustapha, rolled off the post. Stones essentially whiffed on another wide-open shot from 10 yards out. The second half brought more English dominance. However, emboldened by having survived one of the more lopsided 1-1 first halves in recent World Cup memory, Tunisia’s defenders started closing down the oncoming English attackers, clogging open lanes and clearing free balls out of dangerous areas. But a moment of sloppy ball-handling by Tunisia as regulation time expired gave England a corner kick in stoppage time, and a ball deflected off Harry Maguire toward an open Kane on the back post of the Tunisia goal. Whipping his head, Kane emphatically knocked the ball into the net. “Maybe in the end you run out of time, but I thought we kept doing the right things and making good decisions,” England Manager Gareth Southgate said afterward. So what happens now? For decades, conventional wisdom has held that England suffers as much from irrational expectations as soccer deficiencies at the World Cup. This, the thinking goes, is the result of a combination of factors regarding this proud, but often self-flagellating, nation that a) ruled a global empire into the middle of the 20th century, b) invented soccer, and c) once won the tournament, on home soil in 1966. Thus hopes rise every two years, for either the World Cup or the European Championship, that this will indeed be the year that the English Messiah, or at least some 21st century version of Bobby Moore, will lead the Three Lions back to the Promised Land. The results of such exuberance have often been humiliation. Occasionally, England has departed with cruelty, beaten by Argentine gamesmanship, or by German or Portuguese penalty kicks. Even when a supposed Golden Generation including Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham and Frank Lampard was at its peak, the script never changed. There were lackluster meltdowns in the heat of Ukraine and Brazil, and the pressure-cooker of the 2016 European Championship in France. Each time, England’s team seemed to crumple. The defeat to Iceland at the 2016 Euros brought to the surface all manner of painful British sentiments about the retrenchment of a once great empire. Chastened, and perhaps a bit wiser, England’s Football Association decided to flip the script ahead of this World Cup and usher in a new era of limited expectations. No more foreign managers like Italy’s Fabio Capello or Sweden’s Sven-Goran Eriksson. In their place came the former defender Southgate, a seemingly hail-fellow-well-met with a middling résumé who got the job when his predecessor, Sam Allardyce, was fired amid a corruption scandal after a single game. Southgate’s main credentials hardly signaled greatness would follow: his previous experience included managing Middlesbrough in a tenure that saw the club relegated from the Premier League and guiding England’s under-21 team to last place in its group in the 2015 European Championship. He has found his footing with the senior team, losing only two matches out of 19 since taking charge. And with England breezing through World Cup qualifying, the F.A. dispensed with its usual bunker mentality regarding the country’s temperamental news media. This time around, the team’s stars have spoken about coming to Russia with a goal of having fun. Southgate has framed this campaign as the first step in a process for one of the youngest teams at this World Cup, though that may be a tough posture to maintain after the élan England showed Monday night, its finishing troubles aside. “There is a bigger picture, with a lot of young, good players who are hopefully going to be together for a very long time,” Southgate said ahead of the match. Translation: patience, please, because we might not be very good yet. In recent weeks, a new-old narrative has emerged that goes something like this: England wilted under the pressure of high expectations all these years, so the path to success lies in ridding the country of such expectations. Since the F.A. and Southgate have managed that task, the thinking goes, England will now proceed to win the World Cup. Before the game, Tunisia Manager Nabil Maaloul was asked by a member of the British news media whether England was one of the teams that might win it all. He cagily agreed that it was, apparently eager to put more pressure on his opponent. Even the journalist Barney Ronay of The Guardian, the furthest thing from a homer for the national team, went on the publication’s Football Weekly podcast last week and declared that for the first time in memory he actually could envision something he had in the past considered unthinkable. “This is a ridiculous thing to say,” Ronay began, “but England could win the World Cup.” “They have a plan,” Ronay continued, though he said he would feel more optimistic if the players were all 20 percent better. Therein lies the essential question: Does England have enough elite players to not only advance out of a group that includes Belgium, Panama and Tunisia but also play deep into the tournament? For all the chances created and all the late heroics on Monday night, England’s best hopes may be four or eight years away. Its under-17 and under-20 teams won their age-group World Cups last year. This, too, is part of the Southgate narrative, a hedge against another major tournament campaign descending into the anguish of the past if things go bad quickly. This group of players, Southgate maintains, should not be burdened with the struggles and disappointment that have come before them. “The play of the past and the opportunities of the past are gone,” he said. Then he praised his group’s hunger and desire and technical prowess, as well as its ability to support the collective. The reserves, he insisted, lend all their spirit and support to those on the pitch. “There is real enthusiasm,” he said. Now, after Kane’s winner, there will be more. Here’s how England beat Tunisia, from Kevin Draper: On England’s seventh corner kick of the match, Harry Maguire met the ball at the penalty spot, and deflected it to the back post, where Harry Kane was waiting to head it past Farouk Ben Mustapha. Once again, Harry Kane doesn’t go for the first ball, but instead lets one of England’s towering center backs jump into the scrum, and he puts away the second ball. The fourth official signals 4 minutes of added time. If England can’t find a winner ... After a nice move, Ruben Loftus-Cheek cuts a perfect pass back to Marcus Rashford, but he bizarrely lets it roll past. Did a teammate call him off? Matthew Futterman: It’s amazing. Tunisia cannot hold the ball for more than seven seconds, can’t get the ball over midfield, can’t complete three consecutive passes, and yet the scoreboard is dead even. Tunisia take off striker Wahbi Khazri, bringing on Saber Khalifa. Because of the early substitution for injured goalkeeper Mouez Hassen, it’s Tunisia’s final substitution. Farouk Ben Mustapha punches away a corner, slamming into John Stones in the process. Both stay down for a moment, but look to be O.K. carrying on. Chelsea youngster Ruben Loftus-Cheek comes in for Dele Alli, as England chases a late winner. England lets a gilt-edged chance go wanting, after Dele Alli is bundled over 25 yards from goal. Lacking an elite set-piece taker, Ashley Young takes the subsequent free kick and kicks the ball well over the goal. Matthew Futterman: England may yet score two goals, but in the last few minutes their pace has slowed and the runs don’t have the same zip as earlier. They have to be incredibly frustrated to not be up 6-1. England had 12 shots, 6 on target, in the first 45 minutes. They’ve only had 3 shots, 1 on target, in the past 30. Tunisian winger Naïm Sliti comes off, replaced by Mohamed Ben Amor. Substitute Marcus Rashford almost slid Harry Kane in on goal, but a last minute Tunisian slide tackle ended the chance. Matthew Futterman: England is supposed to be younger and faster and more fit than ever. It’s still warm here, and this is usually the part of the game where they begin to start walking around the field and turning a shade of pink. If Tunisia can survive another few minutes they may escape this drubbing. Just before an England free kick, Marcus Rashford comes in for Raheem Sterling. Sterling made a number of good runs today, but looked off every time he had the ball at his feet. England really pouring it on here. Center back Kyle Walker made a darting run forward, looking for the 1-2, and center back Harry Maguire found his way forward even though there was no set piece. English manager Gareth Southgate has to be thinking about which of his substitutes can unlock the Tunisian defense. Jamie Vardy? Marcus Rashford? Danny Welbeck? England is practically camped out in Tunisia’s penalty box, but hasn’t been able to get a clean shot on goal. Tunisia surprisingly looks like they’re interested in committing men forward for a second goal. Twice, Jordan Pickford has had to spring forward to clear a ball near the edge of his box, the most active he’s been in this game since the penalty. An England corner is headed directly at the Tunisian keeper, but the replay shows Harry Kane being wrestled to the ground, at least the second time that’s happened. The referee is uninterested. Compared to the pulsating first 45 minutes, the beginning of the second half has been tame, with the teams trading possession back and forth in the midfield. The second half is underway. Expect Tunisia to bunker down and protect their one point, while England will likely take another dozen shots. But will they get any of them to go in? The set piece-heavy World Cup continues. Harry Kane scored for England early off a corner kick rebound, but Tunisia equalized on a Ferjani Sassi penalty, their only shot on target in the half. England made every cross, cut back, through ball, knock down and killer pass, but couldn’t finish a thing. Going into halftime even is a huge disappointment for the Three Lions. Given the positions England took shots from in the first half, you would’ve expected them to score 2.18 goals. Instead they scored just the one. The good news is that, in many ways, creating good chances is more difficult than finishing them. The bad news, of course, is that they can’t finish. A through-ball puts Jesse Lindgard in a race with the on-rushing Tunisian keeper. Lindgard wins and taps the ball around Farouk Ben Mustapha, but is unable to catch up and can only wince as it rolls off the post but not in. Harry Maguire, the English center back, is a menace in attack. His nice knockdown header sets up a good half-volley chance for Jesse Lindgard, but his shot is deflected out. A goalmouth scramble gives numerous England players an opportunity to put a shot on goal but they all whiff. As Dr. Joe Machnick explained on the Fox broadcast, every single penalty decision is reviewed by the video assistant referee system, and despite the protestations of England, this one stood. If you need a refresher, here’s how the VAR system works. Battling for a cross, Kyle Walker put his arm in the face of Tunisia attacker Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. As he fell, Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan called the penalty. Ferjani Sassi calmly slots a penalty into the bottom left corner, past a diving Jordan Pickford. We’re tied, 1-1. Matthew Futterman: And there, Mr. Draper, is your England mistake! On cue... No surprise, Volgograd Arena absolutely explodes as Ferjani Sassi converts the penalty. Tunisia doesn’t get to the World Cup very much, and its fans have descended here in force. Whabi Khazri was wide open on the left and about to collect a pass in a dangerous spot when he slipped. If Tunisia could ever steal another goal and go into halftime with a lead, oh my... Harry Maguire heads a Kieran Trippier free kick on frame, but it’s easily saved by replacement keeper Farouk Ben Mustapha. A few English players appealed half-heartedly for a penalty, believing Maguire was held, but the referee showed no interest. Sloppy defending by England leads to a chance for Tunisia, but a shot from the top of the box, subsequent corner, and speculative header all fail to seriously threaten. It is hard to imagine Tunisia scoring off anything other than an English mistake. Tunisia with their first shot! Unfortunately it comes from about 35 yards out, and is blasted about that high over the goal. This night might get worse before it gets better for Tunisia, as it’s all one way traffic right now. England is finding plenty of space behind the Tunisian defense, slotting through balls and cutting beautiful passes back to the penalty spot. Matthew Futterman: After 20 minutes Tunisia looks completely incapable of threatening England here with any kind of sustained attack. England’s three-man back line is becoming a one-man back line because Tunisia can’t seem to manage more than two passes in the middle of the field. If England can start connecting on all the sitters this game is going to get ugly. We have an extended stoppage as trainers surround Tunisian goalkeeper Mouez Hassen, who walks off the field holding back tears. He’s being subbed out here, adding insult to injury for Tunisia. Hassen went down once earlier in the match, but resumed and made a wonderful diving save on the John Stones header. It is unclear what is wrong with Hassen, but he has been replaced by Farouk Ben Mustapha. The dam finally bursts! Off a corner, John Stones’s towering header is barely parried away by the Tunisian goalkeeper Mouez Hassen, but Harry Kane is right there to put away the rebound. A perfect poacher’s goal. Tunisia gets their first extended spell of possession and works the ball into the final third, but an errant pass goes out for an England throw-in. Matthew Futterman: So, England is dominating early but may have left its finishing boots in the hotel. If you are an England fan, you are either thinking this is great because the team has created three great chances at the goal in the first 10 minutes, or, here we go again, the major tournament hex continues. The last chance was Raheem Sterling in a nut shell. He did the hard part right, making a perfect late, looping run around three Tunisian defenders to get open for Lindgaard. But when the pass arrived, it somehow wrong-footed him, and bounced off his shins for a goal kick. Again England breaks forward, and again they can’t convert. Jesse Lindgard slots a beautiful ball across to Raheem Sterling, but he is unable to get a solid foot on the ball to put it into the open goal. England is already assaulting Tunisia’s goal. A ball over the top unleashed Dele Alli, but his square ball across the goal to Raheem Sterling was half cleared, and Jesse Lindgard’s follow-up subsequently bundled out for a corner. We’re underway! A couple of monochromatic squads, as Tunisia is wearing all white and England is in all red. It was close to 90 degrees this afternoon in Volgograd. And tiny bugs flying all around the arena in swarms. In other words. If things go south for England as they sometimes do on these big stages, there are some built-in excuses. — Matthew Futterman An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of Tunisia’s substitute goalkeeper. He is Farouk Ben Mustapha, not Moustapha.",The New York Times
2018,Harry Potter in Your Pocket,"Applied Reading The notion of losing yourself in a good book has taken on additional meaning, thanks to immersive experiences that let you wander around in the world built by the author. Several literary franchises designed for all-ages readership have even leveraged the popularity of their film adaptations into real-life attractions: New Zealand’s Tolkien tourism industry offers a peek at the Hobbiton movie set, and there’s now a corner of Dubai’s Motiongate theme park devoted to “The Hunger Games,” Suzanne Collins’s dystopian Y.A. trilogy about teenagers competing to kill each other (and yes, there’s a gift shop). However, when it comes to sharing an alternative reality with fans — and making them want to live there — it’s hard to top J. K. Rowling’s Wizarding World juggernaut. Years before official Harry Potter theme parks opened in California, Florida and Japan, readers were recreating Hogwarts on their own. Kids threw on striped scarves over Party City robes for midnight bookstore parties, and improvisational Quidditch leagues began to form on college campuses. But now, as Scholastic marks the 20th anniversary of the publication of “Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone,” a new mobile role-playing game that lets players become students at Harry’s esteemed alma mater has arrived. In HARRY POTTER: HOGWARTS MYSTERY (free to play with in-app purchases, on Android and iOS devices with an internet connection), Potterheads who always wanted to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry finally get their chance. After Professor Minerva McGonagall (as in the films, voiced by Maggie Smith, who should be in all video games) welcomes you, you design your own student character, get sorted into a house — Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin — and start acquiring classroom supplies in the shops of Diagon Alley, the witching-equipment commercial district. The game is set years before the enrollment of Harry Potter and his nemesis, Draco Malfoy, but you get your own instant enemy. Your in-game alter ego is dogged by a Slytherin mean girl named Merula Snyde who, in an early confrontation, lays out the “mystery” here at Hogwarts: “Your brother lost his mind, disgraced his house, got expelled from school and was never heard from again.” Your character’s quest is to figure out what actually happened to that brother as you work through the game’s levels. While the narrative is intriguing, the gameplay is not. Most of the early action consists of tapping glowing objects, dragging a finger in wand formations or answering multiple-choice questions, but the plot is timed so that your character gets into trouble and runs out of energy relatively early into the game. To move on, you either have to wait until your energy level returns or spend real money for digital coins or gems to power yourself back up. When “Hogwarts Mystery” was first released, prices ranged from 99 cents for a “handful of gems” to $99.99 for a “vault of gems” — a cost that may feel like out-of-state tuition to parents footing the app bills. The game’s developers have been tinkering with the pricing, though, and as software is a malleable substance, perhaps the gameplay itself may evolve for the better with enough feedback from fans. While video games may not be everyone’s cup of tea, more academic Potter studies can be found online. The Google Arts & Culture site has an interactive version of the excellent “Harry Potter: A History of Magic” exhibit at the British Library that closed in February in preparation for a tour at the New-York Historical Society this fall. HARRY POTTER: A JOURNEY THROUGH A HISTORY OF MAGIC, a junior version of the show’s catalog, is also available in most electronic bookshops for $8.99. But perhaps the best way to fully experience the Potterverse is to return to the original text, where the magic all began with words. If you don’t feel like hauling out the seven original volumes (or eight, for those who consider the playscript of Broadway’s current “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” as canon, as Rowling does), enhanced electronic versions of the books put a lively spin on familiar material. Last year, Amazon released the illustrated edition of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” as a “Kindle in Motion” e-book ($9.99, for Kindle tablets and the Kindle app for Android and iOS). In the motion edition, gently animated versions of Jim Kay’s illustrations pepper the story, much like the way photos move in The Daily Prophet, the wizards’ magical newspaper. With Rowling’s Pottermore publishing division behind the project, expect the rest of the books in the series to be transformed. On the moving-pictures front, Apple beat Amazon to the punch in 2015 when the company teamed up with Pottermore to release the exclusive Harry Potter Enhanced Editions of all seven books into its iBookstore for iOS devices. The novels, also priced at $9.99 each, feature occasional annotations by the author and interactive illustrations — like a Golden Snitch that flutters away when you try to touch it. Even though Rowling announced “Harry is done” at the 2016 London stage premiere of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” there’s more than fan nostalgia sustaining the series. Unlike authors who have died or retired their franchises, Rowling is still at work. With the “Fantastic Beasts” films — “The Crimes of Grindelwald” arrives in November — she’s switched from novels to screenplays, and the universe she’s built continues to expand.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Harvard Is Wrong That Asians Have Terrible Personalities,"Mr. Yang is a columnist at Tablet and the author of the forthcoming book “The Souls of Yellow Folk.” There’s a moving passage contained in a deposition taken in the major class-action lawsuit accusing Harvard University of racial bias against Asian-Americans. An attorney for Students for Fair Admissions, the nonprofit group representing a dozen Asian-Americans denied admission by Harvard, confronts the assistant principal of Stuyvesant High School with evidence that white students applying to Harvard in 2014 from her school were more than twice as likely to be admitted to the university as were her Asian-American students. The assistant principal, Casey Pedrick, starts to cry. (Witness crying.) Q. I’m sorry this is upsetting to you. Do you want to take a break? A. (Witness shakes her head no.) Q. You want to keep going? Do you want to tell me why this is so upsetting to you? A. Because these numbers make it seem like there’s discrimination, and I love these kids, and I know how hard they work. So these just look like numbers to all you guys, but I see their faces. That last sentence is worth lingering on for a moment. When Ms. Pedrick looks in the faces of her Asian students, who comprise more than 70 percent of the population at Stuyvesant, she doesn’t see any one of them as “yet another textureless math grind,” as M.I.T.’s dean of admissions was brazen enough to call a Korean-American student to Daniel Golden, the author of “The Price of Admission.” She doesn’t see her students as an arrogant, privileged “ethnic group” who think they “own admission” to these high-performing schools, as the new chancellor of New York City Schools, Richard Carranza, recently put it. Ms. Pedrick knows that her Asian students believe they have to earn their admission to Stuyvesant in the only way anyone has for more than four decades: by passing a rigorous entrance exam. Their parents will often invest a major share of the family income into test preparation courses to help them pass — this despite the fact that more Asians live in poverty than any other group in New York City. At the time that she was deposed, Ms. Pedrick did not know that the Harvard admissions office consistently gave Asian-American applicants low personality ratings — the lowest assigned collectively to any racial group. She did not know that Harvard’s own Office of Institutional Research had found that if the university selected its students on academic criteria alone, the Asian share of the Harvard student body would leap from 19 percent to 43 percent. She did not know that though Asians were consistently the highest academically performing group among Harvard applicants, they earned admission at a rate lower than any other racial group between 2000 and 2019. All she knew was what she had witnessed as an assistant principal and the single fact that she was shown by her deposers. But perhaps she intuited the rest. Earlier this month, we learned that a review of more than 160,000 individual student files contained in six years of Harvard’s admissions data found that Asians outperformed all other racial groups on every measure of academic achievement: grades, SAT scores and the most AP exams passed. They had more extracurricular activities than their white counterparts. They were rated by interviewers who had met them as virtually on par with their white counterparts in their personal qualities. Yet Harvard admissions officers, many of whom had never met these applicants, scored them collectively as the worst of all groups in the one area — personality — that was subjective enough to be readily manipulable to serve Harvard’s institutional interests. The report by the plaintiff’s expert witness, the Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, revealed that Harvard evaluated applicants on the extent to which they possessed the following traits: likability, helpfulness, courage, kindness, positive personality, people like to be around them, the person is widely respected. Asian-Americans, who had the highest scores in both the academic and extracurricular ratings, lagged far behind all other racial groups in the degree to which they received high ratings on the personality score. “Asian-American applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20% of the time only in the top academic index decile. By contrast, white applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20% of the time in the top six deciles,” wrote Mr. Arcidiacono. “Hispanics receive such personal scores more than 20% of the time in the top seven deciles, and African Americans receive such scores more than 20% of the time in the top eight deciles.” Even if the very worst stereotypes about Asians were true on average, it beggars belief that one could arrive at divergences as dramatic as the ones Mr. Arcidiacono documents by means of unbiased evaluation. The Asian-American population has more than doubled over the last 20 years, yet the Asian-American share in the student populations at Harvard has remained frozen. Harvard has maintained since the 1980s, when claims of anti-Asian discrimination in Ivy League admissions first surfaced, that there is no racial bias against Asian-Americans once you control the preferences offered to athletes and alumni. The discovery process in this case has demonstrated that this claim is no longer supportable. Mr. Arcidiacono found that an otherwise identical applicant bearing an Asian-American male identity with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 32 percent chance of admission if he were white, a 77 percent chance of admission if he were Hispanic, and a 95 percent chance of admission if he were black. A report from Harvard’s own Office of Institutional Research found that even after alumni and athletic preferences were factored in, Asians would be accepted at a rate of 26 percent, versus the 19 percent at which they were actually accepted. That report, commissioned back in 2013, was summarily filed away, with no further investigation or action taken. No innocuous explanation can account for the extent of these disparities. Yet Harvard is insisting that those who call it what it plainly is — racial discrimination — are advancing a “divisive agenda.” On June 12, Harvard’s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, sent an email to all alumni of the college warning of a forthcoming attempt to use “misleading, selectively presented data taken out of context” in order to “question the integrity of the undergraduate admissions process.” The statement promised to “react swiftly and thoughtfully to defend diversity as the source of our strength and our excellence — and to affirm the integrity of our admissions process.” As the Harvard law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen pointed out in The New Yorker, the tortuous and evasive quality of the discussion of the treatment of Asian-Americans in elite colleges stems from the way our legal doctrine on affirmative action has evolved. The Supreme Court ruled that it was legal to use race as a criterion in admissions in order to pursue the educational benefits of “diversity” in the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, but it forbade the imposition of racial quotas and, by extension, the maintenance of a policy that consciously aims at “racial balancing.” This imposes a legal condition on Harvard. Rather than make the honest claim that it actively pursues racial balance and that there are good reasons to do so, the school must engage in a charade that nearly everyone working in the proximity of a highly competitive college knows to be false. Harvard has been here before. “To prevent a dangerous increase in the proportion of Jews, I know at present only one way, which is at the same time straightforward and effective,” wrote A. Lawrence Lowell, Harvard’s president in the 1920s, “and that is a selection by a personal estimate of character on the part of the Admission authorities, based upon the probable value to the candidate, to the College and to the community of his admissions.” The opacity of its admissions procedure could veil what Lowell’s written correspondence would later disclose to be a fully intended policy of discrimination. The same zealously defended discretion to rank applicants on intangible personality traits would, of course, later come to the aid of blacks, Hispanics and Asians when Harvard pivoted toward an embrace of affirmative action in the 1970s. Affirmative action and the privileges of legacy and wealthy students, most of whom are white, both found shelter in the concept of “diversity” — a term that refers at once to racial diversity and the mix of people that make Harvard’s student body so varied and so disproportionately rich. Alumni preference, so crucial to the sustenance of Harvard’s $37 billion endowment, could provide cover before the courts for racial bias. Harvard’s commitment to racial diversity could whitewash its devotion to the preservation of privilege before liberal public opinion. There is, in this fragile system, a place for textureless math grinds. But only a few. The conclusion is unavoidable: In order to sustain this system, Harvard admissions systematically denigrated the highest achieving group of students in America. Asian-Americans have been collateral damage in the university’s quest to sustain its paradoxical mission to grow its $37 billion endowment and remain the world’s most exclusive institution — all while incessantly preaching egalitarian doctrines. Until very recently, Asian-Americans have been politically quiescent and largely deferential to a status quo that works against them. But now, a portion of the Asian-American community is acting in what it deems to be its own interest. In the face of this challenge, Harvard has resorted to the desperate expedient of promulgating racial stereotypes. In denying that it has engaged in racial balancing at the expense of Asian-Americans, Harvard has put itself in the morally untenable position of affirming a brazen falsehood. Harvard’s lawyers will soon tell the highest court in the land that Casey Pedrick’s Asian students are less respected because they are less likable, less courageous, and less kind than all other applicants. The university has decided that this is necessary for the greater good. The reality is that it is a carefully considered act of slander.",The New York Times
2018,"Harvard Rated Asian-American Applicants Lower on Personality Traits, Suit Says","Harvard consistently rated Asian-American applicants lower than others on traits like “positive personality,” likability, courage, kindness and being “widely respected,” according to an analysis of more than 160,000 student records filed Friday by a group representing Asian-American students in a lawsuit against the university. Asian-Americans scored higher than applicants of any other racial or ethnic group on admissions measures like test scores, grades and extracurricular activities, according to the analysis commissioned by a group that opposes all race-based admissions criteria. But the students’ personal ratings significantly dragged down their chances of being admitted, the analysis found. The court documents, filed in federal court in Boston, also showed that Harvard conducted an internal investigation into its admissions policies in 2013 and found a bias against Asian-American applicants. But Harvard never made the findings public or acted on them. Harvard, one of the most sought-after and selective universities in the country, admitted only 4.6 percent of its applicants this year. That has led to intense interest in the university’s closely guarded admissions process. Harvard had fought furiously over the last few months to keep secret the documents that were unsealed Friday. The documents came out as part of a lawsuit charging Harvard with systematically discriminating against Asian-Americans, in violation of civil rights law. The suit says that Harvard imposes what is in effect a soft quota of “racial balancing.” This keeps the numbers of Asian-Americans artificially low, while advancing less qualified white, black and Hispanic applicants, the plaintiffs contend. [Read the court documents here and here.] The findings come at a time when issues of race, ethnicity, admission, testing and equal access to education are confronting schools across the country, from selective public high schools like Stuyvesant High School in New York to elite private colleges. Many Ivy League schools, not just Harvard, have had similar ratios of Asian-American, black, white and Hispanic students for years, despite fluctuations in application rates and qualifications, raising questions about how those numbers are arrived at and whether they represent unspoken quotas. Harvard and the group suing it have presented sharply divergent views of what constitutes a fair admissions process. “It turns out that the suspicions of Asian-American alumni, students and applicants were right all along,” the group, Students for Fair Admissions, said in a court document laying out the analysis. “Harvard today engages in the same kind of discrimination and stereotyping that it used to justify quotas on Jewish applicants in the 1920s and 1930s.” Harvard vigorously disagreed on Friday, saying that its own expert analysis showed no discrimination and that seeking diversity is a valuable part of student selection. The university lashed out at the founder of Students for Fair Admissions, Edward Blum, accusing him of using Harvard to replay a previous challenge to affirmative action in college admissions, Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin. In its 2016 decision in that case, the Supreme Court ruled that race could be used as one of many factors in admissions. “Thorough and comprehensive analysis of the data and evidence makes clear that Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group, including Asian-Americans, whose rate of admission has grown 29 percent over the last decade,” Harvard said in a statement. “Mr. Blum and his organization’s incomplete and misleading data analysis paint a dangerously inaccurate picture of Harvard College’s whole-person admissions process by omitting critical data and information factors.” [How do you rate a college applicant’s personality traits. Read more here.] In court papers, Harvard said that a statistical analysis could not capture the many intangible factors that go into Harvard admissions. Harvard said that the plaintiffs’ expert, Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist, had mined the data to his advantage by taking out applicants who were favored because they were legacies, athletes, the children of staff and the like, including Asian-Americans. In response, the plaintiffs said their expert had factored out these applicants because he wanted to look at the pure effect of race on admissions, unclouded by other factors. Both sides filed papers Friday asking for summary judgment, an immediate ruling in their favor. If the judge denies those requests, as is likely, a trial has been scheduled for October. If it goes on to the Supreme Court, it could upend decades of affirmative action policies at colleges and universities across the country. Harvard is not the only Ivy League school facing pressure to admit more Asian-American students. Princeton and Cornell and others also have high numbers of Asian-American applicants. Yet their share of Asian-Americans students is comparable with Harvard’s. In Friday’s court papers, the plaintiffs describe a shaping process that begins before students even apply, when Harvard buys data about PSAT scores and G.P.A.s, according to the plaintiffs’ motion. It is well documented that these scores vary by race. The plaintiffs’ analysis was based on data extracted from the records of more than 160,000 applicants who applied for admission over six cycles from 2000 to 2015. They compare Harvard’s treatment of Asian-Americans with its well-documented campaign to reduce the growing number of Jews being admitted to Harvard in the 1920s. Until then, applicants had been admitted on academic merit. To avoid adopting a blatant quota system, Harvard introduced subjective criteria like character, personality and promise. The plaintiffs call this the “original sin of holistic admissions.” They argue that the same character-based system is being used now to hold the proportion of Asian-Americans at Harvard to roughly 20 percent year after year, except for minor increases, they say, spurred by litigation. White applicants would be most hurt if Asian-American admissions rose, the plaintiffs said. On summary sheets, Asian-American applicants were much more likely than other races to be described as “standard strong,” meaning lacking special qualities that would warrant admission, even though they were more academically qualified, the plaintiffs said. They were 25 percent more likely than white applicants to receive that rating. They were also described as “busy and bright” in their admissions files, the plaintiffs said. One summary sheet comment said the Asian-American applicant would “need to fight it out with many similar” applicants. The plaintiffs’ papers appeared to offer other examples of grudging or derogatory descriptions of Asian applications, but they had been redacted. In its admissions process, Harvard scores applicants in five categories — “academic,” “extracurricular,” “athletic,” “personal” and “overall.” They are ranked from 1 to 6, with 1 being the best. Whites get higher personal ratings than Asian-Americans, with 21.3 percent of white applicants getting a 1 or 2 compared to 17.6 percent of Asian-Americans, according to the plaintiffs’ analysis. Alumni interviewers give Asian-Americans personal ratings comparable to those of whites. But the admissions office gives them the worst scores of any racial group, often without even meeting them, according to Professor Arcidiacono. Harvard said that while admissions officers may not meet the applicants, they can judge their personal qualities based on factors like personal essays and letters of recommendation. Harvard said it was implausible that Harvard’s 40-member admissions committee, some of whom were Asian-Americans, would conclude that Asian-American applicants were less personable than other races. University officials did concede that its 2013 internal review found that if Harvard considered only academic achievement, the Asian-American share of the class would rise to 43 percent from the actual 19 percent. After accounting for Harvard’s preference for recruited athletes and legacy applicants, the proportion of whites went up, while the share of Asian-Americans fell to 31 percent. Accounting for extracurricular and personal ratings, the share of whites rose again, and Asian-Americans fell to 26 percent. What brought the Asian-American number down to roughly 18 percent, or about the actual share, was accounting for a category called “demographic,” the study found. This pushed up African-American and Hispanic numbers, while reducing whites and Asian-Americans. The plaintiffs said this meant there was a penalty for being Asian-American. “Further details (especially around the personal rating) may provide further insight,” Harvard’s internal report said. But, the plaintiffs said in their motion Friday, there was no further insight, because, “Harvard killed the study and quietly buried the reports.” Harvard said that the review was discounted because it was preliminary and incomplete. At the end of the admissions process, the class of applicants is fine-tuned through a so-called “lop list,” which includes race. Almost the entire page in which the plaintiffs describe that fine-tuning has been blacked out. Mr. Blum, the founder of Students for Fair Admissions, said Friday that it was “disreputable” of Harvard to complain that information was being taken out of context while at the same time insisting on significant redactions of the evidence. In a heavily redacted section, the plaintiffs describe how Harvard and 15 other elite schools share notes about the race of admitted students at a meeting of the Association of Black Admissions and Financial Aid Officers of the Ivy League and Sister Schools every year. The court papers portray them as a sort of secret society of admissions officers exchanging information about race, a sensitive aspect of admissions. Harvard’s class of 2021 is 14.6 percent African-American, 22.2 percent Asian-American, 11.6 percent Hispanic and 2.5 percent Native-American or Pacific Islander, according to Harvard’s website.",The New York Times
2018,Harvey Weinstein Pleads Not Guilty to Sexual Assault Charges,"Harvey Weinstein returned to court in Manhattan on Tuesday to plead not guilty to sexual assault charges lodged against him in an indictment last week. Mr. Weinstein, unshaven and in a black suit, limped slightly as he came into State Supreme Court in Manhattan at 10 a.m. The court clerk asked him how he pleaded to first-degree criminal sexual act and other charges, and he answered “not guilty” in a gravel baritone. It was Mr. Weinstein’s first court appearance since his May 25 arrest on charges that he sexually assaulted two women in New York. Last week, a grand jury indicted Mr. Weinstein, 66, on the same charges — one count each of first-degree rape and third-degree rape and one count of first-degree criminal sexual act. Mr. Weinstein’s not-guilty plea had been expected. He has steadfastly denied he forced any of the dozens of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct to have sex with him. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said two sexual encounters described in the indictment handed up last week were consensual. “However reprehensible the crime of rape is, it is equally reprehensive to falsely accuse someone of rape,” Mr. Brafman said in court. “Mr. Weinstein has denied these allegations. He enjoys the presumption of innocence and vigorously denies these charges. He intends to fight them.” Once one of the most powerful and admired movie producers in Hollywood, Mr. Weinstein has had a steep fall in the last seven months since The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposés in which numerous women accused him of luring them to hotel rooms, ostensibly to talk business, then making unwanted sexual advances. The stories, which won a Pulitzer Prize, became a catalyst for the #MeToo movement and prompted a cascade of revelations about other successful men who have abused their power to sexually harass women in the worlds of media, the arts, sports, haute cuisine and entertainment. More than 80 women, including the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, have come forward with similar stories about Mr. Weinstein. Some accused him of using physical force to compel them to have sex. Others said he tried to barter parts in movies for sex, or threatened to ruin their careers if they did not comply. Despite investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York, the accounts did not lead to a criminal prosecution, until two weeks ago, when the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., became the first prosecutor to say he had enough evidence to arrest Mr. Weinstein. The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, handed a copy of indictment to the defense along with a voluntary disclosure report, which lists the evidence against Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Brafman said he intended to challenge the indictment on several grounds, including how it was presented to the grand jury. Justice James M. Burke said he would decide the pretrial motions by Sept. 20, when Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to return to court. Manhattan prosecutors have said they may try to persuade the judge to let them present evidence about past allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein that are not charged in the indictment. This would be done to establish a pattern of behavior, much as prosecutors did to win a conviction against Bill Cosby at his sexual assault trial in Pennsylvania. But Mr. Brafman said he would fight to keep that evidence out. Under New York case law, it is difficult for prosecutors in the state to introduce evidence at trial about earlier uncharged crimes. The grand jury that handed up the indictment on Wednesday is still hearing from witnesses and could add charges. Prosecutors are also digging into the books of Mr. Weinstein’s companies, searching for evidence of financial crimes. Investigators continue to interview women who have said Mr. Weinstein forced them to have sex with him. On Monday, for instance, prosecutors met with Melissa Thompson, an entrepreneur who asserted in a lawsuit filed on Friday that Mr. Weinstein overpowered her and raped her during what was supposed to be a sales pitch at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel in September 2011, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation. Much of Mr. Weinstein’s half-hour in court was taken up with a discussion of whether Mr. Brafman had a conflict of interest in representing the producer because his former associate, Alex Spiro, had spoken with Ms. Thompson last fall about representing her. Mr. Spiro maintains he left Mr. Brafman’s firm before Ms. Thompson contacted him. He says he spoke briefly with her on the telephone and then referred her to another lawyer. But Ms. Thompson and her lawyer contend in the lawsuit filed on Friday that Mr. Spiro led her to believe he still worked for Mr. Brafman, and she sent him a videotape of her meeting with Mr. Weinstein, which she said supported her claim. Mr. Brafman told Justice Burke he never communicated with Ms. Thompson and did not know she existed before last week. He said he had no knowledge of her communications with Mr. Spiro and Mr. Spiro “never had anything to do with Mr. Weinstein.” Ms. Illuzzi said the district attorney’s office did not object to Mr. Brafman continuing to represent Mr. Weinstein as long as Mr. Brafman agreed to forgo cross-examining Ms. Thompson on her communications with Mr. Spiro. She told the judge the prosecution had no current plans to call her. Justice Burke asked Mr. Weinstein if he agreed to waive his right to have his lawyer cross-examine Ms. Thompson on her contacts with Mr. Spiro. “Yes,” Mr. Weinstein answered. The indictment charges Mr. Weinstein with first-degree and third-degree rape as well as first-degree criminal sexual act, which covers forced oral or anal sex. If Mr. Weinstein is convicted of the top charges, he faces a penalty of five to 25 years in prison. The criminal sex act count stems from an encounter with Lucia Evans, a marketing executive who told investigators that Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex in 2004 during what she thought would be a casting meeting at the Miramax office in TriBeCa. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified. Prosecutors have said she was attacked on March 18, 2013, inside a Doubletree Hotel at 569 Lexington Avenue.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Have We Lost Our Civic Consciousness?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “The Strange Failure of the Educated Elite” (column, May 29): It seems that David Brooks has found, in Steven Brill’s new book on meritocracy, a new angle from which to view the roots of our country’s myriad ills as primarily cultural and moral, instead of economic and political. A boomer myself, I see much gone astray, but I hesitate to ascribe our current state to the disappearance of some mythical sense of community and civic consciousness. These are red herrings, diversions from the realities (and evils) of the frequent wars, increasing economic inequality and political corruption that have marked America’s trajectory, beginning in the early 1960s. The fragmentation that Mr. Brooks laments has little to do with the encouraging recent history of expanded educational opportunity and social freedom. Diversity is hardly the culprit. A pervasive spirit of community can grow only in a society that aims to provide fairly for all, which appears to be a receding goal in the present climate of untethered capitalism and political venality. G.L. LOMAX, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: David Brooks admires our country’s progress to a meritocracy, while clearly explaining its weaknesses. What we need, he claims, is “a new ethos to reconfigure it.” Actually, what we need is quite an old one: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I? And if not now, when?” Aren’t these concise questions from Hillel, the ancient Jewish sage, exactly what Mr. Brooks is recommending we ask ourselves now? JUDITH G. ZALESNEBRYN MAWR, PA. To the Editor: Mr. Brooks, I take it you are talking about the baby boomer generation when you say “us” and “we.” Born in the late 1960s, I am solidly Gen X. I did grow up understanding the importance of community, of working together, of having a life with meaning, not just money. I see the echoes of the boomer belief in independence and meritocracy in the millennials. They are incredibly focused on individual success as opposed to what is better for all. I am very hopeful that the new generation that is coming of age will begin to change what you boomers and your children have created. These young people, like the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, are looking to make this a better world for all of us. I believe they will. Don’t worry, we and they will clean up your mess. BRENDA SHERIDANSWAMPSCOTT, MASS. To the Editor: David Brooks asks why has so much talent produced such poor results. One answer is that the explosion of material gains in the second half of the 20th century, following the Great Depression and a world war, led to a misplaced sense of values, in which success was measured by the pursuit of wealth and its ostentatious display. If meritocracy was intended to replace a society based on inherited entitlement, then there had to be a way for the successful to proclaim their superiority. If they couldn’t point to their ancestral tree to prove their worthiness, they had to show off the physical manifestations of their success: mega-mansions and vacation homes, luxury cars and private planes. If one were inclined to support worthy causes, how better than to have your name carved into the facade of a hospital building or an arts center to shout out your generosity? But meaningful investment in the community and its institutions, the sweat labor of day-to-day involvement in their activities, could be left to others. What does it matter if inequality rises, faith in institutions plummets, social trust declines, government becomes dysfunctional and our society is bitterly divided? The position of the educated elite atop the economic pyramid serves as testament to the elite’s worthiness. JAY N. FELDMANPORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: David Brooks’s excellent column neglects to mention the Vietnam War as a source of disillusion and disaffection on the part of the educated elite coming of age in the 1960s. The civil rights movement, which engaged the best of my generation, segued into the antiwar movement, which undermined trust in the government and the leaders who misled the public and exacted a high and bloody price in the lives of that generation. BRUCE M. SHIPMANGROTON, CONN. To the Editor: David Brooks ponders why American meritocracy has failed to deliver good government. How about this: While there may indeed be important exceptions (the sciences, for example), American meritocracy is largely a myth. Yes, opening the doors to women and minorities is great. But that in itself doesn’t guarantee meritocracy any more than providing a choice of 50 flavors guarantees good ice cream. A century ago, artists needed talent to succeed. Now they are largely products of marketing machines. Rich dealers and collectors finance museum exhibitions to make the works of their chosen artists more valuable. Music has followed a similar downward spiral toward the lowest common denominator. University humanities departments have become something of a joke. I could provide many more examples, but one will suffice: Before concluding that America is a meritocracy, just look who’s in the White House, and who’s in the cabinet. WILLIAM COLE, SITGES, SPAIN To the Editor: I disagree with David Brooks on at least one point. The “educated elite” did not lead to the rise of Donald Trump. Rather, Mr. Trump, his followers and the current dysfunctional government are the result of a last-gasp throwback to the time when, as Mr. Brooks describes, you “climbed the corporate ladder if you golfed at the right club” — a time that Mr. Trump would like to return to. The new America, which started in the post-World War II baby boom and diversified the elite, led to a moment of hope with a president like Barack Obama. I believe that that America will eventually win out. ELLYN ROTH, NEW YORK To the Editor: David Brooks astutely lays out many reasons behind the recent weakening of the social bonds that hold us together as a society and the related loss of faith in our governing institutions. However, I was surprised to see no mention of the contribution to this trend made by the conservative movement, which has represented our guiding cultural and political philosophy over much of the past 40 years. It was, after all, Ronald Reagan who famously said, “The most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ ” While reasonable people can certainly disagree over the proper size and role of government, an ideology that constantly trumpets the importance of individuals working on behalf of their own personal ambition and denigrates the contributions of our civil servants is bound to have a detrimental effect on our view of these institutions over time. Government guided our country through the Great Depression, and with the help of the Greatest Generation won World War II. Surely, conservatives’ more recent drumbeat of attacks on government is part of the story. MARTIN WELLINGBRONXVILLE, N.Y. To the Editor: David Brooks’s explanation for “The Strange Failure of the Educated Elite” is right about everything except the value of diversity, which he argues is a midpoint, not an endpoint, in establishing a more fair social system. But diversity is the loftiest of goals: Being able to understand someone radically different — and appreciate what you cannot know for yourself — is what art, philosophy and literature all help us do, sharpening our sensitivity to what is outside our own narrow experience. Building a government that recognizes this diversity, an economy that rewards it, a politics that honors it and a justice system that guarantees it are equally (and still not impossible) lofty goals.

2018,Have You Taken the Specialized High Schools Exam?,"There are eight specialized high schools in New York City that admit students based on their performance on a single, one-day test. While the number of students they serve is relatively small, they take on outsize importance because they are among the most prestigious schools in the city — like Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science — and because their demographics deviate so starkly from the system over all. Black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city’s public school students, but they received just 10 percent of offers for seats at specialized schools in the fall. Both white and Asian students, on the other hand, are overrepresented. About 27 percent of the offers went to white students, who make up 15 percent of the school system; 52 percent went to Asian students, who make up 16 percent. This month, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had avoided the issue during his first term, proposed changing the way students are admitted to the schools, to use students’ class rank and state test scores instead. “We have to make sure the very best high schools are open to every New Yorker, every kind of New Yorker,” Mr. de Blasio said. “They need to look like New York City.” The change would require an act of the Legislature, which has delayed any action until the fall.",The New York Times
2018,Have a Relaxed Airbnb Visit — but Not Too Relaxed,"I Was Misinformed Hello! Cindy and Jack here. We’re delighted you’ve chosen Casita Mellow Yellow for your getaway, and as Airbnb Super Hosts we want to make sure you have a wonderful time. Relax, enjoy the bracing Catskill Mountains air or a snooze in the hammock if you can figure out how to make it stay up. Of course, as this is our home, not a hotel, we ask you to follow a few house rules. 1) Your GPS may not work in the mountains, so when you get off State Route 212, take a right onto the narrow dirt road at the body of the dead deer and drive eight miles, more or less. (Make sure that’s a dead female deer. Taking the turn at the dead male deer will take you to Pennsylvania.) Our house is the white shingled farmhouse with the bright yellow shutters. It is NOT the white shingled farmhouse with the faded sunflower yellow shutters. Do NOT attempt to enter the house with the faded sunflower yellow shutters. And if the owner is outdoors and sees you, say you are Cindy’s cousin. 2) The front door key is in a white envelope under the geranium pot next to the porch. If you see a little green snake, do not be alarmed, it’s a garter snake and it’s harmless. The one with the coppery red head and bands across its body is another story. The snakebite kit is in a shoe box on the top shelf of the closet of the bedroom with the yellow comforter. Or maybe the room with the old typewriter. Our suggestion: If you are part of a large group, tell the most annoying member to get the key. 3) Once inside the house you’ll find a line of light switches to the right of the door. The first is for the porch, the second is for the kitchen, the third is merely to confuse you and the fourth, which we have taken the trouble not to mark in any way, should NOT BE TOUCHED or something horrible will happen. We’re not going to tell you what. Think about it when you can’t sleep because the man next door has had a few drinks and is blasting “Who Let the Dogs Out” from his front porch because he hates Airbnb and hates city people and knows you are not Cindy’s cousin. 4) We are a shoe-free house, so we ask that you wear thick socks or slippers when indoors. The house slippers should be previously unworn and have felt soles. Brand is unimportant. 5) The kitchen is fully equipped and ready for your enjoyment. We do ask that when you use the dishwasher, you open the cabinet door beside it, find the drain hose, and hold it aloft during the rinse cycle. DO NOT OVERLOAD the dishwasher or it will flood and ruin the floor. Will our homeowner’s insurance cover this, or is it something for which we will hold you responsible? That’s something else to think about when you can’t sleep because the crackpot next door has put beer bottles on the tree stumps in front of his house and decides 11 p.m. is a good time for target practice. 6) Please do not touch the wines and liquor on the cabinet in the living room. Especially the Maker’s. We have drawn lines in ink visible to our eyes only on the bottles and we’ll know. 7) You’ll find firewood, kindling, and matches beside the fireplace, which cannot be used by guests and is just there to taunt you. 8) This is an old house with old plumbing, so we ask you not to flush hygiene products, condoms, or much of anything down the toilet. You’re in the country, go outside and squat. Nobody will see you but that raving whack job next door, and as you may have noticed, he’s an erratic shot. 9) There’s a grill on the back patio. You’re welcome to enjoy it. We do ask that after each use you dissemble and clean it, making sure the grill box is free of food debris and the burner tubes are not clogged. The steel brushes are in the basement, behind the work bench, under Jack’s antique scythe collection. The basement light does not work so just feel your way around. 10) In case you break a wine glass, no problem. It happens and we have your credit card. 11) Garbage: We recycle, so separate glass, plastic, metal, the stuff that looks like metal but is really tin over paper, and put it in the containers under the sink. Food refuse goes in the tall garbage can in the kitchen. There is a private garbage pickup service in the area whose trucks you may have seen. We do not use it. Would we be renting our house and staying with Jack’s mother if we could afford a $60-a-month garbage service? At the end of your stay, double bag refuse and take it to the town dump, which is an easy 20-mile ride from the house on a former logging road. If you’ve brought along a pickup truck, this is the time to use it. Drive SLOW, the road is rutted and there are no guard rails. 12) The town dump is open to residents only so you’ll need our dump permit which we keep under the Mr. Coffee. But it was a nice ride, wasn’t it? 13) Checkout time is noon. Before leaving the house, unplug the appliances and make sure the windows and doors are closed and locked. Button your camouflage jacket to the collar, stay low to the ground and run. And if you make it back to the city, be sure to remember to write a review. We know it will be glowing. We gave your address to the guy next door.",The New York Times
2018,Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Wants Tourists to Stay Away from Volcano,"Q & A She says it is not safe to visit Kilauea but that almost all of the Big Island and other destinations in the state have not been affected (the surfing is fine). Traveling between Washington and the eight Hawaiian islands she represents is second nature for Representative Tulsi Gabbard, 37, but it’s still grueling and time-consuming. It’s a 5,000-mile, two-flight, 11-to-15-hour trip home to Oahu. Then she boards another plane to each of the islands. This has been a rough couple of months for Hawaii. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island that erupted on May 3 has frequently been in the headlines. There also have been record-breaking rains — more than 49 inches in 24 hours — on the island of Kauai and in parts of East Oahu that have led to flash flooding, landslides and sink holes. Ms. Gabbard, a Democrat who represents the 2nd District of Hawaii, has visited the affected areas several times to help mobilize support and to ensure safety precautions are taken. She is also a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard and was called for duty shortly after the eruption to help people evacuate and keep them out of dangerous spots. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Gabbard. How do you keep up with the latest news about the volcano? I rely on multiple sources to tell me about conditions on the ground and where the threats are highest. Residents call or send me text and social media messages. I get updates from government and emergency management workers and the National Guard. And live notices go out via cellphone. What do things look like now? There’s a fast-moving lava flow going to another section of the Lower Puna community. Cellphone service has been cut off because power lines and cell towers are down. A major thoroughfare has been cut off and many families had to evacuate in the middle of the night. Local agriculture is devastated. Farms have been overrun by lava or crops have died due to volcanic gases in the air. What are some of the dangers? The direct threats to residents and first responders are the lava flow, which has created a 2,400-acre lava field and destroyed over 100 structures, and the volcanic gases. The volcano emits sulfur dioxide, which at high concentrations can be a health hazard especially for children, the elderly and people with respiratory illness. The broader threat is gaseous vog and ash — vog is the volcanic form of fog. It not only threatens the immediate community but depending on how the wind travels is potentially dangerous to other communities miles away. What precautions should travelers take? We don’t recommend and actually discourage tourists from visiting the active volcano area. Resources are strained. First responders — police, fire, civil defense and the National Guard — are focused on evacuations and keeping residents safe. The situation is continually changing and evolving. Now is not the time for tourists to blanket the area. Has tourism been affected by the volcano? The portion of land directly impacted by the volcano is quite small. Only 10 square miles are off limits. Big Island is over 4,000 square miles, almost the size of Connecticut. Most of the island is safe and of course our other islands haven’t been affected. How do you manage your long-distance life? Carefully. Personally, my husband and I take turns traveling back and forth, sometimes meeting in the middle. Professionally, I thank God for technology. There are many ways I stay in touch with my constituents — telephone town halls, FaceTime, Skype, email newsletters, social media, letters, phone conversations and texts. I drink a lot of coconut water. It’s one of the most effective natural electrolyte liquids one can drink to prevent dehydration. When you’re constantly on a plane staying hydrated is critical to staying well. Does surfing help you unwind? Yes. Growing up in Hawaii the ocean has always been a really big part of my life. My husband proposed to me four years ago at one of our favorite surf breaks during sunset. When I’m home in Hawaii we make it a priority to get in the water. We’ll try to go for a sunrise surf before I start my day. Surfing also helps with jet lag. The ocean is calming, peaceful and rejuvenating. What do you pack in your carry-on? I always bring a reusable, refillable water bottle. I go to refilling stations in airports to be sure I have a full bottle when the plane takes off. I take hand sanitizer, anti-bacterial wipes — I give everything a quick wipe down when I sit down in the plane — headphones, meditation beads and my laptop because work never stops. Wi-Fi over the continental U.S. is fine but as soon as we hit the Pacific Ocean it’s wiped out. That’s when I can begin to relax.",The New York Times
2018,He Bumbled His Way Into a Second First Date,"Mini-Vows Emily Horwitz Gordon and Benjamin Taylor Lowe were married June 23 at the home of Geraldine Brooks and Tony Horwitz, the bride’s aunt and maternal uncle, in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Angela Weisl, a Universal Life minister and a cousin of the bride, officiated. The bride, 33, and groom, 35, both graduated from Cornell. The bride is a public defender at Queens Law Associates in Forest Hills, Queens. She received a law degree cum laude from Brooklyn Law School. She is a daughter of Erica Horwitz and David A. Gordon of Scarsdale, N.Y. The bride’s father is a criminal defense lawyer in private practice in Manhattan. Her mother is a supervising criminal appeals lawyer at the Manhattan law firm Appellate Advocates. The groom is a political strategist at Pythia Public, a public affairs and strategy firm in Brooklyn. He is also pursuing a Master of Science in analytics through Georgia Tech. He is the son of Valerie Taylor of San Rafael, Calif., and Scott A. Lowe of Richmond, Vt. The groom’s father owns a web design and information technology company in Richmond. His mother, who is retired, was an urban planner at Nelson\Nygaard in San Francisco, a company that provides strategic networks of transit service for metropolitan areas. The groom is the stepson of Deborah C. Lowe. Although Ms. Gordon and Mr. Lowe overlapped in their time at Cornell, during which she attended several concerts performed by his a cappella group, the Hangovers, they did not meet in college. They first managed to meet, albeit briefly, in the fall of 2014, connecting on the online dating site OkCupid. But Mr. Lowe, who was still recovering emotionally from a long-term relationship that had recently ended, abruptly canceled what would have been their first date. He canceled just two hours before they were to meet at a bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “I said to her ‘I’m sorry to do this, you really seem fantastic,’” Mr. Lowe recalled. “‘I’m just not in a place to be dating right now. I hope to see you some other time.’” Ms. Gordon, who had already dressed for the occasion and assumed she would never see Mr. Lowe again, was not happy. “I was pretty annoyed,” she said. “I remember saying something a little bit fresh, and being very short with him after that, and I just moved on.” So did Mr. Lowe, but unbeknown to each of them, they kept moving in the same direction. In August 2015, they were back in each other’s orbit, this time on the dating app Bumble. Mr. Lowe reached out to Ms. Gordon, not remembering who she was, and soon after, he was more than a bit shocked when her electronic response identified her as “Emily OKCUPID.” “He immediately remembered me and said, ‘Oh my God,’ I’m so sorry, I won’t cancel on you again if you give me another chance,’” Ms. Gordon recalled. Mr. Lowe got his second chance, at the same Williamsburg bar they had originally targeted for their first date a year earlier. “We had a great time,” Ms. Gordon said. “Not only was he cute but he was funny, and he was also the smartest person I had ever met. “Looking back, I’m glad he canceled our date the year before,” she said, “because had we gone out at that time, things might not have turned out as well as they did.” Mr. Lowe agreed. “Things were much better for us the second time around,” he said. “Emily is the most deeply compassionate person I have ever met. She cares so much about the world around her.” “After our second date,” he said, “I called my father and told him I had found the woman I wanted to be with for the rest of my life.”",The New York Times
2018,"He Couldn’t Refuse a Deathbed Plea. Now He’s Got 10,000 Pieces of Art.","SEATTLE — Seven words. That’s how it started. “Can you take care of the collection?” As Arvi Ostrom lay dying more than 20 years ago, he made that request of his grandson Ken Carlson. Mr. Carlson immediately said yes, of course, even though he really had no idea of the magnitude of the commitment. Mr. Ostrom had been a mostly self-taught artist, and his grandson figured that “the collection” might add up to a hundred or so sketches and paintings. In any case, he said, you don’t deny the last wishes of a grandfather you love. But art and family are complicated subjects. And only when they’re combined, and the art — as Mr. Carlson found to his shock — comes in giant piles, do you start to understand what kind of burden can unfold from a simple promise. Over the course of more than 70 years, starting in the 1920s through his final days at age 91, Mr. Ostrom produced about 10,000 drawings, paintings and wooden sculptures. Whimsical cartoons of tough guys, clenching cigarettes in steel-trap jaws. Portraits of sad-eyed people who might have been patrons at the Snug Harbor, the bar Mr. Ostrom ran in Astoria, Ore. Haunting images of ghost ships sailing off into the Pacific, laced in shadow and gloom. He let his imagination roam the world as he sketched in the quiet hours beside the cash register or at home. Leaving the collection to Mr. Carlson — no one else in the family wanted it — created its own questions. He looked into publishing a family book about Arvi’s art, or buying back the building that had housed the Snug Harbor to open a cafe, or a little museum, but the plans all foundered. And every year that no answer was found raised Mr. Carlson’s worry that the promise had been too much. Mr. Ostrom’s art was simple in its goals, lacking the grander message that art buyers and critics look for. No major museum or local gallery is likely to beckon. Years ago, an appraiser had come to look and figured the collection might be worth $10 a piece as folk art. But selling the work was never part of Mr. Carlson’s plan anyway, nor has he ever tried to sell it. This wasn’t high art, but that wasn’t really the point. This was about a family relationship across generations, the weight of old promises that can keep you awake at night and, perhaps most of all, the mystery of a creative impulse quietly, relentlessly sustained. “I had to honor him and his commitment, that he just kept at it,” said Mr. Carlson, who is 59 and a musician, carpenter and music teacher. “Arvi didn’t give up, and I couldn’t either.” The journey has been long. Over the years, Mr. Carlson said he had “freakouts,” when he would look at the art and start to think that there was some sort of message in it — a secret text from grandfather to grandson hidden in the eyes of Mr. Ostrom’s portrait subjects or the gnarled hands of the fishermen. There were shadows in the Ostrom household that could make you expect hidden messages. Family members said Mr. Ostrom was stoic and taciturn, raised in a corner of the Pacific Northwest near the mouth of the Columbia River where Finnish immigrants came in the 1800s for the fishing. He was scarred, his relatives said, by the sudden and never-explained death of his father, a fisherman and farmer, when Arvi was 5, and by the hard life that came after. Loss always seemed to lurk on the horizon. Mr. Ostrom refused to tell his five children — all daughters — that he loved them, for example, the oldest said, because he said he didn’t want them to be too sad when he died. The Snug Harbor was never a place Mr. Ostrom loved, either, despite decades behind the bar, selling sandwiches and coffee to fishermen heading out in the mornings and beer when they came back at night. The bar put food on the table for the big family. His daughters were forbidden to set foot in the place. A heartbreaking truth about Mr. Ostrom and his passion: The pieces of art he felt best about, and proudest of, were ones he hid away. Perhaps, his grandson said, he feared the prospect of rejection or loss. He had tried to sell some work early in life and eventually gave up. In an art correspondence course he took in 1928 from Federal Schools Inc. of Minneapolis, he was given a grade of “fairly good,” according a letter he kept along with the stacks of work. So he created a snug harbor of his own, beaming himself out of the world of beer and pickled eggs and cigars by sketching and drawing nonstop, until his death. Mr. Carlson, the grandson, lives in a house that he calls an artistic creation too. He sleeps in a loft by the kitchen. His bathroom has no door, and he has for years rented bedrooms upstairs at bargain rates to artists who needed help. Arvi’s art is stored on shelves, in binders, in the basement. His mother, Lois Carlson, said that Mr. Carlson’s devotion to his grandfather has opened eyes in the family to the idea that Mr. Ostrom may have bequeathed something greater than they realized at the time. “We didn’t think there was anything special about it growing up, it was just what Dad did,” Ms. Carlson, 83, said. Last month, the biggest show ever of Arvi Ostrom’s art, more than a 150 portraits, cartoons and sketches, went up on the walls of the Redwing Cafe, a coffeehouse and vegetarian restaurant a few blocks from Mr. Carlson’s house here. A photograph taken in the 1930s of Mr. Ostrom, standing behind the bar at the Snug Harbor in a white shirt and bow tie, greets visitors as they walk in. “It’s so weird to see it in another place,” Mr. Carlson said, standing on a ladder as he helped mount the show. He hung an unframed portrait, protected in its plastic sleeve, onto the wall. The art had left the basement.",The New York Times
2018,He Delivered Pizza to an Army Base in Brooklyn. Now He Faces Deportation.,"Food delivery. Sanctuary. Those are often the anchors for the more than half a million undocumented immigrants who live and work in New York City. But an incident at the United States Army base in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, last week has called those foundations into question, and provoked new tension in the city’s battle with federal immigration authorities over protections for immigrants without legal status. Pablo Villavicencio Calderon, 35, an undocumented immigrant, was making a delivery from a brick-oven pizza restaurant in Queens to the Army base next to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Friday before lunchtime. According to his wife, Sandra Chica, he presented a New York City identification card, as he had done in the past. The card, provided through a program called IDNYC, was supposed to give undocumented immigrants a method of proving their identification when dealing with city agencies, including the schools system and the Police Department, neither of which is allowed to ask about immigration status. But on that day, Ms. Chica said, it was not enough for the military police officer on duty, who said Mr. Villavicencio needed a driver’s license, which he did not have. A background check revealed an open order of deportation from 2010. Military personnel detained him and called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who took him into custody, an official for the immigration agency said. He is scheduled to be deported to Ecuador next week, his wife said. “The arrest of Pablo with a municipal ID is sending shock waves throughout the immigrant community because they were told they would have some form of living in this city without harassment,” Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and a Democrat, said at a news conference on Wednesday outside the Army base. “Now everyone with those IDs are afraid what will happen.” The Trump administration made it clear from the outset that all immigrants living illegally in the United States would be subject to deportation; there would no longer be priorities emphasizing the deportation of dangerous criminals. According to Catherine SantoPietro, a spokeswoman for the Army command at the base, only a Department of Defense or military identification is acceptable for entry. Otherwise, visitors must get a day pass, which requires an on-site background check. “Upon signing a waiver permitting a background check, Department of the Army Access Control standard for all visitors, an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement warrant was discovered on file,” Ms. SantoPietro said in a statement. The episode exposed the tenuous protection undocumented immigrants have in New York, despite that fact that as a so-called sanctuary city, it limits cooperation with immigration officials. And using an IDNYC card can have unintended consequences, acting as a signal that a holder is undocumented. “Because when you show that, you are telling the other people, ‘Listen, I don’t have a driver’s license,’” Ms. Chica said. “Is this city, state and nation safer because they took a pizza delivery guy off the street?” asked Justin Brannan, a Democratic city councilman representing Brooklyn, at the news conference. Mr. Adams wondered why the base policy had appeared to shift, since according to Mr. Villavicencio he had delivered without incident before. “That is why, as a sanctuary city, we need to be clear for those federal locations, what are you requiring of people entering the location,” Mr. Adams said. But State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican member of the Senate Committee on Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs, applauded the actions of the military police, saying that he “would expect nothing less from the Fort Hamilton commander and its dedicated personnel who have committed their lives to protecting our citizens and country.” Mr. Villavicencio knew that he was constantly at risk of deportation, his wife said. He had no criminal record, according to a spokeswoman for ICE, as the immigration agency is known. He was granted a voluntary departure order from an immigration judge in 2010, but did not leave. That made him a fugitive. Mr. Villavicencio married Ms. Chica, 38, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, five years ago, she said. They live in Hempstead, on Long Island. They have two daughters. In February, Ms. Chica said, her husband applied for a green card as the spouse of a United States citizen, but had not heard back. He had been working for the past eight months for Nonna Delia’s, a brick-oven pizza restaurant in College Point, Queens. Doing a delivery job without a driver’s license “was his mistake,” his wife said. A manager at the restaurant, reached by phone on Wednesday, would say only that Mr. Villavicencio “is a good guy,” but did not want to comment further because “the family is suffering.” The restaurant is nearly an hour away from the base, and the manager acknowledged that it had delivered there in the past. Ms. Chica said the personnel at the base had still accepted his food delivery. When she went to pick up his car, the two large containers designed to hold the food were empty, she said.",The New York Times
2018,"He Died at Pompeii, but His Head Wasn’t Crushed by a Block","The skull of the “unluckiest man” at the Mount Vesuvius eruption was found by archaeologists, intact and with a mouth full of teeth. He was known across the internet as “Pompeii’s Unluckiest Man.” But the story that spread about his demise may have been greatly exaggerated, a new finding suggests. In May, archaeologists uncovered the ancient remains of a man who had been seemingly crushed by a flying boulder while fleeing from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Only his skeletal legs and lower torso protruded from beneath the 600-pound block. At the time, the team reported that a volcanic cloud had launched a stone door jamb toward the man, decapitating him. What appeared to be the Wile E. Coyote-esque nature of the man’s final moments made him an instant, meme-worthy celebrity some 2,000 years after his death. But further digging has unearthed the man’s intact skull with his mouth wide open (and full of teeth), suggesting he was not crushed by a volcanic projectile. The skull and the man’s upper torso and arms were found about three feet nearly directly below the rest of the body and the gigantic stone. The team said they knew the bones belonged to the same person because of their proximity to each other and because the two halves matched up. The archaeologists from the Pompeii Archaeological Park announced their finding Thursday. “The death of the victim arrived not because of the block falling on the skull,” said Massimo Osanna, the director of the Pompeii archaeological site. “Our new hypothesis is that he died from asphyxiation from the pyroclastic flow.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The team had already determined that the man, thought to be around 35 years old, had a physical defect that caused him to limp. It’s possible the disability slowed him down, making him more vulnerable to the incoming noxious gas and ash. He was one of about 2,000 known victims from the eruption. Most of the people were either flash-heated to death from the pyroclastic flow or died from asphyxiation. They also found that the man had a small sack with an iron key, about 20 silver coins and two bronze coins. The team thinks the upper part of the man’s torso became separated from the lower half sometime from 1748 and 1815 when Naples was under the control of the Bourbon dynasty. During this time, archaeologists often dug tunnels into the ash. Dr. Osanna and his team thinks the excavators may have dug a tunnel beneath the skeleton which eventually collapsed, causing the skull and upper torso to fall. The team is not sure when the block fell over the body. One hypothesis is that the man was in or near a building during the eruption when he suffocated and died. The walls — and the large stone block — may have collapsed at the same time or later and fallen over the deceased body. “The surprise for us was that the skull was intact and it was not crushed by the block,” said Dr. Osanna. “Now that we have the complete skeleton we can understand a lot of things.” Though the skull has some fractures on it, Dr. Osanna said that he and his team plan on analyzing it for DNA in hopes of learning more about the man’s ancient past before his fretful final moments.",The New York Times
2018,He Fixes the Worst P.R. Crises Imaginable. Then Came Harvey Weinstein.,"Michael Sitrick built his career on helping the rich and powerful deflect damaging headlines. There was no spinning this. CreditCreditJulian Berman for The New York Times Michael Sitrick couldn’t comment on Harvey Weinstein. Until a few weeks earlier, Mr. Sitrick’s crisis management firm, Sitrick and Company, had been managing Mr. Weinstein’s unprecedented crisis. Mr. Sitrick had dropped Mr. Weinstein, but he couldn’t say why. He couldn’t confirm if it was because Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, though he could confirm it was true that Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, and that the two parties were in arbitration. He couldn’t say if there were other factors. But he could say what were not factors. He could confirm, for instance, that he did not resign out of concern for his company’s own reputation. “You can’t do that,” Mr. Sitrick said. “You cannot put your firm’s interests ahead of the client’s interests.” Mr. Sitrick could also confirm that he had not grown morally uncomfortable with the flood of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. When I asked about this — and this was not long before Mr. Weinstein would be arrested in Manhattan on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act and swiftly indicted by a grand jury — he looked at me as if I’d just stepped off a U.F.O. “The law of this land is innocent until proven guilty,” Mr. Sitrick said. “There hasn’t been a single case that has gone to trial.” All this to say: Mr. Sitrick could not “comment,” but he could do what he has made a fortune doing for the better part of three decades. He could spin. Even if you don’t know his name, you know his work. Mr. Sitrick has been managing the narratives of besieged celebrities since the early 1990s. He represented Kelsey Grammer when the star was accused of having sex with his underage babysitter. He helped Christian Slater when the actor was arrested on charges of assaulting his girlfriend, biting a man who tried to stop him and then trying to grab a police officer’s gun. When Erin Everly, about whom Axl Rose wrote “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” was suing Mr. Rose for assault and sexual battery, Mr. Sitrick got her story on the cover of People magazine. Mr. Sitrick was retained by Halle Berry when she was in a hit-and-run, Naomi Campbell when she was accused of assaulting her housekeeper, and Rush Limbaugh when he was arrested on prescription drug charges. “Paris absolutely did not smoke pot Tuesday night or Wednesday morning,” Mr. Sitrick told a reporter shortly after Paris Hilton was released from jail in 2007. When The New York Daily News reported that Kobe Bryant may have been flirting with someone other than his wife at a Jay-Z concert, Mr. Sitrick was there to push back: “There was no touching of the face, and he did not dance with her.” It was Mr. Sitrick who released the first statement on behalf of Chris Brown after he was arrested on charges of assaulting Rihanna: “Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired. I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God’s help, to emerging a better person.” Mr. Sitrick has also deployed his strategies on behalf of Michael Vick (the dogfighting ring), Alex Rodriguez (the steroid scandal) and R. Kelly (where to begin). But although his celebrity clients attract a disproportionate amount of media coverage, they represent less than 10 percent of Mr. Sitrick’s caseload, he said. Corporate crises are his specialty, including Exxon after the Valdez oil spill, Enron during its accounting-fraud implosion and Theranos, the company that claimed to have revolutionized blood testing but didn’t. Mr. Sitrick helped Roy Disney oust Michael Eisner, and he helped American Apparel oust Dov Charney. He has represented the Daniel Pearl Foundation, on a pro bono basis, and the creator of “Girls Gone Wild.” One of Mr. Sitrick’s more notorious cases was for years taught at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, a kind of cautionary tale about the perils of going undercover. In the early 1990s, two producers for “Primetime Live,” an ABC news program, got jobs in Food Lion supermarkets and secretly videotaped workers, raising questions about the company’s meat handling practices. Food Lion then went to Mr. Sitrick, who obtained outtakes of the videos and raised questions about ABC’s practices, effectively turning a story about bad meat into a story about bad journalism. Richard Wald, an emeritus professor at Columbia, was an executive at ABC at the time, and he has asked Mr. Sitrick to address his journalism students over the years. The point of the lesson, according to Mr. Wald, is that “just because a journalist is finished with a story does not mean the story is finished with the journalist.” Of Mr. Sitrick’s work for Food Lion, Mr. Wald said: “He did an absolutely brilliant job, but it annoyed the hell out of me at the time.” Mr. Sitrick, 70, was once a journalism student himself, at the University of Maryland. He moved into public relations after graduation, following a stint reporting for the Baltimore News-American. “I love journalism,” he remembers telling his wife, Nancy Sitrick, “but I’d rather eat.” When Mr. Sitrick moved to Los Angeles with his wife and three young daughters and founded his firm, in 1989, he made it something of a policy to hire onetime editors and reporters. “It’s easier to teach journalists P.R. than to teach publicists what news judgment is,” he said. Sitrick and Company quickly acquired a reputation for pushing back against the press, using many of the same strategies as journalists. Mr. Sitrick represented the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles during its sex abuse scandal, the Kabbalah Center when journalists suspected it of being a cult, and the Church of Scientology during its investigation by The New Yorker. The prominent lawyer Edwin Stier, a former federal prosecutor, said he has retained Mr. Sitrick in cases in which “a public relations strategy became important to try to get accurate information in the public domain powerfully enough to move public opinion and change national policy.” He recently sought Mr. Sitrick’s help to protect the scoops in “Icarus,” the documentary about Olympic doping. It went on to win an Oscar. Other powerful lawyers turn to Mr. Sitrick, including Marc Kasowitz, part of President Trump’s personal legal team, who said he has used Mr. Sitrick in a “variety of large, high-profile cases.” When Mr. Kasowitz emailed a stranger with threats last July, warning him to “Watch your back, bitch,” Mr. Sitrick responded to the press inquiries that followed: “While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.” One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates — as much as $1,100 an hour. It was in early October, a couple of days after The New York Times published its first report about Harvey Weinstein, that the Hollywood producer called upon Mr. Sitrick to fix the unfixable. Mr. Weinstein had initially handled his own press, together with Lisa Bloom, the lawyer and daughter of Gloria Allred. It hadn’t gone well. “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s,” Mr. Weinstein said in an early statement, before announcing a $5 million foundation for female directors, to be named after his mother, and misquoting Jay-Z lyrics: “I’m not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.” Mr. Sitrick, who said his memory of the initial contact is hazy, was called by Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers on Oct. 7, the day Mr. Sitrick’s mother died. He was in Chicago making funeral arrangements. It was for this reason that he passed the Weinstein case to his colleague Sallie Hofmeister, Mr. Sitrick said, not because of the optics of having a woman run things, as reports suggested. Ms. Hofmeister is a former journalist who had worked at The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. She took over on Oct. 8, the day Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company. Mr. Sitrick described his firm’s role in the Weinstein saga this way: “Our job was to make sure nothing was issued to the media, no statements, without clearance from the lawyers. Our job was to find out what information the reporters had, what information they wanted, go to the lawyers, tell them, and talk to the lawyers about what they wanted to say.” Ms. Hofmeister issued Sitrick and Company’s first response, on Oct. 10, when The New Yorker published an article that included accusations of rape and reported that people at the Weinstein Company knew about the misconduct. “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” the statement said. “Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.” It went on: “Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.” That was the first and last time the firm’s statements would refer to “a second chance.” Later that day, The New York Times published another article, this one containing quotations from Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie accusing Mr. Weinstein of abuse of power. As the #MeToo dam broke, the allegations against Mr. Weinstein multiplied. So did Sitrick and Company’s rebuttals. An abridged timeline: Oct. 19: “Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry. Last year, she sent a personal invitation to Mr. Weinstein to see her in her Broadway show Eclipsed.” Oct. 23: “Brit Marling is a super talented actress and writer. Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events.” Dec. 14: “All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired.” Jan. 30: “Your piece omitted that Rose says she faked an orgasm while Mr. Weinstein was performing oral sex on her. Why? It’s misleading to leave out that part that she describes in detail in her book. Can you please update your story to include her full description of the encounter?” Feb. 3: “Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologized and deeply regrets. However her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue.” By February, more than 80 women had accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or sexual assault, and many of his business associates had spoken about a culture of complicity at his companies. Things would get even worse for Mr. Weinstein. On Feb. 11, Eric T. Schneiderman, then the New York attorney general, before he resigned after reports that he assaulted four women, filed a civil rights lawsuit against Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein was already under investigation by law enforcement in three cities. That same day, the Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy, and released all former employees from their nondisclosure agreements. Sitrick and Company issued what would turn out to be one of its final statements to USA Today, for an article on March 22: “Mr. Weinstein categorically denies ever engaging in any non-consensual sexual conduct with anyone.” Two months later Mr. Weinstein was arrested. His lawyer is Benjamin Brafman, whose clients have included Martin Shkreli, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Vincent Gigante, known as “The Chin.” Mr. Sitrick’s first book, published in 1998, is called “Spin: How to Turn the Power of the Press to Your Advantage.” He wrote it with Allan Mayer, who was a force behind the entertainment division of Sitrick and Company before he left to help found the public relations firm 42 West. In Chapter 3, “Inside the Reporter’s Head,” the authors explain that journalists are a peculiar species motivated not by money, but by an odd mix of cynicism and idealism and an egomaniacal drive to “own” a story. The authors also write: “As grubby as they may often seem, journalists are no less susceptible to the American dream than anyone else.” In Chapter 4, “News Media Abhor a Vacuum,” Mr. Sitrick lays out one of his key tenets: that strategic press representatives must engage the media; “no comment” should never be a first resort. “If you won’t talk to them, they’ll simply find someone else who will,” he and Mr. Mayer write, “which is to say, if you don’t tell your story, someone else will tell it for you.” In keeping with that rule, Mr. Sitrick quickly agreed to an interview for this article. Four days after that, as I read Chapter 7 — “Preempt the Situation” — a Google Alert appeared in my inbox, delivering what Deadline Hollywood billed as an exclusive: “Sitrick and Company Resigns Repping Disgraced Mogul Harvey Weinstein.” The Blast, a celebrity news site and TMZ spinoff, followed a few hours later with an anonymously sourced article stating that Sitrick and Company had filed for arbitration in February, after Mr. Weinstein’s bill went unpaid. “We’re told,” the article said, in the most passive voice, “that even after legal documents were filed to collect from the disgraced producer, Weinstein and his reps ‘begged’ for the firm to continue working with him. We’re told Sitrick refused.” Was Mr. Sitrick already starting to write this story? The Brentwood offices of Sitrick and Company occupy the top floor of a black building on San Vicente. Airy and immaculate, they have the feel of a law firm, but with newsroom touches. Brown leather armchairs are arranged in the reception area, where a cable-news ticker rolls silently across a screen. Mr. Sitrick’s private office is behind two security doors. There, he sat in yet another leather armchair, next to a large potted plant. Asked question after question about Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Sitrick dodged and dodged. He became a little more forthcoming when the approach took a more general tack. So, hypothetically speaking, what were reasons he might drop a client? Mr. Sitrick said he might take that step if the client treated his staff badly. He also said: “I’m not talking about any particular client, but one of the reasons we have resigned cases is people have lied to us or told us information that wasn’t true and we believe they knew it.” So it went for close to three hours. A large painting hangs above Mr. Sitrick’s desk, depicting a dozen or so people gathered behind a barricade outside the O.J. Simpson trial. The painting is not a memento. Mr. Simpson is one of few potential clients Mr. Sitrick has publicly acknowledged turning down. (Michael Jackson is another, although Mr. Sitrick has since represented his estate.) Whatever Mr. Sitrick’s affection for the painting, it loomed on that day as a reminder of the fierce whims of American public opinion — of what we will and won’t forgive, what we will and won’t forget. In this vein, did Mr. Sitrick think the #MeToo phenomenon had caused a lasting shift in American culture? To give some historical context: Twenty years ago, for example, in a Los Angeles Times article, Mr. Sitrick was asked to weigh in on the sportscaster Marv Albert, from a crisis-management point of view. (Mr. Albert was not a client.) “The problem with Marv Albert was not his roughhousing women,” Mr. Sitrick had said at the time. “The problem was the allegation that he was running around in women’s undergarments.” Today, I pointed out, it may very well be the other way around. Mr. Sitrick thought for a moment. “I think people are going to realize that they are going to be held accountable for their actions in a way that they weren’t before,” he said. To be clear, Mr. Sitrick wasn’t referring to Mr. Weinstein.",The New York Times
2018,He Leapt to Catch a Thief. A Photographer Caught the Moment.,"LONDON — It was like a scene straight out of an action movie. A man in the busy shopping district of Manchester, England, chased down a theft suspect and tackled him with a flying leap on Wednesday. He did what many people might dream of doing in that situation, but probably never would, even if they did happen to find themselves in it. The would-be linebacker, who was not named by the police, drew praise in the local news media for what some described as a heroic intervention. Allan Bentley, a staff photographer of Cavendish Press, a British photo agency, happened to be standing nearby and captured the dramatic moment, which soon appeared on the websites of major publications in Britain. It began when an unidentified woman withdrew 170 pounds, about $225, from an A.T.M. near a grocery store and had it snatched out of her hand, the news reports said. Mr. Bentley said in an email that he was just walking down the street when the commotion broke out. “One guy was running full pelt whilst others were running behind him shouting, ‘Stop thief,’ ” he said, adding: “The guy put up quite a struggle, but he was no match for the others who grabbed him.” The man was held down for a few minutes after the citizen’s arrest before the police arrived to take him into custody. The woman got her money back, Mr. Bentley said. Greater Manchester Police confirmed afterward that a 43-year-old man had been arrested. On Thursday, the police identified him as Shazad Rahman, and said that he had been charged with theft. In Britain, unlike the United States, firearms and even armed police officers are a rare sight on the streets. The man who made the tackle had only his agility and strength to perform the feat.",The New York Times
2018,He Left Work for 3 Minutes Before His Lunch Break. Now His Pay Is Docked.,"For the want of a bento box, a Japanese worker who habitually left his desk three minutes before his official lunch break has been docked half a day’s pay. The transgression prompted four senior officials at the city waterworks department in Kobe to hold a news conference offering a public apology for the worker’s conduct. “It’s deeply regrettable that this misconduct took place. We’re sorry,” one bureau official said, as all four bowed deeply. The unidentified 64-year-old employee was fined thousands of yen and reprimanded after an investigation found that he had left the office to order a bento box ahead of his lunch break on 26 occasions over a seven-month period, an official said. The case caught the eye of social media users in a country known for its struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance. “It’s sheer madness. It’s crazy,” said one Twitter user. “Is this a bad joke? Does this mean we cannot even go to the bathroom?” said another. Japan’s work culture can be brutally punishing, spawning cases like that of Miwa Sado, a young journalist at a public broadcaster who died of congestive heart failure after clocking 159 hours of overtime in one month. She was 31. Employees consider napping in public — or in the office — a badge of honor. It telegraphs a sign of diligence and commitment: You are working yourself to the bone. Public acknowledgment by officials and leaders of perceived wrongdoings is also expected in Japan, where rail conductors will beg forgiveness when a train is even a minute late, or early. Such was the case November, when the Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company in Tokyo apologized on its website because a train left a station in Chiba, a suburban prefecture, 20 seconds early. But the case of the waterworks employee calls into question the country’s efforts to address a rise in karoshi, or death from overwork. In a 2016 government report on karoshi, nearly a quarter of companies surveyed said some employees were working more than 80 hours of overtime a month. Months later, Tadashi Ishii, the president of the advertising agency Dentsu, announced his resignation after an outcry over the 2015 death of Matsuri Takahashi, 24, an employee who had killed herself by jumping from the roof of an employee dormitory. In May, the Lower House of Parliament passed a bill to improve working conditions, setting equal pay for equal work by prohibiting unfair treatment of non-regular workers. If approved, the bill would place a cap on overtime work, with penalties for violations: Annual overtime would be limited to 720 hours, with a monthly curb at fewer than 100 hours. But critics argue that some of the provisions would worsen the problem of excessive working hours: The bill would exempt highly skilled and highly paid workers since their salaries would be based on results, not hours worked. Residents whose loved ones had died or had killed themselves were in the chamber, holding photos of the deceased, as the voting took place, according to local news outlets. The bill was sent to the Upper House. Gen Oka, who is in charge of personnel affairs of the waterworks bureau of Kobe City, said in an interview on Friday that the employee had “left his desk about three minutes or so between 11:30 a.m. and 11:40 a.m. 26 times between September 2017 and March 2018.” The employee, who is in charge of inventory control, told his supervisors that he went to a nearby restaurant to order a bento lunch because he needed a “change of pace.” But, the official said, “ordering lunch should be done during his lunch break, between noon and 1 p.m.” The worker was caught when a senior colleague looked out his office window and spotted him walking to get food. Senior management calculated how much time he had spent away from his desk and docked him “thousands of yen as punishment,” Mr. Oka said, adding, “He said, ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘I will never do that again.’ ” The official acknowledged that since making the announcement on June 15, the department had received some blowback, with people calling or writing on its website to complain. “We received about 50 or 60 such opinions,” he said. But the department also got some support, he said, from people who said “we shouldn’t hire such a person who leaves the desk during working hours.” He defended the department’s decision, saying, “It is our obligation as public servants to devote ourselves to the work.” On Twitter, the waterworks employee’s punishment drew puzzlement and criticism. “Leaving the desk for three minutes to order bento is not O.K., while leaving for 15 minutes smoking is allowed? That’s strange. Kobe City should explain it,” one person wrote. “Honestly, who cares? This is an unprecedented apology news conference,” another social media user said, adding, “Is it much of a loss for the city that four managers hold a news conference like this?” Another person said: “What about all the politicians who sleep in Parliament? They ought to be fired, then.” An earlier version of this article misstated the gender of a Dentsu worker who jumped from the roof of an employee dormitory in 2015. Matsuri Takahashi was a woman, not a man.",The New York Times
2018,He Literally Wrote the Book on Fabulousness,"BERLIN — At a vogue ball one recent Saturday night, the writer Madison A. Moore whipped out a red bamboo fan, stood up from his judge’s chair in his purple-teal sequined boots, and began feverishly fanning a contestant who was folding himself into a leg split on the floor of a Berlin theater. The pulsating house music cut out with a scratchy vinyl zip. Multicolored spotlights tracking the dancer stopped. Hundreds watching from bleachers burst into applause after the voguer’s lavish mix of hand gestures, runway walks and pirouette dips morphed into taut muscles frozen in space. Fanning a contestant at a vogue ball signals the utmost admiration. The dancer whom Dr. Moore fanned was a lithe, fresh-faced black French teenager from Paris. But Dr. Moore, a postdoctoral research associate at King’s College London, who recently wrote the book “Fabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric,” could easily have bestowed similar praise on any of the night’s other participants: straight white and Asian ladies who vogue for sport, gay black male dancers from Brussels for whom fellow voguers have become an ersatz family, and even a middle-aged German woman with a government job. “The catwalk is nearly always about self-assertion,” Dr. Moore said. “It’s a bit like therapy. People who are marginalized or not cisgender are doing it because it’s urgent.” What all of the voguers at the Opulence Ball had in common was that they were fabulous — or were aiming to be. That is the subject of Dr. Moore’s new book, which describes how marginalized people can “regain their humanity” by leaning into creative strangeness and rejecting boredom — in other words, by becoming fabulous. “Fabulousness doesn’t take a lot of money,” Dr. Moore said. “It requires high levels of creativity, imagination and originality; it’s dangerous, political, risky, and largely practiced by queer, trans, transfeminine people of color or other marginalized groups; it’s about making a spectacle of oneself in a world that seeks to suppress and undervalue fabulous people.” According to Dr. Moore, fabulousness begins with a turning point, a shedding of a past way of living in favor of existing for oneself in another dimension. It’s also utopian, Dr. Moore says, because instead of waiting for things to get better, “fabulous people imagine an alternative universe right now.” Though Dr. Moore began the book as a doctoral student at Yale, he says the work was really “35 years in the making,” tracing back to his childhood in Ferguson, Mo., where he studied to become a classical violinist. He based his theory of fabulousness on the Norwegian-American sociologist Thorstein Veblen’s late-19th-century treatise “The Theory of the Leisure Class,” which satirized conspicuous displays of wealth during America’s Gilded Age. “Think back to Diahann Carroll on ‘Dynasty,’ ” Dr. Moore said. “She’s performing Veblen’s theory of conspicuousness, turning it on its head. She demands a separate hotel room for her clothes. Yet she’s also that rare black woman in traditionally white spaces. Whether it’s her as Dominique Deveraux or trans kids today who can’t use a bathroom, there’s more at stake than just conspicuous consumption. Fabulousness is an embrace of yourself through style when the world around you is saying you don’t deserve to be here.” Indeed, the crux of Dr. Moore’s theory is that while neither easy nor safe, fabulousness is sometimes the only option in the face of ridicule, harassment or neglect by the majority. “I wasn’t the first queer person at Yale to wear heels — there was another guy who would always turn up to class in a sensible pump,” Dr. Moore said. “But as a black, queer person, when I show up in a look, I’m seizing space.” What’s powerful about fabulousness is that it exists in an ambivalent relationship with the dominant culture around it, neither embracing it nor challenging it. As Moore puts it, you don’t need a camera to notice you, if you can be your own flash. “Fabulousness is a mirror held up to society,” said Tavia Nyong’o, professor of American studies at Yale and the author of “Afro-Fabulations: The Queer Drama of Black Life.” “It’s reflecting back a different way of being. That’s what’s angular about it: It tackles class and racial inequalities in a way that’s unexpected and innovative.” Dr. Moore, who is already at work on a second book, about the sociology of clubbing, says gentrification in cities like London, New York and Barcelona is threatening clubs and other arts spaces that act as crucibles of fabulousness. “The difference between clubs in Europe and U.S. is that in Europe, club culture is seen as an engine of creativity,” Dr. Moore said. “My love for techno — my ability to get lost in that perpetual motion — is due to my love of classical music. It all ties together and merits support. Could you imagine a club in New York getting the same tax breaks as the New York Philharmonic or Lincoln Center? Yet that’s what happens in Europe.” He also points out something that had been a subtext of the Berlin ball weekend — that in an age of President Trump, populist firebrands like France’s Marine Le Pen, and a global lurch to the right, clubs, ballrooms and other spaces frequented by marginalized people and their allies need to coordinate and fight for their right to exist. “Clubs are engines of politics,” Dr. Moore said. “A day after the ball, nearly all of the clubs in Berlin got together and staged one of the country’s largest protests against the AfD,” a far-right political party whose full name translates as Alternative for Germany, and which now sits in the Bundestag, the country’s federal legislature. The party’s leader has been rebuked for playing down Germany’s Nazi past. Dr. Moore acknowledges that while being fabulous is a way to navigate the world when you don’t have privilege, it does not always pay the rent. “It’s not easy to be an academic or to speak your mind when you’re gender nonconforming,” Dr. Moore said. “But I’ve always told students to just do you — it’s what I’ve done this whole time.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article mischaracterized Madison Moore’s role in the running of the Opulence Ball.

2018,"He Sold Drugs for $225. Indiana Took His $42,000 Land Rover.","Sidebar WASHINGTON — Tyson Timbs would like his Land Rover back. The State of Indiana took it, using a law that lets it seize vehicles used to transport illegal drugs. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the Constitution has anything to say about such civil forfeiture laws, which allow states and localities to take and keep private property used to commit crimes. Mr. Timbs bought the Land Rover after his father died. The life insurance money amounted to around $73,000, and he spent $42,000 of it on the vehicle. He blew most of the rest on drugs. “Unfortunately, I had a whole bunch of money, which isn’t a good idea for a drug addict to have,” Mr. Timbs recalled the other day. “I used a lot, and eventually the money ran out. It was an addict’s life.” Mr. Timbs’s habit started with an opioid addiction and progressed to heroin. He used his Land Rover to get drugs and, on at least two occasions, to sell them. The buyers were undercover police officers. Mr. Timbs pleaded guilty to one of the drug sales, in which $225 had changed hands, and he was sentenced to a year of house arrest followed by five years of probation. He also agreed to pay an array of fees and fines adding up to about $1,200. But Indiana wanted more. Using the civil forfeiture law, it took the Land Rover. Mr. Timbs, 37, has put his life back together, but it has not been easy. “I have to go to meetings, to counseling, to probation appointments,” he said, making clear that he was not complaining. “They want you to get a job,” he said. “It’s hard to do without a vehicle. Plus, I was a felon, which makes it even harder to find a job.” He found work as a machinist in a factory some 40 minutes from his home in Marion, Ind., where he lives with his aunt. He borrows her car to get to work, and he feels guilty about that. “She has to take a bus back and forth to her kidney dialysis appointments,” he said. As Justice Clarence Thomas explained last year in an opinion urging the Supreme Court to examine civil forfeiture laws, government seizures of property used to commit crimes have become worrisomely popular. “Forfeiture has in recent decades become widespread and highly profitable,” Justice Thomas wrote. “And because the law enforcement entity responsible for seizing the property often keeps it, these entities have strong incentives to pursue forfeiture.” “This system — where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use — has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses,” he wrote, citing excellent reporting from The Washington Post and The New Yorker. The burdens of civil forfeiture fall disproportionately on the poor, said Wesley P. Hottot, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, which represents Mr. Timbs. “Tyson’s case illustrates how civil forfeiture makes it harder for people who have made mistakes to correct those mistakes and re-enter society,” Mr. Hottot said. “It shouldn’t take the United States Supreme Court to make clear that you don’t take everything from a person who’s facing the kinds of challenges Tyson is.” Mr. Timbs won the early rounds in Indiana’s lawsuit seeking to take his vehicle, based on the Eighth Amendment, which says that “excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” Judge Jeffrey D. Todd, of the Grant County Superior Court, said the amendment’s second clause — the one barring “excessive fines” — protected Mr. Timbs. The Land Rover, the judge wrote, was worth about four times the maximum fine Mr. Timbs could have been ordered to pay, which was $10,000. It was also worth more than 30 times the fines that were actually imposed. “The amount of the forfeiture sought is excessive and is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant’s offense,” Judge Todd wrote. An appeals court agreed. In dissent, Judge Michael P. Barnes wrote that civil forfeiture laws can be abused but that Mr. Timbs should lose the vehicle. “I am keenly aware of the overreach some law enforcement agencies have exercised in some of these cases,” Judge Barnes wrote. “Entire family farms are sometimes forfeited based on one family member’s conduct, or exorbitant amounts of money are seized. However, it seems to me that one who deals heroin, and there is no doubt from the record we are talking about a dealer, must and should suffer the legal consequences to which he exposes himself.” The Indiana Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Timbs, on interesting grounds. It said the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of excessive fines did not apply to ones imposed by states. This is, surprisingly, an open question. The Bill of Rights originally restricted the power of only the federal government, but the Supreme Court has ruled that most of its protections apply to the states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, one of the post-Civil War amendments. But there are a few exceptions, and the Supreme Court has been inconsistent about where it stands on the excessive fines clause. Mr. Timbs’s case is poised to resolve the question. It will be argued in the fall. In the meantime, Mr. Timbs sometimes lapses into frustration and bitterness. “I don’t deserve this,” he said. “Nobody does. It’s an unnecessary stressor. I struggle with more than addiction. I struggle with anxiety and depression. I don’t feel like much of a man, because I don’t have a vehicle.”",The New York Times
2018,He Wants to Be a Ballerina. He Has Taken the First Steps.,"The ladies of the court, wearing long dresses and hats with trailing veils, moved in a stately minuet across the stage of the Coliseum Theater in London on Wednesday night, in the English National Ballet’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty.” They tapped their canes on the floor as the Prince looked on, circling elegantly with uniform poise and charm. Nothing looked particularly unusual. But it was. One of those court ladies was a man: Chase Johnsey. For the first time in modern ballet history, a male dancer is performing as part of the female ensemble at an international ballet company, signaling an important moment in an art form that often celebrates a particular ideal of femininity. Or, as the great choreographer George Balanchine said, “ballet is woman.” But in a world with a heightened awareness of gender fluidity, and with transgender people increasingly accepted in a variety of professions, including acting and modeling, ballet is taking its own brave leap. “I want to be seen as a ballerina,” said Mr. Johnsey, an American, who identifies as gender fluid but uses male pronouns. “My hair is up, I wear makeup, female attire. I am able to do female roles and look the part, so that is artistically what I do.” Tamara Rojo, the director of English National Ballet who offered Mr. Johnsey a short-term contract in March, said she was “very sensitive about this being seen as a publicity stunt.” Instead, she said: “This is about reflecting the world we live in. There are different races, cultures and beliefs in our company — this is another aspect of that view.” But stringent physical norms still matter in ballet. It’s not like the theater, which has embraced gender-switching with all-female accounts of Shakespeare, say, or Glenda Jackson playing King Lear. These may require some suspension of disbelief from the audience, but not a fundamental change in appearance or skill from the performer. In ballet, though, the body is all. Female ballet dancers must conform, certainly in major companies, to specific aesthetic norms, which include thinness and ideas about harmonious proportions. (In modern and contemporary dance a far greater range of body types is accepted.) And for the grand 19th-century classical ballets like “Swan Lake” and “The Sleeping Beauty” — the backbone of the traditional repertory — the dancers in the female ensemble, known as the corps de ballet, must not differ too much from one another physically, since they embody collective groups of swans, sylphs or wilis (the spirits of jilted girls). Mr. Johnsey, 32, is dancing in the corps, and a corps dancer must blend into the group, not stand out from it. There are also important technical differences between men and women in ballet. Men have bigger, more athletic jumps and turns, and they lift and carry the women. The female dancers perform on point — dancing on their toes in stiffened ballet shoes — a skill they begin to learn as teenagers, and which requires a different strength and training than men’s. Mr. Johnsey, who has had facial surgery to feminize his features, already had some of these skills before joining English National Ballet. In an interview a few days before the opening of “Sleeping Beauty,” he said he began to dance on point, secretly, as a teenager, after beginning ballet at 14. Three years later he joined Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, an all-male comedic troupe in New York whose dancers play both male and female roles. The Trocks, as they are known, perform technically demanding ballerina roles on point, and Mr. Johnsey was acclaimed for his brilliance and delicacy in these roles. Last year he won the best male dancer award at Britain’s National Dance Awards — mainly for his appearances with the Trocks. (Mr. Johnsey left the Trocks at the start of the year, alleging that he and other dancers were mistreated and harassed for appearing too feminine in classes and rehearsals. The company appointed an independent investigator, who did not substantiate these claims.) But when Mr. Johnsey joined English National Ballet, he discovered that performing in drag with comic intent is very different from performing as part of a seamless female ensemble. “With the Trocks, if you messed up, you could make a joke about it,” he said. And despite his strong point-work technique, he said he had “completely the wrong idea about what makes a ballerina beautiful and graceful. It is actually strength, hidden within softness and grace, and I have had to figure out in my genetically male composition, how to find that.” Mr. Johnsey is not appearing on point in “Sleeping Beauty,” but in what are known as character, or soft-shoe, dances, with costumes less revealing than those for point-work roles. His path even to these appearances has been arduous. Since beginning work at English National Ballet, he has lost 20 pounds, with the help of a nutritionist, and worked with both a physical trainer and a company ballet mistress, Loipa Araújo, to retrain and reshape his body. “I am a small, petite guy, but I am a man,” Mr. Johnsey, who is 5 feet 5, said. “My shoulders are wider, my calves are bigger, the textures of my muscles are different.” He added, “I had to cannibalize my body, make it run on energy from muscles and figure out how to lose muscle mass without losing strength.” The company dancers, Mr. Johnsey said, had been welcoming. “I have never felt like a freak here,” he said. “But I’m aware that not everyone will support me, and that there will probably be a backlash.” Isabelle Brouwers, a corps de ballet dancer who performs with Mr. Johnsey in the Mazurka in Act 3, said there had been no prejudice or hostility when he joined the company. “I think it’s a great and positive step in bringing ballet into the 21st century,” she said. (Ms. Rojo could use some positive buzz; in January The London Times, citing unattributed sources, reported that English National Ballet had lost a third of its dancers in two years amid claims of verbal abuse, a hostile working environment and a conflict of interest in Ms. Rojo’s romantic relationship with Isaac Hernandez, a principal dancer.) But while Mr. Johnsey’s appearance with a ballet company can be seen as a boost for gender equality, it could also be viewed as a man infiltrating an already competitive female domain. Wendy Whelan, the former New York City Ballet principal, said she had conflicting feelings. “I don’t care what the body parts are, as long as artistically the dancer makes the choreography shine,” Ms. Whelan said. “If he is the best girl for the job, then great.” But, she added, this could be “another hurdle” for women in a field that is more difficult for them to succeed in than men. “Living the life of a woman in ballet means not having access to the privileges that come with the patriarchy,” she added. And Isabella Boylston, a principal with American Ballet Theater, said that she didn’t see an issue “if they are open to it going both ways” and have women in male roles too. Jennifer Homans, who wrote “Apollo’s Angels,” a widely praised history of ballet, pointed out that female roles were performed by men at the earliest moments of ballet’s history at the court of Louis XIV. Although ballet is a very gender-specific and rigid art form in some ways, she said, “in other ways that’s not true. It has long been a platform for men to feel and express femininity.” What matters, she said, was “not whether men dance as women and women as men, but whether the effect is artistically interesting.” Will Mr. Johnsey’s small step — an unobtrusive appearance with the female corps — in one of the most conventional of all ballets and companies — be a breakthrough for gender fluidity in ballet? There are already signs of an opening up. In the last few years, there have been far more instances of choreographers creating same-sex duets, and being more unconventional in casting choices; recently the choreographer Justin Peck, at the New York City Ballet, put a woman in a role originally conceived for a man. “I think ballet can be the perfect environment for gender fluidity,” Ms. Rojo said. “We are in a position where we could open up roles for lots of people. Obviously certain roles require physical strength for lifting, and are less obvious for crossover. But the potential is there.” Could Mr. Johnsey be a swan, a princess or a wili? “I don’t see why not,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,He Was Denied a Commission in 1942. Now The Army Is Making Amends.,"In this week’s Race/Related newsletter: The stories of a black soldier who served in World War II and the Japanese-Americans who were forced into internment camps. PHILADELPHIA — Marion Lane discovered the faded photograph after her stepmother died, crammed in a closet with her stepmother’s Sunday dresses. She unrolled it and there was her father, young, handsome and grinning amid a phalanx of soldiers. She was stunned: “It looked like a graduating class of Army men.” Her father was a longtime mail carrier who loved his family, fishing and his beloved, gleaming Cadillacs. He never spoke about his service in World War II. On the day she found the photo, he finally told her why. Her father, John E. James Jr., graduated from the Army’s Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Ga. in 1942, but was never allowed to serve as a commissioned officer. Instead, he was shipped overseas as a corporal with an all-black battalion at a time when racial discrimination in the military derailed the dreams and careers of a generation of African-American soldiers. On Friday, the Army finally made amends, promoting Mr. James to the rank of second lieutenant, two weeks after his 98th birthday. The ceremony at the Museum of the American Revolution was attended by a deputy assistant secretary from the Army, a retired four-star general and Senator Bob Casey Jr., the Pennsylvania Democrat who championed the case. “It’s unbelievable,” said Mr. James, who descends from a long line of military men dating back to the Revolutionary War. “I thought it would never happen.” It almost didn’t. Although she discovered the photo in 2001, Ms. Lane, a retired public school administrator only learned in 2015 that her father could request a correction to his military record from the Army Review Boards Agency. She enlisted the aid of Senator Casey and his staff. The campaign took nearly three years. They sent more than a dozen emails and letters, made two appeals and encountered so many dead ends and disappointments that Ms. Lane half-jokingly wondered whether the Army was hoping her father would “kick the bucket” so that no one would have to acknowledge wrongdoing. “I was ready to throw in the towel,” Mr. James admitted. But after decades of silence, Mr. James was ready to tell his story. As a young man, he had never met any black officers and he had never seen any either. But after he was drafted in 1941, he heard that the Army wanted to recruit black officers. He applied and was accepted in 1942 to a class at Fort Benning that included 21 men of color. He slept in segregated barracks, but for the first time in his life he also ate, trained and studied alongside his white counterparts. He still remembers joining the jubilant black and white officers-to-be in their march, after they had completed their training in December of that year. They all expected to be promoted the next morning. The African-American graduates would join the military’s tiny, black elite: Fewer than one percent of black soldiers in the Army were officers in 1942, according to a book published by the Army’s Center of Military History in 2001. But later that day, Mr. James said, a white officer pulled him aside. Instead of receiving his commission, he was going to be shipped to another post. “I wasn’t going to be getting my bars,” Mr. James said. Ms. Lane suspects that her father was denied his commission because he would outrank some white officers in the battalion he would be assigned to, and black officers were not supposed to supervise whites. Meanwhile, military records show that options for newly graduated black officers were becoming increasingly scarce. By the end of 1942, the number of black officers had begun to exceed the number of available assignments, according to a book published by the Army’s Center of Military History in 1963. Some commanders said they could not house African-Americans who were barred from sharing barracks or mess halls with white officers. Others were more explicit. The Mississippi congressional delegation requested that “no Negro officers be stationed in Mississippi at all,” the study shows. Mr. James didn’t know why he was denied his promotion, but he said he knew better than to complain. [Read more] LOS ANGELES — The actor George Takei, who was 5 years old when he was sent with his family to a camp in Arkansas, was rehearsing for a role when his husband interrupted him with some news this week from the Supreme Court. It could have been a ruling to celebrate: the court had finally overturned the 1944 decision that the United States government could force more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent into internment camps. But for Mr. Takei and many of those who spent months or years in the camps, the ruling on Tuesday felt more like a hollow victory. As pleased as they were that the court at last recognized what history has long regarded as a grave mistake, they lamented that it came as part of the decision that upheld President Trump’s ban on travel into the United States by citizens of several predominantly Muslim countries. There are too many striking parallels, they said, between their treatment and the logic to justify keeping people out of the country. Mr. Takei read the opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote that “the forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of presidential authority.” Chief Justice Roberts pushed back against what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called “stark parallels” between the 1944 decision and the majority opinion this week. He added, “Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution.’” But Mr. Takei did not revel in the words. Instead, he called the ruling “deeply ironic.” “We were classified as enemy aliens,” Mr. Takei said. “There was no evidence in our case. And there is no evidence of terrorism here now,” he said. “What the court ruled was just as crazy and irrational as incarcerating us.” “It’s an insult to people who spent their lives fighting,” he added. “My parents are gone, but I find it hard to imagine they would be celebrating either.” There are increasingly few people who can talk about their memories of the camps, which began in 1942 and officially existed for more than four years. Mr. Takei and his contemporaries were young children at the time that President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the executive order after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Most of the people who were in the internment camps during the Second World War have died, including Fred Korematsu, the Oakland native who defied incarceration orders and was convicted of disobeying a military order. Mr. Korematsu appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the internment with a 6-3 ruling, saying the policy was justified to protect national security during a wartime emergency.

2018,He Was Quitting Golf. Then He Qualified for the U.S. Open.,"SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. — Less than a month ago, Chris Naegel called his wife, Lindsey, with a lump in his throat. He was done, he told her. He was ready to quit professional golf. The admission did not exactly stun her. Naegel was 35, a journeyman bobbing in the backwaters of the sport, from the Hooters Tour to the eGolf Tour to the Adams Tour to the Minor League Tour. He had just badly missed the cut at a Web.com event. “I was kind of, I don’t know,” Naegel said. “Over it.” He recalled that moment as he was looking for his ball Monday evening somewhere on the fifth hole here at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, where he was practicing with his caddie for the United States Open, which starts on Thursday. It was late, the shadows were growing long and the barn swallows were sweeping across the fescue. Only a few golfers remained on the course. One of them was Tiger Woods. Naegel caught sight of a large crowd of fans streaming down an adjacent fairway. “Yeah, that’s got to be him,” he said, knowing the kind of commotion that follows Woods. They passed like ships in the night — if one was an ocean liner and the other a dinghy. But this week, they will share the same coveted waters. The charm of the U.S. Open is its meritocratic qualification system, which allows peripheral players to dream of joining the elites. Anyone with a handicap below 1.4 can place an entry with the United States Golf Association to compete in sectional tournaments that determine about half the Open field. This week, there are college amateurs, club professionals and a National Hockey League referee teeing it up alongside the likes of Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson and Woods. Perhaps the longest of the long shots among the 78 qualifiers is Naegel, the long-thwarted pro from Wildwood, Mo., near St. Louis. He is ranked 1,098th in the world. He arrived at Shinnecock buoyed by a magical three-week stretch that followed his dour conversation with his wife. The couple agreed that he would be done with the game after he went to Texas to compete in a one-day, 36-hole sectional qualifier for the Open. They had no reason to expect him to reach Shinnecock, but he had already booked the trip. Knowing that he would walk away soon, Naegel felt liberated. He started playing like an athlete with nothing to lose. A couple of days after the decision, he competed in a Monday qualifier for the Nashville Open and carried his own bag, forgoing the use of a caddie. He shot a 64. He finished seventh in the tournament to earn Web.com tour status for the rest of the year. At the qualifying sectional on June 4 at Shadow Hawk Golf Club in Richmond, Tex., Naegel needed four birdies over five holes to force a playoff. Down by two strokes on the par-5 18th, he made a 40-foot eagle putt, then birdied the first hole of the playoff for his ticket to the Open. A week later, he and his caddie, Michael Wellington, pulled into Shinnecock shortly before 5 p.m. and quickly sped out to play nine before the sun sank into Peconic Bay. Wellington, 40, who cannot always travel with Naegel, had to use a friend’s frequent-flier miles to get to the sectional near Houston. “I told him even before we played, ‘I’m going with you to Shinnecock,’ ” Wellington said. “He goes, ‘I know.’ ” The two met and started playing together in 2002, not long after Naegel picked up the sport. He had never played a round of golf until spring break of his freshman year in high school. “I probably 10-fingered it and gave it a baseball swing,” Naegel said. But he fell headlong into the game. He tried to walk onto the team at the University of Mississippi but could not get playing time. So he went to Missouri Baptist, an N.A.I.A. school, and led the Spartans to the 2006 American Midwest Conference championship. “I just stayed with one of my teammates in Chicago,” Naegel said. “He sells insurance.” For Naegel, golf has been an undulating flow of minor progression and devastating setback, as it is for many golfers on the margins of the professional tour. In 2017, he missed full status on the Web.com tour for the season by one stroke at qualifying school. Here are a few obstacles that will test the nerves and skill of golfers at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills on Long Island. Forced to play his way into events with Monday qualifying rounds, Naegel shot 64 in one but lost in a playoff. He shot 67 in another but missed by a stroke. “It’s one thing to play poorly at these qualifiers and not even have a chance,” Wellington said. “He was playing well.” After earning a spot in the Web’s BMW event in Greenville, S.C., last month, Naegel missed the cut, beating only a handful of golfers. It was, he said, the worst he had felt as a professional. He called his wife and said he would rather be home with their two boys. She could tell he was serious. “He’s like, ‘If I’m going to be grinding this, I’ve got to see something better,’ ” Lindsey Naegel said. “That’s probably the most frustrated I’ve seen him in a long time.” She told her husband she supported his choice, either way. But she also encouraged him to reconsider making any rash decisions before they had a chance to talk things through. “I didn’t think he was done, really,” Lindsey Naegel said. “I said, ‘Get through the next two weeks and come home, and we’ll talk about it.’ In the next two weeks, our lives changed significantly.” Wellington said he could see how Naegel’s decision allowed him to relax and have fun again. Wellington related it to his own experience after he learned he was bipolar. He stepped away from the game to focus on his new charitable foundation, Birdies 4 Bipolar. On Naegel’s bag at the Open, Wellington said, his job will be easy. Naegel keeps his own yardage and typically reads his own putts. Wellington’s primary task will be to roll out quotations from the book they are both reading, “Relentless,” by Tim S. Grover, and from their favorite movie, “Caddyshack.” “I’m just out here working on my comedy act,” Wellington said. “What I know about the mental game,” he added, “is that if you’re laughing, you’re in the present. Golf is about being in the present.” Naegel admitted that might be a struggle this week. The goal of competing in the U.S. Open had helped sustain him through the years of frustration. But regardless of how he plays at Shinnecock, he knows he cannot give up the game yet. There are still too many possibilities. “Plus,” Naegel said, “I don’t know what else I’d do.” Just before darkness fell on Monday, he and Wellington made their way down Shinnecock’s ninth fairway only to stare up at the face of a drastic elevation change leading to the green. “Holy smokes,” Naegel said. “Is that the green up there?” Wellington asked. “I didn’t know there’s mountains on islands,” Naegel said. He managed to deposit his shot within birdie range. “I believe in his game,” Wellington said. “People are just getting ready to understand how good his game is. All the guys in St. Louis, we know about his game. It’s no secret to us. We just wondered when it was going to be put on full display.” As word got out about Naegel’s improbable run, Wellington became an overnight celebrity in his own right. Fans on social media have bestowed a nickname on him, right out of a golf movie that seems aligned with Naegel’s journeyman narrative. They have been calling him Romeo, the name of the caddie in “Tin Cup.”",The New York Times
2018,Head of Brazil’s State Oil Company Resigns Amid Period of Unrest,"RIO DE JANEIRO — The top executive of Petrobras, Brazil’s state oil company, resigned on Friday, fueling uncertainty about the future of the country’s energy sector, a pillar of Brazil’s economy that has drawn enormous interest from foreign investors in recent years. The executive, Pedro Parente, the company’s chief executive, had been credited with steadying Petrobras, which was devastated by a corruption scandal in 2014, and restoring foreign investors’ confidence as Brazil emerged from a crippling recession. But Mr. Parente faced a barrage of political pressure and criticism in recent days as a loosely organized truckers’ strike paralyzed the country for more than a week, leading the government of President Michel Temer to subsidize the cost of diesel at the pump. Critics said the government’s move represented a return to the type of heavy-handed state meddling in oil prices that Mr. Parente had advised against when he took the helm of the company two years ago. Petrobras’s fuel price policies have enormous impact in Brazil, a country of about 208 million people, because the company has a near monopoly on the refinery system. As the price of oil rose in recent months, and Brazil’s currency dropped in value against the dollar, consumers began paying considerably more at the pump. Lawmakers across the political spectrum have been critical of Mr. Parente’s market-tethered fuel price policies ahead of October’s national elections. The Senate president, Eunício Oliveira, seemed to celebrate Mr. Parente’s departure. “The president of a monopolist company such as Petrobras should have corporate vision, social sensitivity and political responsibility,” Mr. Oliveira wrote on Twitter. The company named Ivan Monteiro, its current finance director, as its interim chief executive on Friday night. Five days before the strike began, Petrobras hit an eight-year record market valuation of 388.8 billion Brazilian reais, or $103.7 billion. But since the beginning of the strike, it has lost over a third of its value. The company controls 90 percent of the oil and gas sector in Brazil, which in the past decade has represented roughly 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Mr. Parente’s departure caused the company’s stock price to plunge and is certain to chill investor interest in Brazil’s oil sector, compounding broader uncertainty about the country’s political future ahead of the presidential election, which is shaping up to be the most splintered and unpredictable in generations. In his resignation letter, Mr. Parente said he had concluded, in the aftermath of the strike, that he could no longer “contribute to the development of the options the government has before it.” Roberto Castello Branco, an economist at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, who served on the board of Petrobras from 2015 to 2016, said Mr. Parente took the helm of the company after demanding to have greater autonomy over keeping oil prices largely insulated from market fluctuations. “Clearly that freedom ended,” he said. “I think the signals the government has sent through these decisions are negative. They have created a new cloud of uncertainty about the future of Brazil’s oil industry.” The truckers’ strike and Mr. Parente’s resignation underscored the political weakness of Mr. Temer, who over the past few days has made progressively larger concessions as the strike over oil prices transformed into a broader outcry over corruption and a lack of faith in the political elite. Mr. Parente’s resignation came two days after Senator Vanessa Grazziotin proposed an inquiry into the company’s fuel price policies. Ms. Grazziotin said international oil companies stood to benefit from the subsidies Mr. Temer authorized in recent days, which will divert funds that had been earmarked for health and education programs. “We’re living a moment of what I would almost call social convulsion,” Ms. Grazziotin said in an interview. “The government says the only way of reducing the price of fuel is by making the population pick up the tab.” An earlier version of this article misstated a measure the Brazilian government took in response to a truckers’ strike. The government agreed to subsidize only the cost of diesel, not the cost of diesel and gasoline.",The New York Times
2018,Head of U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees Warns of Cuts,"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations agency that helps the 5.4 million Palestinians classified as refugees could start running out of money next month because of a $250 million shortfall, largely because of American aid cuts, its top official said Monday. The official, Pierre Krähenbühl, commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said the financial crisis was the worst the agency had faced since its creation in 1949, after the founding of the state of Israel. The most immediate threat, he said, is funding for emergency food aid to indigent Palestinians in Gaza and Syria. A delay in the late-summer opening of schools run by the agency, which serve more than a half-million Palestinian students, also is possible, he said. Mr. Krähenbühl spoke in an interview at his agency’s offices in New York ahead of an emergency fund-raising conference at the United Nations. Most of the roughly $1.2 billion in annual spending by the agency, known by its acronym, Unrwa, comes from voluntary contributions by the 193 member states of the United Nations. “While we have survived in a sense for the first half of the year with $250 million still missing,” Mr. Krähenbühl said, “we are going to run out of money for food distribution in Gaza, for psychosocial support in the Gaza Strip and also cash for work programs in the West Bank and others in a matter of weeks.” By the beginning of July, he said, “I am going to have to make some very significant decisions depending on how much money we will receive by then in additional funding, and we don’t have enough money currently committed to be sure that we can open the school year toward the end of August or September.” The United States historically has been one of the biggest donors to Unrwa, widely regarded as a lifeline to many Palestinians classified as refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. But this year the Trump administration has significantly reduced its contribution, to about $60 million from more than $360 million in 2017, a drop of more than 80 percent. Trump administration officials said any restoration of aid was partly dependent on structural changes at the agency to make it more efficient and accountable. They also said other countries should pick up more of the financial burden. Critics of the aid reduction accused the administration of retaliation for Palestinian anger over its decisions that favor Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian dispute, notably the recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Trump administration officials have rejected accusations that the aid cut was tied to politics. Mr. Krähenbühl said agency officials had maintained open channels of communication with the Trump administration in hopes of changing its decision, with contacts that included Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser on the Middle East, who is currently on a visit to the region. “I have not received any indication that the decision would change this year,” Mr. Krähenbühl said. Israel, which welcomed the American decision cut Unrwa aid, has long criticized the agency, accusing it of anti-Israel bias and of perpetuating Palestinian dependence, claims that agency officials have rebutted. But Israeli officials also have acknowledged Unrwa’s importance as a force for stability, since it provides education, health care and food assistance to Palestinians. Mr. Krähenbühl said other countries had stepped up since the Americans announced the aid reduction in January, most notably Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which each contributed $50 million in emergency funds. “What I do expect is that member states will signal their readiness to either provide additional money now or at a later stage during the year,” he said. “We’ll see how that will play out.” American officials have not said precisely what they would want to see in any Unrwa restructuring, but they have criticized what they called a chronic need by the agency for more money. “I think what they need to do is determine a way to better manage its budgeting and its finances,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said last week. “And that’s something — a concern that not just the United States has expressed, but other countries have expressed that concern as well.” She said, “There needs to be a more sustainable way to have its funding not only come through but for them to manage their money.” An earlier version of this article misstated the United States contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in 2018 and 2017. The United States has contributed about $60 million this year, not $125 million, compared with more than $360 million last year, not $300 million.",The New York Times
2018,Heading the Soccer Ball May Be Bad for Young Brains,"Well The question of whether young children should use their heads on the soccer field has been a contentious one in recent years. In 2015, U.S. Youth Soccer, the organization that oversees most of the country’s leagues for children and teenagers, announced a ban on heading in games and practices by participants younger than 11, citing concerns that the play might contribute to concussions. In response, some soccer authorities pointed out that young players would be late to learn an essential soccer skill and that concussions from heading are rare in that age group regardless. Now a study presented last month at the annual convention of the American College of Sports Medicine may help quell doubts about the current regulations, which went into effect in 2016. According to studies of experienced adult soccer players, heading can generate impact forces almost equivalent to those of a helmet-to-helmet football tackle. But less attention has been directed at heading by young players and the attendant cognitive effects, if any. Last year, however, researchers in Puerto Rico gained permission to work with 30 boys and girls there, ages 9 to 11, who played in a local youth league. (Children this age are allowed to head in Puerto Rico.) The youngsters took a series of cognitive tests and were then outfitted with a specialized headband that recorded head movements and related impacts while they played. Most of the children wound up heading the ball at least once over the course of three games. Data from the headbands indicates their brains were subjected to acceleration forces ranging from 16 to 60 Gs. In adult players, 60 Gs during heading would be considered forceful enough to cause a concussion, although none of the children in the study received a concussion diagnosis. Most of the impacts were what researchers call “subconcussive,” or below the 60 G threshold. Within 10 minutes after each game, the researchers had the children repeat the earlier cognitive tests. Those who headed the ball at least once tended to have lower scores, though in subtly different ways, depending on their sex. The boys showed small drops in what is known as “rapid processing,” or the ability to quickly interpret new information when they hear it, while the girls were a bit worse with “sequential memory,” which involves reading comprehension. The changes in test scores were slight, says Yarimar Díaz-Rodríguez, a neuroscience graduate student at Maimonides University in Buenos Aires, who led the study. And because the experiment was so short, it is impossible to know whether any declines would be lingering or cumulative if the children continued to head the ball. But it is “a bit concerning,” Díaz-Rodríguez says, that some of the children’s scores dropped after a single instance of heading. The results also raise a few doubts about the current age guidelines for heading, she says. Some children in the study were 11 years old, an age at which even players covered by U.S. soccer regulations can begin heading during practices. “I think we do not know if children that young should be heading,” Díaz-Rodríguez says.",The New York Times
2018,Heart-Hammering Science Fiction and Fantasy Thrillers,"Otherworldly Science fiction and fantasy thrillers are often seen as frivolous, action-packed page turners, as critically dismissed as they are compulsively consumed. But a fast pace is more than a generic quality; speed today deserves attention as a subject in its own right, whether in the propagation of misinformation through social networks, the opaque and instantaneous transfers of capital into cryptocurrencies and tax havens or the cataclysmic changes in our climate. The acceleration at the hearts of these vast structures and systems is outpacing our ability to discuss and constrain their effects on us — so here are some books that work hard to catch up. Claire North’s 84K (Orbit, paper, $15.99) is a vicious, engrossing portrait of unregulated capitalism carried to its logical conclusion. In a near-future Britain, human rights have been abolished; people are only as important as their worth to the Company that runs the government. People convicted of crimes, no matter how heinous, are fined; failure to pay sends them to “the patty line,” where they work in indentured servitude until they’ve settled their debt to society. Functionally, what this means is that the wealthy can do whatever they please while more and more people are forced into work camps, especially as it’s cheaper for the Company to employ those who’ve been convicted of crimes than those who haven’t. Theo Miller is an adjuster employed by the Criminal Audit Office. His job is to determine the value of human lives and the indemnity owed for any given crime. But Theo — a milquetoast, middle-class middleman — isn’t entirely what he seems: His name and history are a lie. When Dani Cumali, a woman from his secret past, turns up threatening to expose him, he grudgingly helps her — until he finds her dead, her assassin casually phoning in the murder in order to pay the indemnity. From that point on, Theo takes up Dani’s struggle to reveal the depth and breadth of the Company’s evil. “84K” is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it’s a terrifying look at capitalism’s slippery slopes and a realistic depiction of how a person’s will can shrivel into apathy and fear. On the other, it’s not an easy reading experience. This may be intentional on North’s part as a sort of structural storytelling: Capitalism is vague and diffuse, so why shouldn’t the narration follow suit? North has used carriage returns as punctuation in other novels, but usually for mechanical reasons, like indicating a body swap; in “84K,” random line breaks combine with almost constant ellipses to lend the novel a distracted air, where no one seems able to carry a thought to its conclusion. This is a deliberate stylistic choice — but it’s also exasperating, even allowing for the fact that Theo is meant to be an exasperating character, an Everyman whose motivations are arbitrary and haphazard. That aside, “84K” is absorbing and timely; a book to wrestle and argue with, but first and foremost, to read. ♦ Nicola Griffith’s SO LUCKY (MCD X FSG Originals, paper, $15) is a compact, brutal story of losing power and creating community, fast-paced as a punch in the face.

But as she navigates the disease’s effect on her life, job and relationships, she grows aware of a shadowy, grinning thing stalking her peripheral vision — and becomes certain that a string of murders and home invasions is targeting the community she’s building. “So Lucky” is beautifully written, with a flexible, efficient precision that embodies the protagonist’s voice and character. Like “84K,” it draws attention to people on society’s margins and the behavior of those who think ignoring misfortune will prevent it from happening to them. But unlike “84K,” where the prevailing tone is helplessness and cautionary horror, “So Lucky” is a shot of angry adrenaline. It’s also welcome and wonderful to see a book that shows queer women dealing with the aftermath of divorce and the tangled difficulties of turning deep friendship into long-distance romance. And Mara is frequently terrible, which I appreciated more than I can easily say. I’m hungry for depictions of women who make bad decisions and wrestle with the consequences, who shed prejudice and learn compassion, who are more than aspirational figureheads. ♦ I loved the protagonist of Rebecca Roanhorse’s TRAIL OF LIGHTNING (Saga, paper, $16.99) for similar reasons. Maggie Hoskie inhabits a world only a few years in our future, where energy wars have culminated in a cataclysmic flooding called the Big Water, and the Navajo reservation has saved itself with supernatural help, sprouting enormous walls of white shell, turquoise, abalone and jet around its borders. Within them, the reservation has become the nation of Dinétah — but while the worst of the apocalypse has been kept out, Dinétah has its own problems. The Big Water has ushered in the Sixth World, and with it, all the spirits and monsters that used to inhabit people’s dreams. Maggie is a monster hunter who emerges from isolation to help find a missing girl — but the creature that stole her is rooted in parts of Maggie’s past she’d rather not confront. Since Maggie needs help investigating this new threat, her adopted grandfather suggests she work with his smooth-talking grandson Kai. Short on friends and long on enemies, Maggie lets him tag along. Maggie is brusque and antisocial, and she carries her own weight in pain and doubt; the interplay between her and sunny Kai is delightful. I loved the world-building, too: After decades of reading genre futures in which black and brown people don’t exist, it’s deeply satisfying to find fiction in which histories of genocide actually equip them to survive disasters. As Maggie observes: “The Diné had already suffered their apocalypse over a century before. This wasn’t our end. This was our rebirth.” But problems of plot and motivation nagged me throughout. In the book’s opening encounter, Maggie takes grotesque action on a flawed premise — but that first action is never revisited or questioned once Maggie learns better. Nor was the plot’s resolution as satisfying as it could have been, though it neatly sets up a sequel. Ultimately, “Trail of Lightning” made me want nothing so much as a television show. Someone please cancel “Supernatural” already and give us at least five seasons of this badass indigenous monster-hunter and her silver-tongued sidekick. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to the next volume. ♦ In a setting that could be a prequel to “Trail of Lightning,” Eliot Peper’s BANDWIDTH (47North, $24.95) is a thoughtful meditation on the ethics of power among those who broker it. Not far in our future, San Diego is a perpetually burning wasteland, the Arctic has melted and Dag Calhoun, a partner at a lobbying firm called Apex Group, helps rich people get richer from catastrophe. But while working on behalf of Commonwealth, a company that provides internet to most of the planet, Dag is recruited by a secret organization called the Island. Their ability to hack into people’s feeds — the augmented reality through which everyone experiences the world — grants them unprecedented powers of surveillance and persuasion. But while Dag’s in the business of breaking the world, the Island’s in the business of saving it — and they want Dag to be their double agent. “Bandwidth” is a book that savors everything: Dag dwells as much in the scents and tastes of coffee and tequila as he does in philosophical problems of means justifying ends and the limits of ethical persuasion. Peper manages a great deal of complexity without sacrificing clarity or pace, and I read it all in a single fascinated sitting. That said, the book gives me pause where its women are concerned. A portion of the plot hinges on the premise that one’s sexual predilections can be deliberately and artificially curated, and while I could see the effort made to embed that premise in the novel’s context, it still left a bad taste in my mouth; similar logic underpins rhetoric about “turning people gay” or “curing” homosexuality. Still, the depth and vulnerability of Dag’s perspective, his loneliness and the value he places on his few real friendships, kept “Bandwidth” feeling real and urgent. In an afterword, Peper observes that “in an age of acceleration, contemplation is power.” It’s a good note on which to end — perhaps with an exhortation to digital readers to seek this column in print, where you can linger and contemplate to your heart’s content.",The New York Times
2018,"Heat Wave Rolls Across U.S., but Relief Is Coming","An extreme, dangerous heat wave that washed over Midwest and Northeast states the past few days is shifting eastward, but relief in the form of a cold front may arrive Tuesday. On Monday, after 18 states and Washington, D.C., were put under heat advisories, the National Weather Service announced dangerous heat conditions would shift eastward. End-of-year public school classes were canceled in many districts across the region. Experts urged people to stay indoors during the day. Heat can be deadly: There were 107 heat-related fatalities in 2017, according to federal data. In cities where advisories were issued, the Weather Service recommended that residents schedule exhausting outdoor activities in early mornings or evenings. Residents should also check on family members and neighbors who are more susceptible to the heat. Among the cities most affected was St. Louis, which typically sees an average of 86 degrees this time of year, but was placed under an excessive heat warning after temperatures as high as 105 degrees were predicted. But as the heat leaves the Midwest, a cold front on Tuesday is expected to offer the Northeastern region some relief, said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist at the Weather Service. By Wednesday, all heat advisories are expected to be canceled. The Chicago Tribune captured scenes of children frolicking through a water spray at a Chicago park on Sunday, after the city recorded a high of 95 degrees. Schools there closed early Monday because of the heat. Average high temperatures for the city are usually about 80 degrees. In Massachusetts, the Lowell Public Schools district announced on Twitter that schools would be closed “due to the forecasted extreme heat conditions.” The Weather Channel reported that many other schools in Northeast cities were closed as temperatures approached 100 degrees. Bob Oravec, a forecaster for the Weather Service, said the above-average temperatures were the result of the annual Bermuda high, a high-pressure area that sits off the East Coast and produces warm, humid conditions. Swaths of Kansas and Ohio could see lower temperatures as the weather pattern moves south over the next 24 hours, Mr. Oravec said. In general, affected cities are seeing temperatures 4 to 8 degrees above average, he said.",The New York Times
2018,Hedge Funds Look to Profit From Personal-Injury Suits,"Hedge funds and private-equity firms are deepening their involvement in big-ticket personal-injury lawsuits against drug companies and medical device manufacturers. Investment firms are lending money to law firms that bring so-called mass torts and providing cash advances to plaintiffs involved in such litigation. The activity is increasing just as prosecutors and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of the industry. Earlier this year, EJF Capital, a $6 billion hedge fund, began raising money for its third investment vehicle that will lend money to lawyers bringing mass-tort cases, according to a February email to prospective investors. The new fund aims to raise $300 million on top of the nearly $450 million the Arlington, Va., hedge fund has already lent to personal injury law firms. EJF was an early mover in the business of financing mass tort litigation. Such loans can carry annual interest rates as high as 18 percent. The field is getting crowded. Wall Street firms and other investors have become go-to financiers for many of these cases, which feature large numbers of plaintiffs who have suffered similar injuries from a consumer product. Adam J. Levitt, an attorney in Chicago who has brought mass-tort cases, said there was an “ever-increasing influx of hedge funds into the litigation-funding space.” One cause, he said, is their eagerness for investments that won’t perform in lock step with stock markets or the overall economy. Hedge funds such as Fortress Investment Group, Pravati Capital and Virage Capital Management have lent money to mass-tort law firms in recent years, according to lawyers and lending executives. Marketing documents for EJF’s new fund said the firm saw an opportunity to take advantage of the “current banking regulatory environment,” which has led some banks to pull back from lending to mass-tort firms. Meanwhile, a slew of newer firms — including hedge funds and those affiliated with hedge funds — that specialize in lending to mass-tort lawyers are cropping up. Deer Finance, a small Manhattan firm with a board member who works for the hedge fund Fir Tree Partners, began focusing on such loans last year. An Arizona investment firm, Stillwell Madison, signed a financing agreement in 2016 with Girardi Keese, the Los Angeles mass-tort firm involved in the case that the movie “Erin Brockovich” made famous. Some hedge funds are considering providing law firms with loans to buy large mass-tort cases from rival firms in order to bulk up their caseloads, according to a person involved in negotiating one such deal. Tom Girardi of Girardi Keese, one of the nation’s most successful mass-tort lawyers, said funding from alternative lenders was necessary to battle companies with unlimited budgets. “If you are going to fight them, you better have the money to properly present these cases,” he said. The litigation-finance business has been around for a long time, but until recently it was mostly focused on the financing of complex, long-term commercial litigation. The emphasis on bankrolling consumer suits is newer and potentially even more profitable for lenders. Analysts estimate that litigation finance is at least a $10 billion industry, and they expect it to keep growing. Daniel Ballen, a portfolio manager with Pimco, the giant bond fund, described the industry as being in its “third inning” at a recent litigation-finance conference. As the industry booms, state and federal authorities are beginning to look into a specialized corner that provides high-interest cash advances to litigants waiting for settlements or jury awards. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn recently opened an investigation into a network of lawyers, finance firms and others that may have lured women into getting unnecessary surgery to remove pelvic mesh implants, according to people familiar with the matter. Removing the implants improved the chances that the women would win large legal settlements from medical device manufacturers. In a report in The New York Times in April, women said that they had been prodded to get the vaginal mesh implants removed and that a cash advance firm had provided them with financing to do so. The people familiar with the nascent investigation, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, said prosecutors had recently asked some lawyers involved in the litigation to hand over transcripts of depositions in which plaintiffs discussed how their mesh-removal surgery was paid for. A spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for Brooklyn, declined to comment. In New York, state lawmakers are trying to crack down on finance firms that offer cash advances to litigants, introducing legislation that would cap the interest rates. Critics say that the fine print of these deals is often incomprehensible and that the loans can leave plaintiffs with only a small fraction of the settlement money they thought they would receive. “We have turned our civil justice system into a profit center, and now the Wall Street sharks are circling,” said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, which represents a number of industries. “They see litigation as a low-risk investment. They see this as a sure thing with so many cases settling.” The firms say they are serving a valuable role and helping litigants in need of short-term cash while their lawsuits spend years making their way through the legal system. Settlement advances help individuals “meet pressing financial needs and have the financial wherewithal to pursue cases against often-powerful interests,” said Jim Terlizzi, chief executive of DRB Capital, a company that offers such advances and that is owned by Blackstone Group, the private-equity firm. The broader business of lending to mass-tort firms is also facing growing pressure. Last month, three Republican senators introduced a measure that would require attorneys in class actions and mass torts to disclose if a third party is financing their case. A federal judge in Cleveland overseeing hundreds of mass-tort cases against opioid makers last month ordered plaintiffs’ law firms to disclose any financing they were getting from third parties. Plaintiffs’ lawyers and investment firms argue that the money the firms provide makes it possible to pursue costly litigation against large companies. But some hedge funds impose higher interest rates if a case drags on too long. Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, said she found that problematic because it “encourages quick settlements that, at least in the mass-tort context, are unlikely to be in plaintiffs’ best interests.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Heeding the Pope on Climate Change,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Pope Urges Oil Executives to Act on Climate: ‘There Is No Time to Lose’ ” (news article, June 10): As an alumnus of the University of Notre Dame, I am pleased that its president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, has invited “all schools and departments of the university to respond to Francis’ evocative appeal on behalf of ‘our sister,’ the Earth.” Other Catholic colleges and universities are doing likewise, including the University of Dayton, which has divested from fossil fuels, and Saint Louis University, which was recently host to a climate summit, with Cardinal Peter Turkson, the prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development at the Vatican, as one of its several international speakers. In addition, Catholic health care systems and hospitals — like Dignity Health in San Francisco and SSM Health in St. Louis — are similarly divesting from fossil fuels and pursuing the greening of their facilities and practices. One in six patients is cared for each day in a Catholic hospital in the United States. Between Catholic colleges and universities and hospitals, significant changes are underway, providing pressure in addition to the pope’s that should move oil executives and others to act on climate change.

2018,"Hello, You Must Be Going: Hulu Parts With a Top Executive","Last summer, the executive Joel Stillerman started work at Hulu as its first-ever chief content officer. On Friday, the streaming platform announced that he was out. Hulu had lured Mr. Stillerman away from AMC, where he had a hand in “The Walking Dead” and “Better Call Saul.” His sudden exit was part of a broader reorganization at Hulu, which has attracted a growing number of subscribers but faces an uncertain future. Hulu hired Mr. Stillerman to pursue ambitious original programming and acquire shows from other networks for its expanding library. But soon after he moved from New York, where AMC has its headquarters, to Santa Monica, Calif., where Hulu is based, he ran into knotty complications. For one thing, he arrived when Hulu, after years of trying to find its footing in Hollywood, had hit upon some unexpected momentum thanks to “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which last year became the first program from a streaming service to win an Emmy for best drama series. The project was overseen by Craig Erwich, who will remain in charge of original programming at the company. Second, Mr. Stillerman soon found himself working without the person who had hired him, Mike Hopkins, who left the company as chief executive in October to become the head of Sony’s TV division. Mr. Hopkins was replaced by Randy Freer, the former chief operating officer of the Fox Networks Group. Mr. Stillerman’s vision for Hulu’s future did not impress his corporate overlords, and there were some chemistry issues with Mr. Freer, said three people familiar with the reasoning behind his departure. Mr. Freer, now seven months into the job, made the decision to reorganize the company. A Hulu spokeswoman said, “This change was entirely due to the reorganization, and not at all about performance.” Mr. Stillerman declined to comment. Even before he took the job of chief content officer, the position was not exactly seen as one of the hottest jobs in Hollywood. It had taken Hulu several months to fill it, partly because of the company’s unique — some would say tangled — corporate structure. Unlike Netflix executives, who have the freedom to make deals with little oversight, Hulu’s leaders must answer to many masters: the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, all partial owners. The merger mania sweeping through corporate media means that the latest reshuffling may stay in place for only so long. If Disney prevails in its bid to acquire most of 21st Century Fox, it will become Hulu’s majority owner. On the other hand, if Comcast succeeds with its rogue bid for most of 21st Century Fox, it will assume 60 percent of the company. Whatever the outcome, Hulu is likely to have a majority owner for the first time — and, with it, a new content strategy. For the time being, the position of chief content officer has been expunged. As Hulu has introduced a live TV service and expanded its original programming and its library of content, which now includes vintage shows like “ER” and “30 Rock,” its number of subscribers has surpassed 20 million. And yet the losses are mounting: In 2017, the company lost nearly $1 billion, a figure that will climb to more than $1.5 billion this year, according to the firm BTIG. Spending freely seems to be part of doing business in streaming, however: Netflix is expected to have a negative free cash flow of anywhere between $3 billion and $4 billion this year. Hulu’s competitors are also ramping up their executive ranks. Amazon, a sleeping giant in the entertainment industry, is showing signs of getting its act together, having hired the executive Jennifer Salke from NBC this year in the first of several moves meant to assure Hollywood that it can, at last, become a real player. And Netflix continues to gobble up talent, striking megadeals with the producers Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes, not to mention the Hollywood newcomers Barack and Michelle Obama. The company has 119 million paying subscribers, including more than 55 million in the United States. Hulu, which is available only domestically, has undergone shifts in its identity several times since it started in 2007. Until the success of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” it was seen primarily as a place where viewers could click their way to last night’s episode of a network television show. In addition to the news about Mr. Stillerman, Hulu announced that the senior vice president of experience, Ben Smith, and the head of partnerships and distribution. Tim Connolly, were no longer with the company. “Ben, Tim and Joel have all played a significant role in getting Hulu to the strong position it is in today,” Mr. Freer, the chief executive, said in a statement. “They will forever be a part of Hulu’s success story, and we wish them the very best in their next endeavors.” But it wasn’t all departures. The streaming service has hired Dan Phillips, the former chief operating officer of TiVo, as its new chief technology officer. Jaya Kolhatkar, formerly a Walmart executive, will become Hulu’s first chief data officer.",The New York Times
2018,Helping Hands,"Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: I’m 52, 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 265 pounds. Earlier this year, I was walking through a turnstile at the Broadway-Lafayette subway station when I turned awkwardly. My left knee gave way. Moments later, I was on the ground, unable to get up. Within a minute, two construction workers approached me. “We can’t leave you on the ground, my man,” one said. They picked me up, helped me to the nearest bench and sat me down. A woman came over to me to check on me. I said I just needed a minute and was going to try to get up. “Oh no, hon,” she said. “I’m calling 911.” About 10 minutes later, two police officers arrived. They stayed with me until the emergency medical workers arrived. Seeing that I was in excruciating pain, they talked to me about sports and family to keep my mind occupied. The kindness continued at Bellevue. I was treated, and then given a knee brace and crutches. My wife couldn’t get away from work, so I hobbled out to First Avenue to hail a cab home. The cabby who stopped for me got out and said, “I got you, brother.” I told him I was going to Brooklyn. “No problem, brother,” he said, taking my backpack off my shoulder. His name was Tee, and on the long ride home we talked about everything. What could have been an agonizing ride was very enjoyable. When we got to my house, Tee asked if I need help getting inside. “Good luck brother,” he said, “I’ll be praying for you.” You may hear that New Yorkers are self-involved. I want to send a shout-out to the people who make up my New York. They aren’t.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Helping Small Business,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Big Business, Squashing Small,” by David Leonhardt (column, June 18): The domination of big business is a reality all too familiar to the 30,000 small businesses nationwide that make up the Main Street Alliance. With monopolies growing ever larger, small businesses are being squeezed by both anticompetitive practices and an increasingly unequal economy. None of this is natural. It’s a result of policy choices favoring giant companies over Main Street. We need a Main Street economy that instead of draining resources from small businesses and communities levels the playing field. That means fair taxation to fund a healthy work force and thriving communities. It means economic development that revitalizes local economies and promotes racial equity. It means creating quality jobs that boost our economy. And it means supporting immigrant entrepreneurs and other immigrants and stopping the division promoted by President Trump and other politicians.

2018,Helsinki Summit Meeting Is Set for Trump and Putin,"MOSCOW — President Trump plans to meet President Vladimir V. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16 for one-on-one talks, the White House said on Thursday, a politically delicate meeting that will take place while the special counsel continues to investigate the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia. It will be the first formal summit meeting for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, who have spoken together twice on the sidelines of annual gatherings of world leaders, and it will come at a particularly critical moment, with midterm elections looming in the United States. “The two leaders will discuss relations between the United States and Russia, and a range of national security issues,” the White House said in a statement. The Helsinki talks, which will come on the heels of a NATO summit meeting in Brussels on July 11 and 12, could exacerbate American relations with European allies even as it eases tensions with Russia. Mr. Trump this week sent his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to Moscow, where he met on Wednesday with Mr. Putin. Afterward, an aide to Mr. Putin, Yuri Ushakov, reiterated Moscow’s denial that it tried to influence the United States presidential election in 2016, comments that Mr. Trump cited on Thursday in a Twitter post before the meeting with Mr. Putin was announced. “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” Mr. Trump wrote. The potential for such a high-level meeting has concerned some American allies in Europe, particularly because of recent tensions between the Trump administration and traditional American allies including Canada, France and Germany. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that it was important to get along with Russia and other countries. But a meeting with Mr. Putin, and improving the relationship between the United States and Russia, have long appeared to be priorities for Mr. Trump. Early in the presidential campaign, before having secured the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump said he thought he and Mr. Putin would hit it off. “I think I’d get along very well with Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Trump said in the summer of 2015. Mr. Trump has also said he would consider inviting Mr. Putin to the White House, which would be the first visit by the Russian leader since 2005.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Herbert Hoover’s Ghost,"Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist In 2014 I published a book called “America in Retreat,” with the subtitle, “The New Isolationism and the Coming Global Disorder.” Though an entire chapter is devoted to a critique of Tea Party foreign policy, it was mainly a lament about what I saw as President Obama’s imprudent retreat from America’s global responsibilities and the risk of returning to the disastrous foreign policy mind-set of the 1930s. Silly me. I wrote the book one administration too soon. That’s the conclusion to draw from Donald Trump’s long-promised and now bluntly delivered imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the European Union. And that was just after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to put tariffs on China “on hold” to allow negotiations to continue. What was it that Sarah Palin once said about Obama’s foreign policy — that he was “coddling enemies and alienating allies”? Well, move over, Barack. Those tariffs on China might still be on — with this administration, inconstancy and idiocy seem to contend like wrestlers in a W.W.E. match — but that would only compound the damage. Protectionism anywhere is invariably bad for local consumers and the global economy, but American protectionism is infinitely worse. It’s a betrayal of the liberal-international order we founded nearly eight decades ago; an invitation to anti-Americanism; a rebuff to our friends; and sometimes (Boston Tea Party, anyone?) a prelude to war. Never mind restoring a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. The spirit that really hovers over this White House is Herbert Hoover’s. But that’s unfair to Hoover, whose soul can now rest easy that he is no longer the worst Republican president ever. In the grip of the Great Depression, the 31st president was under intense political pressure to sign the Tariff Act of 1930, better known as Smoot-Hawley after its Republican authors in Congress. Hoover himself was a somewhat reluctant protectionist. And while 1,028 economists signed a petition imploring the president not to sign, he could not then know that “Smoot-Hawley” would become a byword for economic folly. Between 1930 and 1933, the value of global trade declined from $4.9 billion to $1.8 billion. Trump has no such excuses. The economy is humming. The overwhelming majority of Americans want more trade deals, not fewer, and are leery of a trade war. Congressional Republicans are broadly pro-trade and aren’t trying to push the administration into a political corner. And the opposition to tariffs among professional economists is about as universal now as it was then. The same might be said for many U.S. executives who know something about how the tariffs will work. On Friday I spoke with Gary Stein, C.E.O. of Houston-based Triple-S Steel, which sells about one million tons of steel products a year, mostly for construction and heavy manufacturing. He calls the tariffs “just juvenile.” “These guys in Washington don’t understand how real supply lines work,” he says. “You can’t crack the economy on the end of a whip like that when you are dealing with real jobs and real people and real products coming across borders. There’s a lot of special stuff that comes from only one mill, and now suddenly you can’t get it or it’s going to cost you 25 percent more.” So what motivates the president to pick these fights? Rust-belt politics surely plays a role. But it’s also the same ideological obsession he has held since at least the 1980s — as dated and ugly as his mullet — not to mention his sneering indifference to what was once called “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.” When the Wall Street Journal editorial board (of which I was then a member) asked Trump in 2015 whether he worried that his immigration and trade policies could have disastrous political effects in Mexico, he answered: “I don’t care about Mexico honestly, I really don’t care about Mexico.” Next month, Mexicans, who do care, will likely elect their most anti-American president in nearly 50 years. Conservative apologists for Trump have long told us not to worry about his most extreme positions, because his sober-minded advisers would surely bring him to reason. Sure. This week one of those supposedly sober minds, Vice President Mike Pence, torpedoed relations with Canada by abruptly demanding a five-year sunset clause for a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. Did most Americans even notice? Perhaps they won’t while the expansion continues to run its course, but they will feel it when it stops. The administration is blowing up the foundations of global economic order with the same mindless glee as a child popping bubble wrap. Canada now intends to retaliate with $12.8 billion worth of its own tariffs. Mexico and the European Union are set to announce retaliatory levies of their own. And these are our friends. The darker echoes of the 1930s are sounding louder. The shadow of Hoover grows longer. We know how this movie ends. If Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow had a gram of self-respect he’d resign.",The New York Times
2018,Here Are Things Not to Put in Your Vagina,"The cycle From yogurt to oregano oil to lemon juice (OUCH!), the internet is chock-full of suggestions and remedies for women’s sexual health. People always want to know the most unusual object I’ve retrieved from a vagina. I’ll never tell. One, because the woman involved could recognize herself and feel betrayed. Yes, some items are that unusual. The other reason is that the unfortunate sequence of events that ends with a visit to my OB-GYN practice or the emergency room is almost always the unanticipated consequence of sexual experimentation. Lots of objects seem sexually adventurous until the moment one realizes they are not. And realizes that they are stuck. Sexual experimentation with household items is nothing new, though the nature of the object has changed slightly to match the times — think along the lines of a progression from a soda bottle to a diet soda bottle to an energy water bottle to a Kombucha bottle — over my 25 years of practice. Another change I’ve noticed in that time is the increased touting of various “natural” and “ancient” vaginal remedies with household items. The reasons could range from “vaginal maintenance” (a term that, as an expert, I struggle to further qualify) to the treatment of yeast infections to contraception to improving sex lives. There are two themes at play that seem simultaneously opposing yet complementary: that natural is best and that the vagina is so dirty, fragile or in need of nourishment (or all three) that it is one wrong pair of underwear or wet bathing suit away from complete catastrophe. And this is how lemon juice (ouch), yogurt, garlic (double ouch), cucumber and oregano oil (super, mega ouch) are finding their way into vaginas worldwide. No, you are not reading a recipe for tzatziki sauce. Many of these supposed natural therapies claim to have supporting science, although what is offered as proof is easily dismissed with a cursory knowledge of reproductive physiology. Lemon juice is recommended to acidify the vagina (it cannot). Yogurt is suggested because its bacteria could help repopulate the healthy, vaginal bacteria (commercial yogurts don’t have the right strains). Sea sponges are recommended for menstrual hygiene (testing has revealed they have bacteria and debris and they could introduce far more oxygen — a bad thing — into the vagina than a tampon or menstrual cup). What is simultaneously fascinating and depressing is that these “newly discovered ancient therapies” are neither ancient nor effective. Instead they are the result of celebrity wellness sites, social media and even some doctors recycling material from health almanacs and digests that used to be found at the grocery store and repackaging their content under the guise of female empowerment. What is science with its stodgy physiology and evidence-based medicine against the allure of the patient anecdote and the promise of a cure? Stories and confidence are what sells. It’s possible that remedies like yogurt, garlic and so on were tried centuries ago as medicine, spermicide or sexual custom. But who cares if something was used historically if it has since been deemed ineffective or harmful? Blood letting for fever, mercury for vitality or syphilis, and animal dung as spermicide are all ancient medicinal practices, but that doesn’t mean we’re revisiting those therapies today. In other words, all these so-called “ancient” sexual remedies were retired for a reason. I get the allure. So many women are still uncomfortable speaking openly about genital health, and the internet offers privacy — not to mention community and validation. When all these needs are met, accuracy can seem secondary. It is always best to see a health care professional for a diagnosis. We women do know our bodies, but there is so much crossover with symptoms that when women attempt self- diagnosis they are likely to misdiagnose more than 50 percent of the time. That’s worse than flipping a coin. Researching symptoms and treatment options is always good, but to keep your internet hygiene in check (which requires far more effort than vaginal hygiene) these are the things that should send you screaming: Run if the therapy is said to be “proven.” The degree to which something is supposedly “proven” to treat a medical condition is inversely proportional to the number of studies supporting that claim. Run if something is being sold. Anyone selling a product is by definition biased, whether it is “Big Pharma” or “Big Natural.” Run if the recommendation is homeopathic products. A recent study tells us that doctors who recommend homeopathy are more likely to deviate from standard medical guidelines. In other words they are more likely to practice bad medicine.

2018,Here Are the Biggest Stories in American Politics This Week,"From Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s decision to retire from the Supreme Court to upsets in midterm primaries, it was a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the highlights from the headlines this week. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced Wednesday that he would retire from the Supreme Court at the end of July, giving President Trump the opportunity to cement the conservative tone of the United States’ highest court. Over his 30-year tenure, Justice Kennedy was often a crucial deciding vote in some of the court’s most divisive decisions on gay rights, abortion rights and campaign finance. His departure raised concerns for Democrats and liberal activists that those verdicts could be overturned. A political fight began to brew in Washington between conservatives determined to confirm a nominee quickly and activists vowing to fight to preserve the court’s liberal precedents. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, promised a Senate vote on a nominee by the fall. With only one Republican vote needed to derail a nomination, Democrats are hoping they might sway Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Susan Collins of Maine, who are among the most moderate Republicans in the Senate.

Mr. Crowley’s defeat reverberated through the Democratic caucus in Congress, as lawmakers grappled with the loss of a likely candidate for speaker and the prospect of new leadership for the party. In other midterm primaries held Tuesday, it was apparent that liberal activists had defeated the establishment while Republican voters stuck with candidates endorsed by Mr. Trump — a break from the pattern of the past few years.

Crowley’s Loss Heralds an ‘End of an Era’: Last of the Party Bosses The Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, ruling on Tuesday that the president’s power to secure the country’s borders was not undermined by his inflammatory messaging about the dangers Muslims pose to the United States. The court’s conservatives formed the majority in the 5-to-4 ruling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered a blistering dissent from the bench, condemning the ban as “harrowing” and “motivated by hostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.” The court, again voting 5 to 4 with the more conservative judges in the majority, dealt a sharp blow to labor unions on Wednesday by ruling that government workers who do not join labor unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining.

A federal judge in California temporarily stopped the Trump administration from separating children from their families at the border by issuing a nationwide injunction Tuesday night. He also ordered that the administration reunite all families already separated at the border. Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that it would be difficult to adhere to the timetable established by the judge, arguing that before releasing children to parents or other relatives, the government must “vet them.” Border officials said earlier in the week that they had temporarily stopped handing over migrant adults who cross the Mexican border into the United States with children for prosecution. The House also overwhelmingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite Mr. Trump’s late endorsement for the legislation’s passage.

2018,Here Is One Way Trump Spreads False Information Online,"The president tweeted something untrue about Representative Maxine Waters. Outrage ensued online, but that only helped spread disinformation. On Monday, President Trump tweeted that Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, had encouraged liberals to “harm” supporters of “the Make America Great Again movement” and warned her to “be careful what you wish for.” By Tuesday, the tweet was shared more than 40,000 times, and many users included comments critical of the president. Both critics and supporters of Mr. Trump said the tweet contained a veiled threat against the congresswoman, who called on people to confront Trump officials in public as a form of registering their disapproval. This kind of Twitter outrage cycle has repeated itself countless times since Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign in 2015, and it is one of his tried and true methods for injecting disinformation into public discourse, experts said. “What we’re seeing here is the standard process of Trump launching a series of lies into our media ecosystem and then watching it bounce around and amplify through the system,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at The University of Virginia. “So to respond with anything reasonable to the fact that the president basically made stuff up is to extend the message and to throw a bomb” into the political debate. The president’s tweet about Ms. Waters contained a false statement, an insult and what sounds like a threat. But each time it was shared — even, and perhaps especially, by critics who wanted to vent their anger — the message was amplified and spread. Here is how this particular episode began: some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have recently been hassled at restaurants or at a movie theater by protesters opposed to his administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border. At a rally on Saturday in Los Angeles, Ms. Waters praised those protesters and encouraged them to do more, using physical terms like “push back.” “Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” Separately, in an MSNBC interview, she also called on people to confront Trump officials in public spaces and condoned efforts to “harass them.” Both liberals and conservatives criticized Ms. Waters for escalating an already tense political situation, although few, if any, liberals believe she called for targeted attacks on White House officials or Trump supporters. At a news conference on Monday, Ms. Waters said, “I believe in peaceful protest.” But Mr. Trump and conservatives have embraced a more sinister interpretation. The conservative group Judicial Watch called for an ethics investigation into Ms. Waters, saying she had “incited violence and assault against members of President Trump’s cabinet.” Its president, Tom Fitton, repeated that argument in an opinion piece for Fox News, which shared it online. And then there was Mr. Trump, who told his 53 million Twitter followers that Ms. Waters had called for physical violence against many of his supporters. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, repeated a version of that claim during a White House press briefing, implying that she had advocated action against “any Trump supporter.” Online, Mr. Trump’s critics largely denounced what they saw as a veiled threat (“Be careful what you wish for Max!”). By retweeting Mr. Trump, many of his critics in turn spread false statements and an insult (“an extraordinarily low IQ person”) rather than correcting them. But even when they do correct the president, Mr. Vaidhyanathan said, it does not make much difference. “He can make a statement about a member of Congress and her I.Q. and completely lie about what that member of Congress said,” Mr. Vaidhyanathan said of Mr. Trump. “And what will occur is consistent repetition of that message. And most of the repetition of that message will be in the form of criticism, not correction.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Here’s How to Break the Impasse on Climate,"Mr. Lott was the Republican Senate majority leader from 1996 to 2002. Mr. Breaux was a chief deputy whip for the Senate Democrats. As former leaders of our parties in the United States Senate, we know what it takes to achieve a bipartisan breakthrough in Congress. For all the talk of discord in Washington, we see the possibility of finding common ground on a divisive issue. As surprising as it may sound, climate change offers a chance for both parties to come together and deliver a victory — and cash dividends — to the American people. Climate change is one of the great challenges of our generation. The politics of the issue have been divisive for decades and a new approach is needed to address this urgent problem. Both Democrats and Republicans can find that solution. America has always come together at moments of crisis or opportunity, from the shadows of economic depression and world war to the promise of the technology revolution and our rise to global energy dominance. America now must marshal its political will to lead on climate as well. There is only one lever powerful enough to solve this problem at the required scale and speed. Congress should approve legislation to place a meaningful fee on carbon-dioxide emissions that ripples through all sectors of our economy, and return the revenues it generates to the American people in the form of cash payments. We must set it high enough to encourage a turn to cleaner energy sources and accelerate our transition to a low-carbon future. If America leads on carbon pricing, the rest of the world will follow. We can do this. We are proposing that Democratic and Republican leaders put their differences aside and support a plan proposed last year by two former Republican secretaries of state, James Baker and George Shultz. The Baker-Shultz plan has been endorsed by two former heads of the Federal Reserve, by Treasury secretaries from both parties, and by leading corporations from nearly every sector. The plan is simple and elegant. It calls for an initial fee of $40 on every ton of carbon-dioxide emissions at the source, and raising it each year until we reach the necessary emissions reductions as businesses and consumers move to cleaner sources of energy. All revenue would then be disbursed to Americans. A family of four would receive approximately $2,000 a year. We would then export this approach and leadership on this issue to every corner of the global economy, while protecting the competitiveness of American companies. If Exxon Mobil and the Nature Conservancy can back this common-sense solution, shouldn’t Democrats and Republicans be able to do so as well? Indeed, the Baker-Shultz carbon dividends plan is based on a few grand bargains meant to offer everyone with a stake in the climate debate an important win. For example, it would achieve far greater emissions reductions than all Obama-era climate regulations combined, which will appeal to Democrats and environmentalists. At the same time, this market-based solution would render carbon regulations unnecessary, which will appeal to Republicans and business interests. And according to the Treasury Department, 70 percent of Americans, including the most vulnerable, would come out ahead economically. Economists have long agreed that putting a price on emissions is the most cost-efficient way to tackle climate change. The ground rules make intuitive sense: The more businesses pollute, the more they pay; the less they pollute, the more they come out ahead. That goes for consumers and the cars they drive as well. We should push this breakthrough carbon-dividends plan more squarely into the political arena through a national campaign. That is why we signed on as co-chairmen of the new nonprofit group Americans for Carbon Dividends, which will roll out a multifaceted media and lobbying campaign to promote this winning solution. (This group has hired our firm to help with the campaign.) Americans already like the idea. A poll released Tuesday by Americans for Carbon Dividends shows that 81 percent of likely voters — including 71 percent of moderate Republicans and 58 percent of conservative Republicans — agree the government should take action to limit carbon emissions. And by a 2-to-1 margin, likely voters support taxing carbon emissions and rebating the money directly to the American people. Support for this concept among Republicans is similarly strong, with Republicans favoring the dividends plan by a 23-point margin. There are various policy details that will need to be addressed. But this is the only realistic, workable path now open to us if we want to solve one of the most daunting challenges of our time. We must put a meaningful price on carbon in America, and then convince the rest of the world to follow our lead. To do so, we must set our politics aside for the greater good. America has done it before, time after time. We believe the country will do so again. There are various policy details that will need to be addressed.

2018,Here’s What You Missed in American Politics,"Be it President Trump’s decision to reinstate the June 12 meeting with North Korea or more tariffs for American allies, here are six of the biggest stories in politics this week. (And links if you’d like to read further.) President Trump said on Friday that the summit meeting with North Korea on June 12 in Singapore had been rescheduled after a week of meetings and scrambling between American and Korean officials. The president made the announcement after a North Korean envoy, Kim Yong-chol, personally gave him a letter from Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Mr. Trump said he had not yet opened the letter, but felt the meeting — “really a get-to-know-you kind of a situation,” he said afterward — went well. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Kim Yong-chol, one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials, on Thursday in New York and had expressed optimism this week about the potential talks. But that same day, Kim Jong-un met with a top Russian official, Sergey V. Lavrov, in North Korea. Mr. Lavrov’s welcome in Pyongyang, the capital — and the invitation he brought from President Vladimir V. Putin for Mr. Kim to visit Moscow — was a reminder that competing powers could still upend efforts to hold the summit meeting. Additional Reading: Trump Dangles Aid Before North Korea.

The attacks came after The New York Times reported how Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sessions last year to reverse his recusal from the special counsel’s investigation. This week, Mr. Trump also pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative author, commentator and filmmaker who pleaded guilty in 2014 to illegal campaign contributions. He said on Thursday he was contemplating leniency for former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, Democrat of Illinois, and Martha Stewart, the lifestyle mogul. In flexing his power to issue pardons, the president could potentially offer more clemency to people convicted of crimes that parallel charges that have been made or mentioned in connection with allies of Mr. Trump in recent weeks. He also bypassed the traditional Justice Department protocols for issuing pardons and clemency.

Mr. Trump, stung by criticism that he had gone soft on China, said on Tuesday that the United States would proceed with tariffs and other punitive measures on the country. The tariffs, which include 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, are to be imposed by the end of the month. Days later, the Trump administration announced that it would enforce heavy steel and aluminum tariffs on some of its closest allies. The European Union, Canada and Mexico, which now face 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, drew up retaliatory measures in part to target areas of the United States where Mr. Trump enjoys the strongest support. The decision came after months of uncertainty about exemptions and whether American officials would follow through with an aggressive trade tactic.

The United States economy had its strongest job gains since February, according to numbers released on Friday by the Labor Department. In May, 223,000 jobs were added (higher than Wall Street’s expectation of about 190,000) and the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent, down from 3.9 percent in April and the lowest since early 2000. Before the numbers were made public, Mr. Trump broke with protocol and posted on Twitter about the jobs report. The language in his Twitter post seemed to signal notable gains, and economists said they were stunned at the prospect of Mr. Trump offering hints about the report’s content that could affect the markets and trading. Additional Reading: The Upshot: We Ran Out of Words to Describe How Good the Jobs Numbers Are Economic Scene: The Profound Social Cost of American Exceptionalism The Jobs Recovery: A Longer View Roseanne Barr, whose ABC sitcom had attracted high ratings and personal praise from Mr. Trump, had her show canceled Wednesday after she posted a racist remark on Twitter about Valerie Jarrett, a black woman who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. But when Mr. Trump weighed in on the backlash, he focused instead on the apology that ABC officials made to Ms. Jarrett and did not condemn the tweet. It is not the first time the president has found equivalence or diverted attention when confronted with divisive events. A day later, Samantha Bee, a comedian on TBS, apologized for using a vulgar epithet to describe Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser, on her show. But while TBS also offered an apology, the network did not take disciplinary action against Ms. Bee. The difference in consequences offered conservatives a new opportunity to criticize the news media for what they described as a liberal bias.

On Tuesday, that strategy was evident as he campaigned in Nashville on behalf of Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, who is running to succeed Senator Bob Corker. Republican officials are hoping the president can motivate core Republican supporters without encouraging Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans to go to the polls and vote against Mr. Trump and his chosen candidates. And Mr. Trump, who has flaunted his outsider appeal in Washington, has declined to endorse the insurgent conservatives looking to challenge Republican incumbents in primary fights.

2018,Here’s Your Summer Hair Guide ,"Skin Deep Coconut, lemon, tea, almond and aloe? Here are some new products and tricks you’ll want to try this summer. Just when you thought you’d solved your transitional winter-to-spring hair woes, here comes chlorine, sunshine, salt water and humidity. If your usual routine is to throw your hands in the air and deal with it all in September, have a look at these new products and D.I.Y. routines. Remember Sun In? The drugstore spray-on hair lightener that was all the rage in the 1980s is getting a luxury makeover courtesy of companies like IGK (Summertime hair lightening spray, $27) and Ouai (Sun of Beach Ombré spray, $24). “The Sun In concept was cool, but it was done wrong,” said Aaron Grenia, a founder of IGK. “It was basically hydrogen peroxide, and it really lifted and had a lot of power. With ours, we’re using a gentler, more hydrating formula — it’s lemon and chamomile, coconut oil and coconut water.” The results are noticeable but subtler, Mr. Grenia cautioned. “It’s also better for those with lighter hair to begin with,” he said. Alternatively, the colorist Rita Hazan suggests this at-home hack: “Brew chamomile tea and put it in a spray bottle to spritz your hair while you’re in the sun to lighten it a bit. There are flavonoids in the tea that help to gradually lighten hair over time, even darker tones.” With humidity and city grime, chances are you suds up your strands more often in summer. But Whitney Bowe, a dermatologist in New York, suggests rethinking the way we wash our hair. “People love to lather,” Dr. Bowe said. “We’re obsessed with this squeaky-clean feeling and then putting on conditioner with silicones that act as a Band-Aid for your hair. Instead we should be cutting out harsh detergents. We should be preventing damage from happening in the first place.” She’s hardly alone in her philosophy. A slew of new hair cleansers dispense with the usual formulas. Hairstory, with its New Wash, an aloe- and oil-based hair cleanser, is especially passionate about its methods ($40). The single product, with recently released variations for a deeper cleanse (New Wash Deep) or more hydration (New Wash Rich), is intended to replace both your shampoo and conditioner and to address all hair textures. The suds-less wash does take some work (you have to truly work in the product and rinse repeatedly or risk oily strands), but it can produce nice, hair-softening results. A breezier alternative is something in between, like the Glacial White Caviar Resort Cleansing Balm from the Barcelona company Miriam Quevedo ($60). Sulfate-free, with sweet almond oil as its second ingredient, the concentrated formula smells lovely and can help temper frizz. Once upon a time, you slathered conditioner all over your hair and scalp and called it a job well done. But if you heed the Briogeo founder Nancy Twine, you’d give your scalp the separate treatment it deserves. “Summer is a very sweaty season,” Ms. Twine said. “What happens is sweat combines with your normal hair product, and you really start to build up on the scalp.” Briogeo Scalp Revival charcoal and peppermint oil cooling jelly conditioner ($36) “is a really good way to detox and has absorbent qualities,” she said. “At the same time, the conditioner is very lightweight so your roots aren’t weighed down.” Ms. Twine said the jelly is suitable for all hair types, including black hair like her own, and that she created it specifically for her needs. “I've always had issues with a dry scalp,” she said. The drugstore line Yes To offers a charcoal conditioner for $7.99 with lightweight conditioning results although it lacked the soothing aspect of the Briogeo option. If you have colored hair, the hairstylist Eliut Rivera, an Upper East Side favorite, suggests two in-salon treatments ($45 per treatment). “I use the Olaplex 2 treatment on my clients, put their hair under a plastic cap and then put them under heat,” he said. “I would do that right at the beginning of summer and then again right after.” Speaking of colored hair, chlorine can be quite the land mine. Blondes and those with highlights will want to coat their hair before taking a dip. “Water itself is actually super damaging to hair,” Dr. Bowe said. “When your hair gets wet, the hair fibers themselves will swell. That will make your hair very weak and vulnerable to damage.” An at-home solution is to slather your hair in something that coats, like coconut oil, before going for a swim. IGK recently released Blocked Water-Resistant Hair Shield ($29), a creamy wax designed to prevent water from entering the cuticle. “It’s like swim cap for the hair without actually wearing one,” Mr. Grenia of IGK said. It can also double as a styling product. “In the salon, one of our stylists discovered that it’s great as a blow-dry aid, especially for baby hairs on the hair line,” he said. Hair already tinted swimming pool green? In late June, David Mallett, whose Paris salon draws clients like Charlotte Gainsbourg and Karl Lagerfeld, is releasing the handy Blush Hydration Spray ($45). With raspberry vinegar and organic tomato extract, the formula was created to cancel out Hulk-ish tones. Then there are the roots. Clémence von Mueffling, the founder of the Beauty and Well-Being site — her new book, “Ageless Beauty: The French Way,” was released this week — says her summer must-have is the Color WOW hair compact ($34.50), to disguise gray hair. “It will hold you over until you have time to visit your colorist,” she said. But the truth is, summer is meant for freewheeling, ditching obligations (ideally!) and kicking back. If the idea of overhauling your hair-care regimen sounds onerous, Ms. von Mueffling has this simple tip: Be gentler when drying your hair. “If my hair is wet all the time from the ocean or pool, I’ll be sure I gently squeeze water out and let it dry naturally,” she said. (Dr. Bowe agrees and loves the quick drying Aquis hair towel, $30.) Mr. Rivera says that perhaps the most important part of summer hair care is “putting down your hot tools.” “If you don’t want to feel like you need a million products, just doing that will make a big difference. It’s summer, after all. Embrace the season.”",The New York Times
2018,Hero Decorations,"wordplay Milo Beckman and David Steinberg celebrate with pride. THURSDAY PUZZLE — We have another unusual grid shape today, but there is a very good reason for it. I’m not going to tell you what that is though, at least until later. But I can tell you that today’s puzzle is a lovely June offering that will hopefully fill many people with pride. 1A: “Drive follower” sounds almost like a clue about golf, doesn’t it? It’s really a clue about what kind of word can follow the word “drive,” and today, that word is THRU, as in “drive-THRU.” 16A: The “Path to an Oscar?” is probably similar to the “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?” joke (“Practice, practice, practice!”), but today we’re strutting down the RED CARPET. 25A: “Mate’s consent” is AYE because we are talking about a sailor, not a spouse. 49A: Very cool wordplay. The clue — “What you may have that I can't?” — sounds kind of weird when you say it out loud, but if you really give it some thought, the word “you” can have (or be followed by) ARE, but the word “I” can’t, because we don’t say “I ARE” unless we are pleasantly inebriated. And even then. 3D: Yes, you can lead a horse by the REIN. But I’m pretty sure you can’t make him drink. 7D: The first sign in the astrological calendar year, which begins with the Spring Equinox, is ARIES in March. 10D: Hm. The answer, N.T.S.B., stands for the National Transportation Safety Board. I get the wordplay in “Grp. called in when things go off the rails?” and I love playing with words, but I’m not sure I would have made a joke out of rail crashes. I’ve been wrong before, though. 45D: Another “Start to …” or “Follower of ...” trick. “Start to cry?” is the letter CEE. Lots of great, lively fill and debuts, but it’s Thursday, so we have some wonderful weirdness going on in this grid. How could the answer to 15A’s “Some cross-country flights” be EYES? It turns out that there is a word missing. In that row of the puzzle, all three entries — EYES, CARPET and BARON — can be preceded by the word RED. Huh. Skip down two rows and the entries there can be preceded with the color ORANGE. Strange. This sounds somewhat familiar … Oh, I get it! Every other row in today’s puzzle, from top to bottom, has words that can be preceded by a consecutive color of the rainbow. And the grid is a 13 x 17 rectangle, which can only mean one thing: This is a rainbow flag, suitable for flying and celebrating LGBTQ+ Pride month, which commemorates the June 28, 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City. Other mini-theme material in the puzzle includes EEO (clued as “Fair-hiring inits., as for L.G.B.T. workers”), INNS (“Stonewall and others”) and “L.G.B.T. activist” and columnist DAN Savage makes an appearance as well. Oh, and there’s a nod to Prince and his PURPLE RAIN album, which made me very happy. The only theme entry I was unfamiliar with was BLUE HEN (sorry, University of Delaware), but thankfully I had already figured out the theme, so that wasn’t too tough. Plus, the BLUE MEANIES made up for it. Fun, fun puzzle to solve and a nice surprise at the end when you are finished, thanks to The New York Times Games team. DAVID STEINBERG: I had so much fun working with Milo! I’ve been a big fan of his puzzles ever since he debuted in The New York Times as another young constructor. Anyway, Milo came up with this idea and many of the theme entries; my suggestion was switching from a 15 x 15 to a 13 x 17, which looks more like a flag. We were also able to space out the stripes more evenly that way. The fill was a nightmare, given the constraints of all the theme entries. Milo and I went back and forth many times before settling on something close to what you see — the only difference is that (RED) PANDA is now the more familiar (RED) BARON, which I think was a nice suggestion from Will/Joel. The short fill still has more trade-offs than usual, but we hope the theme makes up for them. Happy Pride Month! MILO BECKMAN: What a difference a few years makes! I originally submitted this puzzle for Flag Day in 2012 (also a Thursday) and it was rejected on the grounds that it was too political to run in The New York Times at the time. I tried again in 2015, after Obergefell v. Hodges, figuring the conversation had shifted enough, and got a thumbs-up on the theme but a thumbs-down on the fill (looking back at it, just one section had ULLA, OBLA and OOLA … ouch). So I enlisted David Steinberg, whose fill is always sparkly-clean, to help me with a full rewrite. This is my first collaborative puzzle and it was super interesting to work with another constructor and see how choices differ on fill and clues. The finished product isn’t quite as clean as we would have liked (there’s a lot of theme material here!) but I’m hoping it makes for an enjoyable and fresh solve. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key.

2018,Hero or Villain? Death of Rapper XXXTentacion Divides the Internet,"As news spread on Monday of the death of the rapper XXXTentacion in a Florida shooting, a familiar social media ritual began to play out, with celebrities posting rest-in-peace wishes and respectful tributes to his talent. “I never told you how much you inspired me when you were here,” wrote Kanye West. “One of the most interesting people I’ve ever met,” Diddy posted on Twitter alongside a photo of the two laughing, adding, “REST IN PEACE YOUNG KING.” But a backlash came almost immediately, in long comment threads on Twitter and Instagram, with readers criticizing those stars for failing to immediately condemn XXXTentacion — whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy — for some of the brutal acts he was accused of. A familiar debate returned in force: Can you separate the art from the artist? [A suspect has been arrested in the killing of XXXTentacion: read more here.] A 20-year-old who rose quickly from underground fame on the music platform SoundCloud to the uppermost rungs of the Billboard charts, XXXTentacion was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering. Excerpts from a deposition in the case, and a recent investigative article in Miami New Times, included disturbing allegations that he had badly beaten his former girlfriend, including extended attacks of punching and strangulation. He was shot outside a motor sports dealership in Deerfield Beach, Fla., in what the Broward Sheriff’s Office said appeared to be a robbery. After the producer Diplo posted a brief note on Twitter, simply saying, “Thanks for inspiring me,” with a photo of him with XXXTentacion, many commenters took him to task, answering, “I’m sure his victims share your sentiment” and “This is irresponsible and disappointing.” A few hours later, Diplo followed up with a series of more nuanced statements on Instagram. On his own feed he wrote, “He has his faults and we was willing to pay for his sins.” And in a response to a post by Questlove, the Roots drummer, he posted: “Should not disregard his domestic violence but lot of people riding the hate wave,” adding, “they forget this was someone’s child too and deserved a second chance.” (A spokeswoman said that Diplo was not available for comment on Tuesday.) Similar conversations played out on the social media feeds of musicians including Joey Badass, J. Cole, Travis Barker and John Mayer, with some fans calling XXXTentacion the Tupac Shakur of his generation and others condemning him as an unabashed abuser. (Social media being social media, there was also no shortage of conspiracy theories that he was still alive.) In another widely circulated post, the R&B singer Jidenna called the accusations against XXXTentacion “horrific” but argued that people can change. Whether XXXTentacion had repented was another subject of vociferous debate. Last year the rapper said he would donate money to a domestic abuse charity, then said he gave it to children’s causes instead. XXXTentacion’s music quickly jumped in popularity as news of the killing spread, with his songs climbing the internal rankings at Amazon and iTunes. According to Nielsen, sales of his single “Sad!” rose by 1,140 percent on Monday compared with the day before, and album sales jumped by 4,730 percent in the same period. (Nielsen did not have numbers available for activity on streaming services, where XXXTentacion was particularly popular.) The rapid criticism — and follow-up comments by some stars — was a new wrinkle in the usual pattern of online reactions to celebrity deaths, reflecting the controversy that surrounded XXXTentacion’s brief career. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “We have seen some of our heroes fall in recent catastrophic headlines,” said Vickie Nauman, a veteran digital music executive, “leaving fans feeling duped and manipulated as well as mortified by that hero’s behavior that was enabled behind closed doors.” Last month, XXXTentacion also became an unlikely symbol of the suppressive powers of digital platforms when Spotify singled him out as one of only two artists affected by a newly implemented “hateful conduct” policy — the other was R. Kelly, who has been dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct for decades. Spotify removed both musicians’ work from its editorial playlists, but drew industrywide complaints that its policy amounted to a blunt form of censorship. It followed less high-profile examples of erasure of controversial artists like the indie duo PWR BTTM, whose music briefly disappeared from streaming services after one of its members was accused of sexual misconduct and anti-Semitism. XXXTentacion’s banishment from Spotify’s playlists was brief. Within three weeks the policy was rescinded. (Mr. Kelly, on the other hand, remains unpromoted.) And on Monday, Spotify seemed to forget all about its previous criticism, giving XXXTentacion’s music the top spots on its highly popular RapCaviar playlist and promoting a “This Is XXXTentacion” playlist on its main page. A Spotify spokesman declined to comment on the changes. On Tuesday afternoon, XXXTentacion still held the top two spots on RapCaviar.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Hey Boss, You Don’t Want Your Employees to Meditate","Gray Matter Dr. Vohs and Dr. Hafenbrack are behavioral scientists. Mindfulness meditation, a Buddhism-inspired practice in which you focus your mind entirely on the current moment, has been widely embraced for its instrumental benefits — especially in the business world. Companies like Apple, Google and Nike provide meditation rooms that encourage brief sessions during the workday. Chief executives publicly extol its benefits. And no wonder: The practical payoff of mindfulness is backed by dozens of studies linking it to job satisfaction, rational thinking and emotional resilience. But on the face of it, mindfulness might seem counterproductive in a workplace setting. A central technique of mindfulness meditation, after all, is to accept things as they are. Yet companies want their employees to be motivated. And the very notion of motivation — striving to obtain a more desirable future — implies some degree of discontentment with the present, which seems at odds with a psychological exercise that instills equanimity and a sense of calm. To test this hunch, we recently conducted five studies, involving hundreds of people, to see whether there was a tension between mindfulness and motivation. As we report in a forthcoming article in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, we found strong evidence that meditation is demotivating. Some of the participants in our studies were trained in a few of the most common mindfulness meditation techniques. They were instructed by a professional meditation coach to focus on their breathing or mentally scan their bodies for physical sensations, being gently reminded throughout that there was no right or wrong way to do the exercise. Other participants were led through a different exercise. Some were encouraged to let their thoughts wander; some were instructed to read the news or write about recent activities they had done. Then we gave everyone a task to do. The tasks were similar to everyday workplace jobs: editing business memos, entering text into a computer and so on. Before embarking on the tasks, the participants were asked about their motivation: How much effort and time would they put into the assignment? Did they feel like doing it? Among those who had meditated, motivation levels were lower on average. Those people didn’t feel as much like working on the assignments, nor did they want to spend as much time or effort to complete them. Meditation was correlated with reduced thoughts about the future and greater feelings of calm and serenity — states seemingly not conducive to wanting to tackle a work project. Then we tracked everyone’s actual performance on the tasks. Here we found that on average, having meditated neither benefited nor detracted from a participant’s quality of work. This was bad news for proponents of meditation in the workplace: After all, previous studies have found that meditation increases mental focus, suggesting that those in our studies who performed the mindfulness exercise should have performed better on the tasks. Their lower levels of motivation, however, seemed to cancel out that benefit. Mindfulness is perhaps akin to a mental nap. Napping, too, is associated with feeling calm, refreshed and less harried. Then again, who wakes up from a nap eager to organize some files? By some accounts, motivation is just as important as intelligence and personality when it comes to an individual’s success, and has the advantage of being largely under an individual’s control. Companies benefit, too, when workers are motivated: A 2013 worldwide survey by Gallup found that companies with more engaged employees outperform other companies in growth and productivity. Management theorists and organizational leaders often think about motivation in terms of financial incentives. So as part of our research, we studied whether offering a financial bonus for outstanding performance would overcome the demotivating effect of mindfulness: It did not. While the promise of material rewards will always be a useful tool for motivating employees, it is no substitute for internal motivation. Mindfulness might be unhelpful for dealing with difficult assignments at work, but it may be exactly what is called for in other contexts. There is no denying that mindfulness can be beneficial, bringing about calm and acceptance. Once you’ve reached a peak level of acceptance, however, you’re not going to be motivated to work harder.",The New York Times
2018,"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey! ‘Saved by the Bell’ Now a Restaurant","Is early ’90s nostalgia running amok or what? WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. — When Eric Bushard, a 34-year-old senior manager of strategic partnerships at Yahoo, heard that a pop-up restaurant inspired by the TV series “Saved by the Bell” was opening here on Santa Monica Boulevard, he texted a friend he has known since the fourth grade, “Hey Screech, it looks like the Max is open again!” To his fiancé, who is 17 years his senior and has never watched the show, which aired Saturday mornings on NBC from 1989-1992, these words meant nothing. But to Mr. Bushard and his buddy, both of whom grew up in San Diego, they were an invitation to wallow in Day-Glo nostalgia for a series that is their cohort’s beloved counterpart to the Gen X favorite “The Brady Bunch.” Called Saved by the Max and located in the same shopping center as a Target and a Best Buy, the diner is one of the latest venues designed to let fans have an “immersive experience” of their favorite TV shows and movies. Others have included the popular “Downton Abbey” exhibit, open on 57th Street in New York City through September and expected to travel after that, and the short-lived Rue La Rue Café, a “Golden Girls”-themed destination that opened and closed in Washington Heights last year. The brainchild of three Chicago entrepreneurs — Derek Berry, Zack Eastman and Steve Harris, who all have experience as club promoters — Saved by the Max meticulously recreates the neon-lit cafe where the kids from Bayside High School in the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Palisades liked to hang after class. Keen-eyed visitors to the restaurant will notice, in an array of school lockers, replicas of such props as the brick-sized cellphone favored by the preppy bad boy Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and bottles of caffeine pills like those abused in the series’ most infamous episode by the leggy egghead Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley, years before she abused herself in “Showgirls”). There is even a recreation of Principal Richard “the Big Bopper” Belding’s office: paneling, pennants and all. “When I walked into that place, my knees buckled because it was just perfect,” said Dennis Haskins, the actor who played Mr. Belding on both “Saved by the Bell” and “Good Morning, Miss Bliss,” the 1988 show that spawned it. “I was looking around for the crew. It was that good.” Mr. Haskins had this reaction when he visited a Chicago incarnation of Saved by the Max in 2016 when it opened in the city’s Wicker Park neighborhood. That restaurant, which at 2,500 square feet was less than half the size of the California version, was supposed to be open only for a month but proved to be “crazily popular,” as one local Zagat reviewer put it. “When we put tickets on sale, they sold out in a matter of minutes,” Mr. Berry said. “We found ourselves going a full year, until we decided to put Saved by the Max on tour.” The West Hollywood edition is taking reservations through September 2019. Tickets, which include an appetizer and entree, cost $40. Some nights, visitors might get a cast member as a chaser. “I’m going to be popping in sporadically and showing up in full costume and character,” said Ed Alonzo, the magician and actor who played Max, the cafe owner on “Saved by the Bell.” “Seeing me in the actual diner, dressed as Max, is very surreal for people,” he said. But how is the food? The upscale diner menu was created by Brian Fisher, a usually much more serious chef known for his cooking at the Michelin-starred Chicago restaurants Schwa and Entente. Dishes include Mac & Screech, a cheesy appetizer named for the nerdy goofball played by Dustin Diamond; A.C. Sliders, made with ginger-and-beer-braised pulled pork and saluting Bayside’s star athlete A.C. Slater (Mario Lopez); Tori’s Fried Chicken, which is Korean-spiced, served with a coconut milk waffle and named for Leanna Creel’s character; and the Kelly Kapowski, a Monte Cristo sandwich honoring Tiffani Thiessen’s breakout role as the prettiest girl in high school. Mr. Fisher was a fan of the show, he said. “Oh yeah, big time. I was the perfect age.” (35.) One of the reasons the show resonated with him and others who watched, suggested an executive producer, Bennett Tramer, is because the show’s actors were the same age as their characters, then a rarity in television. “On ‘Head of the Class,’” said Mr. Tramer, referring to the 1986-1991 ABC sitcom about gifted high school students, “They had to take their midterms and then apply for Social Security.” Among the show’s most ardent fans are the composer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda — he even quoted a line from the caffeine-pill episode in his Hunter College High School yearbook — Lena Dunham, Questlove and Amy Schumer. The actress Saoirse Ronan has said in interviews that watching “Saved by the Bell,” which can be streamed on Hulu and Amazon Prime, helped her prepare for her Oscar-nominated performance as an awkward high school student in “Lady Bird.” And a 2015 “Saved by the Bell” reunion skit on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” featuring members of the original cast, was called “the greatest ’90s moment ever” by HuffPost and since has racked up more than 39 million views on YouTube. “It’s extremely flattering that so many people are fans of the show,” said Mr. Lopez. “There was a fun cheesiness that I think everyone enjoys. Plus, there was a certain innocence and charm to it.” Universal, which owns “Saved by the Bell,” did not commission the pop-up restaurant, but has enthusiastically sanctioned it and become a partner. Reviving classic entertainment properties, said Carol Nygren, senior vice president of Worldwide Live Entertainment, Universal Brand Development, “is always a popular trend, and being able to recreate scenes that play into fans’ memories of popular shows is so much fun.” In recent years, Hulu and Netflix sponsored recreations of Luke’s Diner from “Gilmore Girls” and Jerry’s apartment on “Seinfeld” to herald those shows’ arrivals on streaming services. In 2014, Warner Brothers partnered with Eight O’Clock Coffee to do a pop-up version of Central Perk, the coffeehouse on “Friends,” and secured a copyright on the name for use in “coffee shop and cafe services” last January. And who can forget the giddy days of 1997 when Fox built a life-size replica of the “Simpsons” house in a suburban Las Vegas subdivision? Enthusiasm for “Saved by the Bell”-related experiences, however, may outplay all of those properties. “It’s the right time for “Saved by the Bell,” Mr. Eastman said. “People’s interest in the show hasn’t died. Folks who are 32 to 38 years old, we’re all looking for something that’s different to do, something that’s not a nightclub that you have to be somebody to get into.” His business partner, Mr. Harris, who is in his early fifties, said the men chose the show in part because that age group is “out and spending and being more active than people who grew up on ‘Cheers’ and ‘Happy Days.’” (Ouch!) In fact, Peter Engel, an executive producer on the series and author of the 2016 memoir “I Was Saved by the Bell” has dubbed that group of early millennials the “Bell Generation.” “They’re still connected with the show,” he said. “What show, after 26 years, has had a restaurant in Chicago and now in L.A.?” He noted that a documentary is being made about the creation of the show and said he has written a musical based on the series that he described as a “celebration of the ’90s.” He’d like the play to go to Broadway,” but he’ll settle for Las Vegas, as long as there is a Saved by the Max restaurant attached. Mr. Haskins, the once and eternal Mr. Belding, would cheer this development: “With all that’s going on in the world, we need some place that brings back a lot of good memories.” “This show really made a difference,” Mr. Engel said. “‘Saved by the Bell’ reflected a kinder, gentler time.”",The New York Times
2018,He’s Going Back to His Former Wife. Sort Of.,"Modern Love On his deathbed, my husband shared some surprising burial instructions. “There’s something I have to tell you,” John said. Do you remember ever wanting to hear the sentence after that one? I don’t. “There’s something I have to tell you” has never, in the history of man, been followed by “We won the lottery” or “I have discovered a cure for blindness.” This is especially true when the person uttering that sentence is your husband, and he is about to die. I’m not a big believer in deathbed confessions. I intend to keep it all to myself, unless my own “There’s something I have to tell you” is “You were always my favorite,” to whoever walks in the room. Everybody should be at my deathbed. You won’t regret it. John and I were lying in the cramped hospital bed that I had installed in my bedroom because I had decided to go full pioneer woman and tend to him myself. I’m still not sure why. Normally I am the queen of outsourcing. Also, I am a terrible nurse. But my decision to care for him at home was made in an instant. He wanted to be here. Our 16-year-old twin boys desperately wanted him here. And so did I, despite the fact that this was the first time we had lived together in 25 years of marriage. We had always kept separate homes. A week earlier we had learned that John had three separate forms of cancer: pancreatic, liver and prostate. A “cancer overachiever,” as I told him. I can’t remember the Yiddish phrase his doctor used to describe the usefulness of chemo or radiation, but it roughly translated to “pissing in the wind.” Solid, barrel-chested, bearded and floppy-haired, John had always looked like a Bugs Bunny cartoon version of the opera singer he was. I adored his looks. Now he was a skeleton. John spoke with difficulty as he held my hand. “So, there’s something I have to tell you,” he said. “I made a certain promise to Amy.” Amy was his former wife. She had died of breast cancer about 30 years ago, before John and I met. “I promised her,” he said, “that we would be buried together.” Oh. It turns out that when John said he had kept Amy close, he hadn’t been speaking metaphorically; she was in his closet at his studio apartment. Could I fetch her? Also, could I find her passport and death certificate? I would need them to carry out his plan. There was a field in Northern England where John had played as a child. He wanted to be buried there. With Amy. But not scattered. The field still existed, but the area was no longer so rural, and John didn’t want to end up blanketing a local parking lot. So I was to take his box of ashes and Amy’s, get a shovel and probably a flashlight, because this was illegal so we’d need to do it at night, the funereal equivalent of a dine-and-dash. Joining me would be John’s 90-year-old sister and his nephew, along with our sons, Henry and Gus, who were currently far more focused on the adventure of the illicit burial than on what it all meant. “I’d always been sure you’d go first,” John added, sadly. The fact that I am 30 years younger had in no way deterred him from this thought. John seemed the grumpiest of men, but in key ways he was an optimist. “And of course I would have followed your instructions for your own burial,” he said. “I would have cremated you and placed you in the mausoleum with your parents. I know you wanted nothing more.” This didn’t seem the time to point out that for at least 10 years I had been telling him that I loathed the mausoleum, that I had arranged for my body to be donated to a medical school, and that I had put aside money for a big party afterward. John never listened. That, combined with his almost comical frugality (I already had been warned I would need to find the cheapest cremation place in New York) had often threatened to sink our marriage. But I guess I could save that conversation to have with myself, late at night. Plenty of time for that. Not much time for anything else. We talked and talked. “I was a good husband, wasn’t I?” he said. “At least I didn’t chase after girls.” (No, I thought a little churlishly. Because then you would have had to pay for them.) “You were wonderful,” I said. Both thoughts were true. He wanted to make sure I understood his plan. But about 30 minutes into this conversation, he suddenly looked sheepish, as if it had just occurred to him that his wife of 25 years may not actually be on board to carry out this promise he had made to his former wife more than three decades earlier. “You don’t have to do this right away,” he said. “In fact, you could wait until you go, and then have the boys take all three of us. That would be fine too.” “Um,” I said. Amy was Midwestern, blond, aristocratic and gracious, an accomplished equestrian and mezzo-soprano 17 years older than John. Before she got sick, they had worked their way across Europe, singing at all the big opera houses. She was everything I am not. John and I used to joke that the only thing he and I had in common was a mutual antipathy for fish. Amy and John shared everything. He loved us both, and he made a family with me. But I never kid myself. I explained the situation to my friend Hilary over lunch, including the part where I could hold off on the burial until my own demise. “I really don’t want to be their ashy third wheel,” I groused. “Here’s what you do,” Hilary said. “You put Amy in some sort of suspicious container — something metal that the T.S.A. people can’t see through in the screening. Amy looks like a bomb. Oops! The T.S.A. will just have to keep her. Oh well! You tried.” I could have explained instead of laughing, I suppose. But it’s hard, without sounding saccharine. One of the things I loved about my husband was that he kept his promises — even stupid ones that made no difference to anyone but himself. You wanted a light bulb changed? It was going to be changed, exactly at the time he said, and it would be with the 60-watt bulb, not the 100, because … who the hell knows, he had his reasons. This punctiliousness and attention to detail meant he didn’t make promises freely, and he said “No” to life far more often than he said “Yes.” But also, this reliability was at the center of his John-ness. He lived small. But he loved deep. John couldn’t quite remember where Amy’s papers were, but he knew they were in his apartment, and I did too, since he threw out nothing. During the search I found other things I wanted to ask him about. Why did my peace-loving husband have a police summons for disorderly conduct in 2002 that he never mentioned to me? Why were there photos of him happily rowing a woman I had never heard about in a pond in Central Park, and why was she dressed as a mime? By the time I decided to ask, he could no longer speak. He had the most beautiful voice, a basso profundo, and I am glad our last conversations did not involve the police or mysterious mimes. I found the papers in about 30 seconds. He didn’t even need to tell me where he put them. I knew my husband. John died three days later, on his 86th birthday, which, since he was a fan of order and symmetry, seemed purposeful. My son Henry’s response, when I broke the news: “Well, the good news is, now you get to be the favorite parent.” In August, Henry, Gus and I will be headed to England. The cremation was super-cheap, and the container is plastic. I have gotten four Newcastle United stickers so that Henry can decorate it with his favorite team. Amy and her papers are with us, too. I will let my sons carry John, and I will carry Amy. I want her to get there safely. She has been waiting to join John for a long time, though I doubt he ever said to her, “Hey, do you want to be secretly buried in an English field in the middle of nowhere?” In my life, I have been so lucky. Though I do wonder: Is this my love story? Is it theirs? Maybe it’s ours. Judith Newman lives in New York City.

2018,He’s Got a Winning Record. So Why Do Mexican Fans Want the Coach Fired?,"PASADENA, Calif. — A few weeks ago, Juan Carlos Osorio, the coach of Mexico’s national soccer team, sat in the sunny courtyard of a Beverly Hills hotel, nursing a cup of coffee and reliving the moment in 2016 that very nearly derailed his 20-year journey from a small club on Staten Island to his first World Cup. Osorio, 57, had just presided over the most humiliating defeat in Mexico’s history, a 7-0 demolition by Chile in the quarterfinals of the Copa América, the world’s oldest international tournament. It was the sort of loss that gets a coach fired, especially in Mexico — provided Osorio didn’t quit first. [Up Next: Follow our live coverage of Mexico vs. Brazil] “I went into the locker room, splashed cold water on my face, loosened my tie and told my team, ‘If there is no trust in our work then I will go out there right now and tell everyone I resign,’” he recalled. Osorio’s players stood behind him, and, to the surprise and dismay of the Mexican fans and news media, so did the country’s soccer federation. Twelve full-time and interim coaches in 12 years were apparently enough, at least for the moment. The decision may be vindicated in the coming weeks, as El Tri, which opens play on Sunday against Germany at the 2018 World Cup, tries to advance beyond the round of 16 for the first time since 1986. Or it may not be. In which case, there’s no mystery about whom the nation will blame for another underachieving performance: their Colombian-born, United States-educated coach. Osorio has been under more or less sustained attack from the moment he was awarded the Mexico job in the fall of 2015. El Tri legends came forward like a Greek chorus to denounce the choice, mocking him as a physical trainer (which he was early in his career), putting air quotes around his “titles” and insisting that there were dozens of better options in Mexico alone. In the two and a half years since then, Osorio has won more than two-thirds of the games he has coached, and yet the chants for his ouster — “Fuera Osorio!” — have only grown louder. “If Osorio is such a good coach, why isn’t he managing the Colombian team?” said Hugo Sánchez, a former national team coach and Mexico star. Fans complain that Osorio is too analytical — “Profesor” they call him, not entirely out of respect. They wave off the many teams Osorio has beaten as second rate, and fixate on the handful of games he has lost. Most of all, they complain that he is not Mexican. “It’s a matter of identity,” Sánchez said. The relentlessly negative Mexican news media, which is given very little access to Osorio and the national team, only amplifies these complaints. “El Tri Leaves Doubts on Its Way to Russia,” was a typical headline assessing the team after it tied Wales here, 0-0, in a warm-up match recently before the Cup. Osorio has clearly reached his limit. During an interview in May and one last year in New York, he was remarkably candid about the untenability of his position. “They’re not happy with us winning,” he said. “We have to win and humiliate the opposition. There is no country in the world that keeps so much pressure on a national team coach. There is none.” As much as anything, this is a function of Mexico’s modern World Cup history. Since 1994, the team has never failed to advance out of its group. It has also never managed to win a knockout game, losing six consecutive times in the round of 16 in a highlight reel of soccer heartbreak: Mexico has gone down on penalty kicks (Bulgaria, 1994), on a botched offsides call (Argentina, 2010) and on a penalty that wasn’t (the Netherlands, 2014). It is a record of failure that in most other nations would produce a certain kind of fatalism, if only as a form of self-protection. But to Mexico’s fans, each World Cup disappointment has increased the size of the debt they feel is owed to them, and ratcheted up the heat on the team’s coach to finally collect it — to right this cosmic wrong and validate a nation’s unwavering faith. In Mexico, the blending of fantasy and reality is not just a literary tradition. “To coach Mexico you have to be sort of a magician, you have to sell illusions,” the Mexican novelist and soccer columnist Juan Villoro said. Going into this World Cup, Mexico’s fantasies may be more vivid than ever. With more than a dozen of its members playing in top leagues around Europe, the Mexico team is considered one of its best. At the same time, the quadrennial curse looms. Mexico had a punishing draw: It shares a group with the defending champion, Germany, and strong teams from Sweden and South Korea. If Mexico finishes second, a likely outcome, it probably will play Brazil, one of the most heavily favored teams to win the tournament, in the round of 16. The glare also will be unusually intense. El Tri has long been America’s Other Team: It plays most of its friendlies on American soil, selling out stadiums, such as the Rose Bowl, that the United States national team could never hope to fill. The Mexican top level league, Liga MX, routinely draws larger TV audiences than Major League Soccer or England’s Premier League. With the American team failing to qualify for the World Cup, Fox and ESPN are pouring resources into exhaustive coverage of Mexico in both English and Spanish. On top of all this, Osorio knows he is auditioning for his next job. He will almost certainly leave Mexico after the World Cup, whether by his own choice or the federation’s. “It’s not that I’m not happy with the players — I’m very happy with the players — but the environment is just unbelievable,” he said. Osorio makes no secret about his desire to coach the United States team — “that’s a job that any manager would like to have,” he said — and he is, in some respects, the perfect candidate for it. He has the international pedigree, having coached in Colombia, Mexico and even England, as an assistant at Manchester City. As a native Spanish speaker steeped in Latin America’s soccer culture, he might give the United States an edge it badly needs in the competition for young stars of Mexican descent who live in the United States and can choose to play for either national team. But Osorio also has a deep personal connection to the United States. It is where he met his wife, and where both of his teenage sons were born. He first came to the United States at age 26, after an injury cut short his playing career in Colombia and Brazil. He attended a small college in Dubuque, Iowa, but dropped out after a semester and moved to New York City. An illegal immigrant, he cobbled together a living in construction and food service. Osorio went back to school and regained his legal status, finishing his degree in exercise science and playing soccer at Southern Connecticut State University, before returning to New York to work as a personal trainer in Queens. In 1998, at age 37, he landed his first soccer job, as a conditioning coach for the now-defunct Staten Island Vipers in the United Soccer League. Over the next two decades, he bounced from country to country and from club to club, always seeking the next opportunity to coach at a higher level. As a coach, Osorio is as much a product of the United States as he is of Latin America. His high-intensity, situation-centric training sessions are modeled after a Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls practice that he managed to talk his way into during his time in Iowa. And he has tried to import some of the physicality and competitiveness of American sports culture to Mexico. He is always changing his lineup, often benching stars, both to better exploit his competition and so that his players won’t become complacent. This is another source of his unpopularity among a Mexican public that sees his refusal to commit to a single group of players as a lack of confidence in the team. Osorio has little patience for the criticism, which he considers emblematic of Mexico’s problematic attitude toward soccer. “We think we can win by just being talented; we don’t like really the competition,” Osorio says. “We are more into diving, faking and talking bad about other people, creating animosities and creating problems.” Stylistically, Osorio is everything his beloved predecessor, Miguel Herrera — last seen rolling around on the grass of the 2014 World Cup in fits of operatic fury and elation, before being fired for punching a broadcaster — was not. He takes extensive notes on the sideline in color-coded pens, quotes the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and is prone to lengthy digressions about the chemistry of the human brain. Without the pedigree of a successful playing career, the calling card for most professional soccer coaches, Osorio’s rise has been fueled by an obsessive quest to master the tactical aspects of the game. He persuaded Manchester United to allow him to observe its practices when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge there; and he not only befriended a Liverpool family whose home overlooked the team’s training ground, he moved in with them. Osorio’s players, at least, appreciate his hard-won expertise. “I call him, in a way, like a genius because they live in a completely different world than ourselves,” said Javier Hernández, the Mexican star known as Chicharito, or Little Pea. “Even if you can speak five minutes with him about one game or one player, he gives you the way he sees football and the way he sees that player, and it’s knowledge that you can learn if you want.” (Osorio stood by the players after photos and videos leaked of a party several of them attended with escorts hours after the team beat Scotland, 1-0, in its final appearance in Mexico before heading to the Cup.) After the Chile defeat, with a traumatized nation baying for his firing, Osorio went on something of an intellectual and emotional journey, consuming books about failure and humility, while seeking out other coaches who had endured devastating losses. He had his players study a video of Chile’s goals, and hired a mental coach from Spain to help them recover and prepare for this World Cup. Now, Osorio will finally have the chance to erase the loss from his and Mexico’s collective memory and maybe even break the nation’s World Cup curse. “If he can get through to the fifth game, all will be forgiven,” said Hérculez Gómez, a Mexican-American broadcaster for ESPN who played professionally in the United States and Mexico. “That’s what they’ve long yearned for.”",The New York Times
2018,High Blood Pressure at Age 50 Tied to Dementia Risk,"Even levels that do not usually require medication can increase the risk. Elevated blood pressure at age 50 is linked to an increased risk for dementia in later years, a new study reports. The research, published in the European Heart Journal, found that systolic blood pressure (the top number) as low as 130 increased the risk, even though 140 is the usual level at which treatment with blood pressure medication is recommended. The scientists measured blood pressure in 8,639 men and women in 1985, when they were age 35 to 55, and then again in 1991, 1997 and 2003 over the course of a long-term health study. Through March, 2017, there were 385 cases of dementia. After controlling for many risk factors, including stroke, heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases, they found that a systolic blood pressure at age 50 of 130 or greater was independently associated with a 38 percent increased risk of dementia. “The 140 threshold has been considered beneficial for the heart for a long time, but it might not work for the brain,” said the senior author, Archana Singh-Manoux, a research professor at Inserm, the French health research institute. “The problem with hypertension is that people don’t take their meds because they have no symptoms. I would encourage people to use their hypertensive medications.”",The New York Times
2018,High School Musicians Take On the (Almost) Unplayable,"Critic’s Notebook Tensions are said to have run a bit high during the recording of the composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton’s pathbreaking, style-blending album “Creative Orchestra Music 1976.” At the time, it was one of the Arista label’s most expensive productions, requiring multiple sessions and almost two dozen musicians. One seasoned player temporarily fled the studio after deciding that one of Mr. Braxton’s intricate parts was unplayable. You don’t expect to hear high schoolers performing music deemed unplayable by professionals. But on June 10 at the Jazz Gallery near Madison Square Park in New York, three young ensembles from the Kaufman Music Center’s Face the Music program — featuring players between the ages of 12 and 18 — will convene for a remarkable concert devoted to Mr. Braxton’s work. The program’s big band will present Composition No. 55, a showpiece from “Creative Orchestra Music 1976” that tips a hat to the work of Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, while also reveling in Mr. Braxton’s idiosyncratic vamps and quickly careening melodies. Face the Music’s improvisation collective, featuring some of the youngest students, will perform Composition No. 192, a ritualistic piece from Mr. Braxton’s “Ghost Trance Music” series. And an advanced octet will play Composition No. 69b, blended with Composition No. 108b, in accordance with Mr. Braxton’s dictum that “all compositions in my music system can be executed at the same time/moment.” (Eat your heart out, John Cage.) For Face the Music, it’s the latest iteration of a longstanding aim to delve into the music of living composers. It’s also something of a soft launch for Braxton75, a multiyear project that will see various classical and improvising groups performing his works ahead of his 75th birthday in June 2020. (Sony’s Legacy Recordings imprint celebrated his 73rd this month with a new compilation, “The Essential Anthony Braxton: The Arista Years,” including that vintage recording of Composition No. 55.) The Face the Music students and their conductor, Aakash Mittal, will be joined in performance by four artists with deep ties to Mr. Braxton: the vocalists Kyoko Kitamura and Anne Rhodes, the brass specialist Taylor Ho Bynum and the bassist Carl Testa. (The grown-ups are also scheduled to play a set of their own.) Ms. Kitamura and Mr. Testa were on hand for a recent Sunday full of rehearsals, offering pointers and encouragement. When the high schoolers needed a break from the rigors of Composition No. 55, the adult musicians talked them through Mr. Braxton’s “language music” system for improvisation. Based on a codelike series of line drawings rather than traditional notation, this approach allows any single instrumentalist — or the conductor of an ensemble — to select broad performance parameters, like staccato lines or wide-interval hops, then shape what emerges. A few students took turns leading the others in this free (yet bounded) system. Finishing her stint in front of the group, the 17-year-old electric bassist Maxwell Jensen-Moulton, a student at the Brooklyn Latin School, turned toward Ms. Kitamura and said, “I felt like I had so much power.” As Mr. Mittal prepared his students to go back into the traditionally notated Composition No. 55, he encouraged them to transition into the piece after another go at Mr. Braxton’s improvisation language. Suddenly, they were navigating the grandly stacked motifs of Composition No. 55 with greater ease. A meeting of an advanced experimentalist and even the most talented high schoolers is unusual, but Mr. Braxton seems to have planned for it decades ago. In notes for Composition No. 102 (for “Orchestra and Puppet Theater”), from 1982, Mr. Braxton said he intended “to become involved in the world of children and family-centered music” because “all of these matters are related to world change.” One of the operas in his “Trillium” cycle includes a double dutch jump rope troupe. For Mr. Mittal, the conductor, Mr. Braxton’s interest in youthful creativity and future potential is an ideal fit with the openness pursued by Face the Music, which draws students from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. “Braxton’s whole thing is, he lets other people be creators,” Mr. Mittal said. “That’s what teenagers need. That’s also what the world needs.” When a student writes a piece for “wacky instrumentation,” he added, Face the Music will work to field a new ensemble that can play it. “Students aren’t forced into some pedagogical model.” That openness also involves letting students have honest reactions to unfamiliar music — even if those reactions are, at first, unfavorable. The 16-year-old clarinetist and saxophonist Seuss Fu-Rubin’s first encounter with Mr. Braxton’s music was not love at first listen. “Not gonna lie,” he wrote in an email, “I wasn’t a huge fan when I was first introduced.” But over the three years that Mr. Fu-Rubin, a junior at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, has been studying Mr. Braxton’s works, he said he has “come to appreciate his genius and how he layers and opens up an ensemble in many different ways.” Ms. Jensen-Moulton, the bassist, described a similar journey. And she explained why experimenting with Mr. Braxton’s “language music” improvisations made other pieces better, too. “While we blend together in our other repertoire,” she wrote in an email, “‘language music’ is different every time, which improves our ability to perform as one coherent group, rather than as a dozen different instrumentalists.” This understanding of unity — pursued, in a seeming paradox, through open-ended individual expression — is at the heart of Mr. Braxton’s work. Whether it will lead to “world change” is unclear. But it seems unwise to rule anything out.",The New York Times
2018,High-Resolution Snapshot of Zika Virus Reveals Clues to Fighting It,"Trilobites Scientists have captured the clearest and most detailed image yet of Zika, the virus that set off a global health crisis in 2015 and 2016 and left thousands of babies with serious birth defects. The work could contribute to the development of more effective vaccines and treatments to combat the virus. The research, published Tuesday in the journal Structure, combined tens of thousands of two-dimensional images to construct a three-dimensional model of the virus’s structure. The team used electron microscopy, a technique that sends beams of electrons through a particle, projecting an image. The wavelengths of electrons — much shorter than that of light — are roughly the same as the distance between atoms, so scientists are able to perceive minute details. “Previous studies didn’t hit this level of granularity,” said Dr. Peter Katona, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. The result is the highest-resolution image ever captured of a virus with an envelope, or protective outer shell. By visualizing the virus in such detail, the researchers may find pockets on its surface where the drug molecules could attach. Such features may help scientists understand how vaccines and antiviral drugs could interact with Zika. “A vaccine is a key that must fit perfectly into a virus’s lock,” Dr. Katona said. “The better we know the details of the lock, the better we can design the key.” Zika is a flavivirus, a family that includes dengue and Japanese encephalitis, which are also transmitted by mosquitoes. A comparison with these viral relatives showed prominent differences at a specific region of Zika’s surface called the glycan loop. That site might determine the type of cell that a virus infects — and in turn, the symptoms it would cause. The microscopic distinctions may explain why dengue sometimes develops into a hemorrhagic fever, while Zika manifests as birth defects, for example, said Michael G. Rossmann, a microbiologist at Purdue University and one of the study’s authors. “At a lower resolution, many of these viruses just look like matching spherical balls,” said Madhumati Sevvana, the study’s lead author. “Once you zoom in, you start to see the differences in their landscapes.” The Zika virus is a strong candidate for high-resolution imaging because, compared to other flaviviruses, it is heat-resistant and remains active in varying conditions. That resilience can be detrimental to a feverish patient, but in an imaging lab, it is essential. “When a virus isn’t stable, it often falls apart on you, and you’re chasing bits and pieces of it instead of the whole thing,” Dr. Rossmann said. “Zika allowed for a homogeneous sample of a flavivirus — and when we understand one a little bit better, we understand them all a bit better.” The study’s findings likely will not have an immediate impact on disease prevention, according to Kristian G. Andersen, a genomic researcher at the Scripps Research Institute. At present, many promising Zika vaccine candidates cannot be fully tested in humans because of a decline in infections. Bioethicists are conflicted over whether to allow testing in healthy people. Development of antiviral medicines to treat patients is still in early stages, too. “Zika has only been under the microscope for the last few years,” said Duane J. Gubler, an emeritus professor of infectious disease at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “Yes, this is critical information about the structure that is going to be necessary for therapeutics down the road, but I’d add: Don’t hold your breath.”",The New York Times
2018,"Highly Educated, Very Nearsighted?","People who spent more years in school were more likely to have myopia. The more years of schooling you have, the higher your risk for nearsightedness. Observational studies have suggested a link between education and myopia. But a new study used a genetic technique called Mendelian randomization to minimize the effect of several variables and provide stronger evidence of cause and effect. Using eye examinations and questionnaires on education level, researchers used publicly available genetic data on 67,798 men and women in England, Scotland and Wales. They examined the many specific genetic variants linked to myopia and to the genetic predisposition to time spent in school, including higher I.Q. and other factors. The researchers found that although genetic predisposition was a more powerful predictor of nearsightedness, years of education were strongly and causally linked to the condition. They acknowledge that the people in their database were generally healthier than the general population, which could lead to bias. The report is in BMJ. The lead author, Dr. Denize Atan, a consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at the University of Bristol, said the mechanism is unknown but may have something to do with reduced exposure to natural daylight. “Clues from other studies suggest that children who spend more time outside are protected from the onset and progression of myopia,” she said. “One recent study found that just 11 hours a week of daylight exposure seemed to be enough to slow onset and progression.”",The New York Times
2018,Hills Ablaze Above Manchester as U.K. Wildfire Rages for 4th Day,"LONDON — A wildfire raged for a fourth day through dry grassland to the east of Manchester in the north of England on Wednesday, as Britain sweated through one of its hottest and driest summers on record. The blaze started on Sunday on Saddleworth Moor, an expanse of hills cloaked in purple heather that is popular with hikers and home to bird species including the endangered golden plover and curlew and the common red grouse. It has since spread over an area of seven square miles, and firefighters have requested help from the military. “It’s dry as a tinderbox up there,” said Brenda Warrington, leader of Tameside Council at a news briefing in the early afternoon. “A lot of wind is fanning the flames.” She said the situation was very changeable because wind had risen again in the area since the morning. Smoke from the fire could be smelled drifting over Greater Manchester, one of the largest urban areas in Britain. Southern parts of Europe have seen large expanses of dry forests ablaze during hot summer months in recent years, but large wildfires rarely hit Britain. “The scale of this fire is unprecedented, and we believe it may be the biggest in living memory,” Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, which works on preserving the highly prized landscapes, said in a statement, adding that gamekeepers who cultivated grouse on the moor for shooting had usually kept the risk under control. “Keepers are acutely aware of the risk of wildfire at this time of year and are used to dealing with fires quickly,” she said. More than 100 firefighters were at work with a total of 29 engines, according to a statement from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, which said it had help from neighboring fire services and a helicopter from the local water company. Dave Keelan, the service’s assistant chief fire officer, said in the statement: “We have been liaising with a military adviser on the scene and following those discussions we have requested military assistance from the Ministry of Defense and those discussions are ongoing.” Another fire service spokesman, Leon Parkes, said at the briefing that the fire was in four different areas of moorland, and embedded in peat, making it extremely hard to extinguish. Officials said they were hoping for heavy rain, but the long-term forecast was not promising, suggesting at least 10 more days of warm, dry weather. According to the fire service, 34 homes were evacuated as a precaution on Tuesday, with residents allowed back on Wednesday. Four schools were closed on Wednesday, however, because of concerns about smoke. Britain has been in drought conditions for the better part of two months, with temperatures regularly reaching 86 degrees Fahrenheit — well above average — and nearing records in some areas, especially in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The unusually dry and hot weather prompted a health warning in Manchester, where heat wave conditions were expected to continue. Britain has 75 percent of the heather moorlands in the world, according to the Moorland Association. The fire has so far destroyed some 2,000 acres of Saddleworth Moor, The Associated Press reported.",The New York Times
2018,Hillsborough Police Commander Faces Trial in 95 Soccer Deaths,"LONDON — Nearly three decades after the worst stadium disaster in the history of British soccer, a police commander will face 95 counts of manslaughter in the deaths of soccer fans who were trampled and crushed at a match in England in 1989, prosecutors said on Friday. The decision by a judge to proceed to trial in the case of David Duckenfield represents the latest victory in a long quest for justice by the families of the dead, who included 37 teenagers. Mr. Duckenfield, then a chief superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police, was in charge of security for the match. More than 700 people were injured in the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, which emerged as a political flash point over the role of wealth and class in British life. For many years, the authorities, with the support of some news organizations, sought to suggest that the fans were largely responsible for their own deaths. The families of the victims and survivors fiercely rejected those claims. They were vindicated in 2016, when a two-year inquest found that the fans had been “unlawfully killed.” David Cameron, then the British prime minister, said in response to the inquest that he was “profoundly sorry for the double injustice” of losing loved ones and then being told they had been responsible for their own deaths. The inquest cited errors and omissions by the police in planning and executing security for a crucial match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15, 1989, and left prosecutors to decide whether to file charges against the police. The Crown Prosecution Service filed charges last June against six people, including Mr. Duckenfield. On Friday, the judge, Peter Openshaw, said at Preston Crown Court that the case against Mr. Duckenfield and four others could proceed, lifting an 18-year-old legal order that would have prevented prosecution. “The C.P.S. will now continue preparations for the trial of David Duckenfield on 95 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence,” said Sue Hemming, the head of the service’s special crime and counterterrorism division. Graham Henry Mackrell, a former secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, the soccer club that operates Hillsborough Stadium, will face charges of violating safety laws. Three others — Peter Metcalf, who was a lawyer for South Yorkshire Police, and two high-ranking police officers at the time, Donald Denton and Alan Foster, will face trial on charges of perverting justice. The trial of Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Mackrell is scheduled to begin on Sept. 10, according to court documents, and the other three men will face trial in 2019, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. A decision on whether to lift an order that would prevent prosecution of another senior police officer, Norman Bettison, was delayed until Aug. 21. Ninety-six people perished in the tragedy, when the police opened a gate in a misguided effort to alleviate overcrowding outside the stadium. Manslaughter charges could not be filed in one fatality, that of Tony Bland, who died after spending nearly four years in a vegetative state, because too much time had passed between the events at the stadium and his death.",The New York Times
2018,"His Father Took On the Mob. ‘They Will Try to Kill You,’ Bobby Kennedy Said.","As a reference librarian at the New York Public Library, Matthew J. Boylan, 58, spends his days fielding questions from the public on Ask N.Y.P.L., the library’s call-in information line. Even in the age of Google, Mr. Boylan’s role as researcher for the public remains vital, from barroom bets, to questions about eviction from older tenants, to children asking why the sky is blue. Calls that get routed to his desk, at the library’s venerable main branch at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, often reflect the trends of the moment: big news stories, big books or films coming out, royal weddings. Lately, questions have come in about a new Martin Scorsese film in the works, “The Irishman,” and Mr. Boylan has had to explain that the movie partly involves the notorious disappearance of the Teamsters boss, James R. Hoffa, in 1975, which has long been suspected of being a mob hit organized by Tony Provenzano, a Genovese mob capo, and others. Questions about Mr. Provenzano — or Mr. Hoffa, for that matter — get Mr. Boylan recalling his father, Matthew P. Boylan, a distinguished lawyer and prosecutor who died in 2009. “Whenever these things come up, it really gets me thinking about my father,” Mr. Boylan said. “Especially around Father’s Day. I miss him a lot — his advice, his perspective.” In the early 1960s, when the older Mr. Boylan was an assistant United States attorney in New Jersey working for the Department of Justice, which was run by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, he successfully prosecuted Mr. Provenzano in a high-profile federal racketeering case. The case was of keen interest to Mr. Kennedy, who had previously pursued both Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Provenzano. Mr. Boylan even listed Mr. Kennedy as a possible witness. As it happens, the younger Mr. Boylan has also been fielding calls at the library lately about Mr. Kennedy since this month is the 50th anniversary of his assassination. For some, Father’s Day might recall tender moments tossing a ball with dad or riding bikes or going for ice cream. But for the younger Mr. Boylan, the holiday prompts more hard-boiled reflections of the time his father, a young, strait-laced, Harvard-educated prosecutor, became involved in a harrowing extortion trial that was daunting for the entire family. For the younger Mr. Boylan, the trial played out when he was a small boy, and it remains a formative event in his life and career. On his desk at the library this week was a family prize: a signed photograph of Mr. Kennedy with a personal inscription to the older Mr. Boylan: “With appreciation and high regards.” “For Kennedy at the time, this trial was Priority One — it was personal,” Mr. Boylan said. “He would have my father call him, or fly to Washington, for updates throughout the trial. One of my earliest memories was seeing my father getting off a government plane at Newark Airport and having his hat blown straight down the runway.” Mr. Provenzano — known widely as Tony Pro — strong-armed his way to power in the crime-ridden Teamsters union, with a violent approach to campaigning and a knack for making enemies disappear. During the trial, the judge sequestered the jittery jury in a hotel, where two suspicious fires were set, though they caused no real damage. A rival of Mr. Provenzano was found shot to death in Hoboken, N.J., before he could testify against him. “The original choice for prosecutor was so frightened, he had a heart attack,” Mr. Boylan said. “Then Robert Kennedy called my father and warned him: ‘You know they will try to kill you, Matt.’” Mr. Kennedy’s pursuit of Teamsters corruption began in the 1950s, when as chief counsel to the Senate Rackets Committee, he questioned Mr. Provenzano, who continually invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer. “Tony Pro took the Fifth 44 times,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in an interview, recalling his mother, Ethel Kennedy, bringing him to the hearings as a child to watch his father question Mr. Hoffa and a series of alleged mobsters. The younger Mr. Kennedy said his father’s interest in the Provenzano trial unfolding in Newark would have been “right in character” with his habit of keeping a hand in local prosecutions of mob activity and union corruption around the country. “He was personally involved and hands-on, encouraging the local guys on the front lines of fighting the mob,” Mr. Kennedy said. “He wanted to encourage them and make sure they were operating strategically. He liked young, tough guys willing to stand up for what they believed in.” The older Mr. Boylan was 31 during the trial, a few years out of Harvard Law School, and did not back down to Tony Pro’s intimidation tactics. The younger Mr. Boylan said that, as a young child, he found a handgun in his father’s sock drawer that, in an unusual move, the F.B.I. issued to the prosecutor for protection. “Provenzano sent goons to our house to bang on our door in the middle of the night, to put fear into us,” Mr. Boylan recalled. Mr. Provenzano, a stocky former amateur boxer, was quoted in The New York Herald Tribune as saying of Mr. Boylan, “He’s a good boy, but when two fighters get in the ring, one has to win and one has to lose. And they both have to fight as hard as they can.” Mr. Provenzano, a second-in-command ally of Mr. Hoffa in the Teamsters, was convicted in the 1963 extortion trial and sent to a federal prison where Mr. Hoffa was also taken after a jury tampering conviction. The two men became rivals there, which helped lead, years later, to Mr. Provenzano becoming a key figure in Mr. Hoffa’s disappearance, which was never solved. Other news coverage of Mr. Provenzano’s trial included columns by Jimmy Breslin for The New York Herald Tribune that described Mr. Provenzano taking his union-owned Cadillac to court and wearing a sharkskin suit, a diamond pinkie ring and a gold watch. “He does not talk too well but you do not need an elocution course to run a Teamsters union,” Mr. Breslin wrote. “You need muscle, and Tony has plenty of that.” Shortly before Mr. Boylan died, he heard Mr. Breslin single him out by name, in citing the Tony Pro case as one of the best trials he covered in his long newspaper career. “I’m glad my father got to hear that,” the younger Mr. Boylan said, adding that his father was heartbroken when Mr. Kennedy was assassinated and devoted himself throughout his career to public service. Like father, like son. The younger Mr. Boylan, who studied history at Columbia University and graduated from Duke University School of Law, left behind a law career to enjoy a wider realm of research for the public. “That case colored my father’s career, and it never left me either,” he said. “So I’ve spent my career doing public-spirited research for other people, as a direct consequence of what arose out of my father’s experience working for Robert Kennedy and putting away Tony Pro.”",The New York Times
2018,"Hochul Takes Helm of New York Senate, to Republican Displeasure","ALBANY — For the last week, Kathy Hochul has been waiting to take her place as presiding officer of the State Senate, a position she rightfully holds as the state’s lieutenant governor and the chamber’s president. On Tuesday, she did exactly that, hoping to help her fellow Democrats — a vote shy of the majority — wrench legislative concessions and potentially damaging votes out of the majority Republicans. But the greeting she got was far from affectionate. For the third time in a week, the Senate lurched into a morass of parliamentary and political posturing, as Republicans engineered a rare veto override, and Democrats countered with a renewed push for consideration of bills on reproductive rights, leading to several Republican senators to sharply criticize Ms. Hochul’s handling of the chamber. The Senate’s recent dysfunction is rooted in simple math and base emotion: The 63-seat chamber is missing a senator, Thomas D. Croci, a Long Island Republican, who has left to return to military service in the Navy. The chamber’s 31 Democrats, long in the minority, want to take control. The chamber’s 30 Republicans, helped along by a rogue Democrat, have desperately tried to fend off Democratic attempts to assert their power. Both sides are now a vote short of the 32 needed to pass bills. Last Wednesday, for example, Republicans set aside the calendar for the day rather than consider the reproductive rights bills as Ms. Hochul stood in the wings. A day after that, they adjourned as Ms. Hochul appeared in the chamber, perhaps fearing her power to cast a tiebreaking vote, something the State Constitution suggests she can do but which Republicans dispute. And on Tuesday, they used a barrage of parliamentary objections — sometimes angrily articulated — to try to correct Ms. Hochul, who was coached through her appearance on the rostrum by a nearby lawyer, and to confound Democratic attempts to again pass their bills. All of which created some unusual, and often ungainly, scenes in the Senate chamber. The Republicans’ floor leader, State Senator John DeFrancisco, managed to successfully offer up a motion to override a recent veto by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of a Democrat-sponsored bill to expand kindergarten programs; the maneuver seemed calculated to force Ms. Hochul to oversee a legislative rebuke of her boss. The veto override, the first by the Senate in Mr. Cuomo’s seven-plus years in office, passed unanimously, but will not be taken up by the Democrat-dominated Assembly. (The Assembly and Mr. Cuomo’s office noted that such an expansion had been addressed in the state budget completed in March.) That minor drama was followed by another attempt by Democrats to attach the reproductive rights bills to unrelated legislation, pushing for a vote on a political wedge issue in an election year in which some moderate suburban Republicans may be imperiled. The amendments were initially allowed, but Republican leaders then grew agitated as a Democratic sponsor, Senator Liz Krueger, rose to speak on the bill, recognized by Ms. Hochul. The Republican leader, John J. Flanagan of Long Island, objected, telling Ms. Hochul that Ms. Krueger’s comments were out of order, after asking the lieutenant governor to adjust her microphone. Ms. Krueger attempted to speak again, and Mr. DeFrancisco interjected. “This is inappropriate to start a discussion about the bill, which has already been amended,” the senator said, after mentioning rules of the chamber that “have been here a lot longer than we have been.” Ms. Hochul said she disagreed, saying that as presiding officer, she had recognized Ms. Krueger and would hear her speak. “Then we can finish the business of the people, which is what everyone in the state would like to see occur,” she said. Mr. DeFrancisco persisted, his voice becoming pinched, saying he was giving her “one last opportunity to do what you’re supposed to do.” Moments later, Senator Joseph A. Griffo, a Republican from the Utica area who often serves as presiding officer, also criticized Ms. Hochul. “You can’t pick and choose rules that you want to enforce,” the senator said, pointing at Senate rules. Finally, Mr. DeFrancisco rescinded his majority’s acceptance of the amendment, as Democrats questioned the Republicans’ treatment of Ms. Hochul. “To speak so disrespectfully — and, to me, in a demeaning tone — to the lieutenant governor, who happened to be the presiding officer, who happens to be a woman, really took my breath away,” said Senator Shelley Mayer, one of two newly elected Democrats who have left that party just shy of the majority. She said that she and other female legislators felt that Republicans were trying to intimidate Ms. Hochul. Republicans, however, did not see the exchanges in that light. “Today’s not the first day that anybody’s voice has been raised,” said Mr. Flanagan, after the chamber adjourned late Tuesday. “And let’s be really crystal clear: A fifth-grade reading of the rules demonstrates that every point that was raised was a valid point of order.” He added, “And if I need to raise my voice to make the point we have rules for a reason, I’m going to do so, and I’m not going to apologize for it.” Moments after that, Ms. Hochul also said that she was not backing down, saying she was fighting for women’s rights, and her own, though it wasn’t clear if she would preside when the Senate convened again on Wednesday. “This is not something new to me,” she said, adding it wasn’t about her. “I can handle anything.”",The New York Times

2018,Holly Hunter Stretches Into Her Superhero Powers,"A Word With In 2004, Holly Hunter punched her way into “The Incredibles,” the Pixar-Disney superhero film that grossed some $630 million worldwide and won an Oscar for best animated feature. Fourteen years later, she’s back in “Incredibles 2,” now showing to rave reviews, and displaying no signs of wear and tear. As the ultra-bendy, wallop-packing Elastigirl — undercover identity: Helen Parr, wife of Bob and mother of Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack — Ms. Hunter acts and sounds as if all the previous super-excitement happened but a minute ago, in a scenario that picks up where the original film ended. Albeit revved up with an eye-popping costume, a midcentury-modern mansion and an enviably sleek motorcycle. “Incredibles 2” gives Helen a feminist story line that boots her into the field to fight crime and relegitimize superheroes, while leaving her hubby (Craig T. Nelson) at home to tend to chores and kids. Including their infant’s nascent superpowers. It also keeps Ms. Hunter — who broke through in 1987 with the Coen brothers’ “Raising Arizona” before winning a 1994 Oscar for “The Piano”; she was also nominated for “Broadcast News,” “The Firm” and “Thirteen” — in the spotlight, to the delight of fans. More recently, she has played the mother of an ailing grad student with a Pakistani-American romantic interest in “The Big Sick,” and a mother embarking on a great experiment with four children of different races, three of them adopted, in HBO’s now-canceled “Here and Now.” In a phone interview from New York, the famously private Ms. Hunter spoke about Elastigirl’s latest incarnation, the state of her career and a milestone birthday while quipping about her family — “I shall neither confirm nor deny the existence of my children” — and even the neighborhood she lives in. “You can say that I’m moving to St. Marks Place between Second and Third,” she said. “I’m totally kidding but that would be kind of cool advertising. Wow, Hunter’s so hip!” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Where do we find the Parr family this time around? I think it’s so funny that the movie starts 30 seconds after the first one ends. And I also think that it’s a fun thing that there is such a revelation at the end of the first “Incredibles,” with our child Jack-Jack, who manifests his superpowers 30,000 feet up in the air with the bad guy. We don’t know that he has superpowers, so at the beginning of “Incredibles 2” the parents are still in the dark about what that youngest son is capable of. Elastigirl gets a story line perfectly suited to the current zeitgeist. Does the director, Brad Bird, have crystal-ball superpowers? Yeah, the timing is rather impeccable. This was obviously a long time coming so Brad was thinking about what story he wanted to tell, where he wanted the family to evolve to. We’re just lucky. But it’s a wonderful thing because Mrs. Incredible, in the first movie, was a real reluctant hero. She was into being a mother and loved the domestic life. So this is really fun to see her revel in her own autonomy, in her own independence, in her own kind of private life. It really is a room of one’s own for Mrs. Incredible. What about the improvements in the animation itself? The articulation that the animators have at their disposal is, yeah, the word is radical. I remember when we were doing “The Incredibles” that they were having an unbelievably challenging time trying to figure out how to make Violet’s hair move so that she could hide behind it. It was, animation-wise, uncharted territory and so they had to solve that. Now I think that’s nothing. One of the amazing things about Pixar is that the animators have full carte blanche to create. It’s not like they are mirroring what I do or what Craig T. Nelson does or Sam Jackson. The world is their oyster and they are exploiting it. “Here and Now,” the series created by Alan Ball, wasn’t renewed after its first season. At any point did you have a sense of foreboding? Alan is a real artist, and when we all took “Here and Now,” it was based on the pilot and Alan. So there was nothing really known about where the story was going to progress. That was a discovery process for the actors. In no way did I ever feel that for whatever reasons the series would not be picked up. I totally thought that it would. Are you actively searching for something new? Always. Always on the hunt. I live up to my last name but, you know, my last name could also be Drifter. Instead of a Hunter-Gatherer, I’m a Hunter-Drifter. I get stuff and I normally say no to stuff, and at the same time that’s a bit of a crap shoot. It’s not like you’re getting a royal flush very often. You work with what you’ve got. You turned 60 in March. How’s that? I’m certainly aware of my own mortality in a way that I wasn’t when I turned 50. You’ve moved one step closer. It’s like wow, it’s a big chapter. And at the same time, I feel that there’s a lot of power that women have available to them now in a way that maybe we never have had. And granted, we’re operating at a deficit, and a steep deficit, just in terms of how many roles there are for women, how many studio executives are women, how many directors, how many grips, gaffers — you know, we’re heavily deficient in all of those areas. At the same time, I feel hopeful. And I don’t feel utterly foolish for the hopefulness because I think strides are being made. A 2013 Atlantic story was titled, “20 Years After ‘The Piano,’ We’ve All Failed Holly Hunter,” about the lack of leading roles that have come your way. Do you feel like we’ve failed you? [Laughs] I mean, I can’t really comment on another article. You would have to ask John Q. Public about have they failed me. I think that’s a question for the public and I’m interested in hearing what they have to say. He, she, it. There are also rumors of your “resurgence.” Are you riding a comeback? It makes sense that people think about a career in those terms. There are exceptions, and those exceptions are the people that the public is most familiar with, where you’re talking about people who are almost superstars. But for the rest of us — and I certainly include myself in that group — I’m a working actress and so there are times when, yes, I’m unemployed and, yes, I do things that don’t take off, that maybe they don’t even reach an audience. Doing movies that don’t get distribution is something that’s not uncommon out there in the industry at this moment. Or if I do a play, I kind of fall out of the greater public consciousness. A lot of people won’t have seen any of these projects and therefore can feel that I’m not working or I’ve got a lower profile. But the fact is I’m still answering whatever challenges that those particular projects present to me. I’m still going, I’m still working and I’ve still got a process that’s happening. I’m still the little engine that could.",The New York Times
2018,Home Is Where the Horror Is,"What happens when your family is what frightens you? A renaissance in terrifying movies skips jump scares in favor of dread based on adult fears. CreditCreditMark Pernice In “Hereditary,” bugs crawl from decapitated heads, ghosts lurk in the shadows and an artist tries to communicate with the dead. But the most jarring moment of this terrifying new movie might be when Annie, a mother played by Toni Collette, tells her son she never wanted to have him and tried to induce a miscarriage. Then she wakes from this nightmare, unsettled by the thoughts rattling in her subconscious. Parental guilt is the real monster here. Moving into territory once the preserve of prestige dramas, horror has never been more bankable and celebrated than it is right now. And while evil clowns and serial killers at sorority houses still haunt young viewers (and make tons of money), we’re in the midst of a golden age of grown-up horror. Hushed and character-driven, this mix of indie fare and blockbusters works ferociously on adult anxieties in an age of dislocation. These movies have confronted liberal racism, economic worries and family dysfunction; and while horror has always reflected the social and political concerns of its day, if you had to pinpoint a unifying theme that distinguishes this renaissance, it’s the ominous danger of overwhelming grief. A character coping with the death of a loved one is the new car of teenagers heading to a cabin in the woods. It’s the starting point of “Hereditary,” “Goodnight Mommy” and “Pyewacket,” to name just a few movies from the last three years. Then there’s the subgenre of apocalyptic movies (like “It Comes at Night”), whose narratives revolve around coping with the vanishing not of one person, but possibly all of them. “A Quiet Place,” the horror blockbuster of the year, belongs to both categories. Directed by John Krasinski, it’s an end-of-the-world movie about unstoppable monsters that appear to have wiped out most of humanity, but the engine of the story is a sibling’s ill-advised decision that leads to the murder of her brother, fracturing and haunting the family. “Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s triumphant debut of 2017, does not begin with mourning, but the inability to process grief is a critical theme. Though liberal racism is the source of the main character’s terror, what allows him to be hypnotized, rendered frozen and helpless in “the sunken place,” is the memory of his mother’s death and his guilt over not doing more to save her. None of these movies are sequels or remakes, and most of them come from the singular perspective of writer-directors pursuing their vision, not a studio pumping out product. They feature the usual preoccupations of horror — supernatural evil, gore, creepy basements — but they also evoke the poet Anne Carson’s answer to the question, Why does tragedy exist? “Because you are full of rage. Why are you full of rage? Because you are full of grief.” For most of its history, horror was considered kids’ stuff. The publisher of the first major fanzine dedicated to scary movies — the influential Famous Monsters of Filmland — gave his editor one instruction at its start in 1958: I’m 11 and a half years old. Make me laugh. The reputation of scary movies started to change in the late 1960s and 1970s, when a new breed of ambitious filmmakers pushed to make them darker, more realistic and mature. (See “The Exorcist” or “Don’t Look Now.”) While many of the films from this era explored the tensions of the generation gap, they were typically on the side of the younger counterculture. The poster for Wes Craven’s “The Last House on the Left” (1972) warned: “not recommended for persons over 30.” In the following decades, the business of horror expanded and became more diverse, as the genre shed its disreputable image, gaining more respect from critics and even attention from the Academy Awards. These days, the scary movies that dominate the discussion in popular culture are more likely to try to make adults tremble than children giggle. “Hereditary,” opening June 8, is the apotheosis of this trend, a visually ambitious and ruthlessly disturbing supernatural story that is also an intricate meditation on mourning. It begins with a family late for the funeral of its matriarch. Everyone appears dry-eyed if not indifferent about the passing, the first sign something is off. After delivering a halfhearted eulogy for her mother, Annie asks her husband (played with grave unease by Gabriel Byrne): “Should I be sadder?” Like comedy, horror is drawn to transgression, as both a short-term shock and a cathartic outlet for repressed emotions. There’s no one right way to mourn the death of a loved one, but this movie provides a litany of wrong ways. When Annie’s son, a sulking, withdrawn teenager played with hollow eyes by Alex Wolff, witnesses an act of unspeakable violence, instead of screaming or calling the police, he freezes, silent, then heads home, goes to sleep and tells no one. A quirk of most horror movies is that the people in them tend to move on from violence much quicker than they do in real life, in part because they need to (no time to pay your respects when a sociopath is chasing you) but also because of the mechanics of scary movies: Horror directors like to keep frights at a brisk pace. But “Hereditary” turns the teenager’s denial into the subject of the scare, making the lack of sustained response to death appear chilling, even another kind of death. Something seems inexorable about the miseries that befall this family. Annie is an artist who creates tableaux in miniature houses, which the camera lingers on, at one point segueing seamlessly into a scene of the real house. The implication is clear: These people are minor players in a drama they have little control over. Children are familiar with this kind of helplessness, but this movie suggests that adults have just as little agency, and works on the fear that has set off so many midlife crises: the sense you are turning into your parents. “Hereditary” is an apt companion piece to “The Babadook,” the terrific debut of the Australian director Jennifer Kent that more than any other film sparked the ascendance of grown-up horror. That 2014 movie presented another mother in tumult, haunted by the death of a loved one, in this case, her husband, who died in a car crash just before she was to give birth to their son. In another performance that veers from vulnerable to terrifying, Essie Davis plays a woman whose resentment of her boy manifests itself in something existentially menacing. It’s a movie that turns on the unspoken anxiety that you don’t love your own child. Terrifying parental figures have long been a boogeyman of great scary stories, from “Psycho” to “Carrie” to “The Stepfather,” but these new movies are as likely to show us the perspective of the unhinged mother as her child, and the dynamics of their relationship are often complex. In “Goodnight Mommy” (2015), the mother, whose head is wrapped in bandages, initially comes off as a figure of terror to her twin boys, before they switch positions. And in “Pyewacket,” a recent indie gem, the contentious mother-daughter relationship is rooted in such heartbreaking realism that it evokes “Lady Bird,” plus witchcraft. “Pyewacket’s” single mom angrily tells her teenager she hates seeing her face, which is generous compared to what the mother in “The Witch” (2016) tells her daughter: “You reek of evil.” Sexual voyeurism and exploitation have long been hallmarks of horror, but they are relatively absent in grown-up horror. “It Follows,” which centers on a world of teenagers, does play on the old formula of sex leading to death (see “Halloween,” a movie it evokes with beautifully gliding camerawork and synthesizer sound). But this movie has none of the titillation or theatrical kills of a slasher picture; it’s deliberate, melancholy and deceptively layered. Like “Don’t Breathe,” one of the finest horror movies of recent years, “It Follows” is set in a hollowed-out Detroit, a pointed nod to our insecure era of massive economic and technological disruption. Horror often takes place in isolated settings like the woods or space, and the empty streets of a once bustling city work just as well, evoking a vanished world wiped out not by zombies or aliens, but by globalism. Its story, about a teenage girl, Jay, stalked by killers after sleeping with the wrong person, is more of a metaphor for sexual assault than a cautionary tale. And the killers are stumbling human monsters who often take the form of the victims’ parents. Like the found-footage or torture-porn genres before them, grown-up horror movies frequently lean on a high concept, but they are far more likely to blur the line between scary movie and bleak drama. Not only are there few jump cuts, but the camera work is also intentionally slow. Silence often operates the way the violins do in “Jaws,” as a warning that something sinister awaits. “A Quiet Place” and “Don’t Breathe” are both movies about keeping quiet to avoid unstoppable blind killers, making anything but silence equal murder. And in a family dinner scene in “Hereditary,” all the sound cuts out except the clatter of silverware, which seems like the final blows of a bloody sword fight. Though horror has a long history of setting up scares with jokes, in these films, the mood is relentlessly grim. There has been a backlash to such character-driven restraint among the horror faithful. On his podcast, the novelist Bret Easton Ellis, a genre fan who has been critical of what he calls “indie art house horror,” argued that the “The Babadook” was not really horror at all but a tidy psychological drama. In an interview with Jason Blum, the most influential producer of horror today (“Get Out,” “Split” and more), Mr. Ellis said too much logical explanation can be ruinous, rightly grasping that ambiguity can mean more scares. Mr. Blum pushed back, saying his films must be rooted in a coherent reality. Before finishing any project, he said, he tries an exercise: “Let’s take out all the scares. Would it work as a drama?” This is a very different attitude from that of past horror impresarios, and illustrates an aesthetic divide. No one wants to see “Halloween” or “Alien” without the scares. Mr. Ellis hinted at a concern that many fans, including myself, have about the growing respectability of the genre. Now that horror attracts better actors, bigger budgets and meatier scripts, there is a sense of fun missing in some of the tasteful scary movies. Has horror lost some of its disreputable pleasures, not to mention its single-minded determination to terrify? But this ignores another major trend, how radically horror has expanded and diversified. To take one example, for a genre that has been dominated by male directors, there are more female directors leading prominent scary movies than ever before. Ms. Kent and Julia Ducournau, who directed the lurid French cannibal tale “Raw,” are two of the most exciting new voices in the field. In the first horror movie to speak to the #MeToo era, Natalia Leite’s “M.F.A.” (2017) applied a gritty realistic view to a story of sexual assault on campus, while Coralie Fargeat’s new “Revenge” has turned a stylish female gaze on the rape-revenge genre. Part of the reason horror has long targeted young viewers is that it’s harder to scare adults. We have seen too much, including other scary movies. But that experience can be used against us. H.P. Lovecraft famously wrote that the strongest kind of fear was that of the unknown. But the older you get, the less unknown there is. Vampires, werewolves and zombies don’t frighten like they once did. But ghosts still do — when they remind us of what we have lost. 5 Directors to watch These filmmakers are shaking up the genre with hushed, character-driven movies. After making waves with the 2011 short film “The Strange Thing About the Johnsons,” a family drama that went into taboo territory, Mr. Aster, now 31, has delivered his first feature, “Hereditary,” a bleak freak-out that could be described as “Ordinary People” meets “The Omen,” with a little “Shining” thrown in. THE EARLY YEARS “I started by writing screenplays,” Mr. Aster said by phone. “By the time I graduated high school, I had four features that I had written and haven’t read since.” THE INSPIRATION “I wanted to make a sorrowful family tragedy that degenerated into a nightmare in the way that life can feel like a nightmare when things fall apart.” WHY HORROR? “If you make this film, where everything doesn’t turn out to be all right, as a drama, then good luck finding financing. But what’s a deterrent to an audience in one genre suddenly becomes a virtue in another.” INFLUENCES Growing up, he loved “Rosemary’s Baby,” “Don’t Look Now” and “The Innocents.” Of recent films, his personal favorite is the South Korean film “The Wailing,” which “takes as many genres as possible and mashes them together in the most coherent way.” Where to watch: In theaters starting June 8. A native of Uruguay, Mr. Álvarez, now 40, directed the 2016 breakout hit “Don’t Breathe.” Though it wasn’t his first horror feature (that would be the much-debated reboot of “The Evil Dead”), the tale of young thieves who make a deadly mistake when they invade a blind veteran’s home took unexpected twists and, in a horror rarity, featured a disabled lead character. GROWN-UP TASTES Mr. Álvarez said adult horror may be having a moment because directors working now were teenagers when they first binged on films from modern horror’s golden age. “Those filmmakers go back to the late ’70s and mid-’80s, and that’s a time when horror became interesting,” he said. SLAPSTICK, NOT SLASHERS “Don’t Breathe” was inspired more by “Home Alone” than any single horror film, Mr. Álvarez said. “It’s about running to the window, and the man who invaded your home is still there,” he said. “It’s the same logic.” FACING FEARS “I’m interested in how much time we spend worried about things that statistically won’t happen to you, yet we’re afraid,” Mr. Álvarez said. “There’s a noise in the living room, and you find someone in your house. How many people does that actually happen to?” Where to stream or rent “Don’t Breathe.” This 29-year-old Texas-born filmmaker wowed critics in 2016 with his debut feature, “Krisha,” a domestic drama with serious horror undertones. He plunged full-on into horror with his 2017 follow-up, “It Comes at Night,” about a family walled up in a house in the woods facing a mysterious threat. THE INSPIRATION Images came to Mr. Shults over the years: a house in the middle of nowhere, a family, another family. But none of it clicked. “Then I lost my biological father to cancer,” he said. After a rough relationship in which they didn’t see each other for about a decade, “I went to him on his deathbed when he was full of regrets, and I just tried to help him find peace,” he said. “I wrote ‘It Comes at Night’ after that in a dark mental head space, full of grief.” WHAT’S SO SCARY The fear of the unknown is at the root of “It Comes,” Mr. Shults said. “The threat per se is never revealed in the movie, and it’s more about what this fear does to people.” WHAT HE WATCHED GROWING UP A lot of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron. “The first time I saw ‘Aliens,’ I snuck it and kept watching it all night. Then I realized the sun was rising, my dad was waking up, and I had to turn it off and act like I actually went to bed.” Where to stream or rent “It Comes at Night.” The victims in “It Follows” see their menacing stalkers, but almost nobody saw Mr. Mitchell’s 1980s-throwback terror tale becoming the hit it did three years ago. He’s following that with “Under the Silver Lake,” a puzzle-filled homage to film noir starring Andrew Garfield. SEX EFFECTS In the infection-horror film tradition, “It Follows” was a macabre parable of a “supernatural S.T.D.,” as one critic wrote. Though Mr. Mitchell, who was 40 when the film debuted, shied away from explaining the film, he told MovieMaker magazine that “we’re all dealing with our mortality on some level. Sex and love are some of the ways that we’re able to push it away.” LEISURELY EVIL Mr. Mitchell has said an inspiration for the strolling creatures in “It Follows” was the “slow-moving threat” in “Creature From the Black Lagoon” (1954), one of his favorite horror films: “It’s literally this animal, and we just witness what it does and how people react to it,” he told the io9 website. Where to stream or rent “It Follows.” In 2014, Ms. Kent put a terrifying spin on horror’s maniac-mother tradition with “The Babadook,” about a mom who fights a malicious figure awakened from her son’s storybook. Next for this Australian director, who doesn’t reveal her age, is the thriller “The Nightingale,” set in 19th-century Tasmania. SCARES AND SORROW A meditation on grief, “The Babadook” won over more than horror fans with its “interlocking ambiguities,” as A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. William Friedkin, the director of “The Exorcist,” said on Twitter he’d “never seen a more terrifying film.” THE UNDERLYING GOAL “I latched onto this idea of facing the darkness,” Ms. Kent told The Times in 2014. “I wanted to tell the story of a woman who was forced to face the unfaceable.” INFLUENCES Ms. Kent has cited early horror cinema as inspiration, especially “The Fall of the House of Usher” (1928). But to her “The Babadook” defies the horror label. “I didn’t think about genre when I made this film,” she explained to The Washington Post in 2014. “And I certainly didn’t think of it as a horror film.” Where to stream or rent “The Babadook.”",The New York Times
2018,"Homer A. Neal, Leader in Physics Who Explored Matter, Dies at 75","Homer A. Neal, a physicist who helped shape education for physics undergraduates nationwide and led teams that took part in the hunt for the fundamental particles of matter, died on May 23 in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 75. Dr. Neal had a stroke in February from which he never recovered, his wife, Donna Jean Neal, said. He died at the University of Michigan Hospital. A longtime professor at the university, Dr. Neal ran groups there that were involved in finding the top quark and the Higgs boson, the last remaining particles — or building blocks of matter — that were ascribed to the Standard Model of physics, a best-guess description of the subatomic world. Put forward in the 1970s, the Standard Model theorized the existence of a dozen types of matter-related particles, including so-called quarks and leptons, and different types of force-related particles. By the mid-1990s, all the quarks had been accounted for experimentally except the top quark, and by the early 2010s, the main remaining unproved ingredient was the Higgs boson, named after the British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs. Experimental particle physics is a team effort, and more than 5,000 scientists from around the world were involved in observing what they believed to be the Higgs boson, the particle that explains why some other elementary particles have mass, Dr. Bradford Orr, a colleague of Dr. Neal’s at Michigan, said. Dr. Neal led a Michigan team of 40 faculty members, research scientists and students on the Atlas project, one of two experiments at the world’s largest particle accelerator at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The Atlas work led to the observation of the Higgs boson in 2012. In 2013, the scientists who predicted it were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. The existence of the Higgs boson was deduced when particles were made to collide at incredible speeds in the accelerator. It existed for a vanishingly small amount of time before it decayed into a different type of particle. The Michigan group played a lead role in analyzing this decay and in the conclusion that it had indeed existed, Dr. Orr said. Dr. Neal also led Michigan’s team in researching the top quark, whose existence had been only theorized until an international group of about 1,500 physicists was able to produce it in 1995 in the federal Department of Energy’s Fermilab particle accelerator. Here, too, the Michigan group analyzed the decay of particles. In perhaps his most prominent non-research role, in the mid-1980s, Dr. Neal led the first committee to examine undergraduate science, math and engineering programs for the National Science Board, which sets policies for the National Science Foundation. The committee found that science education was so poor that it posed “a grave long-term threat” to the nation. Among other recommendations, it asked that the foundation provide undergraduates with real-world opportunities for research. From that recommendation came the foundation’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which now enrolls more than 9,000 students a year. Dr. Neal also started a summer internship and semester abroad program at Michigan, allowing a few dozen American students to work at CERN every year. Such work experiences are now crucial for students applying to graduate schools, Dr. Orr said. “That just wouldn’t exist without Homer,” he said. Homer Alfred Neal was born on July 13, 1942, and grew up in Franklin, Ky., then a town of about 4,000. His mother, Margaret (Holland) Neal, taught economics and music in high school, and his father, Homer Neal, shod horses. Homer was a ham radio operator in his teens, which gave him a sense of the wider world. Town leaders were unhappy, he once said, that he, an African-American in the segregated South, worked together with a white boy on ham radio projects; the collaboration ended. But Dr. Neal said he had learned from that work that skin color did not matter in science. Dr. Neal did not often talk about race, Dr. Orr said, but he once recalled that as a child he had been encouraged to play basketball rather than pursue a career in science. The odds were against him. Even today, only about 40 African-Americans earn a doctoral degree in physics each year, representing roughly 2 percent of the 2,000 or so doctorates awarded, according to the American Physical Society. There were far fewer when Dr. Neal went to graduate school. “Back in the ′50s, ′60s, ′70s — if you had one African-American in your Ph.D. program per decade, that was probably the norm,” Dr. Orr said. “He was a trailblazer in that respect.” Dr. Neal worried about that lack of diversity in physics. In 2017, he was interviewed for an American Physical Society video on the issue. “Even though nationwide huge investments have been made by the government and agencies,” he said, “the number of underrepresented children is alarming.” Dr. Neal started his undergraduate studies at Indiana University when he was just 15, Mrs. Neal said. He went on to receive his doctorate at the University of Michigan. Earlier in his career he was provost of the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island and dean of research and graduate development at Indiana. He joined the Michigan faculty in 1987 as chairman of the physics department. He was chosen to be interim president of the university in 1996. As an administrator, “he was unflappable, a remarkably deft politician,” Dr. Orr said. Dr. Neal was also a leader in his profession. In 2016 he served as president of the American Physical Society, a professional organization of 55,000 members. He sat on the board of the Ford Motor Company for 18 years, retiring in 2014, as well on the council of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. In addition to his wife, Dr. Neal is survived by their children, Sharon-Denise Neal, who trained as an archaeologist, and Homer A. Neal Jr., a physicist and staff scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University; and four grandchildren. Mrs. Neal recalled that when her husband arrived at Indiana at 15, a faculty member told him he would never make it through. Years later, she said, when he returned as a professor, “Homer Neal had the pleasure of tapping that person on the shoulder and saying, ‘Hello, how are you? I’m now on your faculty.’ That’s the kind of person Homer was. He was not a person who carried a grudge.”",The New York Times
2018,"Homers by Arenado, Blackmon, McMahon Rally Rockies Past Mets","DENVER — Ryan McMahon turned a small adjustment into a big return for the Colorado Rockies. McMahon tweaked his swing early in the afternoon and then hit a go-ahead, three-run homer to help rally the Rockies past the New York Mets 10-8 on Wednesday night. Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon also went deep, and Colorado's struggling bullpen shut the door in the late innings. ""You need a bullpen to do what ours did tonight from the sixth on — put up zeros,"" Rockies manager Bud Black said. ""That's the expectation, and that's their expectation."" Colorado trailed 8-6 when McMahon pinch-hit with two on and two outs in the fifth. He sent a 1-0 changeup from reliever Robert Gsellman into the Rockies' bullpen to give Colorado the lead. It was McMahon's second homer of the season and it came just hours after he worked with hitting coach Duane Espy in the batting cage. ""I made a small adjustment today with my hands, just put them in a better position to get that shorter swing off, that flatter swing off,"" McMahon said. ""Stood the bat up a little more and got instant results. ""It's been a long time coming and it felt really good to come through for the guys."" Gsellman (5-2) had given up just one home run in 16 road games prior to Wednesday. ""A changeup right down the middle and the hitter just did his job and hit it out of the ballpark,"" he said. ""Got to execute the pitch."" Bryan Shaw (3-5) got one out to earn the win. Wade Davis pitched the ninth for his 21st save this season — and the 100th of his career. New York took an 8-6 lead with a four-run fifth. The Mets batted around for the second time in the game and benefited from three walks in the inning, including one to Brandon Nimmo with the bases loaded. Dominic Smith, who tripled in the fifth, had a career-high three hits for New York and was a home run short of the cycle. The Mets loaded the bases in the sixth against lefty Harrison Musgrave but pinch-hitter Kevin Plawecki grounded into an inning-ending double play to Arenado at third. ""The sixth got a little dicey, but zeros nevertheless,"" Black said. ""That's how you win games."" Neither starter lasted long in another high-scoring game at Coors Field. The Mets scored three in the first and another in the second to take a 4-1 lead, but Colorado tied it with three unearned runs in the second. The Rockies went ahead 6-4 in the third on RBI singles by Gerardo Parra and Tom Murphy. TRAINER'S ROOM Mets: RHP A.J. Ramos had arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. ... Mets manager Mickey Callaway said the results of OF Jay Bruce's MRI revealed a right hip strain and the team will decide on a plan soon. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard (strained ligament in right index finger) threw before batting practice. Rockies: LHP Mike Dunn (rhomboid strain) threw live batting practice and said he had no ill effects. Dunn said he threw about 20 pitches. If he feels good Thursday, Black said Dunn could go on a rehab assignment this weekend. ... RHP Scott Oberg (back strain) could also go on a rehab assignment, Black said. INJURY SCARE New York second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera was holding his left arm after tagging out Murphy on a steal attempt in the seventh inning. The trainer checked him over but Cabrera was able to stay in the game. ""He just landed hard on his left elbow,"" Callaway said. HOME INVASION The Rockies have allowed eight or more runs in their last nine home games, which ties for the longest streak in big league history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The 1894 St. Louis Browns were the last team to do it. ROSTER MOVE Before the game, the Mets recalled RHP Chris Flexen from Triple-A Las Vegas and optioned RHP Hansel Robles to their top farm team. UP NEXT In a matchup of left-handers, the Mets will send Steven Matz (3-4, 3.31 ERA) to the mound against Colorado hometown favorite Kyle Freeland (6-6, 3.59) in the finale of the four-game series Thursday afternoon. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball",The New York Times

2018,"Honduran Man Kills Himself After Being Separated From Family at U.S. Border, Reports Say","A Honduran man who was separated from his family after he had crossed the United States border into Texas with them last month strangled himself in his holding cell, according to Customs and Border Protection officials, public records and media reports. The man, Marco Antonio Muñoz, crossed the Rio Grande with his wife and 3-year-old son in mid-May near Granjeno, Tex., The Washington Post reported. In a statement, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman said Mr. Muñoz was apprehended by Border Patrol agents on May 11 for “attempting illegal entry into the United States” and taken to the Rio Grande Valley central processing center. Once there, Mr. Muñoz and his family said they wanted to apply for asylum, The Post reported; Border Patrol agents then told them they would be separated. While at the processing center, the Customs and Border Protection spokesman said, Mr. Muñoz “became disruptive and combative,” so the authorities moved him to a jail in Starr County, Tex. — about 40 miles west of the processing center — for an overnight stay. Although the statement did not say whether Mr. Muñoz was with family members at the border, or explain why he became combative, media outlets reported that he grew upset after learning that his family would be split up. A public report posted by the Texas attorney general says Mr. Muñoz, 39, was booked into the jail the night of May 12. He was “combative and noncompliant” and scuffled with a detention officer, the report said, before being placed in a padded cell late that night. Throughout the evening, officers checked on Mr. Muñoz every 30 minutes, the report said, but during the morning shift, different officers found Mr. Muñoz dead on the floor. The death was listed in the report as a suicide by self-strangulation and hanging. Law enforcement officials reviewed video recordings of what happened in the cell overnight, the report said. “C.B.P. takes every loss of life very seriously and has initiated an internal review to ensure these policies were followed,” the agency’s statement said, referring to the agency’s standards on transport, escort, detention and search. Representatives from the Starr County Sheriff’s Office did not return multiple calls and emails for comment on Saturday. A person who picked up the phone there said staff members were not available on weekends. On May 7, days before Mr. Muñoz was apprehended at the border, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would criminally prosecute everyone who illegally crosses the Southwest border, in what he called a “zero tolerance” policy intended to deter new migrants, mainly from Central American countries like Honduras. The policy imposes potential criminal penalties on border-crossers who would have previously faced mainly civil deportation proceedings — and in the process, forces the separation of families crossing the border. Many who have criticized the policy have focused on its effect on children who are separated from their parents. But Justin Tullius, a lawyer at the nonprofit Raices, which works with migrants in Texas, said adults who are detained have also suffered. “We’ve worked with parents who have shared suicidal thoughts and who have attempted to take their own lives because of the experience of detention,” Mr. Tullius said. “We can’t allow policies that traumatize parents and children. Families must be allowed to go through the process of seeking protection in the U.S. together, without unnecessary and harmful separation.”",The New York Times
2018,"Honeymoons, Babymoons and Jobbymoons?","The getaway Trips taken before starting work at a new employer can help travelers recharge and refocus. Last September, a week after leaving her job, Hirumi Nanayakkara did what any high-achieving and organized unemployed person would do: She woke up, ate breakfast and wrote a checklist. Instead of tasks like “update LinkedIn” or “email recruiters,” though, her to-dos included “eat noodles,” “get a massage” and “go to the beach” — exactly what one does while vacationing in the Balinese town of Padangbai. Ms. Nanayakkara, 34, had flown to Indonesia a few days after finishing a project at LittleBits, the electronic building blocks company where she had been hired as employee No. 5. Five and a half years later, after helping expand the start-up to more than 100 employees, she felt it was time to move on — but not without taking a break first. “Part of the reason for getting away was to immerse myself in nontechnology-related things, because I had done that every day at work,” she said. She also wanted to learn to cook Indonesian food, her favorite. “When people asked, ‘Are you doing your ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ trip?’ I said, ‘No, I’m doing my ‘Eat, Eat, Eat’ trip,’” she said. Honeymoons and babymoons are both culturally anointed trips timed to big life events. But there’s no common name for the trip that follows another milestone: switching jobs. Although these “jobbymoons” (as we might call them) vary, based on employment circumstances, budget and personal passions, they often share one objective: to exorcise the vestiges of the last job before starting the next one. “Travel is great because people learn a lot about themselves,” said Joy Lin, a career coach on the jobs site The Muse. “But you have to know what you’re hoping to get out of it. You don’t want to use travel as an escape between one job that you don’t like and the next job that you don’t like.” Ms. Nanayakkara, now the director of experience at Quip, the toothbrush start-up, used her Bali excursion to focus on four goals: “chill out, get rid of my eye twitch, eat as much local cuisine as possible and define what I want next in life.” Eleven days into the two-week trip, she had checked them all off. Because she didn’t already have her next job lined up, she also wrote down a list of what she hoped it would offer; among the items, “collaborative team” and “creative strategy.” Those who have secured their next opportunities say the chance to disconnect can be just as valuable. In between leaving a full-time position at a public relations and marketing firm and starting work on Ward 6 Marketing, an agency of his own, Heath Fradkoff, 40, traveled with his wife to Ireland. They wanted a vacation where they could traipse around a city — Dublin — for a few days before exploring the countryside. “Here was a period when I didn’t need to be on the grid and I didn’t need to react to anything,” Mr. Fradkoff said. “We wanted to go as far as we could and make as big a deal of this vacation as possible, since it was the only time when I had absolutely no responsibilities, work-wise.” Unlike “bleisure” travel or “bizcations,” which blur business and recreation, trips between jobs involve zero business. “You’re not battling against the friction you might feel if you’re currently employed and you feel you can’t get away. When you do start your new job, it’s better if you’re not rolling into it exhausted, with baggage from the last position,” said Michelle Gielan, a positive psychology expert who, along with her husband, Shawn Anchor, partnered with the U.S. Travel Association on a 2016 vacation study for the organization’s Project: Time Off initiative. The study found that 55 percent of American workers who are employed at least 35 hours a week with paid time off, don’t use all of their vacation. In 2015, Americans took approximately four fewer vacation days than they did in 2000, the study said. “It used to be that you’d have lifetime employment with one employer, and that you’d never really have breaks,” said John Challenger, the chief executive at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive-outplacement firm. “Now we’re seeing plenty of people who decide to take advantage of the natural gaps that occur in one’s work history.” Data suggests that job-hopping behavior may be generational; according to LinkedIn, in 2016, millennials switched jobs 2.2 times more than nonmillennials and had a lower median tenure before hopping. Mr. Challenger said that the chance to take time off can be the silver lining to “no-fault job loss”; say, companywide downsizing. When she was laid off from Tasting Table last fall, Bertha Chen, 26, dove headfirst into networking, interviewing and freelancing. “With no job, I was worried about where my life was going. I’m someone who has to know my next step before doing anything crazy — like jumping on a plane,” she said. After six weeks of searching, Ms. Chen got an offer as an account coordinator at Pinterest; the position was to begin in two weeks. Two hours and eight minutes after accepting it, she bought a plane ticket to Costa Rica and departed less than 36 hours later. Although she didn’t love traveling alone and wasn’t wowed by the destination, the five-day vacation impressed upon her one important lesson. “I had zero time to do research, and although the trip wasn’t perfect, I realized that going with the flow also works out,” she said. “I don’t have to plan every minute.” However unusual it may have felt to her at the time, Ms. Chen’s getaway matches a trend; today more than 50 percent of Google Flights searches are for trips departing less than 30 days out. To counter the premium of 11th-hour airfare, Ms. Chen paid $11 a night for a serviceable, if bare-bones, hostel. Other life circumstances can make the cost of a trip between jobs easier to bear. By the time she left for Bali, Ms. Nanayakkara, who had gotten married a few months before, was already on her new husband’s health insurance, sparing her hundreds, if not thousands, in would-be Cobra payments. She had also tracked airfare on Kayak and Google Flights before finding a round-trip ticket for $850. Mr. Fradkoff and his wife had saved well and had not taken any big trips in the year leading up to their week in Ireland; he had also lined up his fledgling firm’s first few projects, with kickoff dates scheduled immediately after their return. “On the one hand, you’ve wrapped up with your former clients — no one is going to email or call you,” Mr. Fradkoff said. “But you also know you’ll be starting a bunch of new stuff when you get back. You’re starting down a new path; you want to mark the occasion, celebrate it and prepare yourself.”",The New York Times
2018,Hong Kong Activist Edward Leung Given 6 Years for Police Clash,"HONG KONG — A Hong Kong activist was sentenced to six years in prison on Monday for his role in a 2016 clash between protesters and the police over unlicensed street vendors selling traditional snacks during the Lunar New Year. The activist, Edward Leung, faced up to 10 years in prison after he was convicted last month of one count of rioting. He was found not guilty of a separate charge of inciting a riot, which prosecutors have said they will appeal. The judge in the trial, Anthea Pang, said that political causes were no justification for violence, and that the sentence would take into account only the degree of violence and the extent to which public peace had been disrupted, the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK reported. Another defendant, Lo Kin-man, was sentenced to seven years, and a third activist, Wong Ka-kui, pleaded guilty to rioting and was sentenced to three and a half years. Mr. Leung had previously pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer, for which he was sentenced to one year in prison, which will be served concurrently. Pro-democracy politicians widely condemned Mr. Leung’s sentence, saying it was excessive and could scare people away from participating in protests. “Way too harsh and unjust sentencing,” Nathan Law, a local politician with the Demosisto party, said in a Twitter post. He added that the sentence was far longer than those of many people convicted after deadly riots in Hong Kong in 1967. Mr. Leung, 27, had been a prominent representative of Hong Kong Indigenous, a group that formed after the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement and took a more confrontational approach to protecting Hong Kong’s local identity and culture in the face of growing influence from mainland China. He agreed with the label of “radical separatist” used by the top mainland Chinese official in Hong Kong to describe those who participated in the riot. Mr. Leung had advocated Hong Kong’s independence from China, but disavowed that stance while running for the local legislature in 2016. He won 15 percent of the vote in a by-election for a Legislative Council seat in February 2016 despite the rioting charges. He was barred from running again for another seat after an election officer questioned whether he sincerely acknowledged that Hong Kong was an “inalienable part” of China. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997. Under the concept of “one country, two systems,” it can maintain its own local political, judicial and economic systems until at least 2047. But many people in Hong Kong fear the rapid erosion of their city’s unique character and independent institutions under the growing clout of China’s authoritarian government. The 2016 unrest in the Mong Kok district began after activists fought with the police over fears that city inspectors were planning to shut down unlicensed vendors selling traditional snacks during the Chinese New Year holiday. At one point, a police officer fired two live rounds into the air, which the officer said was meant as a warning in order to protect a fallen colleague. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said he had tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to overhaul the public order ordinance that includes rioting offenses out of concern that vague language could be abused. “It is disappointing to see that the legislation is now being used politically to place extreme sentences on the pan-democrats and other activists,” Mr. Patten said in a statement distributed by Hong Kong Watch, a rights group based in London. With the sentencing of the three protesters on Monday, a total of 25 people have received a total of more than 71 years in prison in relation to the 2016 riot, according to a tally by Kong Tsung-gan, an activist and writer. Dozens of Hong Kong activists have also been convicted of offenses that occurred during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal threw out the prison sentences of three Umbrella Movement leaders in February while affirming tough sentencing guidelines for future incidents that “cross the line of acceptability.”",The New York Times
2018,Hong Kong Gives Mainland Police Sway in New Train Station,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s legislature approved a contentious plan late Thursday to allow mainland Chinese police officers to operate in a section of a new train station scheduled to open this year. To the Hong Kong government, the West Kowloon station is important economically, accelerating access to mainland China and its growing high-speed rail network. But to many legal scholars and democracy supporters, it is a trap that will rob Hong Kong of a measure of autonomy, and set the stage for it to lose much more in the future. The new rail line will cut the two-hour trip between Hong Kong and the city of Guangzhou to 48 minutes. Some critics, though, have questioned the project’s $10.8 billion cost, an increase from the original estimate of $8.3 billion, when Hong Kong already has rail links with mainland China, in addition to air, road and ferry connections. The biggest issue, though, is not the price tag of the sweeping, clamshell-shaped station, built in western Kowloon near shopping malls, apartment towers and a new arts district. More troubling to many is that in the heart of Hong Kong, mainland Chinese law will hold sway over 26 acres of floor space in the station, an area slightly larger than Yankee Stadium. When Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the arrangement with Beijing was that it would be given a “high degree of autonomy” under a model of “one country, two systems.” For 50 years Hong Kong could keep its independent courts, its free-market economy and its freewheeling press, while Beijing was responsible for matters of state like national defense and foreign relations. The granting of mainland jurisdiction is a subtle yet powerful way to undermine Hong Kong’s unique status, said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. “Instead of sending bullets into Hong Kong, they’re sending a bullet train,” she said. The new station “will become a horrifying precedent that it’s possible to introduce laws from China in Hong Kong without any legal basis,” said Chris Ng, a representative of the Progressive Lawyers Group, a Hong Kong organization that promotes democracy and the rule of law. The mainland officers would have authority over a customs and immigration area that makes up about one-quarter of the West Kowloon station. Eric Cheung, a professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, said there was a risk that the passage of the station arrangement would bypass Hong Kong’s courts. But Hong Kong’s secretary for justice, Teresa Cheng, said it would have to undergo court scrutiny, though she said she believed the plan was on solid legal ground. Pro-democracy legislators tried to limit the scope or permanence of the mainland officers with a series of amendments, but they were all defeated Thursday. After a series of dismissals of pro-democracy legislators in the past year, the camp has lost much of its veto power. Five lawmakers were barred from the chamber after protesting the measure on Wednesday. The final vote was approved by a 40-to-20 vote as hundreds of demonstrators watched from outside.",The New York Times
2018,"Hong Kong Marks Tiananmen Crackdown, as China Ignores Event","HONG KONG — Tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists turned out in Hong Kong Monday to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing, observing an event that goes largely unmentioned in mainland China. This year’s vigil focused on freeing “dissidents imprisoned or under home arrest” in addition to pushing for greater democracy in mainland China. The protesters marking the Tiananmen anniversary in Hong Kong have seen their numbers dwindle in the years since the Occupy Central pro-democracy movement gripped Hong Kong in 2014. Organizers said as many as 180,000 people showed up to that year’s June 4 vigil — the police estimated the number to be roughly half that — but last year they estimated 110,000 people attended. Heavy rains on Monday also limited this year’s turnout at the event, held annually in the semiautonomous territory. One reason for the declining attendance is that many student organizations are unwilling to join the vigil, arguing that the event should focus on democracy in Hong Kong, rather than mainland China. But not all students agree. “They are letting the events that happened in Tiananmen fade,” said Wong Nga-man, a student at Hong Kong Baptist University. “I want to show that there are still young people like myself who believe in the values of the vigil, for the Tiananmen crackdown and democracy.” Organizers of this year’s event have seized on the death the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, prominently displaying a bust of him in the city’s Times Square and bringing it to Monday night’s vigil. Democracy activists have been calling for the release of his widow, Liu Xia, who is under house arrest. At a second, smaller and unsanctioned vigil, one speaker called for the international community to investigate the deaths in Tiananmen. Michael Mo Kwan-tai, the speaker, called for “the International Criminal Court to investigate suspicions of crimes against humanity.” The organizer of the larger main vigil, Chow Hang-tung, said before the event that she planned to call for an “end to one-party dictatorship.” Organizers said more than 100,000 people were in attendance despite the rain. Many of the participants held candles during the somber ceremony. The vigil in Hong Kong is a stark departure from the situation in China, where protests are banned and mentions of the Tiananmen crackdown, in which hundreds if not thousands of protesters died, are scrubbed from social media. Mike Pompeo, the United States secretary of state, called attention to the anniversary Sunday, releasing a statement urging “the Chinese government to make a full public accounting of those killed, detained or missing” and “to release those who have been jailed for striving to keep the memory of Tiananmen Square alive.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the year of a deadly crackdown on protesters in Beijing. It was 1989, not 1979.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Hope in the Era of Trump’s Climate Foolishness,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. One year ago, on June 1, President Trump dismayed the world by announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the global Paris climate agreement. He has since shown no inclination to ease up on his efforts to nullify virtually every initiative the Obama administration took to limit greenhouse gases from power plants, cars, trucks, and oil and gas operations. His disappearing act could not have been more ill timed. As a result of rapid economic growth in Asia and lower fuel prices worldwide, global energy-related emissions increased in 2017 after holding steady for three years. There is, however, a silver lining: the increasing efforts by states and cities to fill the Trump vacuum. No thanks to Mr. Trump, the United States actually bucked the worldwide trend and reduced its emissions in 2017. The 0.5 percent drop in emissions, small but encouraging, was driven partly by market forces — including the switch from coal to natural gas — and partly by sustained efforts by climate-conscious states to deploy renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The principal driver of these efforts is the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition of 16 states (plus Puerto Rico) committed to upholding Barack Obama’s Paris pledge to reduce United States greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. According to a study last year by the Rhodium Group, these states, which account for almost half of the nation’s economy, are on track to meet their share of the burden, with estimated reductions in greenhouse gases of between 24 percent and 29 percent by the 2025 target date — not enough to get the entire country where Mr. Obama wanted it to be, but progress nonetheless. These numbers could well improve with the recent addition to the fold of New Jersey, whose new governor, Philip Murphy, has pledged to reshape the state’s energy future. A bill he signed last week would require New Jersey’s power companies to generate half their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Mr. Murphy shrewdly combined this mandate with a $300 million annual subsidy to keep the state’s nuclear power plants afloat. Though many environmentalists have serious qualms about nuclear energy, retaining this capacity is smart from a climate perspective, as these plants provide roughly 40 percent of the state’s electricity, all of it carbon-free. New Jersey’s strategy is similar in some respects to programs approved recently in New York and Illinois, where renewables would be encouraged and nuclear plants awarded financial credit for the carbon-free electricity they produce. As Brad Plumer of The Times has observed, the future of nuclear power is something climate-conscious but traditionally nuclear-phobic environmental groups may have to rethink. There are 99 nuclear plants operating across the country, supplying one-fifth of the nation’s electricity without any carbon dioxide emissions. Some of these plants are struggling financially. Six have closed since 2013, and a dozen or so more are scheduled to retire by 2025 unless states decide otherwise. But states and cities cannot go it alone. Take, for instance, the vexing matter of emissions from transportation, mainly cars and trucks, which in 2016 overtook power plants as America’s largest source of greenhouse gases. New York has done a good job of cutting power plant emissions, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo promises even greater reductions by deploying offshore wind farms and a suite of energy efficiencies. But the road to his goal of reducing overall emissions by 40 percent by 2030 would be much easier if he got some help on vehicles. This is why it is important to preserve the ambitious fuel-efficiency standards agreed to by the Obama administration and the automakers in 2012, as well as California’s statutory right to set even stronger standards. Both are threatened by the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, who, as it turns out, has plenty of time for regulatory carnage when he is not attending to his own legal defense against multiple charges of administrative abuse. On Thursday, Mr. Pruitt sent to the White House his proposal to roll back the Obama rules, which require automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles by 2025. The proposal also formally challenges California’s right to set its own standards. That right is critical because other states can emulate California if they wish; 12 states, including New York, plus the District of Columbia have chosen to do so. In January, Gov. Jerry Brown of California signed an executive order setting a goal of five million zero-emission vehicles on the state’s roads by 2030, a huge increase from the 350,000 or so now. Should other states follow suit, it would mean an enormous shift in the car market — and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In an ideal world, Americans would have a federal government that, as it has in the past, provides investment in new technologies, in research and development and in energy infrastructure. Instead, we are saddled with an administration that is preparing to force power companies to keep dirty and inefficient coal-burning power plants operating on the pretext that they are needed to protect national security. Until that changes, the voices of all those governors, mayors, corporate leaders and others who, after Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement, proclaimed, “We Are Still In,” deserve praise and support.

2018,"Hopes for New Era of Malaysian Free Speech Are High, but Pending","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — For his cartoons skewering Malaysia’s political elite, Zulkiflee Anwar Haque was hit with nine sedition charges and banned from leaving the country. But after Malaysians voted in May to oust Prime Minister Najib Razak and his governing party for the first time in the country’s history, Mr. Zulkiflee, who is better known as Zunar, logged into a government database and discovered he was free to travel abroad. “When the new government came in I expected some changes in human rights and freedom of expression, but I was surprised to see this happen so quickly,” Mr. Zulkiflee said. “At the same time, the ex-prime minister and his wife are on a travel ban now. So, funny, you can say it’s trading places.” Mr. Zulkiflee’s discovery was a promising early indicator for supporters of the new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and his opposition coalition, which had campaigned against Mr. Najib’s tightening restrictions on free speech, among other issues. Still, some people who were prosecuted for criticizing officials in the past are cautious. They say that while the new government appears to be genuine in its commitment to free speech, they are awaiting concrete action. “The euphoria is still there,” said Steven Gan, editor in chief of Malaysiakini, an independent news site. “A lot of people really believe that there will be change.” There are several laws still on the books that have been used to restrict criticism. One is the British colonial-era sedition law that was brought to bear against Mr. Zulkiflee, the cartoonist. The other is a “fake news” law passed in April under Mr. Najib that made it an imprisonable offense to produce, publish or circulate misleading information — with the government as the ultimate judge of what is misleading. There is also the Communications and Multimedia Act, derisively known here as the “hurt feelings act,” that prohibits offensive messages online and has been used to pursue journalists and dissidents. “Over the years the repression and the laws that are being used just seemed to increase,” said Linda Lakhdhir, a legal adviser for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “The anti-fake-news law that came out just before the election was very clearly designed to suppress any criticism of the ruling party or of Najib.” Now, the pace and extent of change are in the hands of Mr. Mahathir and his new government. And if there is concern, it is at least partly because Mr. Mahathir, who previously ran the country from 1981 to 2003, was long known to find one way or another to jail his critics. Mr. Mahathir’s campaign-speech commitment to free speech did seem to waver right after the election, when he suggested that the fake news law needed to be reviewed rather than scrapped entirely, as his coalition had pledged during the campaign. But his cabinet officials maintain that the law, which Mr. Mahathir himself had been accused of violating during the campaign, will be repealed. And Mr. Mahathir has sent other signals that he will uphold free speech. When the police in Langkawi arrested a man on charges of insulting Mr. Mahathir after the election, the new prime minister said he disagreed with the man’s prosecution. Mr. Gan and the co-founder of the Malaysiakini site, Premesh Chandran, were charged in 2016 under the Communications and Multimedia Act for publishing a video that criticized the former attorney general over his handling of the scandal at 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, a state investment fund. That attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, has been removed and could face charges for protecting Mr. Najib. While the change in government looks promising for people who are facing charges for criticizing the previous leadership, Mr. Gan said he had niggling doubts about what could come next. “Promises have been made; the first task will be to ensure they stick to the promises,” he said. “For myself, having covered Mahathir for so long, I think the fear is that he may not stick to his promises.” Many of Mr. Mahathir’s allies are former rivals, including people he had jailed, including Anwar Ibrahim, his former deputy prime minister who became the dominant opposition leader after the two men had a falling out. Lawmakers in the new governing coalition say they believe Mr. Mahathir has entered a new stage of his political life, focused on his legacy. Should he revert to his older, more authoritarian tendencies, he would face resistance from coalition partners who hold far more seats in Parliament. Likewise, the public now expects the new government to follow through, said Eric Paulsen, executive director of Lawyers for Liberty, a Malaysian human rights advocacy group. Mr. Paulsen, who was charged with sedition in 2015 over a Twitter post that accused a government agency that manages Islamic affairs of promoting extremism, said he hoped the new government would drop the charge. But that has yet to happen, he said. “As far as freedom of speech is concerned, we shouldn’t be naïve,” he said. “We will see where it goes in the next six months or a year. Things are definitely opening up, and the press is reveling in its newfound freedom.” The Malaysian artist Fahmi Reza became one of the most public figures in the fight over free speech in Malaysia when his caricature of Mr. Najib as a clown led to his being charged under a law prohibiting online content deemed offensive. His lawyer, Syahredzan Johan, said the election should mean that Malaysians will now have more freedom to criticize their leaders. “Since we have a new government that has come to power with the promise of reform, especially with regard to free speech, there is a little bit of an expectation they will not clamp down on dissent,” he said. But Mr. Fahmi is still cautious. This month, he shared advice on Twitter about what people arrested over online comments should say to the police. “Although the government has changed hands, the #HurtFeelingsAct still applies,” he wrote in reference to the section of the Communications and Multimedia Act that prohibits offensive messages online. “You can still be arrested and investigated just for a tweet.” Tommy Thomas, who was appointed this month as Malaysia’s new attorney general, said that repealing “oppressive laws” was one of the government’s first legal priorities. He specifically named the fake news law and a national goods and services tax, adding that “the list of such laws is pretty long.” Mr. Thomas also declared his support for free speech. “I am happy for everybody to criticize me; it’s part of free speech,” he said. “In fact, I’d rather listen to criticism than praises.” While Mr. Zulkiflee, the cartoonist, has had his travel ban lifted, he still faces nine sedition charges, a record number for a single person in Malaysia. He hopes the government will abolish the Sedition Act, but says he is unsure if it will follow through. “Government is government everywhere,” he said. “During the honeymoon era everything is O.K.; after that they go back to their old tricks. I really hope this is not only a new government but a new Malaysia, with more space for freedom of expression, especially for artists like me.”",The New York Times
2018,"Horrific Details on Syria Chemical Attacks Left Out, for Now, From U.N. Report","At least twice this year, the Syrian military fired Iranian-made artillery shells filled with a chlorine-like substance that oozed poison slowly, giving victims just a few minutes to escape. In another attack, Syrian forces dropped a chemical bomb on the top-floor balcony of an apartment building, killing 49 people, including 11 children. Their skin turned blue. These details and others blaming Syria for atrocities in eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, were uncovered by a United Nations commission investigating and documenting possible war crimes in the seven-year-old conflict. But when the commission issued a report on Wednesday, the details were omitted. Seven pages that had been in an earlier draft, provided to The New York Times, were summarized in two paragraphs in the final document. The commission’s report examined how the government of President Bashar al-Assad recaptured eastern Ghouta, the rebel stronghold near the capital, in the first four months of 2018. Mr. Assad’s forces laid siege to the area, using bombardments, mass starvation and chemical weapons. The materials in the leaked draft paint a far more frightening picture of chemical weapons use in eastern Ghouta than had been previously reported. And they assert without qualification that Syrian forces and their allies were responsible, rebutting repeated denials by Mr. Assad’s government and his backers in Russia and Iran. A member of the commission explained the omissions, saying that many of the details in the early draft needed additional corroboration or clarification and might be included in another report, perhaps by September. There was no outside pressure to withhold the information, said the member, Hanny Megally, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. “We thought we need to do some more work on this, it’s an ongoing investigation,” Mr. Megally said. “So we thought, let’s keep it short.” But the conclusions in the omitted information seemed unambiguous. The leaked draft stated: “In one of the most grim patterns of attack documented during the period under review, Government forces and/or affiliated militias continued to use chemical weapons in densely populated civilian areas throughout eastern Ghouta.” In meticulous detail, the draft enumerated six chemical weapons assaults on civilians from January through April 7, the date of the deadliest assault. In what appeared to be a first, it implicated Iranian-supplied weaponry. In attacks on Jan. 13, Jan. 22 and Feb. 1, the draft said, government forces fired chemical agents, “most probably chlorine,” into a residential part of eastern Ghouta’s Douma neighborhood, near a sports stadium, roughly 800 yards from the front lines, between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Some witnesses described a “slow-acting agent” that smelled like chlorine, the draft said, and they had sufficient time “to rouse the victims, obtain wet cloths to serve as makeshift face masks, and evacuate the affected areas.” In the Jan. 22 and Feb. 1 attacks, the draft said, the commission had evidence identifying the bomb delivery devices as surface-to-surface industrially produced Iranian artillery rockets, “only known to have been used by Government forces and, rarely, affiliated militias.” “In relation to the munitions used on 22 January and 1 February, the Commission obtained and assessed material evidence including metadata analysis, and identified a surface-to-surface craft-produced rocket (IRAM). While IRAMs have been employed by a range of actors across Syria, the particular design of observed during these two attacks is only known to have been used by Government forces and rarely, affiliated militias. Specifically, IRAMs documented were built around industrially-produced Iranian artillery rockets known to have been supplied to Syrian Government forces.” The draft said that the eastern Ghouta attacks had followed “a pattern previously documented by the Commission concerning the use of chemical weapons by Government forces,” and that none of them had suggested “the involvement of armed groups.” Thirty-one people, including 11 children, were sickened in the first three attacks, but none died. Two other episodes of possible chlorine use, on Feb. 25 and March 7, caused more extensive casualties, killing two children, including an infant, and injuring 18 civilians. The worst was yet to come, following the collapse of negotiations between Russian military officials and an insurgent group, Jaish al-Islam, to evacuate the Douma neighborhood and end the siege. On April 7, the draft said, an improvised explosive delivered from the air hit a multistory residential building roughly 200 yards from the Rif Damascus Hospital, the last functioning hospital in Douma. The draft described the explosive as a “single industrial gas cylinder” with fins that struck the top-floor balcony and appeared to have “rapidly released large amounts of a substance into the interior space of the residential apartment building.” “Positions and physical symptoms displayed by victims of the attack support witness claims that the agent acted rapidly,” the draft stated, “and likely indicate that a high concentration of the chemical sank downwards.” Based on witness statements and “material evidence received and analyzed by the Commission,” the draft stated, the dead showed “an array of symptoms consistent with exposure to a choking agent, including signs of foaming at the mouth and nose, blue skin indicating impaired blood circulation, meiosis (constriction of the pupils), as well as some cases of dilated (wide open) pupils.” “Statements and material evidence received and analysed by the Commission in relation to the deceased within the apartment building revealed an array of symptoms consistent with exposure to a choking agent, including signs of foaming at the mouth and nose, blue skin indicating impaired blood circulation, meiosis (constriction of the pupils), as well as some cases of dilated (wide open) pupils. Numerous victims unable to flee the building collapsed shortly after exposure.” Mr. Megally declined to go into detail over why such information was withheld from the report published on Wednesday. But he said that with the April 7 attack in particular, more information was needed, including precisely what killed the 49 people. “If we’re not sure what the cause of death was, we may be looking in the wrong place,” he said. “It’s better we finish the investigation, rather than release it in dribs and drabs.” The official version of the report was far more cautious about the chemical weapons incidents in question. In two attacks, for example, the report said the commission was “unable to obtain sufficient material evidence to conclusively identify the weapons delivery systems.” While the circumstances in the April 7 attack were “largely consistent with the use of chlorine,” it said, the symptoms were more consistent with the use of “another chemical agent, most likely a nerve gas.” The official version also condemned rebel forces for indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas. The commission, which has been compiling evidence of atrocities in the Syria conflict since shortly after the war began in 2011, has developed an extensive array of ways to gather information, even though Mr. Assad has not allowed its investigators into the country. Led by Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, a Brazilian diplomat and rights activist, the commission has even compiled a confidential list of Syrian officials and others who may be held accountable in a court some day. The earlier draft of its report on eastern Ghouta was shared by a person close to the commission, who had been consulted on the report and who declined to be identified. The leak suggested some internal dissension in the commission about the strength of its evidence concerning the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons in eastern Ghouta. It was also possible that the commission wanted to exercise caution ahead of an expected report on the April 7 attack in Douma by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which sent investigators to the site. Chemical weapons are banned by an international treaty that Mr. Assad signed under pressure in 2013, when his government was first accused of having used chemical weapons in the conflict — also in eastern Ghouta. The April 7 attack in Douma caused widespread international fury, particularly because many victims appeared to have been children shown gagging and choking, based on videos disseminated by witnesses and activists. The attack drew retaliatory missile attacks and airstrikes by Britain, France and the United States. Mr. Assad’s government, backed by Russia and Iran, sought to cast doubt about the Douma attack, suggesting it had been faked or carried out by insurgents. The Syrian government and its allies took control of eastern Ghouta two months ago after imposing what the commission’s report described as “the longest siege in modern history,” displacing more than 140,000 people from their homes and unleashing bombardments that destroyed hospitals, markets and schools, and forced residents to live in cellars and basements. Those bombardments — mainly airstrikes by Syrian and Russian planes — killed 1,100 civilians and injured 4,000 others in a period of less than a month from Feb. 18, the commission said in its report, which is to be delivered to the United Nations Human Rights Council next week. Tens of thousands of those who fled are still being held unlawfully by the government, which pursued a policy of blanket internment that the panel called “reprehensible.” Sieges are permitted under international humanitarian law. But, in a departure from established practice, the panel said it considered the way pro-government forces had conducted the siege of eastern Ghouta unlawful. “Certain acts perpetrated by pro-government forces during the siege laid to eastern Ghouta, including the deliberate starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare, amount to the crime against humanity of inhumane acts, causing serious mental and physical suffering,” the panel concluded.

2018,Opinion | Horror Multiplies in Yemen,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Standing by. That’s about all the Trump administration has done as America’s allies on the Arabian Peninsula intensify Yemen’s misery. On Wednesday, a coalition led by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia invaded the Red Sea port of Al Hudaydah, the home to 600,000 Yemenis and the lifeline for humanitarian aid that sustains most of the country’s people, launching its biggest offensive of the yearslong war in the Arab world’s poorest country. The attack began with coalition airstrikes and shelling by naval ships. News reports said the bombardment was heavy. The United Nations and nongovernmental organizations like the International Committee for the Red Cross withdrew many of their staffs as the attack on Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who seized Al Hudaydah two years ago, looked increasingly certain. Meanwhile, United Nations diplomats have worked urgently to prevent a full-scale offensive; now those efforts will be even more important to try to limit the fighting. One proposal would have the United Nations or another independent agency manage the port and ensure that civilians receive desperately needed food and medicine. Experts have predicted that 250,000 people could be killed or displaced in the offensive. Over the course of this conflict, President Trump has emboldened Saudi and emirati leaders. He shares their antipathy for Iran and will sell them virtually any weapon they want. The military contractor Raytheon is lobbying Congress and the State Department for permission to sell the Saudis and emiratis billions more dollars’ worth of precision-guided munitions. The Trump administration, which also supplies the coalition with intelligence, refueling capabilities and other assistance, has sent mixed signals about the Al Hudaydah offensive. While the Pentagon urged the coalition not to attack, a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday made no such explicit request. Instead, he made clear to the emirate leaders “our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and lifesaving commercial imports.” He mildly called for all sides to work with the United Nations on a political solution. The war began in 2014, when Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the capital, Sana, and much of the rest of the country. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition, with President Barack Obama’s backing, launched airstrikes against the Houthi forces. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both Sunni Arab nations, see the Al Hudaydah offensive as a way to break a stalemate in the war and deal a blow to the indigenous Houthis and their backers in Shiite-led Iran, which the Sunnis consider their chief rival for regional influence. They have accused the Houthi rebels of using the port to smuggle in arms, including missiles, allegedly supplied by Iran to attack Saudi Arabia. A United Nations panel has expressed doubt that Al Hudaydah is a weapons transit point. Experts question whether Iran provided the missiles. Although coalition leaders have argued that the offensive can be carried out quickly, they have repeatedly miscalculated over the years, trapping their countries in a quagmire. The result has been countless civilian deaths, many attributed to indiscriminate coalition bombing attacks. Under international law, these attacks may qualify as war crimes in which the United States and Britain, another arms supplier, are complicit. In all, more than 10,000 people have been killed in the war in Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries and the battleground for a separate struggle by the United States and its regional allies against an affiliate of Al Qaeda. About 22 million Yemenis need humanitarian aid, and 8.4 million are at risk of starvation. The Trump administration should speak with one voice to its Arab allies, making clear that an attack on Al Hudaydah is a disaster. Arms sales and perhaps other military assistance should be suspended. Working with the Houthis and the United Nations on a cease-fire and a deal for neutral control of the port could be the first step to a political settlement that is the only hope for peace.

2018,Hot Heads: Why Mammals Need R.E.M. Sleep,"Sleeping fur seals toggle between two brain patterns: one while at sea, the other on land. Researchers suggest that R.E.M. sleep serves to warm the brain. On a December evening in 1951, Eugene Aserinsky, a physiologist at the University of Chicago, placed electrodes on the scalp of his 8-year-old son, Armond, before putting him to bed. Then the scientist retired to another room to watch a row of pens quiver across a rolling sheet of paper, recording the electrical activity in the boy’s facial muscles. Hours later, the pens started to swing wildly. To judge from the chart, it seemed as if Armond were awake, his eyes darting about the room. But when Aserinsky looked in on him, his son was fast asleep. Aserinsky had discovered R.E.M. sleep. Eventually he and other researchers learned that during this state, the brain shifts from low-frequency to high-frequency electrical waves, like those produced in waking hours. When Aserinsky woke his subjects from R.E.M. sleep, they often reported vivid dreams. Almost all mammals experience R.E.M. sleep, but even today researchers debate why it exists. On Thursday, a team of American and Russian researchers reported that fur seals may provide an important clue. While they swim, fur seals switch off R.E.M. sleep entirely. It returns when they come back to land — a pattern never seen before. Jerome M. Siegel, a sleep expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of the new study published Thursday in Current Biology, said that the seals provide evidence that our brains switch to R.E.M. sleep from time to time to generate heat in our skulls. “R.E.M. sleep is like shivering for the brain,” he said. Many scientists have argued that our brains require R.E.M. sleep each night to function properly. One clue comes from experiments in which researchers deprive rats of R.E.M. sleep for a few days. As soon as the rats can sleep normally again, they experience a “rebound,” spending more time each night in R.E.M. — as if they need to catch up. Some studies have suggested that the brain needs R.E.M. sleep to keep its metabolism in balance. Rats deprived of R.E.M. will eat more, and yet they also will lose weight. This disruption can be lethal. “If you deprive rats of R.E.M. sleep, they’ll die in two weeks,” said Dr. Siegel. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] But other findings have raised doubts about the importance of R.E.M. Certain types of antidepressant drugs reduce R.E.M. sleep in users, for example, without evidence of harm. R.E.M. isn’t even essential for dreaming. Researchers have found that people also dream during periods of so-called slow-wave sleep. Some of the most puzzling evidence about R.E.M. sleep has come from the sea. In the 1970s, a Russian biologist named Lev M. Mukhametov placed electrodes on the heads of dolphins. He discovered that they can put one side of the brain to sleep as they swim while the other side remains alert. Then they can switch, putting the other hemisphere to sleep. But as hard as Dr. Mukhametov and his colleagues looked, they never found a dolphin in R.E.M. sleep. In the 1990s, Dr. Siegel and Dr. Mukhametov started collaborating on studies of relatives of dolphins and found the hemisphere-switching sleep pattern in other species, such as gray whales. More recently, the scientists wondered what they might find if they looked at a species between the two ends of the spectrum: a mammal that regularly slept both at sea and on land. The researchers decided to study four fur seals. The animals spend weeks or months swimming in the ocean, but they come on land to mate and rear their young. Oleg I. Lyamin, a neuroscientist who splits his time between U.C.L.A. and the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow, implanted electrodes in the seals and strapped data recorders to their backs. The fur seals lived in a pool where they could swim around or haul themselves onto a dry platform. After two days of recordings, the researchers took away the platform. For up to two weeks, the seals could only swim in the pool. Then the researchers put the platform back, allowing the fur seals to doze out of the water again. On the platform, the researchers found, the fur seals slept much as land mammals do. Their entire brains slipped into slow-wave sleep, interrupted from time to time by periods of R.E.M. But when the seals had to sleep in the water, the brain patterns resembled those of dolphins. Only one hemisphere of their brain slept at a time. What’s more, the fur seals experienced almost no R.E.M. sleep. “The R.E.M. sleep pretty much goes to zero and stays there as long as they’re in the water,” said Dr. Siegel. When the seals got back on the platform, ordinary R.E.M. sleep returned. Their long spell of R.E.M.-free sleep did them no apparent harm, and they didn’t experience any R.E.M.-sleep rebound. The results undermine the idea that R.E.M. sleep is essential to mammals, like food and water, Dr. Siegel said. In fact, the earlier studies on R.E.M. deprivation might not have been as compelling as they once seemed. In those earlier studies, researchers kept animals from going into R.E.M. sleep by waking them up. “In some experiments, they wake up the animals a thousand times a day,” Dr. Siegel said. The stress of being awakened over and over could have done the animals harm, rather than just the lack of R.E.M. sleep in particular. A more telling clue about R.E.M. sleep can be found in human behavior, Dr. Siegel thinks. When people wake up on their own, they tend to move out of R.E.M. sleep and become alert. Those awakened from slow-wave sleep are groggy and disoriented. Dr. Siegel and his colleagues propose that the brain cools during slow-wave sleep. To keep the brain from getting too cold, however, the brain periodically unleashes a torrent of activity. Oxygen-rich blood flows into the brain to fuel the activity, warming the brain in the process. “It keeps the brain temperature within a functional limit by cycling on and off the same way your heater in your house might do at night,” Dr. Siegel said. This explanation could also account for why dolphins don’t experience R.E.M. sleep — and why seals don’t as they swim. These marine mammals have evolved a half-brain style of sleeping, perhaps as a way to remain alert enough to avoid predators and drowning. Because part of the brain is always active, it’s always warm. As a result, it never triggers R.E.M. sleep. Only when fur seals return to land and switch to sleeping with their entire brains do the organs cool enough to flip the switch. Niels C. Rattenborg, a sleep expert at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Germany, said the new study is “another compelling piece of evidence questioning the importance of R.E.M. sleep.” He found Dr. Siegel’s brain-shiver theory intriguing. But he wanted to see it put to the test. Neuroscientists have identified a clump of neurons in the brain stem as the switch that turns on R.E.M. sleep. Dr. Siegel’s theory predicts that in fur seals the brain stem stays warm at sea but cools on land. “Until we have that test, it’s an interesting idea but remains unproven,” Dr. Rattenborg said.",The New York Times
2018,"House G.O.P. Breaks Into Open Warfare With Rosenstein, Demanding Files","WASHINGTON — For months, their sparring had been indirect, stern letters exchanged, pointed threats traded through the news media. But on Thursday, the ever-intensifying skirmishes between Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and conservative House Republicans broke into an ugly public fight. On the House floor, Republicans voted in lock step to give the Justice Department seven days to produce sensitive documents related to the Russia inquiry and the F.B.I.’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email use. Though nonbinding, the measure was intended to put Mr. Rosenstein on notice that House lawmakers were willing to take punitive action — potentially including impeachment — if their demands were not met. In the House Judiciary Committee, conservative Republicans hauled Mr. Rosenstein and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, before television cameras to accuse them of hiding information from Congress to protect their own interests. In Mr. Rosenstein’s case, some Republicans charged outright misconduct related to the investigation into Russian election interference. The two leaders, both appointed by President Trump, defended the special counsel investigation and their response to congressional investigators, even as they said they had been deeply troubled by the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s report released this month on the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton email case. “There are mechanisms to resolve this without threatening to hold people in contempt,” Mr. Rosenstein said, urging lawmakers to work with him rather than threaten him. “We are not in contempt of this Congress. We are not going to be.” Democrats accused Republicans of concocting a political distraction to further bloody the reputation of the Justice Department as it investigates President Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat, called the floor vote “clearly a pretext for a move against Mr. Rosenstein that the majority already has planned.” Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois, drove the point home to Mr. Rosenstein: “They want to impeach you; they want to indict you; they want to get rid of you. Mr. Rosenstein, good luck. We’re in the minority.” In the year since he appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel, Mr. Rosenstein has emerged as one of the chief targets of House Republicans critical of the ongoing investigation. Thursday’s resolution passed along party lines, 226 to 183, as he and other department officials were working furiously to meet the requests of the Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has expressed confidence that the department is showing a good-faith effort to meet Republican demands, and at least one committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday’s measure was not really necessary. But Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders demanded that vote. “For over eight months, they have had the opportunity to choose transparency. But they’ve instead chosen to withhold information and impede any effort of Congress to conduct oversight,” said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a sponsor of Thursday’s House resolution who raised the possibility of impeachment this week. “If Rod Rosenstein and the Department of Justice have nothing to hide, they certainly haven’t acted like it.” Thursday’s hearing had been called to allow the law enforcement officials to field questions about the 500-page report from the department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz. He found that the F.B.I. broke with longstanding policy in its handling of the Clinton email case, badly damaged its reputation and opened the door to accusations of political bias. The report criticizes at length two F.B.I. officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who exchanged voluminous texts disparaging Mr. Trump while they were helping to lead the investigation into both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump’s campaign. But in the hearing room, Republicans advanced a wide range of topics, including now-familiar and largely unsubstantiated charges against Mr. Rosenstein and the special counsel investigation that he oversees. One by one, the deputy attorney general sought to dispose of them. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated assertions — including in a Thursday morning tweet — Mr. Rosenstein said he was “not aware of any disqualifying conflict of interest” involving Mr. Mueller. Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, asked if Mr. Mueller had properly addressed the potential taint of political bias brought to the case by Mr. Strzok. Mr. Rosenstein said he was confident Mr. Mueller had taken “appropriate steps” to do so and would continue to. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, pressed Mr. Rosenstein about news media reports saying that he had threatened members of the House Intelligence Committee staff with a subpoena during a heated dispute this year. Mr. Rosenstein disputed that, too, daring his accusers to contradict his denial under oath. He also batted back Republican criticism of his role in approving the secret surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. “If the inspector general finds that I did something wrong, then I’ll respect that judgment, but I think it’s highly, highly unlikely,” Mr. Rosenstein said. Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who has been publicly supportive of the Mueller inquiry, told Mr. Rosenstein, “If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury. If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people. There’s an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied.” Mr. Rosenstein pushed back, saying that Mr. Mueller was moving “as expeditiously as possible” to conclude his work and that the investigation had not actually gone on that long, given its mandate. In a tense back-and-forth with Mr. Jordan, Mr. Rosenstein said, “Your use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.” At one point, Mr. Rosenstein assured lawmakers, “I’m not a Democrat, and I’m not angry” — a reference to Mr. Trump’s frequent complaint that the Russia investigation is being led by “13 angry Democrats.” Mr. Wray also made clear that he was not pleased to be locked in a fight with Republicans: “When I was minding my own business in private practice in Atlanta, I didn’t think I was going to be spending the first 10 months of my job staring down the barrel of a contempt citation for conduct that occurred long before I even thought about being F.B.I. director.” The Judiciary Committee, which had strayed from the spotlight for the last year or so, has ramped up its own investigation of the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton case and certain aspects of the Russia investigation in recent weeks. On Wednesday, lawmakers from the Judiciary Committee interviewed Mr. Strzok for nearly 11 hours about his messages with Ms. Page and his role in both cases. Mr. Strzok said the messages had been taken out of context and did not affect his work, and Democrats on Wednesday night called for the interview transcript to be released to the public. “As today’s transcript will make crystal clear, House Republicans are desperately trying to find something — anything — to undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign,” Mr. Nadler and Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in a joint statement Wednesday night. “Unfortunately for them, they were entirely unsuccessful.”",The New York Times
2018,House Hunting in … England,"International Real Estate 14 Photos View Slide Show › A STATELY HOME ON THE COAST $2 MILLION (1.5 MILLION BRITISH POUNDS) This home, known as East House, is in a former manor in Rousdon, a village on the coast of East Devon, in South West England. It is one of six units in a subdivided Tudor-style house and is part of the larger 350-acre Rousdon Estate, which was established in the 1870s and now has dozens of residences. East House, which encompasses about 12,000 square feet in the building’s southeast wing, is the largest of the units. It comes with 3.1 acres of landscaped grounds, and has access to a private beach at nearby Charlton Bay. Other amenities include a tennis court and a small lake. The manor, which was constructed of locally mined sandstone and has a slate roof, is a protected historic property with a “grade two star” listing from the National Heritage List for England. Sir Henry Peek, a spice and tea importer who also served in Parliament, was the original owner of Rousdon Estate and commissioned the manor house on a plot 500 feet above sea level. Completed in 1878, it later housed Allhallows, a school for boys. The listing broker, Isabel Clifton of Strutt & Parker, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate, said the current owners bought East House after the boarding school was shuttered in the late 1990s and “restored the property to its former glory,” but are now looking to downsize. The five-level home has eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and two kitchens, connected by a turreted spiral stone staircase. It has rich wood paneling with intricate carvings, Ms. Clifton said, as well as stained-glass windows, gold-leaf detail on the ceilings, parquet and marble flooring, and ornate moldings and fireplaces. There are also numerous wood-burning stoves. The main entry, on the ground level, opens to a drawing room anchored by a fireplace with a decorative wood mantel. A long hallway with stone carvings and a marble floor leads to a 42-by-25-foot library/great room with two wood-burning stoves, a carved fireplace and three alcove windows with built-in seating. A reception hall and a foyer beyond lead outside to the gardens and a two-car parking area. The level below is less formal, with an open space that includes a kitchen, dining area and family room. Doors open to the gardens and a courtyard with stone archways, cast-iron railings and a tiled floor. There is also a workshop and storage space. Three large bedrooms are on the third level, including the master, which has an en suite bathroom, a wood-burning stove and a balcony offering views of the gardens and bay. A long hallway as ornate as the one on the level below is lined with a display case of taxidermied seabirds. (The furnishings are not included in the asking price, Ms. Clifton said, but can be bought separately.) The remaining bedrooms are on the top two floors, along with another kitchen and a sitting area. East Devon, which has a population of about 140,000, is a rural community in the county of Devon. It is about 160 miles southwest of London and is close to the town of Lyme Regis on the Jurassic Coast, a long stretch of shoreline declared a Unesco World Heritage site for its rich geological history. Stonehenge is about a 90-minute drive from the home, and Exeter Airport is about 20 minutes away. MARKET OVERVIEW The housing market in South West England has been steadily improving since the 2008 financial crisis, real estate agents said. But “the 1 million-pound-plus market in Devon is still below its 2007 peak, and certainly transaction volumes are lower than they were pre-2007,” said Chris Clifford, associate director for residential sales at Savills, in nearby Exeter. Home prices in Devon have risen marginally this year at the lower end of the market (below 500,000 pounds, or about $670,000), agents said. But they have remained mostly flat on the luxury side, thanks to the government’s decision to raise stamp duties on the purchase of second homes in recent years, Mr. Clifford said. (The higher taxes were put in place to help first-time home buyers.) Still, “the market in Devon appears to be recovering from this,” he said, “and the best-in-class properties are selling well.” WHO BUYS IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND South West England is a popular destination for tourists and second-home buyers, known for its historic cities and stunning rural countryside, with its rolling hills and rugged coastline. “Devon and the wider South West has some of the most spectacular scenery in the country,” said Craig Moore, a real estate lawyer and partner in the law firm Womble Bond Dickinson. Most buyers in the area come from other parts of England, real estate professionals said, and are often retirees or those close to retirement who can work remotely and commute to London once a week. The international buyers in South West England tend to be drawn to the high end of the market, above 3 million pounds ($4 million), Ms. Clifton said. “Many come from the Middle East and Asia, looking for classic British architecture next to top schools,” she said, adding that she has also seen interest from Americans and Europeans. BUYING BASICS Foreigners face no restrictions on buying property in Britain, though obtaining local financing can be challenging. “The application for a mortgage could be more stringent than usual if you are not based in the U.K.,” said James Gostling, who advises real estate clients at the law firm Devonshires, in London. Buyers are usually required to make a 10 percent nonrefundable deposit, and are advised to hire an experienced real estate lawyer to help with any financing needs and to oversee the transaction, which typically takes two to three months to complete. The lawyer will review the contract, conduct the necessary due diligence (including investigating the title and inspecting the property) and register the transferred title with HM Land Registry. Real estate agents also suggested having a surveyor inspect the property and advise on its value. Buyers do not need to be present at the closing, and “generally they aren’t,” Mr. Moore said. “Essentially the documentation gets signed by the relevant parties but not dated. The lawyers then complete between themselves the transfer of funds and the dating of the documents.” WEBSITES Rousdon Estate: rousdonestate.com South West Tourism Alliance: visitsouthwest.co.uk Official England tourism: visitengland.com Official British tourism: visitbritain.com East Devon: eastdevon.gov.uk Devon County: new.devon.gov.uk LANGUAGES AND CURRENCY English; pound sterling (1 pound = $1.34) TAXES AND FEES Home sellers generally pay the sales commission, typically 2 to 3.5 percent of the sale price, plus the VAT, or value-added tax. Buyers are responsible for paying a Stamp Duty Land Tax, levied on properties that cost more than 125,000 pounds (about $167,000); rates vary depending on the sale price. Those who own other properties elsewhere in the world also face a 3 percent surcharge above the standard rate, Mr. Gostling said. Other transaction costs include fees for the lawyer and surveyor, and for registration with the Land Registry. The annual council tax on East House, paid to the local government, is 3,528 pounds ($4,728), Ms. Clifton said. There is also an annual fee paid to the Rousdon Estate community, for maintenance, sewage and drainage, of about 1,100 pounds ($1,475), she said.

2018,House Hunting in … Hungary,"International real estate Budapest’s luxury housing has increased in quantity and quality in recent years, with new high-end properties that reflect a changing city. 11 Photos View Slide Show › This five-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom home is in the residential second district of Budapest, Hungary’s capital, on the western side of the Danube River, which bisects the city. The 4,090-square-foot house, which was completed in 2017, has an alarm system and various smart features, including heating and air-conditioning. It also has a generous lot of 13,175 square feet — which includes a terrace with areas for dining and lounging, an outdoor pizza oven, a pool and a sauna — making it an ideal place for holding large parties, said Zoltan Mezo, the general manager of At Home Network, the agency that has the listing. The main entrance opens into a large, double-height living-and-dining area. One wall has built-in, distressed-wood shelving arranged in a playful pattern; on the opposite side, sliding doors lead out to the backyard. A fireplace is tucked into a stone wall separating the living room and kitchen. Next to the dining room is an en suite bedroom, currently used as the master suite. There is a smaller bedroom and an adjacent half bathroom off the kitchen. A staircase near the entrance leads upstairs, where there are three additional bedrooms and a bathroom. A mezzanine hallway with built-in bookshelves overlooks the living room and connects the bedrooms. The basement has a two-car garage, a wine cellar, a gym and a laundry room. The surrounding neighborhood is popular with families, Mr. Mezo said, as there are parks and two international schools nearby. The house is about seven miles from downtown Budapest and about 20 miles from Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. Budapest’s luxury housing stock has increased in quantity and quality in recent years, said Chris Clarke, a founder of the real estate agency Clarke & White, and is “becoming on par” with that of other European cities. Historically, many of the luxury offerings were older renovated apartments and villas, Mr. Clarke said, but new high-end developments often have large terraces, smart home features and views of the Danube. The market reflects the changing city, which has a population of almost 1.8 million. In the central fifth district, which Mr. Clarke said is popular with foreign investors, the price per square meter of new apartments has tripled since 2015, reaching 1.5 to 2.5 million forints (or about $500 to $850 a square foot) at the high end. That is expensive for Budapest, he said, but still far cheaper than luxury property in Paris or London. (There is no central real estate database in Hungary, so all figures are based on anecdotal information or data compiled by individual agencies.) Andras Cornides, a sales manager with the real estate agency Tower International, said prices in Budapest’s desirable neighborhoods are about double what they were four or five years ago, and have grown around 15 to 20 percent a year over the past two or three years. Kornelia Pasztor, the Hungary branch manager of the international luxury real estate agency Engel & Völkers, said the most desirable of Budapest’s 23 districts are the first, second, fifth, 12th and the riverfront portion of the 13th. The first district, home to Buda Castle, is highly coveted and has almost no residential offerings; the sprawling, hilly second and 12th districts have luxurious villas; the fifth district, until recently a commercial hub, is home to infill projects and now has the city’s highest real estate prices. Agents said prices have been growing for several reasons: Hungarians have more personal wealth and are no longer delaying home purchases as they did during the global recession, and low bank savings rates are making real estate investment attractive by comparison. Also, foreigners have been investing, particularly in rental (and short-term rental) properties, and a government initiative lowered the sales tax on certain new apartments to 5 percent, from 27 percent, through the end of 2019. Mr. Mezo said about half of his agency’s luxury buyers over the past year were from foreign countries, including Israel, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Spain, Italy and, most of all, China. Ms. Pasztor said foreign buyers made up nearly the same amount of her agency’s business — about 40 percent — and most were from China, Germany, Austria, France and the United States. Buyers from outside the European Union must get permission from the government to buy residential property in Hungary, said Gabriella Galik, a founding partner of Budapest law firm KCG Partners. Permission is usually easily obtained; the fee is around $185, and the process can take up to two months. Transactions are typically handled by a lawyer, and the fee is normally no more than 1 percent of the purchase price. Closing costs also include a land registration fee of around $25, a property transfer tax of 4 percent of the purchase price and, when applicable, mortgage costs, which are set by the bank. Although the price of this particular listing is given in euros, most real estate transactions in Hungary are done in forints. Buyers of new homes pay a value-added sales tax of 5 or 27 percent, depending on various factors, including the size of the property, Ms. Galik said.

2018,House Hunting in … Italy ,"International real estate Relatively unknown to the international market, the coastal region of Abruzzo is on the rebound after a decade of falling home prices. 14 Photos View Slide Show › This three-story villa is in the Abruzzo region of Italy, due east of Rome, with views of the Adriatic Sea. It was constructed in the early 1800s and expanded and restored between 1999 and 2008. The one-acre property also includes a 538-square-foot guesthouse, an outdoor kitchen and a 75-foot swimming pool. The 4,844-square-foot home, which has three bedrooms and four bathrooms, was built with Tuscan-style bricks and wooden rafters, giving it a rural character. Up a stone stairway and under a portico, the main entrance is on the second floor. It opens to a spacious living room and dining area, with a patio beyond and a covered outdoor kitchen complete with barbecue and pizza oven. Trees and plants shade the area, which is used for al fresco dining. The second floor also has two bedrooms and a bathroom. Another bathroom was designed around a circular bulkhead space between the second and third floors. The master bedroom is on the third floor, with an en suite bathroom and a balcony and large terrace offering sea and hill views. A living room on the ground floor opens to a large porch; next to it is a dining room and indoor kitchen with stainless steel appliances. The ground floor also has a bathroom, two dressing rooms, a laundry room, ample storage space and a garage. Floors are travertine marble throughout, and the made-to-measure furniture is included in the asking price. High-tech amenities include central air-conditioning and heating, external video surveillance, motion-detecting sensors, a garden irrigation system and an armored vault. The guesthouse has a bedroom, small kitchen, sitting room with fireplace, bathroom and patio. The villa is in the province of Chieti, within walking distance of the small town of Santa Maria Imbaro, which has a variety of shops. The nearest beach is five miles away, in Fossacesia, on the Trabocchi Coast. The region has many restaurants, and its coastal towns are “bustling with night life,” said Tracey Nicholas, the owner of Abruzzo Reality, which has the listing. Cycling is popular and a coastal cycling track is under construction, she said. The closest international airport is about 45 minutes away, in Pescara, and Fiumicino Airport, in Rome, is about two hours and 45 minutes away. In the past decade, home prices in Abruzzo — which includes the provinces of Chieti, Pescara, Teramo and L’Aquila — have dropped around 30 to 40 percent, although they now seem to have bottomed out, Ms. Nicholas said: “We think they could start to rise again soon. Last year was our best year in 10 years, and this year is following a similar trend.” While housing sales in the coastal and densely populated areas of Abruzzo, like Pescara and its neighboring towns, may be picking up, there are still bargains to be found in the interior mountain and rural villages, said Giovanni Paravia, who handles foreign customer service for TopRE Abruzzo Mare e Monti, an agency in Spoltore. “The small villages have lost attractiveness to the locals that prefer, if possible, to live closer to their job location,” he said, “hence the prices for houses in the internal areas are falling.” That is good news for retirees seeking the charm and slow pace of an Italian village with access to skiing and beautiful beaches, said Lorna Richardson, the marketing director of Properties Around Italy, a London-based marketing portal for Italian real estate agents. “For middle-aged and older persons, it is heaven,” she said. “It is the ideal place to purchase a holiday home and totally, completely chill.” Abruzzo has villas, apartments, country houses and ruins — and home prices run the gamut. A two-bedroom holiday apartment with a garage close to the beach can usually be bought for 100,000 to 150,000 euros (about $117,000 to $175,000), Mr. Paravia said. A home with land in the countryside may cost as much as 200,000 euros (about $233,000), while large stone houses with historic features or villas with swimming pools sell for 400,000 to 600,000 euros ($467,000 to $700,000), he said. Unlike Tuscany, Umbria and the Italian lake district, Abruzzo is not well known in the international market, said Keith Purdie, the director of Abruzzo Property Italy, a London- and Pescara-based real estate agency. About half the foreigners who buy in Abruzzo are from the United Kingdom and Ireland, brokers said, although there have been fewer British buyers since the 2016 Brexit vote. The rest are Americans, Australians and Scandinavians, with the odd buyer from European countries like Belgium, France and Holland. Mr. Paravia said he used to see Russian buyers, but they have now largely disappeared. American buyers, who thinned out after the global real estate crisis of 2008, often “have previous history with Abruzzo,” Mr. Purdie said. “Their relations were born in the area and have emigrated, so they are trying to reconnect.” There are no restrictions on most foreigners buying real estate in Italy, although their home countries must have reciprocal buying agreements with Italy, brokers said. It is not necessary to hire a local lawyer, which could cost as much as 2,000 euros (about $2,300), brokers said, as home sales are handled by notaries, lawyers who are trained to handle title and other matters. On average, foreign buyers should budget 10 percent on top of the sale price to cover taxes and fees for the notary and the real estate agent, Ms. Nicholas said. But a buyer seeking a primary residence would have a reduced tax rate and should budget 5 to 6 percent, Mr. Paravia said. A permanent move to Italy, however, entails an arduous immigration process, Ms. Richardson noted. While mortgages from Italian banks are available to foreign buyers, getting one can be time-consuming and difficult, and is generally not recommended, brokers said.

2018,House Hunting in … Portugal,"International Real Estate 15 Photos View Slide Show › A SEVEN-BEDROOM VILLA IN THE ALGARVE $1.6 MILLION (1.4 MILLION EUROS) This 4,293-square-foot home, known as Villa Laguna, sits on a .69-acre lot, over a hillside from the small town of Moncarapacho, in the eastern Algarve, the southernmost region of Portugal, along the Atlantic coast. The house was designed by the Dutch owners, Anjo Van Engelen and Ronald Schelen, and a Portuguese architect to serve as a bed-and-breakfast, but “done in a way to also use it as a private house,” Ms. Van Engelen said. Pursuing their dream of “a better life in the sun,” she said, the couple moved to the Algarve from the Netherlands when the house was completed 10 years ago. On one side, the house overlooks a cluster of neighboring homes. On the other, sweeping views take in the trees, fields, Ria Formosa park, the Atlantic, and some of the Algarve’s salt pans, basins designed for sea-salt production using a method of saltwater evaporation dating to the Phoenicians. The three-level stucco house, which is listed by Luximo’s Christie’s International Real Estate, has seven bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. It sits on the crest of a knoll, beyond a stone wall with an electronic gate. The gravel driveway leads to a lower-level, two-car garage, and also winds past a cobblestone walkway leading to double entry doors topped by a half-moon window. A double glass door in the foyer brings light into the entry area. The floor is handmade terra-cotta tile. Vaulted ceilings throughout are accented by wood beams. On the main level, a dining room with an antique Dutch wood-burning stove doubles as a sitting area. Double glass doors open to a terrace in back. The galley kitchen, which has stainless-steel appliances, a natural stone countertop, a white subway tile backsplash and a high-top breakfast table, separates the guest wing from the owners’ private wing. The private living room has a wall built of stones from an “old ruin,” Ms. Van Engelen said, and the master suite has a bathroom with a vanity, a Jacuzzi tub, a shower, a toilet and a bidet. A staircase with an iron balustrade leads to the upper level, where there is a second bedroom with a Juliet balcony. A corridor off the foyer leads to five guest rooms, each of which has an en suite bathroom and opens to a covered porch. The property also includes a laundry room and storage on the lower level. The house is being sold furnished, except for a few personal belongings. In the backyard, a terrace with an in-ground saltwater pool is surrounded by a large deck covered in terra-cotta tile. Paths lead to a putting green and a fish pond. Moncarapacho has a cobblestone central square, restaurants, sidewalk cafes and small markets. A 10-minute walk away, in the fishing village of Fuseta, are more restaurants, lagoons and a ferry to Atlantic beaches. Several golf courses are close by. The drive to Faro Airport takes about a half-hour. MARKET OVERVIEW For the last three or four years, Portugal has been “a really great market to invest in,” said Ricardo Costa, chief executive of Luximo’s, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate. In the luxury market, prices have gone up 10 percent a year for the last three years, Mr. Costa said. Since the market started recovering from the global economic downturn in 2012, he said, prices have returned to, and in some cases surpassed, pre-recession levels. The mild climate helps, Mr. Costa said: “Portugal is becoming the Miami of Europe.” So does Portugal’s status as the “third safest country in the world,” he added, after New Zealand and Iceland, according to the 2017 Global Peace Index. In the Algarve, the prices rose 4.9 percent during the first quarter of 2018, said Michael Vincent, managing director of portugalproperty.com. The “extremely high demand from foreign buyers,” he said, exceeds the supply. Other reasons for the price increase include the access to top golf courses and beaches, good flight connections, stellar cuisine, high-end resorts, and marinas that accommodate super yachts, all of which “attract the rich and famous,” Mr. Vincent said. The average sale price for villas in the Algarve — from three-bedrooms in a prime area close to the coast to five-bedrooms slightly farther inland — is around 450,000 euros (or about $530,000), he said. At the low end of the market, apartments can sell from about 175,000 euros ($206,000) to 500,000 euros ($589,000). In very high-end areas like Quinta do Lago, Vale do Lobo and Vilamoura, mega-mansions of the sort you might see in Beverly Hills can fetch as much as 20 million euros ($23 million), Mr. Vincent said. While prices at the beginning of 2018 were higher in Lisbon, three of Portugal’s six most expensive areas — where prices topped $1,070 a square foot — were in the Algarve, including Lagos, Oeiras and Albufeira. Many of those who buy property in the Algarve are looking for an investment, said Joana Margarida Santos, office and sales manager of Portugal Sotheby’s International Realty, while “others invest and also want to live here.” A typical house rental can bring in between 10,000 and 50,000 euros ($12,000 and $58,000) a week in August, she said, and a four-bedroom house can go for as much as 60,000 to 70,000 euros ($70,000 to $82,000). WHO BUYS IN THE ALGARVE In this part of Portugal, “most owners and buyers are foreigners,” Mr. Costa said. About 70 percent are from England and Ireland, he said, and a number are French citizens, attracted by the area’s safety and the tax benefits. Recently, demand from buyers in Scandinavia, Germany and Italy has been outpaced by “a huge increase of American buyers,” Mr. Vincent said, “to the point it is our second-most-sold-to nationality, after only the United Kingdom.” Foreign buyers also come from Brazil, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada, Ms. Santos said. BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Portugal. A down payment of 15 percent, along with a promissory agreement, goes to the seller, not to an escrow account, Mr. Costa said, and a notary is required to handle the closing. The seller pays the real estate commission about five to six percent. Mortgages are available to foreign buyers, Ms. Santos said, but banks typically require about 40 percent down, and 80 to 90 percent of foreign buyers pay cash. Foreigners who buy property valued at 500,000 euros (about $589,000) or more are eligible for a Golden Visa that gives them a residency permit for five years, Mr. Vincent said, noting that this provides “a fast track for foreign investors from non-E.U. countries to obtain a fully valid residency permit in Portugal.” WEBSITES Portugal tourism: visitportugal.com Algarve tourism: visitar-algarve.com Algarve real estate: algarveportal.com LANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES Portuguese; euro (1 euro = $1.18) TAXES AND FEES Taxes and fees usually total about 7 percent of the purchase price of a property.

2018,"House Immigration Bill, Pitched as Compromise, Tilts to a Harder Line","WASHINGTON — An immigration bill pitched as a compromise between conservative and moderate Republicans would make sweeping changes to the United States’ immigration system while establishing a special visa program that would give young undocumented immigrants the chance to become citizens based on factors like employment and education. The draft bill, circulating among lawmakers on Thursday afternoon and up for a vote next week, closely adheres to President Trump’s vision for an immigration overhaul. In addition to protecting the young immigrants, it provides billions of dollars for a wall on the southwest border while imposing new limits on legal immigration. The bill would also toughen rules for asylum seekers. And it would address the separation of children from parents under the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal border crossings by mandating that families be kept together while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, according to a summary of the measure. In effect, the measure would offer Democrats and immigration moderates in the Republican Party a difficult choice: accept hard-line changes to much of the immigration system in exchange for protections for young undocumented immigrants and what appears to be a modification of the wrenching policy of splitting up families at the border. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, tried Thursday to blame Democrats for the family-separation policy that the Trump administration started — because Democrats have refused to accept the broader changes in immigration policy demanded by the president. “The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close, and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade,” she said. The proposed bill, the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018, grew out of weeks of negotiations between Republican conservatives and moderates. “We’re bringing legislation that’s been carefully crafted and negotiated to the floor,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said Thursday. “We won’t guarantee passage.” And its passage is far from assured. Within hours of the draft’s release, Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that it would urge lawmakers to vote against the measure, deriding it as “amnesty.” Immigration rights groups are almost certain to oppose it, as well. And Democrats, who were cut out of negotiations, will most likely oppose it. “It is nothing more than a cruel codification of President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda that abandons our nation’s heritage as a beacon of hope and opportunity,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. In one sense, Mr. Ryan has already succeeded, having quashed a rebellion from moderate lawmakers who were attempting to use a parliamentary maneuver known as a discharge petition to force votes this month on immigration. Had the petition succeeded, the House would have considered — and almost certainly passed — a bipartisan measure that would pair a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers, with enhanced border security. But the petition fell two signatures short of the number it needed — and moderates lost much of their leverage. Mr. Ryan called the new immigration measure a “very good compromise” and said he hoped it would pass. But Democrats and other critics of the speaker said that the bill is destined to fail, and accused Mr. Ryan of putting it on the floor solely to give political cover to the moderates, many of them vulnerable in this fall’s midterm elections and facing demands from constituents to address the Dreamers’ fate. Hundreds of thousands Dreamers have been shielded from deportation by an Obama-era initiative known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Mr. Trump moved last year to end. Under the proposed bill, Dreamers would be able to apply for a six-year renewable legal status, assuming that they meet certain criteria, including having been under 16 when they entered the United States. The new merit-based visa program would give them an avenue to obtain citizenship — though the program would be open to others beyond Dreamers, a design that could make it less offensive to conservatives loath to approve any kind of “special pathway” to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Through the program, Dreamers would be able to obtain green cards, and, in turn, citizenship. The program would include a point system based on qualifications like education level, military service and employment. The draft bill also includes changes to the legal immigration system. It would eliminate the diversity visa lottery system, which is intended to bring in immigrants from underrepresented countries. It would also curb family-based immigration, eliminating the visa categories for married children of United States citizens and siblings of adult citizens. Such family-based migration is the cornerstone of the existing immigration system, but Mr. Trump has been pressing to move toward a system that favors educated professionals and skilled workers. The bill would beef up border security, providing funds for Mr. Trump’s promised wall on the southern border with Mexico, while also including changes intended to strengthen immigration enforcement — important provisions to conservatives and to the president. In an apparent effort to discourage lawmakers from rescinding funding for the wall in the future, the bill would tie the border-wall money to the issuance of visas under the merit-based program. Republicans, who said Thursday afternoon that they were digesting the 293-page document, seemed to have mixed views. A major question is whether conservatives, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, will support the legislation. “It’s going to legalize people who are illegally in America,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who is known for his hard-line views on immigration. He said he would vote against the bill: “That’s amnesty.” But Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who considers himself a “center-right” Republican, said that he was encouraged by the draft and that the negotiations that produced it had been unifying for the Republican conference. “It’s forced all of the different perspectives to come together and talk about what really matters,” Mr. MacArthur said.",The New York Times
2018,House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise,"WASHINGTON — The House rejected a hard-line immigration bill on Thursday and Republican leaders delayed a vote on a compromise measure that seemed destined to fail, then delayed it again, in the latest show of their party’s disarray over immigration. The compromise, a broad immigration overhaul negotiated by moderate and conservative Republicans, was supposed to be voted on early Thursday evening. It would provide a path to citizenship for young unauthorized immigrants while keeping migrant families together at the border, in addition to funding President Trump’s border wall. But with its prospects seeming dim, Republican leaders pushed the vote to Friday and huddled with their members in a last-ditch effort to stave off what would have been an embarrassing defeat. Then they delayed the vote again, to next week, as lawmakers discussed making additions to the legislation. The turbulent day in the House offered yet another reminder of the deep divisions over immigration vexing Republicans, with no easy solutions in sight. Looming in the background throughout was Mr. Trump, who attacked Democrats and complained on Twitter that they “don’t care about security” and “won’t vote for anything!” To some extent, Mr. Trump’s retreat on Wednesday on separating families at the border appeared to lessen the pressure on Congress to quickly pass a legislative fix. But the immigration votes were part of a long-running drama that can be traced back to a different action by Mr. Trump: his move last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which had shielded the young immigrants known as Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the country as children. The House went through with a planned vote Thursday afternoon on the hard-line immigration bill, named after its chief sponsor, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The measure had not been expected to pass, but conservatives had sought a vote on it anyway. The bill failed, 193 to 231, with 41 Republicans in opposition, along with all 190 Democrats who voted. The Goodlatte bill would have sharply reduced legal immigration while beefing up border security, cracking down on so-called sanctuary cities and requiring employers to use an internet-based system called E-Verify to confirm that they are hiring legal workers. It would have offered a three-year renewable legal status to DACA recipients. The compromise bill, meanwhile, is facing trouble with conservatives, who would be taking a political risk by supporting a bill that has been derided as offering “amnesty” to young undocumented immigrants. Republican leaders appear to be hoping that with a bit more time, the legislation can be modified to win over reluctant members, with the addition of an E-Verify provision as one possible change. Republicans in the Senate are backing narrow legislation to ensure that children are not taken from their parents at the border. But they were in disagreement with Democrats over how to do it, and senators from both parties tried Thursday to tamp down expectations that the chamber would pass a solution that would make it into law quickly. In the House, Republican leaders were trying to keep the compromise bill alive after it had appeared headed toward defeat. “I am a big fat no — capital letters,” Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania, said before the vote was delayed until next week. “I’m going to encourage other people to vote no because it doesn’t stop amnesty.” Early in the day, Mr. Trump did not appear to help matters, venting his frustration on Twitter that even if the House passed immigration legislation, it would require Democratic support to clear the Senate. In effect, the president suggested that voting for the bill might be a pointless exercise — not exactly a persuasive message for conservatives on the fence about whether to support a measure that could rile up their party’s right flank. The compromise bill came together as House Republican leaders tried to defuse a rebellion from moderates seeking action to protect the Dreamers. The moderates had used a parliamentary tactic known as a discharge petition in an attempt to force a series of votes on immigration, including on a bipartisan bill that would have paired a path to citizenship for Dreamers with strengthened border security. The rebellious moderates ultimately fell two signatures short of what they needed to force votes this month. Like the Goodlatte legislation, the compromise measure is a wide-ranging bill that would make significant changes to the immigration system. Among other things, it would provide billions of dollars for Mr. Trump’s promised wall along the southwest border with Mexico. It would offer a six-year renewable legal status to Dreamers, and it would create a new visa program through which they could eventually receive green cards based on factors like education, employment and English proficiency. In turn, they could become citizens. To respond to children being separated from their parents at the border, House Republicans added language to the bill intended to keep families together when parents are prosecuted for crossing illegally. Before Mr. Trump signed his executive order on Wednesday, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had promoted the compromise bill as providing a fix to the crisis, saying it would keep families together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security as legal proceedings played out. Democrats have condemned the bill, which generally aligns with Mr. Trump’s stated requirements for any immigration overhaul. “It is not a compromise,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. “It may be a compromise with the devil, but it’s not a compromise with the Democrats, in terms of what they have in their bill.” House Republican leaders did find one bright spot on Thursday: The House narrowly passed its version of the farm bill, which failed last month after it became caught up in the Republican discord over immigration. The House’s farm bill, which would impose new work requirements on food stamp recipients, passed with only Republican votes. The Senate did not include those contentious changes in its version of the bill, which has bipartisan support but still needs to clear that chamber. The Senate is set to act on its legislation next week.",The New York Times
2018,House Rejects Immigration Overhaul Despite Trump’s Late Plea,"WASHINGTON — The House resoundingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite a last-minute plea from President Trump, as internal divisions in the Republican ranks continued to hobble legislative efforts to protect the young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. The 121-to-301 vote was an embarrassment both to Mr. Trump and to House Republican leaders, who had spent weeks trying to bring together conservatives and Republicans with moderate views on immigration — and ended up with little to show for the effort. In the end, nearly as many Republicans voted against the bill, 112, as for it, 121. The defeat provided the latest display of the Republican Party’s disunity in Congress on immigration. And it highlighted the continuing inability of both the House and the Senate to resolve the fate of the Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children. Many of those undocumented immigrants have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Mr. Trump moved last year to end. Republicans in the House are now likely to turn their focus to narrower legislation that would seek to keep migrant families together at the border, an issue that senators are also looking to address. But with the Fourth of July approaching and lawmakers close to returning home for a recess, it was not clear how quickly a narrower measure might move forward. The House is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. A Republican aide said the chamber would not take action on the family separation issue until after the recess. The frustrations over immigration in Congress are matched by the confusion in the Trump administration. A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction on Tuesday stopping the administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordering that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days. The Justice Department responded by putting pressure on lawmakers, saying in a statement that the judge’s order “makes it even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together.” “Without this action by Congress, lawlessness at the border will continue,” the department said. But the House vote demonstrated the difficulty of developing any kind of broad immigration legislation that can clear even a single chamber of Congress. This year, the Senate rejected a series of immigration measures, and last week, the House rejected a hard-line immigration bill favored by conservatives in that chamber. For their part, Democrats have offered their support for legislation to provide Dreamers with a path to citizenship while beefing up border security. But they have been unwilling to support legislation that fulfills Mr. Trump’s wider demands on immigration, including making cuts to legal immigration. All 189 Democrats who voted on Wednesday opposed the bill. “Once again, Republican leaders put a partisan immigration bill on the floor, and it failed overwhelmingly,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip. “When will they realize that the path forward on immigration and asylum reform must be a bipartisan one?” Hours before the vote, Mr. Trump used Twitter to implore Republicans — in all capital letters — to pass the bill, which would have provided more than $23 billion for border security, including for his promised wall, while keeping migrant families together at the border and providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers. But coming days after Mr. Trump had told Republicans in Congress to forget about immigration until after the midterm elections, his last-minute change of mind did not prove persuasive. In the end, the lack of consensus within the party on immigration was glaring. “We attempted to bridge the divide,” Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and the chief deputy whip, said after the vote. “What’s clear is there’s no Republican-only DACA fix,” Mr. McHenry said. “There are certainly Republican votes for border security, but the problems that President Obama left for us with DACA will not be easily remedied simply with Republican votes.” The bill rejected Wednesday would have made significant changes to the immigration system, and it generally adhered to Mr. Trump’s stated requirements for any overhaul. It would have limited family-based immigration, and it would have eliminated the diversity visa lottery, which admits immigrants from countries that do not send many people to the United States. But despite the painstaking negotiations among Republicans to try to arrive at a broad immigration overhaul that would be acceptable to different ideological factions within their conference, the resulting compromise still ran into trouble with conservatives. It was derided on the right as “amnesty” for offering a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. “This bill was not the sort of bold immigration reform that America supported when it elected Donald Trump to be president, nor does it reflect the priorities of a conservative-led legislature,” said Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida. The vote on Wednesday followed a push by moderate Republicans, many facing difficult re-election bids, to compel the House to take action protect the Dreamers. They used a parliamentary maneuver known as a discharge petition in an attempt to force a series of votes on immigration, but fell two signatures short of what they needed. Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, a leader of the moderates who pushed for action on immigration, did not hide his frustration with the outcome of the vote. “Today,” he said, “a coalition of shortsighted House members shamefully came together to preserve the broken, inefficient, unfair immigration system that misgoverns our country.” For now, the DACA program has been kept alive by the courts, but the failure of Congress to agree on a legislative fix means that hundreds of thousands of Dreamers will continue to face an uncertain future. Democrats were quick to assign blame. “Republicans maintain full control of Washington,” said Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, “and their failure to deliver on immigration reform is both a reflection of the Republican Party’s antipathy towards immigrant families and their inability to govern.” House Republican leaders twice delayed a vote on the immigration overhaul last week to give themselves more time to build support. But by Wednesday, their last-ditch efforts had failed to produce any outpouring of enthusiasm. Mr. Trump did not help matters. Last Friday, he tweeted that Republicans in Congress “should stop wasting their time” on immigration legislation until after the midterm elections in November — a message directly at odds with the effort in the House to build support for the bill. The president could have been a valuable salesman in persuading wavering Republicans to get behind the legislation. Instead, his conflicting messages only added to the discombobulation that Republicans have not been able to escape on the politically delicate subject of immigration.",The New York Times
2018,"House Votes to Trim Unused Funding, a Gesture of Fiscal Restraint","WASHINGTON — With annual budget deficits nearing $1 trillion, the House took a modest step on Thursday to broadcast fiscal responsibility, narrowly approving a White House plan to rescind nearly $15 billion in unspent funding that had been approved in past years. The bill would reduce actual spending by a total of $1.1 billion from 2018 to 2028, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a small act of penance after Congress approved a $1.5 trillion tax cut in December, then a $1.3 trillion spending plan in March whose heft exasperated conservatives. The new bill would have little practical effect, given that much of the funding was not expected to be spent anyway. And the reduction in spending would be virtually imperceptible, as the total deficit from 2018 to 2028 is projected to exceed $13 trillion. The House voted 210 to 206 to pass the measure, a so-called rescissions package. The effort to rescind leftover funds had been championed by a leading contender to be the next House speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. “President Trump’s spending cut request is a straightforward and smart way to trim a bloated federal budget,” said Mr. McCarthy, who is the majority leader. Democrats were united in opposition. Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that after last year’s tax cuts, the bill “is like putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound.” Mr. Trump has touted the package as “historic.” But Republicans in the Senate have largely not leapt to embrace the effort to cancel unused funding. It was not clear whether the plan would go anywhere in that chamber. “We’ll evaluate it,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, told reporters, passing up the opportunity to express any enthusiasm about the measure. The Trump presidency has been a bleak period for those concerned about the growing debt, especially after Republicans eagerly approved last year’s tax overhaul that was projected to widen deficits. The deficit is now expected to exceed $1 trillion in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and the national debt has topped $21 trillion. Among the funding to be rescinded is $7 billion for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP — a curious move in an election year, at least from a public relations standpoint. But the budget office said canceling that funding would not change what the government spends on CHIP or affect the number of children with coverage.",The New York Times
2018,How 3 Letters From Trump Might Help Bring the 2026 World Cup to the U.S.,"MOSCOW — When the officials leading the United States’ bid to host the 2026 World Cup — a joint effort with Mexico and Canada — hit the campaign trail in earnest this year, they quickly encountered uncomfortable questions from soccer associations around the world concerned about President Trump’s travel restrictions on people from many countries. How could a country host the world’s most-watched sporting event if it were inhospitable to visitors? Would visas be granted, some federations asked, to all teams and their fans if their countries qualified? With a rival bid from Morocco mounting a surprisingly strong challenge, the concerns could not be ignored. But if the North American bid is victorious on Wednesday, when soccer officials around the world will vote to award the 2026 World Cup, the United States soccer leadership will thank one person for helping them convince the world that Mr. Trump’s policies would not be a factor: Mr. Trump himself. Since March, Mr. Trump has provided United States soccer officials with three letters addressed to Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body. Each letter, part of an extensive but largely unseen United States government effort to support the bid, contained increasingly specific guarantees that foreign teams, officials and even fans will face no restrictions on entering the U.S. for World Cup matches in 2026 if their countries qualify for the tournament. In effect, the letters assured officials voting on the event that Mr. Trump’s hard-line stance on visas would not apply to the World Cup. The letters were reviewed by The New York Times; they have not previously been reported. In the most recent letter, dated May 2, Mr. Trump cites the 1996 and 2002 Olympic Games and the 1994 World Cup as examples of major international events hosted by the United States, and he assures Mr. Infantino — and by extension FIFA voters — that “I am confident that the United States would host the 2026 FIFA World Cup in a similarly open and festive manner, and that all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” Of course, a second Trump term would end in 2025, more than a year before the event, a fact the United Bid officials also have pointed out to voters. That has not seemed to matter, soccer officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada said Monday. What has eased the minds of some voters, the U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro said, is the mere existence of his letters — printed on crisp White House letterhead and marked with Mr. Trump’s distinctive, inch-high signature at the bottom in thick black pen strokes. “You know, in this environment, he says that, in writing — it’s pretty powerful,” Mr. Cordeiro said. In order to produce the letters from Mr. Trump, the White House began an interagency review to craft the language in them, according to a person familiar with the bid. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and his team also kept in touch with Canada and Mexico in what were sometimes the only harmonious interactions with the United States’ neighbors amid loud public clashes over trade and immigration. And just as Morocco has enlisted current and former government ministers to take its 2026 message abroad, the United States government has at times played an even more active role: the National Security Council has been in touch with other countries whose votes could help put the United States over the top, the person familiar with the bid said, and Mr. Kushner leveraged his relationship with the Saudi royal family to get Riyadh to publicly announce its support for the North American effort. The 2026 World Cup will be the first with 48 teams, up from the current 32, and the sheer scale of the undertaking — more than 1,100 players, plus the requisite stadiums, training sites, hotels and transportation infrastructure to accommodate their federations and their fans — had made the North American bid an early favorite. But the World Cup also requires that the host open its doors to all, and Mr. Trump’s public comments about immigrants, African countries and Muslims quickly became a talking point as North American soccer executives made the rounds campaigning for votes. For example, Iran, one of six predominantly Muslim countries on a list of eight countries Mr. Trump has sought to limit travel from, has qualified for the past two World Cups. Syria, another country singled out by Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions, narrowly missed out on the final day of qualifying last year for the 2018 event. Mr. Trump has made only two public comments on the World Cup bid, and neither was seen as particularly helpful. On April 26, he tweeted, “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid.” Then, days later, in a Rose Garden appearance with the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, he pressed African countries to support the North American bid. “We will be watching very closely, and any help that they could give us in that bid, we would appreciate,” he said. Many observers, inside soccer and out, saw each remark as a threat toward nations whose federations voted for Morocco. But there were other issues, too. A North American World Cup almost certainly would mean increased cross-border travel at a time when Mr. Trump has pushed for tightened borders. So even before Mr. Trump’s public remarks about the 2026 race, officials with the bid began asking for letters to reassure FIFA and its voters that its effort had the full support of the United States government, and Mr. Trump began signing them. On March 9 he wrote to Mr. Infantino expressing his support for the North American bid in “the spirit of continental partnership.” Three days later he sent a second letter, which included five bullet points pledging that the United States would respect FIFA rules that required, for example, the playing of any country’s national anthem, the display of any national flag and respect for human rights. Then, in mid-April, after members of FIFA’s technical committee visited Mexico, the United States and Canada to evaluate the bid’s readiness, Mr. Cordeiro met with Mr. Kushner at the White House. Mr. Cordeiro thanked White House officials for the administration’s support throughout the bidding process, a person familiar with the meeting said, and then asked for one final set of clarifications from Mr. Trump guaranteeing access to all visitors should the Americans win the bid. “FIFA could have red-flagged us if we hadn’t been able to give these assurances,” Mr. Cordeiro said. The North American bid had entered the 2026 race early, and nearly ran unopposed. But Morocco, a four-time loser with its previous World Cup bids, including to the United States in 1994, has proved a resilient opponent. Morocco has stressed its passion for soccer, its proximity to the European television market and, curiously but pointedly, its “very low gun circulation.” Once prohibitive favorites, the North Americans remain cautiously optimistic that they will prevail — “I feel we have a path to victory,” Mr. Cordeiro said Sunday — but they also remained wary as they crisscrossed the globe seeking support. In the five weeks since Mr. Trump’s May 2 letter was created, it has traveled the world. Mr. Cordeiro and the presidents of the Canadian and Mexican soccer federations, Steve Reed and Decio De María, have been to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe in the past two months. They knew at each stop that should a potential voter raise the issue of visas, they could refer to the president’s letter, an image of which always was available for reference with the swipe of a finger across a cellphone. Mr. Cordeiro even quoted it in a letter of his own, sent on May 25 to the top officials of each of FIFA’s 211 member federations and shared with The Times on Monday. “In our bid’s discussions with football associations around the world, one topic has been visa and entrance requirements to the United States in 2026,” Mr. Cordeiro wrote. “I want to assure you that we take this matter very seriously and that the U.S. government has made strong commitments to FIFA.” Mr. Cordeiro also cited a March 12 letter from the secretary of state at the time, Rex Tillerson, in which the United States confirmed its intention “to issue visas, subject to eligibility under U.S. law, without regard to race, skin color, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, disability, wealth, birth or any other status, or sexual orientation.” “We are confident,” Mr. Cordeiro added in his letter, “that these guarantees will ensure that every eligible fan and member of our FIFA family will have unhindered access to our country to experience and celebrate the 2026 FIFA World Cup.”",The New York Times

When we go to a place like Hillstone, we’re going to be so on top of it purely because that company is so proud of their training regimen. We’re like, “O.K., well we’re still minor leaguers, right? Those guys are major. How can we better our staff as a small company to rival the consistency and the reliability of those other kinds of restaurants?” GOING GREEN We just moved into our apartment, and we’re 95 percent done with the construction at the restaurant. The thing about modern design is that it can come off sterile, or like very cold. So we kind of need some green to make it feel more alive. We bought plants on the Lower East Side, and I was outraged how much the prices were. TOOLS OF THE TRADE We’ll go to Brooklyn and there’s this place that has plates and enamelware. We’ll go to places like that and scope things out. I like to find deals. I like Sur La Table. When we’re not at work or when we have time off, it’s still kind of work, but still kind of shopping. We do that or I’ll sharpen my knives. If they don’t need to get sharpened, I’ll at least oil them up. WHAT’S NEXT TO EAT? We’re doing errands until like 4. Then we rest. We have another coffee. Definitely another coffee, and this time we’re just drinking it out of the refrigerator. We’re hanging out. We’re just really just refreshing, we’re using the restroom, sitting down and then goes the, “What’s next to eat?” PLAYING WITH FOOD I try to do fun things with my chefs and cooks. Like, “Let’s create something that not necessarily will 100 percent make it onto the menu, but let’s try some new dishes out like cook it at your house and bring it over, a type of potluck or whatever.” But really it’s just so I bond with my team. LATE NIGHT Angela will call it quits and go to bed around 11, but me and Kim will stay up until 2, and my brother will just stay and hang out and either watch TV, or watch TV and talk about work, or look at ridiculous food online on Instagram. We’ll tag each other on like a nine-patty burger, “Yo, what is this?” Kim’ll send me photos of seafood towers and we’ll be like, “Oh man, like let’s go to The Dutch.” It’s just the most unhealthy relationship.",The New York Times
2018,How Amazon Steers Shoppers to Its Own Products,"It started with a simple battery. Around 2009, Amazon quietly entered the private label business by offering a handful of items under a new brand called AmazonBasics. Early offerings were the kinds of unglamorous products that consumers typically bought at their local hardware store: power cords and cables for electronics and, in particular, batteries — with prices roughly 30 percent lower than that of national brands like Energizer and Duracell. The results were stunning. In just a few years, AmazonBasics had grabbed nearly a third of the online market for batteries, outselling both Energizer and Duracell on its site. Inside Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, that success raised a tantalizing possibility. If, with very little effort, Amazon could become a huge player in the battery market, what else might be possible for the company? Anyone who spends much time on the Amazon site can see the answer to that question. The company now has roughly 100 private label brands for sale on its huge online marketplace, of which more than five dozen have been introduced in the past year alone. But few of those are sold under the Amazon brand. Instead, they have been given a variety of anodyne, disposable names like Spotted Zebra (kids clothes), Good Brief (men’s underwear), Wag (dog food) and Rivet (home furnishings). Want to buy a stylish but affordable cap-sleeve dress? A flared version from Lark & Ro ($39), maybe in millennial pink, might be just what you’re looking for. On the surface, the move into the private label business (in which goods are sold under the retailer’s name rather than that of an outside vendor) appears to be a deft move by Amazon. Analysts predict that nearly half of all online shopping in the United States will be conducted on Amazon’s platform in the next couple of years. That creates a massive opportunity for Amazon to more than double revenue from its in-house brands to $25 billion in the next four years, according to analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. That’s the equivalent of all of Macy’s revenue last year. Furthermore, in an effort to incentivize shoppers to sign up for the Amazon Prime program (which now costs $119 a year, up from $99 a year ago), certain of Amazon’s private-label products, such as its Goodthreads men’s khakis or Wag’s salmon-and-lentil dog food, can be purchased only by Prime customers. “Amazon started very slowly in private label,” said Youssef Squali, a managing director of internet and digital media research at SunTrust. “Quite frankly, we think our estimate for the size of the private-label business is conservative,” he added. Amazon declined to make any of its executives available for this article, but in a response to a list of questions, the company said its overarching goal is to provide customers a wide range of products and brands. “We take the same approach to private label as we do with anything here at Amazon: We start with the customer and work backwards,” the company said in its statement. Amazon is hardly alone in its charge into private label. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have been offering store brands for years and are also racing to start more private labels, particularly in apparel. But Amazon holds a unique position in the global marketplace. From its beginnings in 1994, Amazon’s platform was designed to democratize retail. Small vendors or manufacturers could sell outdoor grills, computer bags, and children’s toys alongside established brands. Now, with its expansion into private label, Amazon has shifted away from being an impartial, may-the-best-product-win distribution partner to being a direct competitor to those other vendors. It’s not just lower prices that are driving Amazon’s customers to its private-label goods. Amazon is utilizing its knowledge of its powerful marketplace machine — from optimizing word-search algorithms to analyzing competitors’ sales data to using its customer-review networks — to steer shoppers toward its in-house brands and away from its competitors, say analysts. And as consumers increasingly shop using voice technology, the playing field becomes even more tilted. For instance, consumers asking Amazon’s Alexa to “buy batteries” get only one option: AmazonBasics. The emerging private label threat from Amazon presents a quandary for small vendors and big, national brands alike. Even as Amazon takes away market share and eats into their profit margins, they have little choice but to continue to sell on Amazon’s platform in order to get themselves in front of millions of potential customers. “I think, effectively, you have a company that has conspired with about a billion consumers and technology to destroy brands,” argued Scott Galloway, a founder of business research firm now called Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business, in a presentation last year. “Their attitude is that brands have, for a long time, earned an unearned price premium that screws consumers.” But as Amazon uses its powerful platform to bolster its private-label business, there is also debate in legal circles whether some of its activities could be viewed as monopolistic in nature. Some say Amazon could face a legal challenge akin in size and scope to when the Department of Justice two decades ago filed antitrust charges against Microsoft for bundling its own browser into its software, making it difficult for consumers to install a browser from Microsoft’s top competitor, Netscape. Microsoft lost that court battle. “I think there is a potential monopolization case against Amazon,” said Chris Sagers, an antitrust professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in Ohio. “The Amazon marketing people are geniuses. They’re brilliant,” Mr. Sagers said. “But if they are getting massive penetration in the market and preventing customers from buying products from their competitors? Well, it’s like they’re writing the plaintiff’s complaint for them.” In an emailed response, a spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is “a small fraction of a very large and vibrant global retail industry, and the competition and invention happening across retail is great for customers.” Type the word “batteries” into Amazon’s search bar and the first thing that will catch your eye is a large sponsor ad running across the top of the screen for Energizer, featuring its ubiquitous drum-playing pink bunny. But after that, the screen is filled with offerings for AmazonBasics batteries, many flagged with badges that denote them as a “best seller” or “Amazon’s Choice,” a designation for items that are highly rated and have low customer returns. Energizer would not say how much it pays Amazon for the banner advertising, but several people with knowledge of Amazon’s pricing say some large brands are spending six figures each month advertising their products on Amazon’s platform even as Amazon’s private-label products are crowding them out. Are the big brands fighting a battle that may be impossible for them to win? For more than two decades, shoppers perusing the aisles of Walmart have run into cans of Sam’s cola or coffee alongside national brands on the shelves. In Costco, shoppers can pickup store-brand Kirkland paper towels and bacon. (Store brands are typically priced well below their big-brand peers because they do not spend money on expensive national marketing campaigns like Procter & Gamble or Kimberly-Clark.) But now, Amazon and many of these big-box retailers are increasing their private-label efforts. In the past year, sales of in-house labels of food and nonfood goods at brick-and-mortar stores grew more than 4 percent, while sales of name brands were flat, according to data from Nielsen’s Total Food View research. For Amazon, the starting line for deciding what goods or products to replicate for an in-house brand is not that different than what happens at retailers like Target or Walmart. They look at what is selling online and figure out if they can manufacture it cheaper. Commodity goods like paper towels, exercise mats, and power strips can be easily cloned at a fraction of the cost. In other cases, particularly apparel, Amazon may use private-label goods to fill a gap if clothing manufacturers or high-end designers are unwilling to sell on their platform. Shoppers looking for Ralph Lauren polos or button-down oxford shirts won’t find them sold directly on Amazon, for example. But they will find Amazon Essentials polos in a rainbow of 16 shades, priced at $12, or oxfords by its Goodthreads label for $25. Amazon’s advantage over traditional retailers is its knowledge and access to data from its platform. Take word searches. About 70 percent of the word searches done on Amazon’s search browser are for generic goods. That means consumers are typing in “men’s underwear” or “running shoes” rather than asking, specifically, for Hanes or Nike. For Amazon, those word searches by consumers allow it to put its private-label products in front of the consumer and make sure they appear quickly. In addition, Amazon has the emails of the consumers who performed searches on its site and can email them directly or use pop-up ads on other websites to direct those consumers back to Amazon’s marketplace. Some of this data is also available to big brands or vendors selling on Amazon’s platform through a program called Amazon Retail Analytics Premium. But it is expensive, with vendors paying 1 percent of their wholesale cost of goods sold to Amazon or a minimum of $100,000 to get access to a database that lets them see some, but not all, of the data Amazon has compiled. “Amazon has access to data that nobody else has,” said James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now works at Buy Box Experts, a consulting firm that advises companies on how to build their brands and sell products on Amazon. “I can’t just walk into a store and say, ‘Excuse me, did you look at this brand of cereal this morning and decide not to buy it?’ Amazon has that data. They know you looked at a brand and didn’t buy it and they’re not going to share that data with any other brands.” With that data, Amazon is able to conduct regional or one-day price tests, dropping the cost of its goods in certain markets to discover at what price more customers purchase the item. And while traditional retailers can readily scan their sales data and understand what size shirts and colors sell and which ones don’t, Amazon has hundreds of reviews of competitors’ products on its website, providing customer feedback on how the shirt looked after five washes or how it fit different body types. “Amazon can analyze those reviews and figure out why customers were dissatisfied with a certain product,” said Cooper Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner L2. “Amazon can then turn around and create a private label for a similar product but improve upon it based on what customers say.” When Amazon introduces a new private-label product, it doesn’t go all in. It often uses a technique analysts call “test-and-repeat,” ordering a small batch of product from its manufacturers, testing demand and then, if the product is successful, reordering a bigger batch of product as well as expanding its assortment. Again, here, Amazon has a big leg up on traditional retailers. Most retailers appeal to one segment of consumer — the budget, midmarket, or higher-end shopper. Amazon can offer a variety of private-label goods, positioned toward shoppers in different categories, says Deborah Weinswig, the founder and chief executive of Coresight Research. For instance, through Amazon’s Pinzon brand, it offers a queen-size hypoallergenic mattress topper for $40.37. But it also sells a mattress topper through its AmazonBasics private label for $22.99. Similarly, Amazon sells men’s button-down shirts under both the Amazon Essentials and Goodthreads labels. Analysts at research firm Gartner L2 found, on best-selling products, the Goodthreads apparel cost 60 percent more. But, perhaps more important, Amazon has utilized a reviewing program called Amazon Vine for many of its private-label goods. Amazon Vine, or Vine Voices, are very active reviewers on the Amazon marketplace who are then invited by the company to participate in its Vine program, which identifies them as influential reviewers. In exchange for free products, which they disclose receiving, the reviewers agree to write evaluations on Amazon’s site. Amazon has actively used Vine Voices to help introduce its private label brands. An analysis of more than 1,600 products across ten of Amazon’s private-label brands, including AmazonBasics, Amazon Essentials, Mama Bear, Pinzon, Goodthreads, and others, showed that about half had Vine reviews. Of those 835 products, more than half of the first 30 reviews were from the Vine program, according to ReviewMeta.com, an online tool that helps customers identify inauthentic reviews. While, for the most part, the Vine and non-Vine reviews were similarly rated, in a handful of cases, the Vine reviews were significantly better. For instance, Vine reviews for Amazon’s Mama Bear diapers and baby products averaged 4.36 stars; non-Vine reviews averaged 3.82 stars. Amazon Vine is also available to non-Amazon brands, but, specifics around how the program works are difficult to determine because Amazon doesn’t make it public. But many analysts say it is fairly expensive to participate, saying it can cost manufacturers as much as $5,000 to obtain reviews for one product, along with the cost of giving the product away. (The money to participate goes to Amazon; the Vine reviewers receive no compensation beyond the free product.) A spokeswoman for the company said Amazon does not incentivize positive star ratings or attempt to influence the content of reviews. She also said that the company limits the total number of Vine reviews that it displays for each product. “What’s happening on Amazon is different than you see in brick-and-mortar stores,” said Kevin Grundy, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies. “There, private label brands might take slightly more than 10 percent market share. Amazon’s private label brands are taking more than 25 percent of the online market.” Mr. Grundy said when the contract for the AmazonBasics batteries, which are currently made by a manufacturer in the Far East, next comes up for bid, likely bidders could include Energizer and Duracell. The next frontier? Alexa. Competitors and industry analysts are closely watching Amazon’s voice-operated platform, wondering whether Amazon will use that rapidly growing arena to further steer consumers to its own brands. In a voice test of various categories using the Amazon Echo devices last year, researchers at Bain & Co., found in categories in which Amazon offered a private-label product, Alexa recommended those products 17 percent of the time. Noting that the private label goods represent only about 2 percent of total volume sold, the Bain researchers said, “the online retailer clearly positions its own private labels favorably in voice shopping.” Early last year, the Yale Law Journal published a note that was simply titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The essay, written by a law student named Lina Khan, argued, essentially, that the current framing of the nation’s antitrust laws have not evolved to deal with the market power of technology giants like Amazon. Just a few weeks earlier, The Capitol Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based news service that examines business and regulation, published a story arguing Amazon risked antitrust enforcement by the Trump administration for using its algorithms and platform to promote its own products over “those of merchants that are dependent on Amazon’s platform and with whom Amazon competes.” The articles fed into a growing debate among economists and lawyers around whether Amazon is displaying monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior in its marketplace. Amazon has two strong defenses when these issues are raised. At least since the 1970s, courts have been very skeptical of antitrust plaintiffs who can’t show that the challenged conduct would cause prices to go up or quality to go down. In this case, Amazon can argue, quite vehemently that, through its platform, consumers are paying lower prices, say legal experts. And while Amazon’s brands have quickly gained market share on its platform in some areas, in other segments, such as apparel, they account for less than 1 percent of the inventory sold. And when broadened out to include brick-and-mortar stores, its online share of the battery market equals less than 5 percent. Until Amazon’s share of the total market starts to reach closer to 40 percent or more, it is difficult to argue there is an attempted-monopolization case, say legal experts. But if its private-label business grows as analysts expect it to do, could it face a legal challenge of whether it is a “monopsony”? In a monopsony, a large buyer controls a large proportion of the market and drives prices down. “If Amazon is not making its competitors available on voice and Alexa, well, that sounds like possible exclusionary conduct to me,” said Mr. Sagers. “If a federal court could be convinced that there is a market for in-home, voice retail distribution and that Amazon controls it, then I think Amazon could be looking at a monopsony case.” Still, others argue a dominant question in any sort of antitrust action has been whether the company’s actions or a planned merger would harm consumers. “You have to show that the end game is some sort of consumer harm, either through higher prices or lower quality,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. “And so far, Amazon doesn’t even show up on the radar screen when it comes to consumer harm.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How America Treats Immigrant Families,"Letters To the Editor: Re “In Retreat, Trump Halts Separating Migrant Families” (front page, June 21): Signing an executive order ending the policy of removing children from illegal migrants crossing the border should not and cannot be seen as a victory for President Trump. For God’s sake, he started the fire and now he wants to be celebrated for putting it out. Enough already. PAT NEWMANSTAFFORD SPRINGS, CONN. To the Editor: As President Trump signed the executive order on Wednesday, he remarked, “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.” Translation: “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of the onslaught of wall-to-wall negative coverage I received, so I decided to act.” JOHN R. ARBITELL JR.MALVERN, PA. To the Editor: I am very sympathetic to the plight of children being separated from their parents. What I am not sympathetic to is the use of children as instruments for getting into our country illegally. Some of these children may not even be the individual’s sons or daughters. They are being used as pawns by undocumented individuals to cross the border. I was an immigrant myself in 1949 as a Holocaust survivor, and my parents had to apply for a visa and provide two American sponsors to show we weren’t going to be a burden to this country. The vetting process took three years, but they followed protocol until we were approved. Families who want to enter our country should go through the same appropriate channels, showing appropriate documentation for themselves and their children. ERICA LINDEN-FINEBERG NEW YORK To the Editor: This month alone, my family and I bade farewell to Aziz, Bahiaa, Carlos, Esteban, Sergio and Miguel, men and women who had entered America with nothing more than the hope of a brighter future. Each worked — hard — in the United States for more than a decade (we employed several of them). Each passionately pursued citizenship. And each was rebuffed at every turn by a system that is Orwellian, and a political atmosphere that is toxic. Simply put, they gave up on America. We are but one New Jersey family. Do the math. How many good, hard-working people are “fleeing back” to their countries with the story of an America that doesn’t care? Our hearts are not only broken. They are enraged. PHILIP TAFT, HOPEWELL, N.J. To the Editor: “Incivility Infests Life in the U.S. on Trump’s Cue” (White House Memo, front page, June 21) mentions some objections to comparing the current separation of children of the seekers of asylum to the separation of children during the Holocaust. As a Holocaust survivor who lost his whole family, I do not consider the gradation of evil appropriate. Once the threshold of civility has been breached, the evil that results should be condemned, not ranked. MICHAEL KATZ, NEW YORK",The New York Times
2018,"How Angela Goding, of MoMA PS1, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine When she’s not attending Art Basel Hong Kong, visiting studios in Beijing or traveling to the Berlin Biennale, Angela Goding, director of development at MoMA PS1, relishes putzing around her new home of Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. A 30-plus-year New Yorker and a self-described “hardcore Manhattan snob,” Ms. Goding, 50, said she never spent a night in Brooklyn prior to moving to the borough last October with her partner, Charles McMickens, 58. On Sundays, Ms. Goding said that she avoids the phone and computer, and focuses instead on “hanging out with my man who I don’t see enough of and being local.” SLEEP SLOTHS One of the benefits of not having children or animals is that I can easily sleep nine or 10 hours. On Sundays, we’re in bed until 10. It seems very slothful. We are completely lazy and relishing the lack of alarm clocks and me having to dash off somewhere. I need my minimum nine hours sleep for optimal functioning. It’s very decadent. I figure it recharges me for the rest of the week. You need it for the mental energy for dealing with New York City. DINER FARE We get up and go to my favorite place, it’s this diner called Mike’s Coffee Shop. It’s one of the oldest diners in Brooklyn. It’s just this down-and-dirty beautiful, iconic Brooklyn diner with a bar. I’ll drink black coffee. We’ll have pancakes or I’ll get poached eggs and muffins. Charles always gets the grits. SUNDAY SERVICE We go to the 11 o’clock service at the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church. I don’t consider myself Christian. Nor does Charles. There’s this new, young pastor from Yale. It’s not so heavy handed about Christianity. It’s about being a good community member, being socially engaged, doing good work. I find it very inspiring. There’s something real and refreshing of being able to go to a place with someone you love and just contemplate, be grateful and feel part of a community, something larger than yourself. EXPLORING Depending on the weather, we’ll ride Citi Bikes to somewhere in Brooklyn. I love riding through the Fulton Mall, which is one of those areas where it’s Brooklyn at its romantic finest. It’s so colorful. It’s just so alive. You hear these snippets of conversation that are amazing. It’s really unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. LIGHT LUNCH We love going to DeKalb Market Hall. It’s this food court in City Point. We spend a lot of time there. We go grocery shopping. Pain D’Avignon sells really delicious cranberry pecan bread. We’ll go there and stock up for the week. Foragers has a butcher shop there. There’s this amazing hand roll place called Daigo Hand Roll Bar. I have a Sapporo and two hand rolls. PAPER PLEASURES We always stop by Greenlight Bookstore on Fulton Street. I went through a phase where I read everything electronically, and now I’ve gone back to actual books. The people who work there are super knowledgeable. I can always find something. DUMPLINGS FOR DINNER I like eating early around six or seven. We make Chinese dumplings from scratch on Sunday nights. I was taught it from my mother and she was taught it from her mother. We make a big batch of dumplings and freeze them for the rest of the week. It’s a relatively time-consuming endeavor because you have to make the dough, roll it out, make the filling and then stuff them. It’s very labor intensive, but it’s also really meditative. We’re hanging out in the kitchen, listening to music, drinking wine. THE IDEAL MAN We drink a lot of wine. Charles runs an all-natural wine store so we have free flowing wine on Sundays. Mostly esoteric, delicious Northern Italian wines are his specialty. He also has an ice cream business, which in the summer time is called Fort Grace Ice Cream. He’s the ideal man. He has wine and ice cream, and we always have plenty of those in our house. The wine is key. BATH BEFORE BED In the master bathroom, there’s a huge bathtub. I’m 5-foot-11, and I can fit totally submerged in this bathtub. I’ll run an amazing, luxurious Epsom salt and lavender bath and soak. I’ve never ever had a bathtub that I could completely fit my frame into. MUSIC AND MALT BALLS We read a lot and listen to music while we’re finishing up the wine. That’s usually how we chill out at the end of the night. I listen to a ton of classical music. It’s funny; we’ll have red wine and malt balls in bed. We get those from Sahadi’s. They’re delicious and they don’t make crumbs.",The New York Times
2018,How Anthony Bourdain Inspired Two World Travelers for The Times ,"What would the world of travel and food reporting look like now without his gusto? Jada Yuan and Lucas Peterson on the adventurer who made the world more exciting. Last fall, when I was applying for a job I never thought I’d get, to spend the year traveling to each place on The Times’s 52 Places list, I got hooked watching Anthony Bourdain’s “Raw Craft” series on YouTube. It’s quieter than his food shows; he’s just highlighting master craftsmen, but his awe and appreciation of their skill is palpable. I had been trying to find someone less obvious for inspiration and just — of the hundreds of videos I watched, there was no one else who could make me care about a shoe or a sandwich the way that he did. What would the world of travel and food reporting look like without the humanity he brought to it? Would I have had the confidence to apply for this job? Would this job even exist? What I loved most is the gusto. Mr. Bourdain’s taste buds and legendarily steely stomach might have objected to a few of the delicacies he guzzled down on camera for our vicarious entertainment, and education, but he was, above all, a tireless ambassador for testing your comfort zone, for being all in. He was even a fan of durian, the tropical fruit so pungent it’s banned from hotels in Thailand. “Your breath will smell as if you’d been French-kissing your dead grandmother,” he said. From him, that was a ringing endorsement. It was also the first time I had heard of durian. I’ve still never had the guts to try it. Mr. Bourdain, for many of us viewers and admirers, didn’t just bring us to street carts in Cambodia and inside home kitchens in Mexico; he made them tactile and Technicolor. He was the friend on the road trip who jumps into the dark, dank pond first, and then ropes you in: “This is terrible! Get over here!” I could never make watching his shows a habit, though. He was too convincing. The wanderlust would hit like torture. Trying exotic foods was never what got to me about what he did. It was the way he could wander into a village in Indonesia and spend the day having a laugh and a delicious roadside dessert with a trail of children who spoke no English. He made travel seem like an accessible joy to anyone who could save up enough money to buy a plane ticket — which was a pretty powerful notion for someone, like me, who was answering phones for New York magazine when his first book, then first TV show came out. I’d devour his writing and grab quotes from him at parties (he was a wealth of colorful insights) and then see him out at a restaurant in the city. Before him, the only travel personality I remember knowing of was Robin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.” In recent years, so many have pointed out, he became an activist, speaking out on behalf of women like his partner, Asia Argento, in her allegations of rape against Harvey Weinstein, and questioning his own role as a man in ignoring women's stories. Looking back, his life's work was activism: Championing good food, showing the warmth to be found in a stranger's backyard, leading with humor through a miserable windstorm in Iceland, opening eyes. News of Mr. Bourdain’s death of apparent suicide came extremely hard Friday morning. I was sitting in a hotel lobby in Bristol, England, after a few very tough days on this job that I owe in part to him. He had been in France, one time zone away from me, and people in the States were just beginning to hear. Sadness, for him, for his family, for his friends, some of whom I know, crashed down in overwhelming waves. So did empathy. For four and a half months I have been on the road by myself, experiencing just a taste of Mr. Bourdain’s life of the past two decades. Traveling is a beautiful privilege but it is also incredibly lonely. You’re in new environments constantly, you feel untethered from a support system, and sometimes you even forget who your support system is. Lives move on, and often away from yours, when you're on the road and working intensely. I've found that the push-pull of seeing loved ones and having them leave, or having to leave them, can be harder than not seeing them at all. Talking on the phone with my therapist is some of the most important work I do every week. People tell you often that you have a dream job, and you feel some obligation to keep up that fantasy for them, to not show the cracks. I can’t imagine what pain Mr. Bourdain was dealing with, but I do know what it’s like to have to go home to a hotel room in a city where I know no one and wrestle with mine. Always going first can wear on a soul. Jada Yuan is traveling to every place on this year’s 52 Places to Go list for The New York Times. I like to imagine that Anthony Bourdain spent at least a few hundred nights over the course of his life in a similarly nondescript hotel room like where I currently am, futzing with the electric outlet by the bed, and pecking out words on a laptop while the moon rises over Jakarta, or Buenos Aires, or Istanbul. Fighting jet lag, fighting loneliness. He had seemingly carved out for himself the gig of a lifetime, and paved the way for a lot of us who have also been lucky and able to make careers traveling and exploring different countries and cultures. I think that’s what makes this loss particularly confusing and devastating, and why so many have been compelled to share photos taken with him, personal experiences, and stories about the times they hung out with him. For many of us, he was not just another writer or personality to admire. He was literally who we wanted to be. And if success, respect from your colleagues, getting to eat your way around the world and generally just being the coolest person on the planet doesn’t guarantee happiness, what hope do the rest of us have? I don’t know the answer to that, nor do I understand the extent of his pain and internal battles. But I know that, as a traveler and writer, I owe him a lot. I probably owe him more than I realize. Bourdain didn’t invent food and travel journalism, but he made it so exciting. He was like the one high school history teacher you had that made you feel like learning was actually fun. His voice was raw, and it was unique. And he took that voice, hooked it up to an old amplifier he’d jury-rigged with twine and electrical tape, and blasted his message to every corner of the world. The message was uncomplicated: Go to the place. Eat the thing. Talk to the person. Mr. Bourdain made you want to spend weeks in places you never would have thought to visit, and devour plates of food you may never have before dared to try. He made the unapproachable look appealing; the daunting look downright attractive. The first season of his CNN show, “Parts Unknown,” went to places like Myanmar, Libya, and Congo. By challenging the idea of what a travel show could be and where it could go, he accomplished more than just good TV; he helped give a voice to places and people that were absent or underrepresented in media. And that made the world a more understanding, more curious, and kinder place. Mr. Bourdain knew better than anyone that travel and food were the two things that could hope to heal a fractured world. I always appreciated his honesty; he managed to be hopeful without sugarcoating reality. He understood there was both great beauty and great ugliness in the world and dared to present both to us. He didn’t equivocate or euphemize, and he championed and defended regular people. Right now, I’m in Istanbul on a Friday night. When the sun sets, vendors selling mussels appear on the sidewalk in certain parts of the city. I don’t see them during daylight hours. The mussels guys tote big shallow baskets full of yellow lemons and shiny black shells that clack like mah-jongg tiles as they’re counted and stacked. And while they looked appealing, I wasn’t planning to try them. I had been warned against eating the mussels, and that seemed like pretty sound advice. But Anthony Bourdain has just died and tonight, sadness and confusion outweigh all else. I’m going to have some street mussels even though I’m a little bit afraid of them. They might be good and they might not be, but that’s not really the point. I will eat them because I’ve never tried them before, because it’s what people do here, and because I imagine he would have done the same thing.

2018,How Anti-Immigration Passion Was Inflamed From the Fringe,"WASHINGTON — Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller spent years on the political fringe in the nation’s capital as high-decibel immigration hard-liners, always warning about the dangers of open borders but rarely in a position to affect law or policy. Now, Mr. Sessions, the attorney general and former senator from Alabama, and Mr. Miller, the president’s top policy adviser and former Senate aide to Mr. Sessions, have moved from the edges of the immigration debate to its red-hot center. Powerful like never before, the two are the driving force behind President Trump’s policy that has led thousands of children to be separated from their parents at the nation’s southern border. It was Mr. Sessions who ordered prosecutors to take a new “zero tolerance” attitude toward families crossing into the United States, part of his plans to reshape the country’s law enforcement priorities to limit immigration. It is Mr. Miller who has championed the idea inside the White House, selling Mr. Trump on the benefits of a policy that his adversaries have called “evil,” “inhumane” and equivalent to child abuse or the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. “The U.S. government has a sacred, solemn, inviolable obligation to enforce the laws of the United States to stop illegal immigration and to secure and protect the borders,” Mr. Miller said in a recent interview. Asked if the images of children being taken from their parents would eventually make the president back down, Mr. Miller was adamant. “There is no straying from that mission,” he said. On Monday, as an audio recording became public of children crying for their parents after being separated at the border, Mr. Sessions vigorously defended his zero-tolerance policy. “We cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws,” Mr. Sessions declared in a speech to law enforcement officers. The partnership between Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller began in 2009, when Mr. Miller, a conservative rabble rouser and contrarian who emerged from the left-leaning Santa Monica, became a spokesman for the senator. He sported sideburns and skinny ties as he often delivered long and passionate lectures to reporters, and anyone else who would listen, about the dangers of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. Mr. Sessions, 71, had strong views shaped by his experience as a young politician in rural Alabama, where he saw immigrants take jobs at a poultry plant away from poor, unskilled Americans. During more than a decade as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general, and 20 years in the Senate, Mr. Sessions came to believe that immigrants, whether here legally or illegally, posed a direct threat to the country by depressing wages, committing crimes and competing for welfare benefits. He was deeply influenced by the work of George Borjas, a Harvard economist who has said that immigrants have an adverse impact on the economy. Mr. Miller, 32, had gone from California to Duke University. While a student, he met David Horowitz, a right-wing provocateur and the founder of Students for Academic Freedom, which opposed progressive thought on college campuses. After Mr. Miller graduated, Mr. Horowitz helped him get a job with Michele Bachmann, then a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, and recommended him highly to Mr. Sessions. Together Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions often drew on the work of anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies — some of which are derided as hate groups by immigration activists and civil rights organizations. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white nationalists and other hate groups, describes FAIR as having “a veneer of legitimacy” that “hides much ugliness.” By 2013, Stephen K. Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, invited Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions to a dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that served as the headquarters for the conservative news outlet. The three bonded over an article titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters,” foreshadowing the case they would help Mr. Trump build during his presidential campaign. Later that year, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly to defeat a bipartisan immigration bill. The senator spent hours on the floor arguing with his colleagues while Mr. Miller churned out a nonstop flurry of news releases. He cast the fight against immigration in dramatic terms, with the future of the nation at stake. The bill passed the Senate, but Mr. Sessions worked with conservatives in the House to ultimately defeat it. In 2014, Mr. Miller presented Mr. Sessions with an award at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach, Fla., as part of the ceremony held by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Mr. Bannon was there as well. But it was Mr. Trump who pulled Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions — and their views about immigration — out of the political shadows. In January 2015, when few were watching, Mr. Sessions wrote a 23-page memo that predicted that the next president would most likely be a Republican who spoke to the working class about how immigrants had stolen their jobs. Most mainstream politicians ignored the memo, but its contents influenced Mr. Trump. At a raucous 2015 rally in Mobile, Ala., he sensed the power of the immigration issue as a crowd of 30,000 supporters roared with approval at his promise to build a wall across the southern border and crack down on illegal immigration. By then Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller were the architects of the immigration agenda of the long-shot Trump campaign. In 2016, Mr. Sessions endorsed Mr. Trump for president — his first ever endorsement of a candidate in a primary — and Mr. Miller did as well. Both men have something else in common: They are largely unfazed by criticism or bad press. Mr. Sessions is known for proudly holding opinions thought to be retrograde. Under his high school yearbook photo was the caption: “He is a host of debaters in himself.” While serving as Alabama’s attorney general, he supported reviving chain gangs of volunteer inmates and tighter identification requirements for Alabama voters. Mr. Miller is similarly immune to critiques from establishment Republicans, who often view his immigration positions as far out of the mainstream and politically dangerous. In the recent interview, Mr. Miller dismissed as ignorant the hand-wringing of Republicans about the family separation controversy. “You have one party that’s in favor of open borders, and you have one party that wants to secure the border,” Mr. Miller said. “And all day long the American people are going to side with the party that wants to secure the border. And not by a little bit. Not 55-45. 60-40. 70-30. 80-20. I’m talking 90-10 on that.” On Monday, as Mr. Trump vowed that “the United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” he continued to falsely blame congressional Democrats for a policy driven by Mr. Miller and Mr. Sessions. He once again called for legislation that would crack down on immigrants and decrease the need to separate families at the border, even though there is no law that requires families to be separated. Echoing the president, Mr. Sessions urged lawmakers to pass legislation to build a wall along the southern border and impose new restrictions on immigration that he said would end legal “loopholes” that let illegal immigrants in. “If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness,” Mr. Sessions said, “we won’t face these terrible choices.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly named an organization that tracks white nationalists and other hate groups. It is the Southern Poverty Law Center, not the Southern Policy Law Center.",The New York Times
2018,How Argentina Lost Its Way. (Spoiler: It’s Not Messi’s Fault.),"In the early hours of Friday morning, Argentina’s World Cup squad returned to its training facility at Bronnitsy, a few miles outside Moscow, in almost complete silence, the mood funereal. The country’s World Cup hopes hang by a thread: not of winning it, but of merely qualifying for the knockout rounds, of avoiding immense embarrassment. A crushing 3-0 defeat to Croatia in Nizhny Novgorod on Thursday left Argentina reliant on others to stay alive in the tournament: the team’s coach, Jorge Sampaoli, and his players must beat Nigeria in their final game, and hope that Iceland — the smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup — fails to beat Croatia. [Follow our coverage of Argentina vs. Nigeria] This is not how Argentina’s summer was supposed to go. Boasting the world’s best player, Lionel Messi, a phalanx of outstanding forwards and a coach with a fine record at the international level, Argentina arrived in Russia with hopes of going one better than it had in Brazil four years ago, when it lost in the final, and winning its first World Cup since 1986. So, what has gone wrong, and what can be done about it? Does it make sense to put all of the blame on the coach? In his postmatch news conference on Thursday, Sampaoli could barely raise his eyes to face his interrogators. On half a dozen occasions, maybe more, he made it clear that only one person should take responsibility for the fact that Argentina was now on the brink of elimination: him. “Had I set things up differently, they might have turned out much better,” he said. “I probably did not understand the match as I should have.” Sampaoli made mistakes, without question, in terms of player selection, in terms of tactics, in terms of preparation. Following their tie with Iceland in the opening game, Argentina’s players only had three training sessions to get used to the system Sampaoli introduced for the game against Croatia, the most dangerous opponent in Argentina’s group. It looked it, too: against Croatia, Argentina had a defense left exposed, a midfield that was overrun, and an attack that was blunted. There was an emotional failure, too. Sampaoli’s style has always relied a little on organized chaos: it was the relentlessness of his Chile teams that led him to such success with that country, and in no small way led to him being given the Argentina job. Against Croatia, though, cooler heads were required, particularly after falling behind in such unexpected circumstances, on a goalkeeping blunder. Sampaoli did nothing to help. He threw on attacking players seemingly at random, with little apparent design and to no obvious end. He proved incapable of thinking his way out of the problem. Diego Simeone, the Atlético Madrid coach, described it as “chaos,” pointing to a “total lack of leadership” in a WhatsApp message to his assistant, German Burgos, that somehow went viral. Simeone, who played in three World Cups for Argentina, had been a contender to take charge of the national team before Sampaoli took the job. Maybe, in hindsight, he would have done better. In 13 games as coach of Argentina, Sampaoli has used 13 lineups, and a total of 59 players. He has never given an impression that he knows what he wants this team to be, or who — beyond Messi — he wants to be in it. There was no plan B, to be used in an emergency, because he had not yet settled on plan A. And yet, it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that all of this is more deep-seated than poor team selection, or just one underwhelming managerial tenure. In the last 13 years — the span of Messi’s senior international career — Argentina has had 8 coaches. Some have been cross-the-fingers, hope-for-the-best appointments: Diego Maradona and Sergio Batista, say. Others, like Alejandro Sabella, Alfio Basile and Edgardo Bauza, have been uninspiring, but experienced, relatively well-regarded coaches. Sampaoli, like José Pekerman and Gerardo Martino, came with impressive résumés and widespread public support. Though Argentina’s international record is not quite as poor as is often claimed — a World Cup final and two Copa America finals in recent years is better than most — it has still not won a trophy since 1993, and given the talent at its disposal, it has failed to live up to its own standards. Should Argentina fail to reach the round of 16 in Russia, Sampaoli will be fired. If past experience is anything to go by, that alone will not solve the problem. So, if it’s not all Sampaoli’s fault, it must be Messi’s? Before we get to that, let’s make one thing abundantly clear: Lionel Messi does not need to win the World Cup to have a case to be the greatest player of his era, or even of all time. The logic that only World Cup winners could be true greats is an antiquated one. It was true enough when it was only on that stage that the very best on the planet regularly encountered each other: a time when Pelé spent his entire career on one side of the Atlantic, and when Maradona played only a handful of European Cup games in his career. It is not true now, given that we have the Champions League, and Messi can face his peers over and over again, from September until April or May. That is the stage where greatness is bestowed, and Messi has shone on it often enough certainly to be one of the two finest players of the 21st century. Whether he’s better than Cristiano Ronaldo — and whether either of them are better than Pelé, Maradona, Johan Cruyff or anyone else — is, more than anything, a matter of personal taste, but it should not be determined by whether he has won a World Cup or not. It is, after all, hardly Messi’s fault that Nicolas Otamendi is the best defender Argentina can produce. Messi, though, does not seem to see it that way. There has been a longstanding, and now somewhat clichéd, allegation that he does not deliver for his country, one that somehow managed to linger after he carried it to the World Cup final four years ago and a couple of Copa América finals at the same time. Even more hackneyed is the idea that he does not care, that because he has spent so much time away from Argentina that he somehow lacks the requisite passion to represent his nation. His behavior in the last week or so should expose that thinking as flawed: the stress was evident as he stood for Argentina’s anthem in Nizhny Novgorod; he had avoided a family barbecue at Argentina’s training facility in Russia in the days preceding the game, preferring to stay alone in the room he shares with Sergio Agüero. Even before that, his determination to do something for his country — to win the World Cup, to cement his greatness — was clear. Messi volunteered to change his own role so as to enable Sampaoli to make more use of the likes of Agüero, Ángel Di María and Gonzalo Higuaín. He has made tactical suggestions, too, to try to improve the team. In some lights, perhaps that looks like the sort of egocentrism more associated (rightly or wrongly) with his great rival, Ronaldo. In others, it is a veteran player, one of the best of all time, desperate to succeed. That none of it has worked, that Messi still seems such a shadow of himself in the blue and white of his nation, could be one of two things. Perhaps he is inhibited by the pressure, crushed by the weight of his country’s expectations, and his own. That seems unlikely: he is well used to performing under pressure, and in an environment that is, at times, no less dysfunctional, at Barcelona. Perhaps, then, as Sampaoli said, the flaws in the rest of the team “cloud” Messi’s abilities, and prevent him from shining in the way that Ronaldo can for Portugal. His brilliance cannot disguise the shortcomings of the others. Wait, what? This is a team with Higuaín, Agüero, Paulo Dybala, Di María and the rest: Messi’s teammates are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Are they really that bad? There are two issues here. One is psychological: all of those players rank among the best in the world in their positions at club level, but they have long seemed totally dependent on Messi for Argentina. Against Iceland and Croatia — and for years now — it was striking how few of them seemed willing to try to ease the burden on him. Too often, Argentina’s plan seems to be to funnel the ball to Messi and hope for the best. It almost worked in Brazil four years ago, but much of the time it makes the team predictable, and easily contained. Croatia, for example, deployed Marcelo Brozovic to shut down Messi in Nizhny Novgorod. He did his job extremely well — Messi did not have a shot until the 64th minute, and made just 15 passes in the first hour — but, more tellingly, none of Messi’s teammates was able to take the reins. If Messi is not firing, Argentina does not seem capable of coping. The rest of the players are diminished in his presence. The other issue is that Argentina’s squad is almost comically front-loaded. That signifies two issues: one is that Sampaoli can not, realistically, squeeze all of it into the same team. No system could adequately accommodate Dybala, Higuaín, Agüero and Messi, let alone the likes of Mauro Icardi, the prolific Internazionale striker left out of the squad (purportedly to suit Messi). Sometimes, having that many choices can be paralyzing: it may be that the richness of his resources is what has left Sampaoli so indecisive in his time in charge of Argentina. The other, more serious, issue is what that abundance of attacking choices says about the team’s defense. There is a valid question over whether the midfield Argentina has brought to Russia is capable of playing the way Sampaoli desires — the intense, high-pressing style that has brought him so much success — but it is at the back that Sampaoli has had to make do with what he has got. Otamendi, Marcos Rojo, Gabriel Mercado, Federico Fazio: these are not elite central defenders. And at fullback, with the noteworthy exception of Ajax’s Nicolas Tagliafico, the problem is just as pronounced. Eduardo Salvio, an attack-minded right-winger, has played as a fullback and a wingback in Russia so far. In effect, Argentina’s strength is all in one place; too much of the rest of the team is a wasteland. In contrast, Portugal — and all discussions of Messi must come back to Ronaldo — boasts a well-drilled defense and midfield. Ronaldo is the only star, but he has a reliable platform from which to perform. Messi’s situation is the polar opposite: no matter how much he excels, there is always a chance the ground will shift beneath his feet. Why is that? Why does Argentina have such a dearth of defenders? This is the key issue, the one that has trapped Argentina below the waterline, and the one the country must start to address if its time in the international wilderness, at least trophy-wise, is to come to an end. Argentine domestic soccer is in a state of almost permanent financial crisis. Many of its clubs lead a hand-to-mouth existence, their business models entirely reliant on selling players — ordinarily very young players — either directly to European clubs or, until the practice was banned, to investment firms hoping to profit on the country’s vast resources of talent. That model, naturally, tends to place the focus much more on attacking players than defensive ones: it is the gifted forwards and wingers who attract the premium fees, who are more likely to be sold on to Europe for the sorts of sums that can keep a club afloat. Argentina used to produce rafts of central defenders: recent World Cup squads have included players of the caliber of Roberto Ayala, Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Chamot, Walter Samuel and Oscar Ruggeri. By those standards, the current crop — Otamendi, Rojo, Mercado — is hardly vintage. And it is an entirely predictable consequence of an approach to youth development that now prioritizes short-term profit over long-term need. Argentina was, for many years, the gold standard for nurturing young players. Its production line seemed to be endless, despite a comparative lack of investment, players emerging from the barrios of Buenos Aires to take on the world. It has won the Under-20 World Cup a record six times, most recently in 2007, with a squad that included Di María and Ever Banega, both in Russia this year with the senior team. Since then, though, the success has stopped, leading to concerns that the talent has dried up. That is unlikely to be the case: Cristian Pavon, a 22-year-old winger with Boca Juniors, has emerged from this World Cup with his reputation enhanced. But the system does not seem to be working as it once did. Players leave for Europe too young, stunting their development at the crucial moment; energies are directed toward identifying attacking phenomena, rather than the painstaking work of educating defenders. There is a lack of scheming midfielders, too, a byproduct of what might be called the Bielsa Orthodoxy: the intense, hard-running style of play of Marcelo Bielsa, Sampaoli’s mentor, is now so widespread in Argentina that players capable of stopping and thinking are in short supply. Argentine soccer used to be defined by what they call pausa: a playmaker’s ability to wait for the exact moment to play a pass. There is no pausa in Argentine soccer any more. The game against Croatia was the perfect example: all running, no thinking, an advertisement for a country that has lost its way.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Britain Lost Its Power of Seduction,"Aatish Taseer Mr. Taseer is a novelist and a contributing opinion writer. “The place of those who have ceased to rule is to teach,” V. S. Pritchett wrote of Spain in 1954, as the British Empire was collapsing around him. By the end of the 20th century, Britain had long since ceased to rule. But in India, where I grew up and which had been a British colony for nearly 90 years and subject to its growing influence since the 1700s, it continued to feed us in myriad ways. The phantom limb of empire outlasted Britain’s physical presence; we felt ourselves bound, as if by an invisible cord, to our former colonial masters. It wasn’t just the side of the road we drove on, our army and our system of government. Britain was part of our cultural heritage. From the books we read — Enid Blyton and the Biggles adventure series as children; Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene and W. Somerset Maugham as adults — to the way we organized our schools and examinations, our spellings and pronunciations, Britain exerted tremendous influence. Britain was the place where we aspired to go to university. If there was a big international news story — the civil war in Sri Lanka, say — it was to British newspapers and radio that we turned for credible information and analysis. The British seemed more knowing than their American counterparts, less provincial. They were at home in the world. Their history of empire made them a kind of cultural pivot in the Anglophone world. This was even truer for the republic of letters. Since the time of Joseph Conrad, Britain had been able to recognize new voices and project them beyond its borders. British critics, editors and literary agents were better positioned to judge foreign writing than American ones. And for well over a century, Britain was the place where African and Asian writers, like myself, would come, be understood and hope that our talent would be broadcast to places with bigger readerships, like America. A roll call of great writers — V. S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Chinua Achebe, J. M. Coetzee — owe their existence to Britain as the supreme arbiter of writing from farther shores. Now may be the first time in a hundred years this is no longer true. I had an experience the other day that made me realize how much the shape of my world had changed. My British publisher, with which I’d been working since the beginning of my writing career nearly a decade ago, wrote to say it could no longer publish my books. It praised the new work on submission, cited the low sales of past work and then told me that “the market has changed.” What had changed? Brexit, of course. Two years ago this week, a slim majority of the British people voted to make their country more isolated, less worldly. While the exact contours of Britain’s exit from the European Union are still being debated, the shock of the country’s retreat from the wider world is being felt acutely. It ought to have been devastating news, a literary death sentence. For a writer as myself, with a colonial background and a home market in India that could not wholly support him, Britain had played a key role in terms of prestige and influence. British publishers, operating out of norms that were as anachronistic as they were offensive, often demanded “commonwealth rights” of colonial writers. We surrendered them unthinkingly, believing Britain to be the keystone to our success. It is only now with Britain out of my life that I can see how the vestiges of a colonial mind-set had led me to exaggerate the country’s influence. For long before Brexit, my cultural moorings had been shifting in accordance with a new reality: America had stepped in to fill the void left by Britain. It was America where we now aspired to go to university; American magazines and newspapers that we went to for information about world affairs; American literary agents and publishers that were prepared to publish what Britain no longer could. India, in the meantime, had also grown by leaps and bounds, and could support its own writers as never before. It was just Britain that had fallen out of the equation. It was as if the post-empire glow, like light emanating from a star that has died, had finally gone out. To my surprise, I have found myself mourning the part Britain had played. As a colonial power, Britain was abhorrent; but in the past 50 years, as its real power shrank, it played an outsize role in the transmission of culture through the English-speaking world. In America, where I went to university and where I now live part of the year, I am constantly aware of the tremendous cultural distance from India, which a shared familiarity with English can conceal. Britain, in its 20th-century avatar as a translator between different English-speaking societies, made it easier to join the dots. It created an atmosphere of cross-pollination in the Anglophone world that gave, and continues to give, us people as far apart as Trevor Noah and Arundhati Roy, Wole Soyinka and Zadie Smith. Britain, as an intermediary, could often be patronizing and superior. The British demanded exotica from Indian writers, as if it was our job to falsify the reality of our places for their entertainment. In America, one is free of colonial baggage. But it was also true that in America one had to make the case for why the country should care about any given issue in the world beyond, which usually meant, “How does it affect us?” Britain, with its colonial past, seemed almost obliged to care. Freed of imperial possessions, and yet effortlessly cosmopolitan, Britain escaped the fate of so many larger countries. What Borges said of big countries could easily be applied to both India and the United States: “The writer who was born in a big country is always in danger of believing that the culture of his native country encompasses all his needs. Paradoxically, he therefore runs the risk of becoming provincial.” Britain had the opposite experience. It was a small island country that flowered in its contact with other cultures. But it seems now that after three centuries of growth and expansion, the British mind is finally catching up with its new shrunken place in the world. Brexit is only a symptom. The shrinking disease is not political but cultural, and as such it expresses itself in all variety of ways. The signs were there well before Brexit. In 2011, James Wood, a Briton himself and The New Yorker’s house critic, saw provincialism at work in the overrefinement and cloying nostalgia of writers like Alan Hollinghurst. He rightly faulted Mr. Hollinghurst for being “too ready to perpetuate a fond English elegy that he should, instead, be scrutinizing.” The shrinking disease is there in the longing for rootedness, which public intellectuals like David Goodhart, my old editor at the magazine Prospect, expresses as the difference between cosmopolitan “anywheres” and “somewheres” with “rooted” identities based in “group belonging and particular places.” It is there especially in the willful provincialism of Prime Minister Theresa May who famously said, “If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere.” As an unapologetic “anywhere,” I am in the grip of a nostalgia of my own. I find myself composing an elegy for that brief interregnum when Britain had ceased to rule but was nonetheless dazzlingly cosmopolitan. “European rule in Asian countries was based on force,” Arthur Koestler wrote in “The Lotus and the Robot,” “but its cultural influence was not.” He added, “We ruled by rape, but influenced by seduction.” As Britain withdraws into itself, I cannot help feeling we are going to miss that last benign act of British power when the rape fell away, and seduction remained.",The New York Times
2018,How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port,"HAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka — Every time Sri Lanka’s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned to his Chinese allies for loans and assistance with an ambitious port project, the answer was yes. Yes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldn’t work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lanka’s debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa. Over years of construction and renegotiation with China Harbor Engineering Company, one of Beijing’s largest state-owned enterprises, the Hambantota Port Development Project distinguished itself mostly by failing, as predicted. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, the port drew only 34 ships in 2012. And then the port became China’s. Mr. Rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015, but Sri Lanka’s new government struggled to make payments on the debt he had taken on. Under heavy pressure and after months of negotiations with the Chinese, the government handed over the port and 15,000 acres of land around it for 99 years in December. The transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway. The case is one of the most vivid examples of China’s ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world — and of its willingness to play hardball to collect. The debt deal also intensified some of the harshest accusations about President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative: that the global investment and lending program amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world, fueling corruption and autocratic behavior in struggling democracies. Months of interviews with Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Western officials and analysis of documents and agreements stemming from the port project present a stark illustration of how China and the companies under its control ensured their interests in a small country hungry for financing. • During the 2015 Sri Lankan elections, large payments from the Chinese port construction fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in China’s efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia. The payments were confirmed by documents and cash checks detailed in a government investigation seen by The New York Times. • Though Chinese officials and analysts have insisted that China’s interest in the Hambantota port is purely commercial, Sri Lankan officials said that from the start, the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the port’s location were part of the negotiations. • Initially moderate terms for lending on the port project became more onerous as Sri Lankan officials asked to renegotiate the timeline and add more financing. And as Sri Lankan officials became desperate to get the debt off their books in recent years, the Chinese demands centered on handing over equity in the port rather than allowing any easing of terms. • Though the deal erased roughly $1 billion in debt for the port project, Sri Lanka is now in more debt to China than ever, as other loans have continued and rates remain much higher than from other international lenders. Mr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor also would not comment. Estimates by the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry paint a bleak picture: This year, the government is expected to generate $14.8 billion in revenue, but its scheduled debt repayments, to an array of lenders around the world, come to $12.3 billion. “John Adams said infamously that a way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has chosen the latter,” said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi. Indian officials, in particular, fear that Sri Lanka is struggling so much that the Chinese government may be able to dangle debt relief in exchange for its military’s use of assets like the Hambantota port — though the final lease agreement forbids military activity there without Sri Lanka’s invitation. “The only way to justify the investment in Hambantota is from a national security standpoint — that they will bring the People’s Liberation Army in,” said Shivshankar Menon, who served as India’s foreign secretary and then its national security adviser as the Hambantota port was being built. The relationship between China and Sri Lanka had long been amicable, with Sri Lanka an early recognizer of Mao’s Communist government after the Chinese Revolution. But it was during a more recent conflict — Sri Lanka’s brutal 26-year civil war with ethnic Tamil separatists — that China became indispensable. Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in 2005, presided over the last years of the war, when Sri Lanka became increasingly isolated by accusations of human rights abuses. Under him, Sri Lanka relied heavily on China for economic support, military equipment and political cover at the United Nations to block potential sanctions. The war ended in 2009, and as the country emerged from the chaos, Mr. Rajapaksa and his family consolidated their hold. At the height of Mr. Rajapaksa’s tenure, the president and his three brothers controlled many government ministries and around 80 percent of total government spending. Governments like China negotiated directly with them. So when the president began calling for a vast new port development project at Hambantota, his sleepy home district, the few roadblocks in its way proved ineffective. From the start, officials questioned the wisdom of a second major port, in a country a quarter the size of Britain and with a population of 22 million, when the main port in the capital was thriving and had room to expand. Feasibility studies commissioned by the government had starkly concluded that a port at Hambantota was not economically viable. “They approached us for the port at the beginning, and Indian companies said no,” said Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary. “It was an economic dud then, and it’s an economic dud now.” But Mr. Rajapaksa greenlighted the project, then boasted in a news release that he had defied all caution — and that China was on board. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority began devising what officials believed was a careful, economically sound plan in 2007, according to an official involved in the project. It called for a limited opening for business in 2010, and for revenue to be coming in before any major expansion. The first major loan it took on the project came from the Chinese government’s Export-Import Bank, or Exim, for $307 million. But to obtain the loan, Sri Lanka was required to accept Beijing’s preferred company, China Harbor, as the port’s builder, according to a United States Embassy cable from the time, leaked to WikiLeaks. That is a typical demand of China for its projects around the world, rather than allowing an open bidding process. Across the region, Beijing’s government is lending out billions of dollars, being repaid at a premium to hire Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese workers, according to officials across the region. There were other strings attached to the loan, as well, in a sign that China saw strategic value in the Hambantota port from the beginning. Nihal Rodrigo, a former Sri Lankan foreign secretary and ambassador to China, said that discussions with Chinese officials at the time made it clear that intelligence sharing was an integral, if not public, part of the deal. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Rodrigo characterized the Chinese line as, “We expect you to let us know who is coming and stopping here.” In later years, Chinese officials and the China Harbor company went to great lengths to keep relations strong with Mr. Rajapaksa, who for years had faithfully acquiesced to such terms. In the final months of Sri Lanka’s 2015 election, China’s ambassador broke with diplomatic norms and lobbied voters, even caddies at Colombo’s premier golf course, to support Mr. Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government. As the January election inched closer, large payments started to flow toward the president’s circle. At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbor’s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksa’s campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. The document details China Harbor’s bank account number — ownership of which was verified — and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out. With 10 days to go before polls opened, around $3.7 million was distributed in checks: $678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and $297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including women’s saris. Another $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksa’s electoral bid, while two checks totaling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence. Most of the payments were from a subaccount controlled by China Harbor, named “HPDP Phase 2,” shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project. After nearly five years of helter-skelter expansion for China’s Belt and Road Initiative across the globe, Chinese officials are quietly trying to take stock of how many deals have been done and what the country’s financial exposure might be. There is no comprehensive picture of that yet, said one Chinese economic policymaker, who like many other officials would speak about Chinese policy only on the condition of anonymity. Some Chinese officials have become concerned that the nearly institutional graft surrounding such projects represents a liability for China, and raises the bar needed for profitability. President Xi acknowledged the worry in a speech last year, saying, “We will also strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption in order to build the Belt and Road Initiative with integrity.” In Bangladesh, for example, officials said in January that China Harbor would be banned from future contracts over accusations that the company attempted to bribe an official at the ministry of roads, stuffing $100,000 into a box of tea, government officials said in interviews. And China Harbor’s parent company, China Communications Construction Company, was banned for eight years in 2009 from bidding on World Bank projects because of corrupt practices in the Philippines. Since the port seizure in Sri Lanka, Chinese officials have started suggesting that Belt and Road is not an open-ended government commitment to finance development across three continents. “If we cannot manage the risk well, the Belt and Road projects cannot go far or well,” said Jin Qi, the chairwoman of the Silk Road Fund, a large state-owned investment fund, during the China Development Forum in late March. In Sri Lanka’s case, port officials and Chinese analysts have also not given up the view that the Hambantota port could become profitable, or at least strengthen China’s trade capacity in the region. Ray Ren, China Merchant Port’s representative in Sri Lanka and the head of the Hambantota port’s operations, insisted that “the location of Sri Lanka is ideal for international trade.” And he dismissed the negative feasibility studies, saying they were done many years ago when Hambantota was “a small fishing hamlet.” Hu Shisheng, the director of South Asia studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China clearly recognized the strategic value of the Hambantota port. But he added: “Once China wants to exert its geostrategic value, the strategic value of the port will be gone. Big countries cannot fight in Sri Lanka — it would be wiped out.” Although the Hambantota port first opened in a limited way in 2010, before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, the Chinese government quickly folded the project into the global program. Shortly after the handover ceremony in Hambantota, China’s state news agency released a boastful video on Twitter, proclaiming the deal “another milestone along the path of #BeltandRoad.” The seaport is not the only grand project built with Chinese loans in Hambantota, a sparsely populated area on Sri Lanka’s southeastern coast that is still largely overrun by jungle. A cricket stadium with more seats than the population of Hambantota’s district capital marks the skyline, as does a large international airport — which in June lost the only daily commercial flight it had left when FlyDubai airline ended the route. A highway that cuts through the district is traversed by elephants and used by farmers to rake out and dry the rice plucked fresh from their paddies. Mr. Rajapaksa’s advisers had laid out a methodical approach to how the port might expand after opening, ensuring that some revenue would be coming in before taking on much more debt. But in 2009, the president had grown impatient. His 65th birthday was approaching the following year, and to mark the occasion he wanted a grand opening at the Hambantota port — including the beginning of an ambitious expansion 10 years ahead of the Port Authority’s original timeline. Chinese laborers began working day and night to get the port ready, officials said. But when workers dredged the land and then flooded it to create the basin of the port, they had not taken into account a large boulder that partly blocked the entrance, preventing the entry of large ships, like oil tankers, that the port’s business model relied on. Ports Authority officials, unwilling to cross the president, quickly moved ahead anyway. The Hambantota port opened in an elaborate celebration on Nov. 18, 2010, Mr. Rajapaksa’s birthday. Then it sat waiting for business while the rock blocked it. China Harbor blasted the boulder a year later, at a cost of $40 million, an exorbitant price that raised concerns among diplomats and government officials. Some openly speculated about whether the company was simply overcharging or the price tag included kickbacks to Mr. Rajapaksa. By 2012, the port was struggling to attract ships — which preferred to berth nearby at the Colombo port — and construction costs were rising as the port began expanding ahead of schedule. The government decreed later that year that ships carrying car imports bound for Colombo port would instead offload their cargo at Hambantota to kick-start business there. Still, only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota in 2012, compared with 3,667 ships at the Colombo port, according to a Finance Ministry annual report. “When I came to the government, I called the minister of national planning and asked for the justification of Hambantota Port,” Harsha de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, said in an interview. “She said, ‘We were asked to do it, so we did it.’ ” Determined to keep expanding the port, Mr. Rajapaksa went back to the Chinese government in 2012, asking for $757 million. The Chinese agreed again. But this time, the terms were much steeper. The first loan, at $307 million, had originally come at a variable rate that usually settled above 1 or 2 percent after the global financial crash in 2008. (For comparison, rates on similar Japanese loans for infrastructure projects run below half a percent.) But to secure fresh funding, that initial loan was renegotiated to a much higher 6.3 percent fixed rate. Mr. Rajapaksa acquiesced. The rising debt and project costs, even as the port was struggling, handed Sri Lanka’s political opposition a powerful issue, and it campaigned heavily on suspicions about China. Mr. Rajapaksa lost the election. The incoming government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, came to office with a mandate to scrutinize Sri Lanka’s financial deals. It also faced a daunting amount of debt: Under Mr. Rajapaksa, the country’s debt had increased threefold, to $44.8 billion when he left office. And for 2015 alone, a $4.68 billion payment was due at year’s end. The new government was eager to reorient Sri Lanka toward India, Japan and the West. But officials soon realized that no other country could fill the financial or economic space that China held in Sri Lanka. “We inherited a purposefully run-down economy — the revenues were insufficient to pay the interest charges, let alone capital repayment,” said Ravi Karunanayake, who was finance minister during the new government’s first year in office. “We did keep taking loans,” he added. “A new government can’t just stop loans. It’s a relay; you need to take them until economic discipline is introduced.” The Central Bank estimated that Sri Lanka owed China about $3 billion last year. But Nishan de Mel, an economist at Verité Research, said some of the debts were off government books and instead registered as part of individual projects. He estimated that debt owed to China could be as much as $5 billion and was growing every year. In May, Sri Lanka took a new $1 billion loan from China Development Bank to help make its coming debt payment. Government officials began meeting in 2016 with their Chinese counterparts to strike a deal, hoping to get the port off Sri Lanka’s balance sheet and avoid outright default. But the Chinese demanded that a Chinese company take a dominant equity share in the port in return, Sri Lankan officials say — writing down the debt was not an option China would accept. When Sri Lanka was given a choice, it was over which state-owned company would take control: either China Harbor or China Merchants Port, according to the final agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, although it was never released publicly in full. China Merchants got the contract, and it immediately pressed for more: Company officials demanded 15,000 acres of land around the port to build an industrial zone, according to two officials with knowledge of the negotiations. The Chinese company argued that the port itself was not worth the $1.1 billion it would pay for its equity — money that would close out Sri Lanka’s debt on the port. Some government officials bitterly opposed the terms, but there was no leeway, according to officials involved in the negotiations. The new agreement was signed in July 2017, and took effect in December. The deal left some appearance of Sri Lankan ownership: Among other things, it created a joint company to manage the port’s operations and collect revenue, with 85 percent owned by China Merchants Port and the remaining 15 percent controlled by Sri Lanka’s government. But lawyers specializing in port acquisitions said Sri Lanka’s small stake meant little, given the leverage that China Merchants Port retained over board personnel and operating decisions. When the agreement was initially negotiated, it left open whether the port and surrounding land could be used by the Chinese military, which Indian officials asked the Sri Lankan government to explicitly forbid. The final agreement bars foreign countries from using the port for military purposes unless granted permission by the government in Colombo. That clause is there because Chinese Navy submarines had already come calling to Sri Lanka. China had a stake in Sri Lanka’s main port as well: China Harbor was building a new terminal there, known at the time as Colombo Port City. Along with that deal came roughly 50 acres of land, solely held by the Chinese company, that Sri Lanka had no sovereignty on. That was dramatically demonstrated toward the end of Mr. Rajapaksa’s term, in 2014. Chinese submarines docked at the harbor the same day that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was visiting Colombo, in what was seen across the region as a menacing signal from Beijing. When the new Sri Lankan government came to office, it sought assurances that the port would never again welcome Chinese submarines — of particular concern because they are difficult to detect and often used for intelligence gathering. But Sri Lankan officials had little real control. Now, the handover of Hambantota to the Chinese has kept alive concerns about possible military use — particularly as China has continued to militarize island holdings around the South China Sea despite earlier pledges not to. Sri Lankan officials are quick to point out that the agreement explicitly rules out China’s military use of the site. But others also note that Sri Lanka’s government, still heavily indebted to China, could be pressured to allow it. And, as Mr. de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, put it, “Governments can change.” Now, he and others are watching carefully as Mr. Rajapaksa, China’s preferred partner in Sri Lanka, has been trying to stage a political comeback. The former president’s new opposition party swept municipal elections in February. Presidential elections are coming up next year, and general elections in 2020. Although Mr. Rajapaksa is barred from running again because of term limits, his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, appears to be readying to take the mantle. “It will be Mahinda Rajapaksa’s call. If he says it’s one of the brothers, that person will have a very strong claim,” said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the central bank governor under Mr. Rajapaksa’s government, who still advises the family. “Even if he’s no longer the president, as the Constitution is structured, Mahinda will be the main power base.”",The New York Times

THE DARKENING AGE The Christian Destruction of the Classical World By Catherine Nixey Illustrated. 315 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $28. Vandalizing the Parthenon temple in Athens has been a tenacious tradition. Most famously, Lord Elgin appropriated the “Elgin marbles” in 1801-5. But that was hardly the first example. In the Byzantine era, when the temple had been turned into a church, two bishops — Marinos and Theodosios — carved their names on its monumental columns. The Ottomans used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine, hence its pockmarked masonry — the result of an attack by Venetian forces in the 17th century. Now Catherine Nixey, a classics teacher turned writer and journalist, takes us back to earlier desecrations, the destruction of the premier artworks of antiquity by Christian zealots (from the Greek zelos — ardor, eager rivalry) in what she calls “The Darkening Age.” Using the mutilation of faces, arms and genitals on the Parthenon’s decoration as one of her many, thunderingly memorable case studies, Nixey makes the fundamental point that while we lionize Christian culture for preserving works of learning, sponsoring exquisite art and adhering to an ethos of “love thy neighbor,” the early church was in fact a master of anti-intellectualism, iconoclasm and mortal prejudice. This is a searingly passionate book. Nixey is transparent about the particularity of her motivation. The daughter of an ex-nun and an ex-monk, she spent her childhood filled with respect for the wonders of postpagan Christian culture. But as a student of classics she found the scales — as it were — falling from her eyes. She wears her righteous fury on her sleeve. This is scholarship as polemic. Nixey writes up a storm. Each sentence is rich, textured, evocative, felt. Christian monks in silent orders summoned up pagan texts from library stores with a gagging hand gesture. The destruction of the extraordinary, frankincense-heavy temple of Serapis in Alexandria is described with empathetic detail; thousands of books from its library vanished, and the temple’s gargantuan wooden statue of the god was dismembered before being burned. One pagan eyewitness, Eunapius, remarked flintily that the only ancient treasure left unlooted from the temple was its floor. Christians became known as those “who move that which should not be moved.” Their laudable appeal to have-nots at the bottom of the pile, both free and unfree, meant that bishops had a citizen-army of pumped-up, undereducated young men ready to rid the world of sin. Enter the parabalini, sometime stretcher-bearers, sometime assassins, who viciously flayed alive the brilliant Alexandrian mathematician and pagan philosopher Hypatia. Or the circumcellions (feared even by other Christians), who invented a kind of chemical weapon using caustic lime soda and vinegar so they could carry out acid attacks on priests who didn’t share their beliefs. Debate — philosophically and physiologically — makes us human, whereas dogma cauterizes our potential as a species. Through the sharing of new ideas the ancients identified the atom, measured the circumference of the earth, grasped the environmental benefits of vegetarianism. To be sure, Christians would not have a monopoly on orthodoxy, or indeed on suppression: The history of the ancient world typically makes for stomach-churning reading. Pagan philosophers too who flew in the face of religious consensus risked persecution; Socrates, we must not forget, was condemned to death on a religious charge. But Christians did fetishize dogma. In A.D. 386 a law was passed declaring that those “who contend about religion … shall pay with their lives and blood.” Books were systematically burned. The doctrinal opinions of one of the most celebrated early church fathers, St. John Chrysostom — he of the Golden Mouth — were enthusiastically quoted in Nazi Germany 1,500 years after his death: The synagogue “is a den of robbers and a lodging for wild beasts … a dwelling of demons.” Actions were extreme because paganism was considered not just a psychological but a physical miasma. Christianity appeared on a planet that had been, for at least 70,000 years, animist. (Asking the women and men of antiquity whether they believed in spirits, nymphs, djinns would have been as odd as asking them whether they believed in the sea.) But for Christians, the food that pagans produced, the bathwater they washed in, their very breaths were thought to be infected by demons. Pollution was said to make its way into the lungs of bystanders during animal sacrifice. And once Christianity became championed by Rome, one of the most militaristic civilizations the world has known, philosophical discussions on the nature of good and evil became martial instructions for purges and pugilism. Still, contrary to Nixey, there was not utter but rather partial destruction of the classical world. The vigorous debates in Byzantine cultures about whether, for example, magical texts were demonic suggest that these works continued to have influence in Christian Europe. The material culture of the time also lends nuance to Nixey’s story: Silverware and dining services in Byzantium were proudly decorated with images of the “Iliad” and “Odyssey.” And while 90 percent of all ancient literature has been lost, paganism still had a foothold on the streets. In Constantinople, the spiritual headquarters of Eastern Christendom, the seventh-century church was still frantically trying to ban the Bacchanalian festivities that legitimized cross-dressing, mask-wearing and Bacchic adulation. I read this book while tracing the historical footprint of the Bacchic cult. On the tiny Greek island of Skyros, men and children, even today, dress as half human, half animal; they wear goat masks, and dance and drink on Bacchus’ festival days in honor of the spirit of the god. It seems that off the page there was a little more continuity than Christian authorities would like to admit. But the spittle-flecked diatribes and enraging accounts of gruesome martyrdoms and persecution by pagans were what the church chose to preserve and promote. Christian dominance of academic institutions and archives until the late 19th century ensured a messianic slant for Western education (despite the fact that many pagan intellectuals were disparaging about the boorish, ungrammatical nature of early Christian works like the Gospels). As Nixey puts it, the triumph of Christianity heralded the subjugation of the other. And so she opens her book with a potent description of black-robed zealots from 16 centuries ago taking iron bars to the beautiful statue of Athena in the sanctuary of Palmyra, located in modern-day Syria. Intellectuals in Antioch (in ancient Syria) were tortured and beheaded, as were the statues around them. The contemporary parallels glare. The early medieval author known as Pseudo-Jerome wrote of Christian extremists: “Because they love the name martyr and because they desire human praise more than divine charity, they kill themselves.” He would have found shocking familiarity in the news of the 21st century. Nixey closes her book with the description of another Athena, in the city of her name, being decapitated around A.D. 529, her defiled body used as a steppingstone into what was once a world-renowned school of philosophy. Athena was the deity of wisdom. The words “wisdom” and “historian” have a common ancestor, a proto-Indo-European word meaning to see things clearly. Nixey delivers this ballista-bolt of a book with her eyes wide open and in an attempt to bring light as well as heat to the sad story of intellectual monoculture and religious intolerance. Her sympathy, corruscatingly, compellingly, is with the Roman orator Symmachus: “We see the same stars, the sky is shared by all, the same world surrounds us. What does it matter what wisdom a person uses to seek for the truth?”",The New York Times
2018,How Cognitive Behavior Therapy May Help Suicidal People ,"In C.B.T., clear steps are intended to help build hope, solve problems and make a plan to avoid relapses. After a week of devastating news about suicide, there has been much discussion of the need for people who may be thinking of ending their lives to reach out for help. But some people who are suffering may be skeptical that therapy could make a difference. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy, or C.B.T., in treating suicidal individuals and decreasing subsequent attempts. A 2016 review of 15 randomized controlled trials found that C.B.T. “is a useful strategy in the prevention of suicidal cognitions and suicidal behaviors.” Throughout my career I have used this method to treat patients with many different types of problems and diagnoses, including suicidal behavior — which may occur along with problems like depression, addictions, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder. Medications can be very effective in treating certain diagnoses, but those medications may take some time to take effect. Therefore the suicidality must be addressed before the medications will be helpful. Sometimes individuals will need to be hospitalized in order to keep them safe until C.B.T. or medications can help. But inpatient treatment is not necessary for everyone who has suicidal thoughts. C.B.T. starts with the proposition that people’s behavior, including suicide attempts, make sense once we understand what they’re thinking. A highly suicidal individual might think, for example, that his or her emotional pain will never go away and will only get worse. If the individual believes there is nothing that can alleviate his or her suffering, suicide may seem as if it is the only solution. But in C.B.T. treatment, individuals learn a number of skills. While individual patients’ needs can vary greatly, following is a basic approach. First, with a therapist’s help, people who are feeling suicidal develop a written safety plan. This plan is designed to increase hope. It demonstrates to individuals that they can learn to manage their problems more effectively than they have in the past. As part of this plan, they identify their specific warning signs. Then they record specific coping strategies they can do on their own, such as interacting with people or pets, distraction, relaxation techniques, exercise and reviewing their coping cards — which are individually crafted messages with important ideas they learned in therapy, such as their reasons for living. The next step in creating the plan is listing people to contact, including health care professionals and emergency lines, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255). They also remove access to things they might think of using to end their lives. A person who is dealing with addiction or who is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs will have impaired judgment and is likely to be impulsive, greatly increasing the potential for suicide. In these cases, working to reduce the use of such substances is very important. In the second part of treatment, individuals focus on solving problems that are most related to their suicidal crises. They also learn how to reduce potential future crises, especially by changing their distorted thinking and unhelpful behavior and learning new coping strategies. The therapist strongly reinforces their reasons for living and continues to work toward increasing hope. Other typical strategies might include scheduling activities, especially ones that could lead to a sense of pleasure, increasing social connections and support, learning emotional regulation techniques, shifting attention when preoccupied with suicidal thoughts, modifying beliefs that their suffering is unbearable and reducing impulsivity. In this stage of treatment, they also develop a Hope Kit, often a container or scrapbook with meaningful items such as photographs and letters, prayer cards (when relevant), and a list of significant events they want to attend (such as a graduation, wedding or reunion). This Hope Kit can be a powerful reminder of the reasons they want to live. In the final phase of treatment, individuals consolidate their new skills and learn relapse prevention techniques. This phase allows individuals who are struggling with suicidal thoughts, as well as their family members, friends and health care providers, to feel less helpless. Given the right kind of treatment, people can learn precisely what to do when they have thoughts of killing themselves and what to do to prevent future suicidal crises. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. Judith S.

2018,How Conservatives Weaponized the First Amendment,"WASHINGTON — On the final day of the Supreme Court term last week, Justice Elena Kagan sounded an alarm. The court’s five conservative members, citing the First Amendment, had just dealt public unions a devastating blow. The day before, the same majority had used the First Amendment to reject a California law requiring religiously oriented “crisis pregnancy centers” to provide women with information about abortion. Conservatives, said Justice Kagan, who is part of the court’s four-member liberal wing, were “weaponizing the First Amendment.” The two decisions were the latest in a stunning run of victories for a conservative agenda that has increasingly been built on the foundation of free speech. Conservative groups, borrowing and building on arguments developed by liberals, have used the First Amendment to justify unlimited campaign spending, discrimination against gay couples and attacks on the regulation of tobacco, pharmaceuticals and guns. “The right, which had for years been hostile to and very nervous about a strong First Amendment, has rediscovered it,” said Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University. The Citizens United campaign finance case, for instance, was decided on free-speech grounds, with the five-justice conservative majority ruling that the First Amendment protects unlimited campaign spending by corporations. The government, the majority said, has no business regulating political speech. The dissenters responded that the First Amendment did not require allowing corporate money to flood the political marketplace and corrupt democracy. “The libertarian position has become dominant on the right on First Amendment issues,” said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the Cato Institute. “It simply means that we should be skeptical of government attempts to regulate speech. That used to be an uncontroversial and nonideological point. What’s now being called the libertarian position on speech was in the 1960s the liberal position on speech.” And an increasingly conservative judiciary has been more than a little receptive to this argument. A new analysis prepared for The New York Times found that the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been far more likely to embrace free-speech arguments concerning conservative speech than liberal speech. That is a sharp break from earlier eras. As a result, liberals who once championed expansive First Amendment rights are now uneasy about them. “The left was once not just on board but leading in supporting the broadest First Amendment protections,” said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer and a supporter of broad free-speech rights. “Now the progressive community is at least skeptical and sometimes distraught at the level of First Amendment protection which is being afforded in cases brought by litigants on the right.” Many on the left have traded an absolutist commitment to free speech for one sensitive to the harms it can inflict. Take pornography and street protests. Liberals were once largely united in fighting to protect sexually explicit materials from government censorship. Now many on the left see pornography as an assault on women’s rights. In 1977, many liberals supported the right of the American Nazi Party to march among Holocaust survivors in Skokie, Ill. Far fewer supported the free-speech rights of the white nationalists who marched last year in Charlottesville, Va. There was a certain naïveté in how liberals used to approach free speech, said Frederick Schauer, a law professor at the University of Virginia. “Because so many free-speech claims of the 1950s and 1960s involved anti-obscenity claims, or civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protests, it was easy for the left to sympathize with the speakers or believe that speech in general was harmless,” he said. “But the claim that speech was harmless or causally inert was never true, even if it has taken recent events to convince the left of that. The question, then, is why the left ever believed otherwise.” Some liberals now say that free speech disproportionately protects the powerful and the status quo. “When I was younger, I had more of the standard liberal view of civil liberties,” said Louis Michael Seidman, a law professor at Georgetown. “And I’ve gradually changed my mind about it. What I have come to see is that it’s a mistake to think of free speech as an effective means to accomplish a more just society.” To the contrary, free speech reinforces and amplifies injustice, Catharine A. MacKinnon, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote in “The Free Speech Century,” a collection of essays to be published this year. “Once a defense of the powerless, the First Amendment over the last hundred years has mainly become a weapon of the powerful,” she wrote. “Legally, what was, toward the beginning of the 20th century, a shield for radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed, has become a sword for authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and Klansmen, pornographers and corporations buying elections.” In the great First Amendment cases in the middle of the 20th century, few conservatives spoke up for the protection of political dissenters, including communists and civil rights leaders, comedians using vulgar language on the airwaves or artists exploring sexuality in novels and on film. In 1971, Robert H. Bork, then a prominent conservative law professor and later a federal judge and Supreme Court nominee, wrote that the First Amendment should be interpreted narrowly in a law-review article that remains one of the most-cited of all time. “Constitutional protection should be accorded only to speech that is explicitly political,” he wrote. “There is no basis for judicial intervention to protect any other form of expression, be it scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or pornographic.” But a transformative ruling by the Supreme Court five years later began to change that thinking. The case, a challenge to a state law that banned advertising the prices of prescription drugs, was filed by Public Citizen, a consumer rights group founded by Ralph Nader. The group argued that the law hurt consumers, and helped persuade the court, in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, to protect advertising and other commercial speech. The only dissent in the decision came from Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court’s most conservative member. Kathleen M. Sullivan, a former dean of Stanford Law School, wrote that it did not take long for corporations to see the opportunities presented by the decision. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s last Supreme Court term contained hints of his retirement and foreshadowed a lasting rightward shift. “While the case was litigated by consumer protection advocates,” she wrote in the Harvard Law Review, “corporate speakers soon became the principal beneficiaries of subsequent rulings that, for example, struck down restrictions on including alcohol content on beer can labels, limitations on outdoor tobacco advertising near schools and rules governing how compounded drugs may be advertised.” That trend has continued, with businesses mounting First Amendment challenges to gun control laws, securities regulations, country-of-origin labels, graphic cigarette warnings and limits on off-label drug marketing. “I was a bit queasy about it because I had the sense that we were unleashing something, but nowhere near what happened,” Mr. Nader said. “It was one of the biggest boomerangs in judicial cases ever.” “I couldn’t be Merlin,” he added. “We never thought the judiciary would be as conservative or corporate. This was an expansion that was not preordained by doctrine. It was preordained by the political philosophies of judges.” Not all of the liberal scholars and lawyers who helped create modern First Amendment law are disappointed. Martin Redish, a law professor at Northwestern University, who wrote a seminal 1971 article proposing First Amendment protection for commercial speech, said he was pleased with the Roberts court’s decisions. “Its most important contributions are in the commercial speech and corporate speech areas,” he said. “It’s a workmanlike, common sense approach.” Liberals also played a key role in creating modern campaign finance law in Buckley v. Valeo, the 1976 decision that struck down limits on political spending by individuals and was the basis for Citizens United, the 2010 decision that did away with similar limits for corporations and unions. One plaintiff was Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, Democrat of Minnesota, who had challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1968 presidential primaries — from the left. Another was the American Civil Liberties Union’s New York affiliate. Professor Neuborne, a former A.C.L.U. lawyer, said he now regrets the role he played in winning the case. “I signed the brief in Buckley,” he said. “I’m going to spend long amounts of time in purgatory.” To Professor Seidman, cases like these were part of what he describes as a right-wing takeover of the First Amendment since the liberal victories in the years Chief Justice Earl Warren led the Supreme Court. “With the receding of Warren court liberalism, free-speech law took a sharp right turn,” Professor Seidman wrote in a new article to be published in the Columbia Law Review. “Instead of providing a shield for the powerless, the First Amendment became a sword used by people at the apex of the American hierarchy of power. Among its victims: proponents of campaign finance reform, opponents of cigarette addiction, the L.B.G.T.Q. community, labor unions, animal rights advocates, environmentalists, targets of hate speech and abortion providers.” The title of the article asked, “Can Free Speech Be Progressive?” “The answer,” the article said, “is no.” The right turn has been even more pronounced under Chief Justice Roberts. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a larger share of First Amendment cases concerning conservative speech than earlier courts had, according to the study prepared for The Times. And it has ruled in favor of conservative speech at a higher rate than liberal speech as compared to earlier courts. The court’s docket reflects something new and distinctive about the Roberts court, according to the study, which was conducted by Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis; Andrew D. Martin, a political scientist at the University of Michigan and the dean of its College of Literature, Science and the Arts; and Kevin Quinn, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. “The Roberts court — more than any modern court — has trained its sights on speech promoting conservative values,” the study found. “Only the current court has resolved a higher fraction of disputes challenging the suppression of conservative rather than liberal expression.” The court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1953 to 1969 was almost exclusively concerned with cases concerning liberal speech. Of its 60 free-expression cases, only five, or about 8 percent, challenged the suppression of conservative speech. The proportion of challenges to restrictions on conservative speech has steadily increased. It rose to 22 percent in the court led by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger from 1969 to 1986; to 42 percent in the court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist from 1986 to 2005; and to 65 percent in the Roberts court. The Roberts court does more than hear a larger proportion of cases concerning conservative expression. It is also far more likely than earlier courts to rule for conservative speech than for liberal speech. The result, the study found, has been “a fundamental transformation of the court’s free-expression agenda.” In past decades, broad coalitions of justices have often been receptive to First Amendment arguments. The court has protected videos of animal cruelty, hateful protests at military funerals, violent video games and lies about military awards, often by lopsided margins. But last week’s two First Amendment blockbusters were decided by 5-to-4 votes, with the conservatives in the majority ruling in favor of conservative plaintiffs. On Tuesday, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority that requiring health clinics opposed to abortion to tell women how to obtain the procedure violated the clinics’ free-speech rights. In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that was a misuse of First Amendment principles. “Using the First Amendment to strike down economic and social laws that legislatures long would have thought themselves free to enact will, for the American public, obscure, not clarify, the true value of protecting freedom of speech,” Justice Breyer wrote. On Wednesday, in announcing the decision on public unions, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the court was applying settled and neutral First Amendment principles to protect workers from being forced to say things at odds with their beliefs. He suggested that the decision on public unions should have been unanimous. “Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned,” he wrote. “Suppose, for example, that the State of Illinois required all residents to sign a document expressing support for a particular set of positions on controversial public issues — say, the platform of one of the major political parties. No one, we trust, would seriously argue that the First Amendment permits this.” In response, Justice Kagan said the court’s conservatives had found a dangerous tool, “turning the First Amendment into a sword.” The United States, she said, should brace itself. “Speech is everywhere — a part of every human activity (employment, health care, securities trading, you name it),” she wrote. “For that reason, almost all economic and regulatory policy affects or touches speech. So the majority’s road runs long. And at every stop are black-robed rulers overriding citizens’ choices.”",The New York Times
2018,"How Corey Johnson, City Council Speaker, Spends His Sundays","Sunday Routine For Mr. Johnson, if it’s Sunday, there’s probably a parade. And he will probably be dancing at it. Mr. Johnson, the City Council speaker, with his cat, Mousse.CreditCreditAmy Lombard for The New York Times Earlier this month, the Queens Pride parade and the Celebrate Israel parade fell on the same Sunday. What’s an ambitious New York politician — the first openly gay male, H.I.V.-positive City Council speaker — to do? “I alternate,” Corey Johnson said. “Last year I did Queens Pride and skipped Israel. This year I did Israel.” Since January, when Mr. Johnson went from representing Manhattan’s West Side to the entire city, the 36-year-old has sacrificed the traditional day of rest to an endless stream of public events, which he attends with “a wonderful group of rotating detectives,” he said. When not dancing in front of a parade float, he lives in a studio apartment in Chelsea with a cat named Mousse — because he’s “fat and sweet.” SNOOZE I’m kind of a night owl, so I don’t get as much sleep as I should during the week. So on Sundays I try to sleep in. SINGING IN SWEATPANTS I get up around 10. I turn on some music. Music wakes me up. I’m a big pop fanatic, so I love Lady Gaga, Rihanna, anything that’s on the radio. I’m usually singing and hanging out with my cat. Throw on a pair of sweatpants and a baseball cap, unless I have to go right to an event. CHILL I live on iced coffee 12 months of the year. I drink iced coffee when there’s a blizzard outside. So I usually go to L & M Deli on my corner. It’s been there for almost 40 years. That’s how I get my day going, with the largest iced coffee you’ve ever seen. I’ve been going there for like 15 years. Sometimes I’ll get an English muffin. I’m not a big breakfast person. CALENDAR I’ll come back home and see what the big events of the day are. In summer there’s usually a lot of parades, especially on Sunday. I read the papers, and then I’m usually scrolling through Twitter. MEAL PLAN I’ve been sober for almost nine years, so I don’t really go to bars that much, so my social life revolves around meals, whether it be brunches, lunches, dinner, house parties. One thing about this new job is that it’s harder for me to squeeze in time with my friends. PUBLIC LIFE Then I spend the day going to local events. At the parades my favorite thing to do is dance. Some people march in parades. Some people walk in parades. I dance in parades. The City Council usually has a nice soundtrack on the truck in front of us. I literally dance the entire way. By the end of it I am sore and soaked in sweat from my dancing. DIVA FIX The playlist has always been good, but I asked recently if they could put on some Rihanna and Gaga and Beyoncé and some of my favorite divas — Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Tina Turner — on the soundtrack for the different Pride parades. I’m addicted to Donna Summer. SEAMLESS AND CHILL Typically I’ll get home at night and have food delivered. I don’t sound healthy, but I usually order either pizza or Chinese food. I Seamless it. GIRL CRUSH Usually I watch “60 Minutes.” Even though I am a gay man, I have a huge crush on Lesley Stahl. BINGE And then I’ll usually catch up with other stuff I recorded during the week. Right now I’m on a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” marathon. It’s a guilty pleasure. Then I binge on Netflix. UNWIND I try to have a quiet night at home. It used to be a big night out for me before I got sober. I used to always go out dancing on Sunday nights, but then I’d pay for it during the week. So I’ve had to readjust my life in sobriety. WHAT QUIET MEANS I usually have the TV on, I’ll have music going on a low hum, I’m on Twitter, and a lot of times I’m on the phone. I try to check in with my mom on Sunday nights. My mom and I are very close. She lives in Boston. I used to speak with her almost every day, but it’s changed with the crazy schedule I have now. MR. SAND CAT I don’t fall asleep easily. My mind’s typically racing about what’s going on that week. I go to bed sometime between midnight and 1:30 in the morning. The cat sleeps with me. He’s the best.",The New York Times
2018,How Corey Stewart Could Endanger Other Virginia Republicans,"MANASSAS, Va. — He once stood proudly before a Confederate flag, declaring it was not a symbol of hatred, but “about our heritage.” After the march of torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville last year, which led to the death of a counterprotester, he criticized “weak Republicans” who “couldn’t apologize fast enough.” As officials around Virginia have grappled with whether to remove Confederate statues, he has compared those politicians to leaders of the Islamic State. Now Corey Stewart, a county official who for years has played to the hard-right fringe, captured the Republican nomination for Senate in Virginia. [Read more about Corey Stewart, Republicans and the fringe right.] He did so in a low-turnout primary on Tuesday when many centrist Republicans apparently stayed home, unhappy with a three-way race among candidates all professing strong loyalty to President Trump and given to fiery culture war pronouncements. Mr. Stewart, the chairman of a county board of supervisors who briefly led Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign in Virginia, received a congratulatory overnight tweet from the president, who called Mr. Stewart’s Democratic opponent, Senator Tim Kaine, “a total stiff.” Tellingly, though, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party’s campaign arm, said it would not support Mr. Stewart, who lags far behind Mr. Kaine in fund-raising and has a history of cozying up to white supremacists and anti-Semites that threatens to make him an albatross for down-ballot Republicans. White House officials said the president was unlikely to cross the Potomac River to campaign personally for Mr. Stewart unless there were signs that his race against Mr. Kaine had become competitive. The real worry for national Republicans — and the hope for Democrats — is that Mr. Stewart’s nomination may cost some incumbent Republicans in Virginia their seats in Congress. “For the G.O.P. candidates in the down-ballot House races in Virginia, having Stewart on the ticket is going to be a very tough challenge,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. “Somehow they will need to separate themselves from the more extreme elements of his message, while at the same time not alienating the Trump Republicans whose votes will be needed.” [Mark Sanford’s political career fades in the age of Donald Trump.] Virginia Democrats quickly moved to join Mr. Stewart at the hip to other Republicans in competitive House races. “There is no place to hide — you are either running with Corey Stewart and you condone his vile politics, or you don’t,” said Susan Swecker, the state Democratic chairwoman. Mr. Stewart could especially hurt Representative Barbara Comstock, a Republican defending a seat in affluent Northern Virginia that is emblematic of how the state has been shifted from its once-fixed Republican moorings by an influx of immigrants and college-educated professionals. Hillary Clinton won in Ms. Comstock’s district, the 10th, by double digits in 2016. Ms. Comstock, who has generally supported Mr. Trump, held off a primary challenge from her right on Tuesday. “The good news is that Congresswoman Barbara Comstock won her challenge,” said David Ramadan, a Republican former state legislator in Virginia. “And the bad news is, my good friend who has lost his mind, Corey Stewart, has become the nominee for the Senate.” Virginia has been moving steadily from being a solid Republican state to one that is reliably Democratic in statewide elections. The populous counties outside Washington and around Richmond are now filled with highly educated voters, immigrants with white-collar jobs in the technology industry, and suburban women, groups that tend to have more moderate views than the Trump-led national Republican Party. The center of gravity for the Republican Party in the state has shifted “from the country club to the country,” as one Republican strategist, Tom Davis, put it. “Every candidate will be asked if they support Stewart,” said Mr. Davis, a former congressman from Virginia. “This is more nuanced than the media would have you believe, but in high-education areas, it is a killer.” The establishment wing that once dominated the party did not even field a candidate in the Senate primary on Tuesday. Instead, Mr. Stewart faced a little-known state lawmaker, Nick Freitas, and a Christian minister given to divisive outbursts, E.W. Jackson. [Here are three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Turnout in the race was noticeably low. Mr. Stewart’s 136,500 votes on Tuesday were about 20,000 fewer than he received in the Republican primary for governor last year, a race he lost. If the turnout pattern repeats in November, at least two other Republican House members besides Ms. Comstock could also be in trouble: Dave Brat and Scott Taylor. “Stewart’s fearmongering and division-sowing campaign will turn many Virginians to the Democratic ticket,” said Schuyler VanValkenburg, a Democratic state legislator who lives in Mr. Brat’s district, the Seventh. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee challenging Mr. Brat, is a former C.I.A. officer who won more votes on Tuesday than any other House candidate in the state. Katey Price, Mr. Brat’s campaign manager, said on Wednesday, “I see this as a very winnable district and very winnable race, and we’re going to run a smart campaign focused on the issues.” Mr. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL who represents the Second District, centered on Virginia Beach, will face Elaine Luria, a former Navy commander. “My opponent will either embrace Corey Stewart, be silent or distance himself from him,” Ms. Luria said in an interview. “Virginia favors equality, diversity and economic opportunity for all. Corey Stewart’s race-baiting rhetoric is offensive to everybody in Virginia.” Mr. Taylor angrily responded to a Twitter taunt from the state Democratic Party that asked him if he thought Mr. Stewart was a racist and whether the two men would campaign together. “Let’s see you jokers bring your weak identity politics campaign, trying to make it about race in #VA02, see how it works out for you,” Mr. Taylor tweeted back. “Not gonna happen.” Mr. Stewart, 49, has spent years courting voters on the rightward fringes of his party, often by playing to anti-immigration sentiment. He made the defense of Confederate monuments the focus of his unsuccessful 2017 primary campaign for governor. “Nothing is worse than a Yankee telling a Southerner that his monuments don’t matter,” he said on Twitter, though he was born in Minnesota. In January 2017, Mr. Stewart met with and praised Paul Nehlen, an outspoken anti-Semite who is now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. Mr. Stewart was also endorsed last year by the white nationalist Jason Kessler, who later helped organize the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Mr. Stewart has since distanced himself from both Mr. Nehlen and Mr. Kessler. As chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, Mr. Stewart promoted a policy in 2007 to deny county services to immigrants without legal status. The rule, which was updated to require police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they arrested, drew intense opposition and brought Mr. Stewart to national attention. Elizabeth Guzman, a Democratic state lawmaker representing the district where Mr. Stewart lives, said Mr. Stewart was able to win his county office largely because many Democrats did not vote in local elections. That trend was dramatically reversed in November, when Democratic candidates took 15 Republican-held seats in the statehouse. “Now that we are engaging everybody in the process, he is not winning in November,” Ms. Guzman said of Mr. Stewart. “When you are going to vote on the Republican ticket, he is going to be the head of that line, and as soon as people see that name, it will turn off people.”",The New York Times
2018,How Did Kim Jong-un Get to Singapore? With Some Help From China.,"BEIJING — When Kim Jong-un arrived in Singapore on Sunday for his landmark summit meeting with President Trump, he stepped off a jumbo jet emblazoned with the logo of Air China and the Chinese national flag. China said it provided the aircraft — actually an American-made Boeing 747 that was formerly used by Chinese leaders — to Mr. Kim to make the 3,000-mile trip to Singapore. Photographs of Mr. Kim stepping off the Chinese jumbo jet drew immediate quips about North Korea’s reliance on its much larger and wealthier neighbor. “China’s new province,” said a tweet by Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at Georgetown University who was once under consideration to be the American ambassador to South Korea. The Air China jet was one of three in a mini-armada that flew the North Korean entourage to Singapore. The other two were Russian-built aircraft operated by North Korea’s national carrier, Air Koryo. One carried Mr. Kim’s sister and close adviser, Kim Yo-jong. The other was a cargo plane bearing Mr. Kim’s armored stretch limousine. Chinese aviation experts said Mr. Kim probably chose the Air China aircraft because of its greater reliability. Called the 747-4J6, it is a specially outfitted version of the venerable American jet that until three years ago had been used to carry members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the elite inner circle of Communist Party leaders. Mr. Kim’s own official aircraft is a 38-year-old Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-62, Chinese aviation experts said. “The Russian aircraft cannot compare with the Chinese Boeing 747-4J6 for safety and comfort level,” said Gao Zhuo, a columnist for Aerospace Knowledge, a monthly Chinese magazine about flight. Since the Ilyushin Il-62 is no longer in production, and spare parts are scarce, Mr. Kim may have decided against using it to avoid being grounded by a minor mechanical malfunction. “Any incidents on the trip,” Mr. Gao said, and “a proud person like Kim would be very embarrassed.” The Chinese government almost certainly lent Mr. Kim the Air China aircraft without charge as a friendly diplomatic gesture, Chinese foreign policy experts said. “It would be free,” said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University. When asked at a media briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said only that North Korea had asked China to provide the plane. During the flight to Singapore, which could be tracked online, Mr. Kim’s aircraft followed an unusual route through Chinese airspace that appeared to take it over Chinese Air Force bases. This indicated that his plane was most likely escorted by Chinese fighter jets, Mr. Gao said. While the aircraft was built by Boeing, its interior was outfitted by the Chinese government, which has equipped all of its leadership’s jets since a Boeing 767 delivered in 2001 to Jiang Zemin, then president, was reportedly found to be filled with listening devices. As for cabin comfort, Mr. Gao said Chinese leaders do not indulge in overly fancy interiors. Photographs of aircraft used by President Xi Jinping, for instance, usually show desks and seats that are not luxurious, though they do appear more comfortable than those in commercial airliners, Mr. Gao said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Did We Get to the Savagery of ‘Tender Age’ Shelters?,"Will Wilkinson Contributing Opinion Writer Perhaps you’ve come to wonder how tearing babies away from their mothers over a victimless misdemeanor came be the official policy of the United States government. It’s a question on a lot of our minds. Most of us are outraged and livid with shame that the savagery of “tender age” shelters was undertaken by our government, on our behalf. If we’re ready to say “never again,” we need to be willing to expose the roots of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. We need to be willing to cut them out. Blame Donald Trump’s ruthless bigotry, sure. But when the president walked into the Oval Office, he walked into a ready-made, bipartisan immigration policy framework poised for brutality. Militarized borders, deportation squads, an archipelago of internment facilities, hypertrophied executive power, a lurid body of national security and anti-trafficking law sprung from the rich manure of panic — none of this is Mr. Trump’s handiwork. It was an inheritance. And now Mr. Trump has deployed this machinery of repression, bristling with Bush- and Obama-era upgrades, to take terrified innocents hostage. The administration sees the moral horror and basic decency of the American people as weakness it can exploit to extort concessions to its unpopular, hard-right agenda of ethnocultural population control. The president’s fresh executive order, falsely advertised as a reversal on family separation, is nothing but a ransom note. It amounts to a promise to continue ripping families apart unless settled legal protections for Mr. Trump’s child hostages are removed. Stephen Miller, the president’s trusted adviser, is enthusiastic about the possibility that scarring toddlers for life might rally the embattled president’s base and drive favorable midterm turnout. The White House’s nonchalance about using the suffering of children as a means to its political ends is beyond sickening. But a handful of memos altering internal executive agency policy could not have brought us so neatly to the point of kidnapping children and sticking them in warehouses, with no immediately obvious legal problem, if relatively unbounded executive discretion to inflict industrial-scale suffering weren’t already written into law, if decommissioned Walmarts hadn’t already been repurposed as prisons for immigrant kids, and if a moral and legal framework for the justification of this infrastructure had not been well entrenched. The keys to a cruel machine were handed over to a cruel and indecent man. Thousands of families are living inside a nightmare because we knew the machine could be cruelly and indecently used, but we went ahead and built it anyway. To see why it must be disassembled, we need to understand how the seductively paranoid logic of nativist escalation made the step into internment camps for kids so short. For right-wing populists like Mr. Trump, a country is a nation, a nation is a people of a specific culture and complexion, and failure to police the composition of the population threatens to dilute that character beyond recognition. From this perspective, any level of immigration, legal or illegal, economic or humanitarian, that might turn America into a majority-nonwhite country is a recipe for national suicide. If a majority of Americans refuse to accept racial hygiene as a legitimate policy goal that justifies reducing immigration to a trickle, then they must be spooked, deceived and ransomed into doing it anyway. The one-way ratchet that built our cruel immigration enforcement machine really got cranking once “border security” had been more or less universally accepted as an urgent policy goal. The panic fomented by the Sept. 11 attacks, which led to the creation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the serious militarization of the southern border, supplied the critical psychological foundation for restrictionist escalation. But our border with Mexico cuts across a historically, economically and culturally integrated region, and hardening it doesn’t stop the demand or supply of Mexican and Central American labor. Nor does it much discourage refugees fleeing life-threatening civil violence. Intense militarized enforcement does make border-crossing more perilous, so demand for help getting across — for “trafficking” and “smuggling” — goes up. Ascending to the next rung on the ladder of escalation requires capitalizing on other sources of overreaction to criminalize that help. Moral panic over trafficking of sex slaves and forced laborers is promoted not only by religious conservatives looking to crack down on consensual sex work and outlaw pornography but also by feminists and liberal Hollywood do-gooders. This climate of alarm has been tremendously useful to reactionary nationalists looking to seal off borders and routes of migration. This is not to say coerced sex and labor trafficking isn’t a serious and horrifying problem. But there is no reliable data to support the idea that it is rife in the United States or merits emergency action. There is a widespread belief that it does, however, and that has allowed the Trump administration to portray its pitiless war on informal networks of transnational mobility as a way to protect vulnerable people, especially children, from the “criminals” who ply them. And it has helped them justify treating parents seeking physical and economic security for their children as dangerous lawless smugglers of their own sons and daughters. In his first days in office, the president issued an executive order declaring that “the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational criminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis.” The administration has relentlessly characterized the prosecutorial discretion previously exercised to avoid family separation and laws intended to protect detained immigrant children as “loopholes” that have, in Mr. Trump’s words, “created a massive child smuggling trade.” There is no evidence of “a massive child smuggling trade.” There is no evidence of “humanitarian crisis” involving “transnational criminal groups” apart from the crisis of refugees fleeing civil strife in Central America. When considering the administration’s rhetoric about human trafficking, smuggling rings and the humanitarian benevolence of measures like family separation, which, in the words of John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, deter “movement along this terribly dangerous network,” remember that the Underground Railroad was a dangerous network and criminal human smuggling enterprise. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended the administration’s family separation policy this week by intimating that there is a torrent of “adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit.” Ms. Nielsen maintains that “those are traffickers, those are smugglers, that is MS-13, those are criminals, those are abusers.” But the D.H.S.’s own numbers suggest otherwise. The rate of adults apprehended with kids fraudulently posing as family rose from just 0.1 to 0.6 percent of all cases of accompanied minors snagged at the border between 2017 and the first five months of this year. All but a minuscule fraction of kids crossing with adults are in the company of close kin. But every single one of them who crossed between checkpoints was, technically, in the company of a “smuggler,” because the law against “alien smuggling” applies to anyone who has helped an unauthorized migrant across the border, and need not involve coercion or abuse. The administration has offered no data on the portion of the small number of migrants falsely posing as parents who are bad actors rather than, say, second cousins or family friends. In 2016, there were 2,404 alien smuggling convictions. Less than half of those found guilty had a prior criminal history. Most of them were American. Fewer than 50 of them had smuggled a minor. The government offers no evidence to the effect that there’s a crisis-level smuggling and trafficking problem in response to which 100 percent prosecution of misdemeanor “improper entry” violations, family separation or its new demand for indefinite family detention could make any kind of practical or moral sense. Yet the government separated 2,342 children from 2,206 parents at the United States-Mexico border in the short period between May 5 and June 9. The Trump administration is lying to us. It isn’t protecting kids, or anyone, from transnational smuggling rings. It has co-opted the pre-existing ideology of our paranoid, militarized, restrictionist immigration enforcement regime to seal off American territory from ethno-cultural “infestation,” deter legitimate asylum claims, justify the callous abnegation of our humanitarian obligations to refugees and exploit vulnerable people for political leverage. We can’t protect these abused children by allowing the president to use them as hostages to negotiate further escalation and build an even crueler, more powerful, more repressive machine. The fact that we built it at all, and on a bipartisan basis, is a stain on our national conscience. It was made through zero-sum thinking. Us or them. Win or lose. But the ebb and flow of human traffic over borders, the mingling of people and goods and ideas, is the natural pattern of human cooperation, and the durable basis of positive-sum peace. The machine will sputter and fall apart when we see that this movement makes us safe by tying our fortunes together, by making friends and partners of our neighbors. We can regulate rather than impede the natural currents of regional movement, encourage trust and lawful order rather than mutual suspicion and turmoil. We could, if we wanted, make North America great again. Congress is meant to throttle the power of the executive. Until the legislative branch takes back its intended authority, and remembers how to function, the very existence of the machine will tempt its operator with autocratic power. We can’t just tinker with the machine, add a few safety features here and there. We have to smash it. And after we smash it, we have to wage a permanent campaign against the irrational fear that made it possible, so that we never build it again.",The New York Times
2018,How Did the Nazis Gain Power in Germany?,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE DEATH OF DEMOCRACY Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic By Benjamin Carter Hett Illustrated. 280 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30. We ask about the rise of the Nazis from what we think is a great distance. We take for granted that the Germans of the 1930s were quite different from ourselves, and that our consideration of their errors will only confirm our superiority. The opposite is the case. Although Benjamin Carter Hett makes no comparisons between Germany then and the United States now in “The Death of Democracy,” his extremely fine study of the end of constitutional rule in Germany, he dissolves those comforting assumptions. He is not discussing a war in which Germans were enemies or describing atrocities that we are sure we could never commit. He presents Hitler’s rise as an element of the collapse of a republic confronting dilemmas of globalization with imperfect instruments and flawed leaders. With careful prose and fine scholarship, with fine thumbnail sketches of individuals and concise discussions of institutions and economics, he brings these events close to us. The Nazis, in Hett’s account, were above all “a nationalist protest movement against globalization.” Even before the Great Depression brought huge unemployment to Germany, the caprice of the global economy offered an opportunity to politicians who had simple answers. In their 1920 program, the Nazis proclaimed that “members of foreign nations (noncitizens) are to be expelled from Germany.” Next would come autarky: Germans would conquer the territory they needed to be self-sufficient, and then create their own economy in isolation from that of the rest of the world. As Goebbels put it, “We want to build a wall, a protective wall.” Hitler maintained that the vicissitudes of globalization were not the result of economic forces but of a Jewish international conspiracy. Hett, a professor of history at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, sensitively describes a moral crisis that preceded a moral catastrophe. If Jews were held responsible for what happened in Germany, then Germans were victims and their actions always defensive. Political irresponsibility flowed from the unfortunate example of President Paul von Hindenburg. He was famous as the victor in a battle on the Eastern Front of World War I, even though the credit was not fully deserved. Hindenburg could not face the reality of defeat on the Western Front in 1918, and so spread the lie that the German Army had been “stabbed in the back” by Jews and Socialists. This moral weakness of one man radiated outward. Once Hindenburg won the presidential elections of 1925, Germany was trapped by his oversensitivity about a reputation that would not withstand scrutiny. He believed that only he could save Germany, but would not put himself forward to do so, for fear of damaging his image. Without Hindenburg’s founding fiction and odd posturing, it is unlikely that Hitler would have come to power. As Hett capably shows, the Nazis were the great artists of victimhood fiction. Hitler, who had served with German Jews in the war, spread the idea that Jews had been the enemy within, proposing that the German Army would have won had some of them been gassed to death. Goebbels had Nazi storm troopers attack leftists precisely so that he could claim that the Nazis were victims of Communist violence. Hitler believed in telling lies so big that their very scale left some residue of credibility. The Nazi program foresaw that newspapers would serve the “general good” rather than reporting, and promised “legal warfare” against opponents who spread information they did not like. They opposed what they called “the system” by rejecting its basis in the factual world. Germans were not rational individuals with interests, the reasoning went, but members of a tribe that wanted to follow a leader (Führer). Much of this was familiar from Italian Fascism, but Hitler’s attempt to imitate Mussolini’s March on Rome failed. When Hitler tried a coup d’état in 1923, he and the Nazis were easily defeated and he was sentenced to prison, where he wrote “Mein Kampf.” In Hett’s account, the electoral rise of the Nazis in the late 1920s and early 1930s had less to do with his particular ideas and more to do with an opening on the political spectrum. The Nazis filled a void between the Catholic electorate of the Center Party and a working class that voted Socialist or Communist. Their core constituents, Hett indicates, were Protestants from the countryside or small towns who felt themselves to be the victims of globalization. Did the Nazis come to power through democratic elections? In Germany in the 1930s, as elsewhere, elections continued even as their meaning changed. The fact that the Nazis used violence to intimidate others meant that elections were not free in the normal sense. And the system was rigged in their favor by men in power who had no use for democracy or for democrats. The Nazis were by no means the handmaidens of German industry or the German military but, as Hett argues, both businessmen and officers formed lobbies in the late 1920s that aimed to break the republic and its bastion, the Social Democrats. They tended to confuse their particular interests in lower wages and higher military spending with those of the German nation as a whole. This made it easy to see the Social Democrats as foreign and hostile. In a similarly titled book, “How Democracies Die,” the political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky have recently argued that the killers of democracy begin by using the law against itself. Constitutions break when ill-motivated leaders deliberately expose their vulnerabilities. Certainly this was the case in Germany in 1930. President Hindenburg was technically within his rights to dissolve the Reichstag, name a new chancellor and rule by decree. By turning what was meant to be an exceptional situation into the rule, however, he transformed the German government into a feuding clique disconnected from society. Governments dependent upon the president had no reason to think creatively about policy, despite the Great Depression. Voters flowed to both extremes, to the Communists and even more to the Nazis. The Nazis took advantage of an opportunity created by people who could destroy a republic while lacking the imagination to see what comes next. When elections were called in 1932, the purpose was not to confirm democracy but to bring down the republic. Hindenburg and his advisers saw the Nazis as a group capable of creating a majority for the right. The elections were a “solution” to a fake crisis that had been, as Hett puts it, “manufactured by a political right wing that wanted to exclude more than half the population from political representation and refused even the mildest compromise.” It did not occur to the president’s camp that the Nazis would do as well as they did, or that their leader would escape their control. And so the feckless schemes of the conservatives realized the violent dreams of the Nazis. The Nazis won 37 percent of the vote in July, 33 percent in a November election, and Hitler became chancellor in January 1933. A few weeks later, he used the pretext of the arson of the Reichstag to pass an enabling act that in effect replaced the constitution. Hindenburg died in 1934 believing that he had saved Germany and his own reputation. In fact, he had created the conditions for the great horror of modern times. Hett’s book is implicitly addressed to conservatives. Rather than asking how the left could have acted to stop Hitler, he closes his book by considering the German conservatives who aided Hitler’s rise, then changed their minds and plotted against him. Following the recent work of Rainer Orth, Hett says that the Night of the Long Knives, the blood purge of June 1934, was directed mainly against these right-wing opponents. The conclusions for conservatives of today emerge clearly: Do not break the rules that hold a republic together, because one day you will need order. And do not destroy the opponents who respect those rules, because one day you will miss them. An earlier version of this review misstated the year of Hitler’s attempted coup. It was 1923, not 1924.

2018,How Do You Pack for a Yearlong Trip? ,"Our 52 Places Traveler has spent the past five months on the road figuring out how to answer that question. Here are her most important takeaways on packing and prepping for long-term solo travel. You know those paisley Vera Bradley duffels beloved by sorority sisters and grandmas nationwide? I dragged one with me for the first four legs of my impossible, wonderful 52 Places trip because it was the only luggage I owned that fit all the things I thought I needed. It went home just before I left the United States, which made up the first few legs of my trip, along with some 20 pounds of clothes, according to my luggage scale. (I eventually ditched that, too.) Blogs, travel writers, foreign correspondent friends, and flight attendants all gave me great advice, but the past five months of hopscotching through climates and national borders have been figuring out what works for me, with trial — and a ton of error. Here are my most important takeaways on packing and prepping for long-term solo travel. I got so stressed out about packing and starting a new job that I totally overlooked what I needed most: the proper credit cards to make sure I had access to money at all times. Not having those before I left was the single biggest headache of the early part of this trip. I had to wait 40 days to get approved for a Chase Sapphire Reserve — widely considered the best card for international travel, despite its $450 annual fee (you can make it up with a $300 annual travel credit and quick points accumulation) — and instead use a Citibank Prestige ($450 annual fee, and a lot of similar benefits) that only came with a $7,000 limit. Between the costs of this trip, and huge deposits required by Latin American rental car companies, I was paying down my balance every other day. (And spending more time crying on the phone to customer service reps than talking to my family.) Points and perks are great, but you need cards that work in real life. Three, each with no foreign transaction fees, are worth consideration: the Reserve (mine came with a $27,000 limit); Capital One Quicksilver (a good backup with modest cash back and no annual fee); and something from this list with chip + PIN capabilities since you can’t use automated kiosks in Europe without one. Also consider a Charles Schwab Investor Checking Account — they reimburse your A.T.M. fees. For more, the team at Wirecutter, a New York Times Company, has an in-depth guide to travel rewards cards and their perks. First, ask the question: What kind of traveler am I? Rugged backpacker? Chic minimalist with a spinner bag? Then pick luggage that helps you realize that. Wirecutter has suggestions here depending on what you need and how you travel. I’m a grown-woman multimedia journalist hauling (and keeping an eye on) all my own stuff. So I needed the most compact, most capacious bags I could actually lift myself. My kit: a roller carry-on for clothes and toiletries, a backpack for some 20 pounds of computing and camera gear, and a small purse because I don’t know how to live without one. As important as credit cards are, my number one concern going into this trip was: What happens when I get my period? Like many people with a uterus, it sometimes ruins my life for up to a week every month. And I almost never see it mentioned in travel writing, which is overwhelmingly dominated by men. OB Ultra Tampons, the only ones that work for my heavy flow, are hard enough to find in New York City, let alone on the road. So I’ve been trying menstrual cups (greater capacity, re-useable) paired with Thinx (cutest of the period underwear I tried and Wirecutter approved; order a size up) — and the results have been dismaying. I’ve bled on clothes and hotel sheets from Montgomery, Ala., to Oslo. Emptying the cup in public restrooms is also an embarrassing dance I haven’t mastered. There’s a definite upside to cups. On my one successful week, I went on an eight-hour hike in Peru and never once had to squat behind a bush to change a tampon. But you need a lot of test runs before hitting the road. One menstrual-cup advocate told me it took her 3 years to find the right fit! High heels, bomber jackets, good dresses and my favorite leather handbag all went back in the first shipment home. My new motto: A trip like this will ruin any object you love. Since then I’ve lived out of my LeSportsac Essential Crossbody purse. It’s virtually theft-proof and holds all my essentials (wallet, phone, external batteries, Ray-Bans, lip balm, passport) in well-organized compartments. Plus, it’s washable, which has proved crucial in disasters involving powdered sunscreen and melted chocolate. For a suitcase, I very intentionally chose a two-wheeled Briggs & Riley Baseline International Carry-On (acquired at the wonderful Luggage Super Outlet near Disney Springs). Sure, it’s a tad heavy (9.13 pounds) and expensive ($399 wholesale). But it also has a unique soft-bodied design that makes it roomy and easy to pack. I can sit on it in train stations, drag it over cobblestones and check it whenever I want. Plus, those sturdy two wheels won’t roll away from me if I get distracted, which gives me one extra layer of protection against theft. Backpacks were trickier, but I’m happy with the third one I bought, the $170 Osprey Fairview 40, which features a spine-saving aluminum frame, waistband and chest strap. (Remember to get a rain cover.) Check out a full review of the Osprey here. You can never have too many bags inside your bags. Eagle Creek packing cubes (a Wirecutter favorite!) and compression sacks keep my clothes ordered (I use the roll method) and nylon mesh pouches from Muji and The Container Store hold everything else. Things that could leak get Ziplocs. An REI Co-op Flash 22 Print Pack packs flat and comes out as my daypack. And a Loqi bag tote is endlessly handy. You know those go-bags you keep in your closet to grab and run when the baby is coming, or when the apocalypse hits? The same concept applies to intense travel. Assume you have to walk out the door in five minutes and won’t come back for 12 hours. My purse is always ready with my Sony RX100 camera; my charger for its terrible battery; two of my three portable batteries; two wall-charging blocks; a converter plug; and both a micro-USB and an iPhone cord. Plus tampons, of course. Duplicates and spares live in a Skooba Cable Stable DLX gadget organizer, and are always back at the hotel charging for the next outing Hotel outlets are never as convenient or as abundant as you want them to be. The miraculous Allocacoc Power Cube gives me four conventional sockets for American devices, two USB ports and a bunch of plug adapters. I supplement it with one six-foot Anker USB cable that can stretch to my bed from most parts of a room, or one of my portable batteries. Speaking of batteries, three seems to be the magic number: two big ones for long days (an Anker PowerCore 20100 and a Tronsmart Presto 10000) and a small Jackery bar that recharges much faster than the other two. You can read reviews of the PowerCore and Jackery here. Default to comfort over style. Stick to black and neutrals, for easier mixing and matching — and better hiding of stains. Add color through jewelry and scarves. Also, pick fabrics like merino wool that are anti-wrinkle, dry quickly and don’t retain smells. My staples: Hanky Panky retro thong underwear (wide lace waistband that doesn’t create a muffin top); SmartWool and Darn Tough socks; Chantelle and True Body Lift bras; a sports bra; this great Arcteryx Cala dress in black; something long-sleeved for sun protection; and a retro one-piece Esther Williams bathing suit that works for going out when paired with black shorts from Joy in London. From the waist down, it’s all about leggings. For casual and travel days, I wear Outdoor Voices 7/8 Warmup Leggings in deep-sea blue. All other days I’m in Wolford Velour Leggings — elegant, velvety soft multi-taskers that may be the single greatest clothing purchase I’ve made in years ($425, though I got them on discount). They’ve even kept me warm hiking in Patagonia and Iceland. I may never wear jeans again. Oh, stinky clothes, the bane of the long distance traveler. Regular sink washings with Dr. Bronner’s Castile Soap go a long way. But my go-to trick is spot treating with a small spray bottle filled with Dryel. Makes everything smell fresh in seconds. I practically cried when I ran out a week ago. Shoes are notoriously tough to pack. To make the cut in my bag they have to serve multiple functions, feel comfortable, pack easily, stand up to water and dirt and look okay. Right now I have blue Altra Escalantes for walking (clouds for my feet!); black Columbia Fire Venture Mid Waterproof hiking boots for outdoor excursions and rainy days; and Reef flip flops. (Make sure you like the look of those boots because you’ll be wearing them on most flights to avoid packing them.) All I need now is a dress sneaker. If a lifetime of skiing and snowboarding has taught me anything, it’s that layers beat bulk. My second skin is a super-thin Ibex merino wool sweater-jacket that a good friend gave me (Athleta has similar options). Heat Holder fleece lined tights can be worn on their own or under leggings. A Brazilian Canga scarf (a gift from 52 Places finalist Shannon Sims) doubles as sarong and a towel. In place of a winter coat, I pair two jackets: my flattering teal and navy Salomon Halo Down Jacket II and an urbanite-cool K-Way Jacques Plus Rain Jacket. The combo kept me dry-ish in Chile and Iceland and doubles as a pillow. Two reporter friends, Heidi Vogt, who has lived in Afghanistan and both East and West Africa, and Jean H. Lee, an expert on North Korea, were my packing gurus, so I melded their suggestions with a few tricks of my own. Beyond the basics (Band-aids, anti-bacterial ointment, ibuprofen), you want: — Lavender oil for bug bites. — Loperamide (Imodium), Cipro and oral rehydration salts for the inevitable G-I issues. And Travelan, which you take before meals to prevent the inevitable. — A SteriPEN water purifier, which came in handy when I was holed up in hotels in South America with no bottled water around. — Lacrosse ball for rolling on sore muscles (a physical therapy trick). Besides clothes, most of what I eliminated in my first purge were beauty products. As long as I have sunscreen, bug spray and, yes, tampons — all can be tough to find when you need them — I’m winning. Lotion should be multipurpose (Embryolisse Lait-Crème works for hands and face). Whenever possible, replace liquids with powders or solids. Get a Violife Slim Sonic battery-operated toothbrush (every seasoned lady traveler I know has one). Mascara and a red lip pencil that won’t melt has been all the makeup I’ve needed. Like many women who like wearing dresses, I spend my summers combating “chub rub” — the irritation that comes from your sweaty inner thighs rubbing together. Imperative: two pairs of Spanx Thinstincts, which are like lightweight bike shorts that prevent skin-to-skin contact, and a stick of Megababe, which you apply when you don’t want to wear the Spanx. (Stick deodorant and baby powder also work in a pinch.) I can’t deal with shaving my legs daily, or the itch of stubble growing back. So I always travel with a Braun epilator. It pulls leg hair out by the root, so the hair takes longer to grow back. Be warned, it can be intense for first-timers. Travel days are always when I lose things. So I try to make them my personal Groundhog’s Day; the more militant the sameness, the more I’ll notice if anything is off. Same hotel check out procedure, same outfit, same flight accessories. On my always list: Compression socks — the best I’ve tried are from Cep Compression — and noise canceling earbuds (I use them for transcribing interviews), though you don’t need super expensive ones. I love traveling with a full-size Bluetooth Apple keyboard that I hook up to my phone for writing out stories and emails (another Jean Lee trick). It weighs next to nothing and allows me to leave my computer at the hotel if I’m trying to upload photos on Wi-Fi, or am worried about rain or pickpockets. It’s especially helpful on long days away from wall outlets. The computer will die, but the phone-keyboard-portable-battery combo can go much longer. And that iPad? I thought I’d need it for watching movies on planes. It just became another thing to pull out at airport security. I don’t miss it.

2018,How Do You Solve a Problem Like the Verrazano? With an Extra Z,"ALBANY — The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge: A colossal expanse linking Brooklyn and Staten Island, once the longest suspension bridge in the world and a proud symbol of New York City’s history and urban geography. Language of origin: Italian. Part of speech: noun. Spelling: Wrong. The iconic bridge, with one Z, was christened in 1960 in honor of the 16th-century explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, with two Zs. After the better part of a century of wrangling over the spelling of the name, the state seems poised to finally rectify what is possibly the biggest unintentional slight in the annals of American public architecture. “It does a justice for the injustice that has been done over the years,” said Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican who represents parts of Brooklyn and who is the sponsor of a bill, unanimously passed in the Senate, that would add a long-truant Z to the bridge’s name. “Verrazzano was a great discoverer, a great explorer,” Mr. Golden said. To have the name misspelled all these years — “It’s shameful,” he said. The orthographic debate the bill seeks to settle is older than the bridge itself. Even before construction on the structure began, city and state leaders were squabbling over the spelling, with Gov. W. Averell Harriman stumping for two Zs, and the aides of his successor, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, championing just one. The war pitted zealous One-Zers against Two-Zers, encyclopedists against museum officials, historians against the Italian ambassador. In 1959, at the zenith of the dispute, officials en route to a groundbreaking ceremony for the planned Verrazano-Narrows Bridge found themselves in a boat called the “Verrazzano.” The One-Zers carried the day, and the bridge as currently named — two Rs, one Z, one N, and more than a few angry Italian-Americans — was born. Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the bridge, said a spelling fix would cost the agency roughly $350,000 to replace “96 signs of varying sizes.” The final price tag is likely to be much higher, as the state and city transportation departments also own signs on nearby roads; renaming the Triborough Bridge after Robert F. Kennedy cost more than $4 million. The M.T.A. figure pales in comparison — but is perhaps still no insignificant sum for an agency bedeviled by arguably bigger problems than nomenclature. (Mr. Golden later said the bill would be amended so that only two signs would need to be immediately changed, one on each side of the bridge; others could be fixed in the course of normal replacement.) Advocates of the change say it’s the message, not the price, that matters. “I understand that there’s a cost involved in doing these things, but I think the cost over time is minuscule compared to the psychological and emotional effect that it has on people,” Joseph V. Scelsa, the president of the Italian American Museum in Lower Manhattan, said. “It’s important that we make it up in this country, not only for Italian names but all names.” The true difficulty may not be so much cost as past practice. Since its opening in 1964, the bridge has become a fixture of the city’s literature, and the paper trail left by that lone, controversial Z is long. One of New York’s most venerated writers, Gay Talese, wrote an entire book about the bridge, one Z. Opinion pieces have denounced its infamous $17 one-way toll. Local businesses bear its name. “That’s the name, and that is the norm,” said Tomas Kim, the owner of Verrazano Bicycle Shop in Brooklyn, who said he does not plan to change his store’s name. “It was a mistake from the beginning, but it’s the name of the area.” “We’re not changing our name,” said John Miraglia, the manager of Verrazano Motorworks on Staten Island, said. “I mean, I’m Italian. A lot of our names got changed when we came here. It’s not really a big deal.” (The bill would sway at least one local establishment: Public School 101 in Brooklyn, also known as The Verrazano; education department spokesman Doug Cohen said the sight of a misspelled proper noun was “enough to make any educator shudder” and that the school would “take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of all future spelling bees.”) The bill zipped through the Senate on Wednesday, and will now go to the Assembly. If passed there, it would then be put to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has his own history of bridge-naming tussles. As for the other bills, on topics from reproductive rights to speed safety cameras, still pending before the State Senate, which has been locked in a political stalemate for days? Zero, zip, zilch.",The New York Times
2018,How Elastic Is Your Brain?,"The Shortlist THE BIOLOGICAL MIND How Brain, Body, and Environment Collaborate to Make Us Who We Are By Alan Jasanoff 292 pp. Basic Books. $30. Jasanoff’s big message in “The Biological Mind” is you are not your brain. Or rather, you are not merely your brain — your body and the broader circumstances of your life also make you who you are. Jasanoff reminds us that the brain is not some mystical machine — it’s a gooey, bloody tangle of cells, dripping with chemicals. But we mythologize brains, creating false boundaries that divorce them from bodies and the outside world, blinding us to the biological nature of the mind. These divisions, Jasanoff contends, are why neuroscience has failed to make a real difference in anyone’s life. Unfortunately, the book’s own divisions between body versus brain, and nature versus nurture, reinforce the very dualisms that Jasanoff indicts. He gives examples of the ways our bodies and the world around us affect our thoughts, feelings and actions, but not how body and world become biologically embedded to constitute a mind. Missing is a discussion of how the workings of your body necessarily and irrevocably shape your brain’s structure and function, and vice versa. The artificial boundary between brain and world also goes largely unmentioned. In real life, the experiences we have from infancy onward impact the brain’s wiring. For example, childhood poverty and adversity fundamentally alter brain development, leaving an indelible mark that increases people’s risk of illness in adulthood. This is fascinating and profound stuff, but it mostly goes unexamined in Jasanoff’s book. Still, “The Biological Mind” is chock-full of fun facts that entertain. And best of all, it makes you think. I found myself debating with Jasanoff in my head as I read — surely a sign of a worthy book. MY PLASTIC BRAIN One Woman’s Yearlong Journey to Discover if Science Can Improve Her Mind By Caroline Williams 278 pp. Prometheus. $24. Williams is on a quest to change her brain (or as Jasanoff would say, a quest to improve her mind, which is partially constituted by her brain). She is a chronically distracted worrier who is disorganized and constantly getting lost. Each chapter recounts her adventures with the latest, greatest “brain-training” tool to improve her mental skills. She starts off, for example, by attempting to increase her ability to pay attention and resist distraction by having scientists “zap” her with targeted electromagnetic energy to the outside of her head. In subsequent chapters, she tries to reduce her anxiety, expand her creativity, improve her math ability, calibrate her inner GPS and take control over her perception of the passing of time, using various brain-hacking techniques. Each chapter is a mini-redemption story, with Williams starting out skeptical and ending victorious. Williams writes in a familiar, dinner-party style, delighting guests with tales of her exploits. If I were invited to that party, though, I’d be the insufferable person nit-picking at the scientific warts in her stories. These include her persistent Cartesian dualism separating the brain and its “owner,” inaccurate metaphors like a reference to brain regions “lighting up,” and outdated scientific claims that the brain is a battleground between an inner burglar alarm in the amygdala and a wellspring of reason in the cerebral cortex. But it probably does Williams a disservice to read her intriguing quest for self-improvement as a primer on the inner workings of the brain. That’s not her aim. “My Plastic Brain” is best appreciated as an enjoyable memoir, not a book that explains the science of how plasticity really works under the hood. ELASTIC Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change By Leonard Mlodinow 252 pp. Pantheon. $28.95. As a professor, I encourage my students to question their textbooks and their own deeply held beliefs, and turn assumptions on their head, even (in fact, especially) when it makes them uncomfortable to do so. I ask them to take on contradicting ideas and embrace the ambiguity. And when failure comes, as it inevitably will, I remind them to treat their discomfort not as a damper but as a signal to press on. This is what Mlodinow calls “elastic thinking” and he tells an absorbing story about the what, why, and how of it. He skillfully weaves scientific findings with stories of people, events, and the natural world, using clever analogies and metaphors. For example, his depiction of the brain as an ant colony, with individual neurons as ants, is a true gem. As much as I enjoy Mlodinow’s storytelling, the scientific details gave me whiplash. Some of his understanding of brain structure and function is bang on, but he also presents numerous outdated scientific claims. For example, he writes that the brain is made of neurons organized in a hierarchy, which is correct, but he embeds this in an antiquated view of brain structure that experts in brain evolution have pooh-poohed for decades. Mistakes inevitably follow, like treating the brain’s reward system as synonymous with emotions and how they manifest (it isn’t). He points out that neurons are always firing (true), but he localizes this brain-wide phenomenon to just one brain network (false). “Elastic,” like the previous two books reviewed here, illustrates how difficult it is for science writers to keep up with the pace of discovery outside of their areas of expertise. Mlodinow’s book is a story about human creativity, innovation and independent thought. His tidbits from literature, the history of science, politics and his own life experiences create an absorbing narrative about the ways in which humans can open their minds to new insights. “Elastic” is sure to inspire someone to pick up where it leaves off, sorting out the neuroscientific understanding of elastic thinking using a scientific process that’s worthy of the name.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Entitled Parents Hurt Schools,"The authors’ research focuses on equity in American public education. There is a widespread view in education that poor parents are trouble: They don’t spend enough time reading to children, monitoring their homework, attending school events or helping teachers. Educators, at times, complain bitterly about them, and many policies have been designed to address these issues. With economic segregation in the United States worsening, there is likely to be a growing number of school districts where poor children, and poor parents, predominate. Yet, economic segregation, which is more pronounced among families with children, also creates public school districts where affluent families predominate. This can lead to trouble in schools, but of a distinct kind. Motivated by a fierce desire to protect their children and themselves from difficulty, and armed with a robust sense of entitlement as well as ample economic, cultural and social resources, affluent parents can create conflict and interfere with school districts on a scale that is rarely acknowledged. We saw this firsthand during the research for our recent study of an affluent school district in the Northeast. We call this district Kingsley, to preserve the anonymity of the interviews we conducted with families and school officials. As of the 2010 census, more than a third of households in the district had an annual income of $150,000 or more, and the median home value exceeded $450,000. More than 70 percent of adult residents had at least a bachelor’s degree, over twice the national average. Kingsley was also extremely successful academically. It was a “destination district,” with average SAT scores nearly 250 points above the state average on the 2,400-point scale. We started visiting this community — which is similar to places like the Boston suburb Newton, Mass. — to understand how parents decide where to live and send their children to school. After the study had begun, Kingsley administrators began the process of redrawing boundaries for the district’s high schools to balance attendance numbers. Administrators, of course, don’t want children crowded into one school while there are empty seats in classrooms in another. Since they cannot control where parents live within the district, they sometimes reassign certain neighborhoods’ students from one school to another. This provoked an outcry among many of the parents, which we documented. At no point was there a suggestion, by parents or administrators, that the educational quality of one of the two high schools was worse. However, the reassignment would have increased some students’ travel time, by an average of about 10 minutes. The reassignment process lasted for almost a year. Once the district began releasing proposals, there were vigorous protests, which led to revised proposals and new protests. We read more than 3,000 emails and letters from parents to administrators and the school board on the subject. We transcribed video recordings of the 18 board meetings that took place during the controversy, including the public commentary at these sessions. [Are modern American parents self-absorbed? Or just doing what’s best for their children? Read the discussion.] Many of these meetings were held in packed auditoriums, with hundreds of angry parents. At the end of one meeting, parents were visibly distraught. Groups of mothers gathered together, and one was crying as she said, “It is not fair.” Her friend told her, “We will fight it!” Another agitated mother worried, “How am I going to tell my 12-year-old?” The capacity of the parents and guardians at Kingsley to impede the reassignment process was due in large part to their noneconomic resources: the professional skills and connections they could deploy in a fight against the school district. School administrators found themselves confronted not just by disgruntled parents but by pediatricians, urban planners, public relations specialists and psychologists. These parents had an extraordinary capacity for mobilization. At one parent meeting we observed, no fewer than 10 committees were formed. When administrators denied parents’ requests for a school-bus ride-along so that parents could time the proposed bus routes, parents — with stopwatches in hand — collected their own data on travel times. They recruited local politicians to attend their planning meetings and solicited letters of support from outside experts. At school board meetings, administrators found themselves presented with two inch-thick binders full of copies of peer-reviewed studies, meant to demonstrate the shortcomings of the administrators’ proposals. Although the district ultimately passed and implemented a plan, the process consumed vast amounts of administrators’ time, energy and resources. The superintendent estimated that he devoted 70 to 80 percent of his working time over several months to the redistricting process. At one point, the administration felt it necessary to have law enforcement present at board meetings, after an incident in which a board member was confronted by a hostile resident. The superintendent called the process a “Nor’easter” that damaged the school district’s reputation and diverted his attention from other substantive issues, including curriculum planning and supporting students in the transition from middle school to high school. This kind of conflict between school districts and affluent parents is not unique to Kingsley. Parents protested when their school districts redrew attendance boundaries in Union County, N.C., and they sued in Forsyth County, Ga. On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, some affluent parents of children from a well-funded, overwhelmingly white school bitterly protested a plan to increase racial diversity in schools, despite support for the plan from the parent councils and school leadership. A PTA “donation balancing system” in California’s Santa Monica-Malibu district, in which funds are shared across the district, helped fuel a movement to create a separate, more affluent school district. There are consequences to this phenomenon of “opportunity hoarding” by well-to-do parents. A number of researchers have described, for example, the various ways that parents, generally upper middle class, monitor and scrutinize teachers and principals, which can diminish educators’ authority. Parents who secure their child’s admission to a “gifted” program, despite insufficient test results, undermine the legitimacy of these tests and programs. [Is there any correlation between a parent’s involvement in a school and the child’s performance in that school? Here’s what studies say.] Intense parental involvement in schools is not always helpful to children, either. In certain situations, it can lead to higher levels of stress among children and intrafamilial conflict. In 1932, Willard Waller’s classic work on the sociology of teaching pronounced parents and educators to be “natural enemies”: Parents are concerned for their own children, while educators look to the success of all students. This is an inherent tension, and one that parents and school administrators should understand better. Controversies can escalate quickly, and unprepared educators sometimes make things worse. Democratic processes are essential in public school districts, but educators should also find ways to listen to parents’ concerns and resolve matters quickly and decisively. All parents want the best for their children, but a key goal of public education is to create citizens with a vision of a common good. Upper-middle-class parents are understandably anxious about the futures of their children in an increasingly competitive global economy, but not every issue is worthy of a fight. Parents should think about what matters in the long run and reflect on whether their actions might be contributing to greater inequality. Affluent parents bring powerful resources to schools. They should also model thoughtful civic engagement that considers collective, rather than simply individual, benefits.",The New York Times
2018,"How Good Is the Trump Economy, Really?","It depends on whether you look at the level, the direction or the rate of change — three concepts that are often conflated. The Trump administration has become downright boastful about the state of the economy. “In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America,” the president tweeted recently. After I analyzed the May employment data by consulting a thesaurus and writing a cheeky article using a lot of near-synonyms for “good,” the Trump administration blasted it out approvingly to the White House press list and through a presidential tweet. But I also received some blowback from liberals. There were some similarly good months for job growth in the Obama administration, they noted. And my analysis was not nearly so effusive then. So which is it? Is the economy doing exceptionally well, or performing only about as well as it did in the late years of the Obama administration? The answer depends on precisely how you phrase the question, which in turn hinges on a crucial distinction that people often fail to make when talking about the economy. There’s a big difference between the level of economic performance; the direction of change in the economy; and the pace of change. Think of the economy as a bathtub. The level of the water in the tub — how much economic activity there is — is one useful, interesting question. Whether the water level is rising or falling — is this an economic expansion or recession? — is a separate question. And how fast the water level is changing — what is the pace of growth? — is a third question. All might be useful information, but they capture different things. And too much of the debate over how the economy is doing conflates them. So how good is the Trump economy? It depends on which of these approaches you take. The economy looks strongest if you look only at the level of economic activity, not the rate of change. For example, per-person gross domestic product adjusted for inflation is at its highest level on record, as are other similar measures of output. That isn’t very surprising. Over time, workers tend to become more productive thanks to improving technology and the nation’s stock of machinery and other capital increases. So we expect G.D.P. to rise most of the time, and to fall only during the occasional recession. By this measure, 60 percent of the time since modern G.D.P. statistics began in 1947, a president could accurately claim that the economy is the best it has ever been. Other measures of the level of economic performance are also quite good, though not historically so. The 3.8 percent unemployment level is the lowest in 18 years, but it was lower in 1969. The lowest on record was 2.5 percent in 1953. And the very low jobless rate masks some weakness in the labor market. Among adults in their prime working years, 79.2 percent were working in May, which is still below that statistic’s 80.3 percent recent high in early 2007 and its record high of 81.9 percent in 2000. Still, if you look only at the level at which the economy is performing, the Trump administration does have plenty to be excited about. Similarly, the direction of the economy looks to be positive by almost every measure. Employers are adding jobs; output is rising, as are incomes. Another term for a shrinking economy would be an economy in recession, and there is no reason to believe that a recession is currently underway. Then there’s the growth rate. This is the measure by which the Trump economy looks very much like a simple, straightforward continuation of President Obama’s second term. In 2016, for example, Mr. Obama’s last year in office, employers added an average of 195,000 jobs a month. In the first 17 months of the Trump administration, the average has been 190,000. It shows up in G.D.P. numbers, too. What may look like a nice smooth line of steady improvement in per-capita G.D.P. growth in the chart above looks a lot more herky-jerky when you look at the same data in terms of percent change over the previous year. And looking at the growth rate instead of the level shows that the 2.09 percent improvement in the first year of the Trump administration is below a couple of the peaks of the Obama second term, including a 3 percent reading in the year ending in the first quarter of 2015. In talking about the economy, the level, direction and rate of change all matter. They just matter in different ways. The late 1990s, for example, featured both strong levels of economic activity and fast growth. In the aftermath of a steep recession in 1982, there was a different combination: a weak level of economic activity paired with fast growth. The 2010-2011 time frame featured weak economic activity paired with slow growth, a nasty combination. The reason my analysis was more effusive about the recent economic results than it was about similar growth numbers during the Obama administration is that strong growth numbers are more impressive — and unexpected — at a time when the level of economic activity is already high. When the jobless rate was, say, 7 percent, we needed strong job growth just to put the unemployed back to work. To get similar job growth rates with an unemployment rate below 4 percent is reason for a little more giddiness. So what is the most honest way of talking about the Trump economy? It goes like this: The president inherited an economy that had come a long way toward healing. During his administration, the economy has continued growing at about the same rate it did before he took office, pushing incomes, employment and output to yet higher levels. There are plenty of problems that remain in the United States, economic and otherwise, and the degree of credit the president deserves for the state of the economy is an open debate. But this is a bathtub that is already pretty full, and the water’s rising nicely.",The New York Times
2018,How Guardianship Laws Still Control Saudi Women ,"The right to drive is only one small step toward full legal equality. Saudi women are subject to what are known as guardianship laws, legal codes based on a strict interpretation of Shariah law, coupled with a rigidly traditional view of the sexes. In many aspects of life, a woman remains a legal dependent, no matter her age, education level or marital status. She needs a male guardian — a father, uncle, husband, brother or son — to consent to a variety of basic needs. “It’s a long struggle, and a long road to serious equality,” said Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi anthropologist at the London School of Economics. In 2000, Saudi Arabia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, including the guardianship system. Last year, King Salman signed a series of royal decrees that have loosened some of these restrictions. But in a range of activities and life choices, Saudi women cannot decide themselves. The Education Ministry generally requires a guardian, known as a wali, to approve a young woman’s enrollment in school. If she wants to study in a university outside her hometown, a guardian needs to approve her travel and accommodations. If she wins a scholarship to study abroad, a guardian must approve her application for a passport and give consent for her to depart the country. Traditional customs mean that young women studying abroad generally need a male relative to accompany them, acting as chaperones. Companies and government offices customarily ask a woman to bring her guardian to consent to paid employment outside the home, although the law does not formally require this. Also by custom, banks require a guardian’s approval for a woman to open a savings account, let alone get a loan or credit card. Women only last year got the right to open a business in their own name and the right to sign a rental contract for housing in their own name, although many landlords refuse to consider a single woman as a tenant. Permission to marry must be granted by a guardian. Without guardian consent, a Saudi court will not recognize a marriage. Women who would like to marry non-Saudis must seek the approval of the Ministry of Interior, another process that requires a guardian’s consent. Permission to marry a non-Muslim is close to impossible in Saudi Arabia. Within the guardianship system, once a woman is married, her husband becomes her guardian. If her husband dies, guardianship transfers to her son — or back to her father, or an uncle if her father is dead. Women in Saudi Arabia are not guaranteed a fair trail. Their witness statements carry half the weight of a man’s. Women are allowed half the inheritance of male family members. A recent royal decree reversed decades of precedent whereby divorced women would automatically lose custody of children to their husbands. A woman who does not heed her guardian can be arrested on charges of “disobedience.” If a woman is detained for any reason, the police will not release her unless her guardian comes to pick her up — even if she faces no criminal charges. Women practice law in Saudi Arabia, but there are no women judges. Passports and state identification documents must be procured with the consent of a woman’s guardian. But Saudi women do not need their guardian’s approval to get a driver’s license. Women are expected to wear all-encompassing and modest attire while in public. Saudi Arabia employs an entire division of police responsible for maintaining public morality, and can detain women and men whose clothing and actions do not conform to strict interpretations of proper dress. Recent reforms mean that some public spaces are now open for limited social mixing of the genders, like cinemas or sports events, but even in those areas of public life, women are expected to be accompanied by a male chaperone. Religious police no longer have the power to make arrests, but they remain on the job.",The New York Times

2018,How Hunting Became a Macho Sport,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE FAIR CHASE The Epic Story of Hunting in America By Philip Dray Illustrated. 396 pp. Basic Books. $32. Sport hunting enjoyed a long and snooty history centuries before the establishment of the United States. King Henry VIII hunted stags the way President Trump golfs: often, with entourage and without apology. During Henry’s reign, peasants were allowed to snare wild hares, but the noble deer was off limits to those of low parentage; the physician Andrew Boorde declared venison a “lord’s dish,” and observed that great men “do not set so much by the meate, as they do by the pastime of kyllyng it.” What defined a gentleman, in other words, was his pleasure in the fairly played hunt, not his vulgar appetite for the steak. In America’s colonial era, hunting remained a sport reserved for the elite. At Mount Vernon, George Washington indulged in the occasional mounted fox chase. “But elsewhere in the early United States,” the historian Philip Dray writes in “The Fair Chase,” “there was little recognition of sport hunting.” That would change, of course, and the evolution of a truly American style of hunting forms the subject of Dray’s enlightening and oddly bloodless new book. According to Dray, the critical turn from noble pleasure to blue-collar pastime came with the establishment of the myth of the frontier hunter. For that, America had Daniel Boone. Born on a Pennsylvania farm in 1734, Boone spent much of his early adulthood hunting and trapping beyond the western colonial border. A skilled woodsman, tough and common-born, Boone came to the world’s attention thanks to a land speculator named John Filson. Filson’s 1784 book, “The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke,” was really a long brochure, meant to inflate the value of the author’s real estate near present-day Lexington. For drama, Filson included in his encomium a chapter on Boone’s adventures in “the best tract of land in North America, and probably in the world.” “While Filson wanted Boone’s example to show that courage and hard work could conquer the frontier,” Dray writes, “neither author nor subject possibly could have dreamed the extent to which Boone would become a mythic figure, a representation of the young country’s hopes.” Like all colonials on the frontier, Boone stalked his game as a poacher. His favored “Kentucke” ground belonged to members of the Shawnee tribe, who seized his furs and guns when they caught him trespassing. Frontiersmen who hunted on Native American ground often acted as an advance guard for settlers who would later steal the land outright. Hunting became a seemingly democratic sport open to all classes of white folk largely because there was no sheriff to arrest them for bagging the king’s deer. Not to say it wasn’t risky. Two of Boone’s sons were killed by Indians, and Boone himself lived to tell the tale only because of his uncommon ability to talk his way out of trouble with the tribes. America’s first sports periodical, American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine, appeared in the late 1820s, not long after Boone’s death. At the time, “sport” connoted a kind of “Guys and Dolls” lifestyle: hard-drinking bachelors laying action on horses, dice and fighting cocks. When one sporting publisher realized that “hunting stories — hunters pitted against elusive, dangerous animals in forbidding terrain — possessed unique narrative power,” as Dray writes, the hook-and-bullet genre was born. From the 1830s until the eve of the Civil War, men like Henry William Herbert made a living selling adventure tales larded with wily bucks and ferocious bears. Under the pen name Frank Forester, Herbert instructed his readers in the ways of rod and gun and, as a eulogist later wrote, “infected his readers with the same love of the chase he felt himself.” In the United States, sport hunting is no longer merely a pastime. It’s often prescribed as an antidote to a recurring fear: the softening of the American man. Today’s alt-right blather about “snowflakes” and male feminization is nothing new. Washington Irving thought manly self-reliance ought to be instilled in America’s youth by sending them hunting on the Great Plains, rather than touring in Europe where they “grow luxurious and effeminate.” Outdoorsmen were vigorous, muscular Christians — nothing like those studious urban types, as Ralph Waldo Emerson noted, “with their pale, sickly etiolated indoor thoughts!” Emerson’s fellow Transcendentalist, Henry David Thoreau, prefigured today’s hiker-hunter cultural split. In “Walden” Thoreau considered hunting a necessary but distasteful stage in a man’s development: “No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which holds its life by the same tenure that he does.” The same schism played out a half-century later when the naturalist John Muir shared a camp at Yosemite with President Theodore Roosevelt. “When are you going to get beyond the boyishness of killing things?” Muir demanded of the famously avid hunter. Any human who enjoys a Whopper with cheese kills things too, of course. He just does it indirectly. And therein lies one of the hunter’s greatest lines of defense. Dray, with typical evenhandedness, acknowledges as much. “Most of us reside somewhere along a very broad spectrum of hypocrisy regarding animal lives,” he writes. It’s a private and sometimes quirky thing, this ethical line each of us draws when it comes to hunting. I’ve hunted deer but could not justify going after elk. (I felt I hadn’t earned the right.) My dad hunted ducks with his father long ago but stopped because, he once told me, “I couldn’t see the sense in killing something that was so beautiful.” We both still love aquatic hunting — the pastime also known as sport fishing. What is O.K. to hunt, when and why? “The Fair Chase” isn’t a book about ethics and philosophy, but Dray does a fine job introducing his readers to the issues in play. “Recreation,” he observes, “appears to be the offensive aspect” for a lot of hunting opponents. In a 2013 survey, 79 percent of Americans said they approve of hunting. Two years later, a separate poll found that 59 percent of adults “think hunting animals for sport” is unacceptable. The difference seemed to be the word “sport.” Say “hunting” and many people think of grandpa stalking deer in October. “Sport hunting” conjures up images of rich white guys getting their jollies killing lions and giraffes. What emerges is a vague yearning for the culturally appropriate. It might be justifiable for members of the Makah tribe to hunt a gray whale, but it’s not O.K. for your white deer-hunter grandpa to shoot a beluga. “The Fair Chase” can be frustrating at times. Dray’s historical method involves a bit of overlapping and backtracking, and he sometimes seems more interested in the literary description and public presentation of hunting rather than the act itself. Hunting is an emotional, blood-racing activity, and Dray seems happy to leave the intense feelings it provokes to in-the-field writers like Ted Kerasote, Pam Houston, David Petersen and Aldo Leopold. Still, he isn’t afraid to lay out hard truths, including the ways in which the National Rifle Association, once a hunting group, has hijacked an important and honorable pastime for gun-selling ends. The history of American hunting is a decidedly mixed bag. “America’s love affair with sport hunting,” Dray writes, “led to enhanced appreciation of the great outdoors, and to public acceptance of the need for management of wildlife populations and wilderness; but it also contributed to the wholesale slaughter of birds and animal species,” and fed the myth of the American as heroic conqueror. As Thoreau wrote, hunting may represent an early stage in human development. But it’s not one we’re likely to outgrow anytime soon.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How I Accidentally Made My Mom a Bollywood Star,"Mr. Rizwan is a comedian and actor. LONDON — When I was 16, I started filming silly videos at home on my camcorder and uploading them to YouTube. Like any millennial, I was in search of some juicy online validation. I showed the videos to my mom and told her that people do this for a living. She laughed and told me to get a real job. To get her on board with my career plans, I started putting her in my sketches. We did rap battles. We dressed up as Goths. We even re-enacted my birth. Sadly, she drew the line at twerking. I succeeded in getting her on my side — and we got almost eight million views that first year. In 2013, I got a call from a producer in India saying that she was casting a lead role in a prime-time TV series. “Here we go,” I thought. “Finally, Bollywood’s calling.” The producer clarified. “No, we don’t want you,” she said. “We want your mother.” I told my mom, assuming she would never consider such a thing. “I’ll give it a go,” she said. I was shocked. The woman who just months before had been giving me a hard time about my videos was willing to put herself on tape for an audition. I helped her film it and we sent it off. A few months later, the producer offered her the role. She quit her job as an English teacher in the suburbs of London, flew to Mumbai and started working as a Bollywood actress. She has been there for five years and is best known for playing Mrs. Bhalla on a show called “Yeh Hai Mohabbatein,” or “This is Love.” According to a group that tracks television ratings in India, it’s one of the country’s top five shows, with millions of viewers each week. It’s a golden-ticket story — the kind of showbiz tale people marvel at — but it actually feels as if my mother’s life has come full circle. My mother, Shahnaz Rizwan, was born in the 1950s in tumultuous post-partition Pakistan. She was one of nine siblings and her family had very little money. Her dad sold film reels to studios, and one day when a child actor dropped out of a movie, he suggested my mom as a replacement. At age 3 she made her film debut. Over the next decade, she told me, she went on to star in more than 30 black-and-white Pakistani films. By 12, she was supporting her family with her earnings. She was basically the Macaulay Culkin of Karachi. But when she was a teenager, she had to stop acting. People told her it was no profession for a young woman and that only prostitutes worked as actresses. She gave up the movies and quickly transitioned from stardom to normal life. As a young adult, she was the first woman in her neighborhood to ride a bicycle. Today, you’d be praised for choosing such an eco-friendly mode of transport, but back then it was scandalous for a woman to travel by bike without a male escort. Many people scolded her for it, calling her a prostitute (this seemed to be a theme in her early years). She wanted a life beyond the limitations she felt in Pakistan, so she came to Britain in the 1990s with my sister and me tucked under her arms — and no money, no husband, no connections. It was four years before my dad could follow. In the meantime, my mom did every “real job” possible, from cleaning to sewing in a factory. She got an English degree and eventually found a job teaching English to other immigrants. But she was always a performer. When I was a kid, she would organize plays at our town hall — she rented it by the hour to write, direct and produce the shows. The cast consisted of her children and the Lithuanian students she roped into learning lines as part of their English lessons. The plot of her first play, “Husband for Sale,” was about a business-minded wife (played by her) who tries to sell off her husband (played by my dad) to a rich elderly lady. I’m sure it was more therapeutic for her than anything. When I was 8 years old, my mom received a letter of deportation, informing her that we’d have to leave the country. She had one main focus — to get her children educated before we had to go. I studied around the clock, signing up for every scholarship exam possible. While I was doing that, my mom was engaged in a year of protests and legal battles. Every weekend I had to help her distribute fliers door-to-door, to gather petition signatures in support of immigrants’ rights. She managed to build a support network not only for herself but also for other immigrants and began to organize weekly meetings in the basement of a South Asian supermarket. She gave a speech at a conference and caught the attention of a lawyer who offered to represent her at no cost. After all her community work and court proceedings, we gained “indefinite leave to remain.” By the time the Spice Girls released their third album, we were bona fide citizens of Britain. A few years later, I stumbled across YouTube and spent all my spare time learning how to use a secondhand camcorder. Life suddenly became a lot more exciting when I could make a video of me titled “Twerking in Public” and share it with the world. Today, my mother has decided to step away from her TV role. She wants to spend more time back in Britain with her family. But her fame is interfering a bit with my own ambitions. If you type my name into Google — not that I would know ! — it auto-suggests “Mawaan Rizwan mum.” When I visited her in India a couple of years ago, I asked her whether she was feeling overwhelmed by her newfound fame. She said, “I’m not famous, Mawaan, I just have lots of friends now.” So I think she’s coping just fine. In fact, she’s using her fame to her advantage. When I was at the Mumbai airport with her, our bags were over the weight limit. My mom gave a knowing smile to the woman working at the airline counter. The woman realized who she was and freaked out. Eventually the entire check-in staff started screaming. Workers and passengers lined up for autographs. My mom posed for selfies; no one complained about the bags. When I was a boy, I witnessed my mother make the impossible possible in our lives. Then, with a few silly videos, we did the same for her on a bigger scale than either of us imagined. The only problem now is my dad. Recently, he sat me down so that we could talk. “You made your mum famous,” he said. “What about me?”",The New York Times
2018,How I Answer Readers’ Peskiest Apartment Questions,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. What do you do when a neighbor’s snores keep you up at night? A Times reader tormented by sleepless nights posed this question to me this year. I have been answering queries like this one from readers about their neighbors, landlords, roommates and co-op boards every week for five years for the Ask Real Estate column. The letters arrive in my inbox, and occasionally by mail, from New Yorkers searching for solutions to vexing problems. Of the dozens I receive, I select one each week that is not answerable with a cursory Google search, yet universal enough that others may have grappled with a similar conundrum. Even if you’ve never heard a neighbor snore (and I hope you haven’t), odds are the quiet sanctuary of your apartment has been disrupted at some point by a crying baby, a rowdy party or maybe even an enthusiastic whistler. Like many New Yorkers, I occupy a small space — in 400 words, I offer guidance. I had been writing for the section for about three years when the column needed a new writer. I jumped at the opportunity to reshape it into something akin to a conversation with a trusted friend — or, as my editor, Vivian S. Toy, puts it, a tough older sister. I’ll set you straight when you’re unreasonable, and come to your defense when you’re mistreated. As a reporter, I offer advice after researching city code, housing law and human psychology. Can you get in trouble if someone spots you naked through your kitchen window and complains? For that one, I turned to state decency laws and a lawyer who represents residents of co-ops and condos. (The answer: You’re fine so long as you’re not behaving in a lewd manner.) I talk to noise consultants, exterminators, plumbers, pulmonologists, property managers and mediators. Lawyers often help me navigate legal options available to renters and owners. Mostly, they advise people to stay out of court. They tend to be fans of the stern letter. One letter from a reader who was dismayed to find a sapling planted outside her Brooklyn home led me to the Department of Parks and Recreation, where I learned how the city selects tree planting sites — and how to get your block added to the list. The homeowner would have to live with the sapling since it was planted on the sidewalk, which belongs to the city. Which agency controls the sidewalk, anyway? The quest for that detail often sends me bouncing from one city agency to another. If you’re annoyed because your neighbor won’t shovel the snow, welcome to the Department of Sanitation. If someone paints the curb yellow to keep others from parking there (clever, but illegal), the Department of Transportation is your agency. When my reporting reveals an elusive answer, one where the letter writer has a long slog ahead, I often feel protective of the person seeking advice, the one worried about mold blooming in her walls or the threat of eviction. This is where the big-sister role kicks in. How can I use this corner of The Times to offer guidance? I do read every question that comes through the inbox, although I can’t respond to all of them. Some letter writers follow up after they get a response, relieved to hear that their concerns were valid and that a solution is possible. I often wonder if the advice helped in the long run. Did the super switch cleaning products? Did the roommate move out? Advice must be practical and feasible to actually be useful. Sure, I could tell a reader to sue the landlord in small claims court because that hefty amenities fee didn’t include all it promised. But what happens when the lease expires and the landlord refuses to renew it? Instead, I try to remind readers of the leverage they do have, and offer ways to harness it. If a landlord is behaving badly, find other neighbors in the same situation and organize. That stern letter is stronger with a dozen signatures at the bottom. Pause before you take anyone to court, as lawsuits are long and outcomes uncertain. I’ve come to believe that many problems, particularly with those who live on the other side of a wall, can be solved with a bottle of wine or a batch of cookies, or both. Others, however, require a kind of fortitude New Yorkers know all too well.",The New York Times
2018,How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love the Cruise Collections,"Or whatever you want to call them. Resort? Pre-spring? What about just “good clothes”? Confessions of a fashion critic. For years, I have been a whiner. Come May (or April, even), when the emails about cruise — or resort or holiday or spring or pre-spring or whatever you want to call the collections that enter stores in November and stay until March — begin to arrive, I have an almost Pavlovian reaction: See email, start kvetching. This season drives me batty. It’s very important. The clothes stay on store shelves at full price longer than any other collection, and, for many people, make up more of the wardrobe than the runway lines. Resort collections are huge (at Carolina Herrera, Wes Gordon made 14 different white cotton shirts and shirtdresses alone) and are responsible for more of a brand’s annual revenues than pretty much any other season. But this season is also totally disorganized, lasts at least two months, overlaps with men’s wear and couture, and doesn’t even have a name designers can agree on, for goodness sake. I mean: On the one hand there are Gucci, Chanel, Dior and Vuitton, holding the equivalent of destination weddings in far-flung locales with all sort of bells and whistles. Clients and press flown in specially for the occasion, mega runway experiences, glamorous dinners. And then there is Michael Kors. When I arrived in the cavernous downtown Manhattan warehouse where he was holding his presentation earlier this month, I found an empty bench with a row of seats and the designer bouncing on his toes. “Am I really early?” I asked in confusion. “No, it’s just you and Matthew!” Mr. Kors chortled happily. And then my colleague Matthew Schneier and I sat there in the echoing expanse as Mr. Kors plopped himself on the bench next to us and assorted models came out in 39 looks from the collection, including a very cool painterly T-shirt and trousers/stripes-and-sprouts combo, and some “Casino Royale” brocades paired with python and crystal-studded platform Birkenstocks. Mr. Kors riffed. It was like micro-dosing a fashion show. “It’s not a twin set — it’s a tri-set!” Mr. Kors said about a matching floral minidress, jacket and boots. Of a gold lamé tiered frock, he said, “It’s the Jitney dress gone glamorous.” I have always struggled to fit all this into a logical pattern, because I felt it was my job as a responsible fashion adult to (1) act as a filter between the brands and you; and (2) act as a truth teller for the industry, letting it know when what it is doing makes pretty much no sense to its customers. And if I couldn’t parse the cruise collections into some sort of structure, what did that mean for everyone else? 8 Photos View Slide Show › It seemed to me the answer was chaos. But I have come to realize that it is also a surprising amount of good clothes. And that those two things may not be unrelated. Precisely because there simply isn’t the same formal structure or corporate imperative that has turned the regular show system into a high-pressure money and Instagram machine, designers are more relaxed about the whole thing. They play a little. They try stuff out and shrug off the statement. Sometimes it works really well. Sometimes … whoops! That’s O.K. Blink and you can miss it. “There’s less anxiety,” Mr. Gordon said as he talked me around his Carolina Herrera collection, which was his first as sole designer of the label. (Mrs. Herrera became global ambassador last February.) When I was there, so was Bergdorf Goodman, placing its order, so I got to spy on its rail. In case you were wondering: lots of tequila sunrise ball gowns and summer frocks, some with little wooden animals instead of bugle beads. “I can risk a little bad taste every once in a while,” Mr. Gordon said, showing off a rainbow-striped mink cape with a matching rainbow-striped chiffon evening look, reminiscent of the cape Lena Waithe wore to the Met Gala (and not in bad taste). “Chic doesn’t have to mean uptight. These are happy clothes.” He looked chuffed amid the toucan tones. Narciso Rodriguez said much the same after his mini-show (two rows of benches on either side of a narrow room in his office building) of sleek tops, trousers and skirts razor tailored into asymmetry. “I’m relaxing into things I’ve done in the past, but making them better and more relevant,” he said as the models milled about like greyhound puppies with nowhere particular to go. You can’t really grumble about that. Nor about hanging out with Diane von Furstenberg as she lounges on a velvet pouf and pushes back her cloud of hair and talks about how you can roll a dragonfly print stretch net dress up and “stick it in your handbag — crunch! Like that.” And then raises an eyebrow at her creative director, Nathan Jenden, because in his enthusiasm to rush off and find a jade green fox fur jacket (“very old YSL”) he dropped a chunky knit on the ground. “I think you should pick that up, Nathan,” Ms. von Furstenberg said. There’s a kind of insouciance to the season that is catching. It’s hard to keep being hung up on irrationality when everyone else seems to be having fun. Especially because even in the random spattering of collections I have seen so far, there were lots of very good clothes. At Valentino, for example, where Pierpaolo Piccioli seems to be getting better every season, and this time around went in two different directions, dipping into 1970s typeface for mini Macs and scarf dresses, and then switching it up for haute bohemia, with elaborately embroidered garden frocks. Or Oscar de la Renta, where my favorite style among Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim’s pastel jerseys and billowing parachute silks was a long lace shirt with train atop a pair of slim black cigarette pants — though Meghan Markle’s favorite was, apparently, a Wedgwood print wrap dress, which she wore recently to the wedding of Prince Harry’s cousin Celia McCorquodale. Or Altuzarra, where Joseph Altuzarra segued from big picnic checks to Amalfi Coast landscapes (which he drew himself — he showed me the sample sketch) to Roman urns and dip-dyed florals, all with a hint that everything was about to come undone, the lace and silk and knit beginning to peel away. Or Coach 1941, where Stuart Vevers traded a yacht for a trip to the Viper Room, complete with patchwork velvets, upholstery fabric anoraks and an entirely decadent pale pink double-face zip-up hoodie that would make any distinction between office attire and athleisure entirely moot. There was some talk, back a few months ago, about Alexander Wang trying to team up with the Council of Fashion Designers of America and organize an actual “pre-collection week” (he has decided the pre-collections will be his main show), but it didn’t happen, for whatever reason. Here’s hoping it doesn’t. Because what I learned when I finally stopped complaining about the cruise is this: We don’t need another formal fashion week that demands the industry travel around the world, view every show through an iPhone and take a break from reality until the season is over (the much-hyped and now shrinking men’s weeks in London and New York testify to that). What we already have is enough. We need more opportunities to hang out and gab with designers to find out what’s in their heads. We need more well-designed garments that, in their confidence, make different kinds of women feel secure and well appointed for whatever their place is in the world. If those garments are all over the place, well, so are we. It’s not so strange after all, love. An earlier version of this article misidentified the event where Lena Waithe wore a rainbow cape. It was the Met Gala, not the Oscars.",The New York Times
2018,How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters,"The Shift SANTA MONICA, Calif. — I wanted to hate the scooters. I really did. Before going to the Los Angeles region last week for work, I had heard about the area’s invasion by dockless, rent-by-the-minute electric scooters. I saw their sudden arrival described as a plague of two-wheeled terrors that had crowded sidewalks and endangered pedestrians, and I knew that some cities had issued cease-and-desist orders and passed emergency ordinances to get them off the streets. I also knew that Los Angeles’s leading e-scooter company, Bird — which reportedly just raised $150 million at a valuation north of $1 billion — was run by Travis VanderZanden, a former executive of Uber and Lyft. His new venture seemed to be an unholy mix of the former’s lawless arrogance and the latter’s saccharine branding. (A group of people riding Bird scooters is called a “flock,” Mr. VanderZanden has insisted.) Tech hubris on wheels — what’s not to loathe? But I wanted to experience the scooter craze for myself. So for a week, I used shared e-scooters as my primary mode of transportation. I rode them to meetings, ran errands across town and went for long joy rides on the Venice Beach boardwalk. In all, I took more than a dozen scooter rides, from just a few blocks to several miles. And here’s my verdict: E-scooters might look and feel kind of dorky, but they aren’t an urban menace or a harbinger of the apocalypse. In fact — sigh — they’re pretty great. My journey to e-scooter acceptance began when I saw an empty scooter outside my hotel. I downloaded the Bird app, entered my driver’s license and credit card information, agreed to some basic terms (no riding on sidewalks, no riding two to a scooter, no speeding downhill) and scanned a code on the scooter’s handlebar. The scooter beeped, telling me that it was unlocked, and I was off. Battery-powered scooters have been available for years, but only recently have they been outfitted with GPS trackers and wireless connectivity and arranged into on-demand fleets. These scooters are limited to 15 miles per hour, but that is still zippy enough to put a satisfying whoosh in your hair. And when you’re done riding, just park it anywhere, choose “end ride” on your app, take a photo to help the next rider find it and walk away. Rides are cheap (Bird charges $1 plus 15 cents per minute), and an abundant supply of scooters in Santa Monica meant that I was never more than a block or two from one. The rise of shared e-scooters is just one of several recent tech-powered experiments in urban mobility. Dockless bike-sharing programs, which have been popular in China for years, are starting to take off in America. The programs added 44,000 bikes in the United States during the last half of 2017, according to a report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Other wheeled innovations — like electric unicycles and skateboards — are also making gains. Like the earliest ride-hailing providers, many e-scooter companies have taken a cavalier approach to growth, dumping thousands of vehicles on city streets with no permits and little advance notice. This tactic has not endeared them to cities. Bird paid $300,000 in fines and other fees to settle a legal dispute with Santa Monica after the city sued it for operating without a proper license last year. Denver recently ordered Bird and LimeBike, another e-scooter provider, to remove their scooters, and Nashville and other cities have begun seizing scooters from their streets. (Citizen-led protests are happening, too — in San Francisco, scooters have been vandalized and thrown in front of Google buses.) Emerging technology should always be scrutinized, especially when it could involve health risks and strain public infrastructure. And new forms of transportation have always been controversial. (In the 19th century, critics of bicycles labeled them tools of the devil.) But people should think twice before condemning e-scooters as an ill-conceived tech-world fantasy. Because if you can get over their dopey aesthetics and dubious corporate strategy, e-scooters actually solve some problems. They’re lightweight and emission-free. They don’t require bulky docks or parking lots, and they’re perfect for trips that are too long to walk but too short to justify driving or hailing a car. If they take off, they could alleviate congestion and become a low-cost way of getting around cities without robust public transportation systems. Opponents of e-scooters typically make three major claims. But as I learned during my experiment in California, none of those arguments hold up particularly well under scrutiny. Anti-scooter activists tend to paint scooter riders as kamikaze daredevils, slaloming through cars and pedestrians. I did see a few instances of dangerous behavior — couples riding two to a scooter, people riding one-handed while taking selfies and some running red lights. There is also the issue of helmets, which many states require but which, as far as I can tell, no scooter riders are wearing. There have been five traffic incidents involving Bird scooters in Santa Monica since November, and 424 citations of motorized scooter riders, according to a Santa Monica Police Department spokesman. Bird, which declined to provide information about accidents, offers helmets to active riders for a $1.99 shipping fee, and about 30,000 people have taken it up on the deal. (The deal is available only to riders who live in a current Bird market, which excludes out-of-town visitors like me.) There is no doubt that scooters could be safer if helmet laws were better enforced and basic safety training was provided before riding. But it’s probably not time to panic just yet. We don’t have enough data to know if scooters are more dangerous than bikes, motorcycles or other types of two-wheeled transit, and scooter safety will most likely improve as riders get more experience and drivers learn to share the road. In fact, the only scary scooter rides I had were the times that cars veered a little too close to the bike lane I was riding in. If cities want to encourage safe scooter riding — and they should, given the benefits they have for congestion and environmental health — they should create protected scooter lanes and encourage drivers to give them more room. This anti-scooter case was made most memorably by a columnist at The Los Angeles Times who complained that “these electric scooters are everywhere — roads, sidewalks, street corners, parking lots, boardwalks, apartment complex hallways — beeping while stationary and whirring when rolling, ridden mostly by stoic mannequins in flip-flops.” It’s true that scooters have gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous in a matter of weeks — one morning, I counted more than 100 within a few blocks of my hotel. But their visibility is a function of their novelty. We don’t view parked cars and bus stops as eyesores, even though they’re everywhere. This isn’t just about clutter — cities are worried that parked scooters will impede wheelchairs and block entrances. But there are easy solutions here. Just as we have parking meters for cars, cities could designate scooter parking areas on every block, and begin ticketing riders who leave their scooters in the middle of the sidewalk. Companies like Bird — which already pay armies of contract workers to recharge their scooters at night — could also give users small rewards for clearing badly placed scooters out of the way. Some people object to e-scooters on political and symbolic grounds, claiming that they represent everything that is wrong with the tech industry. Critics have taken aim at their perceived elitism (you need a smartphone and a credit card to use scooter-sharing apps) and the sudden, permissionless way they were rolled out in cities, which fit a pattern of bad behavior set by tech companies like Uber and Airbnb. It’s true that scooter companies have not exactly covered themselves in glory. They have invited a backlash by flooding the streets with scooters with no explanation and little or no contact with local officials. As these companies grow, they will need to prove that they can cooperate with regulators, rather than trying to circumvent them. But there’s nothing inherently elitist about e-scooters. (In fact, at between $2 and $5 for most rides, they’re price competitive with public transportation, and far cheaper than services like Uber and Lyft.) And while e-scooter companies have moved brazenly into new markets, they have also shown some willingness to compromise in cities like Austin, Tex., where local officials required that scooters carry licenses and proof of insurance. David Estrada, Bird’s chief legal officer, told me that the company had cooperated with officials in Miami and other cities to plan orderly rollouts. He said the company obeys local laws and doesn’t introduce scooters in cities, such as New York, that expressly prohibit them. But he said that cities tended to drag their feet on new transportation policy, and that seeking pre-emptive approval for e-scooters could take years. “We’d have happy cities, but we wouldn’t have a business and we wouldn’t be solving a problem,” Mr. Estrada said. It’s possible that the skeptics are right, and that electric scooters will end up like Segways — novelty gadgets for big-city tourists. It’s also possible that they’ll end up like Uber and Lyft — a multibillion-dollar industry that spends years battling local officials but ultimately changes urban transportation as we know it. The answer will most likely depend on the regulations that emerge, and whether scooter companies can operate profitably in cities that, unlike Santa Monica, don’t have flat terrain and year-round sunshine. Whatever happens, you can count me as a slightly embarrassed member of Team Scooter. If liking fun, inexpensive, short-distance transportation is wrong, I don’t want to be right.",The New York Times
2018,How I Used Art to Get Through Trauma,"My encounter with a gunman on my evening commute led to nightmares and depression. Art helped me recover from post-traumatic stress, and it might help you, too. I’m a writer, and I use words to tell stories. But after a tragic event in 1993, I felt as though words had lost their efficacy. Luckily, I was able to use other mediums, namely drawing and painting, to help me deal with what I witnessed. If you’ve experienced trauma, art — whether it’s drawing, painting or writing, can help you cope. Here’s how I learned. On Dec. 7, 1993, I traveled home on an evening train. At some point, I dozed off, but as the train approached one of the stations, a commotion startled me awake. When I looked over my shoulder from my aisle seat, I saw panicked passengers rushing toward me. I hadn’t realized it, but they were running from a commuter who was firing an automatic pistol at others in the rear of the train car. It’s odd, but when I recall memories of the next few minutes, they have the quality of a time-lapse video, where moments speed by quickly and feel slightly disconnected: I’m crouched below my seat. Then, I see a gunman fire at others. He glances at me, but moves on. Three commuters then tackle the gunman. Next, I see wounded people, and try to help, but become overwhelmed. I hear a woman screaming she’s been shot. I notice blood on the floor and see a body slumped over in a seat. Finally, I panic and run to the next car to exit the train. The shooting probably took less than five minutes, and I walked away physically unharmed. But on that December evening, six commuters died and 19 others were wounded. After the shooting, I had many heartfelt conversations with friends and family, yet I often felt unable to truly convey what I’d gone through. Seeing a therapist helped immensely, but I still struggled to articulate my feelings. I also had nightmares and was severely depressed. Since I’ve always loved fine art, I attempted to tell my story visually and began work on a painting called “Still Life on the Long Island Railroad.” It’s based on a Baroque still-life painting technique, in which the artist depicts a dinner table scene without guests. In such a painting, you might see plates with half-eaten food and overturned goblets, which is meant to give you the feeling the dinner guests either left in a hurry or were forcibly removed. In my still life, I transferred the setting to a L.I.R.R. train car, placing a half-eaten candy bar and coffee cup on floor of the train car. I spent many days painting it and completed it in November of 1994. Yet, today, the hodgepodge, fragmented painting looks confused and unsettled. I wondered. Could making such a jumbled painting have been helpful to me, at least psychologically? I posed this question to Dr. Robert Ursano, professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the Uniformed Services University and a founding director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress. He said, “We know recounting the story can be a valuable part of recovery. It allows us to put the parts and pieces into context, and also to develop meaning from the story. Those elements — the recalling and setting to rest, and putting it in a meaningful context — are part of the recovery process.” Often, people choose to write about trauma, since it’s “the most common form of expression,” Dr. Ursano said. But, drawing and painting are equally valid forms of expression also used by patients. What’s most important is that a patient is comfortable with the medium. In my still-life painting, perhaps I was using the canvas to visually piece together fragments of personal memories, emotions, and fears during this time. Yes, it’s a disjointed composition that still disturbs me today, but it may accurately reflect the feelings I had at the time. The still life wasn’t the only work I created. Between 1995 and 1998, I drew more than 150 small drawings, using my commute to sketch passengers, who slept, read or stared out windows. Dr. Ursano noted that this may have benefited me: “It puts you into a state of relaxation, which can be a safe space that’s known to you. You have a sense of control over that space.” It also helped me avoid obsessing over remembering the shooting, a common problem with patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. “In some ways,” says Dr. Ursano, “we look at post-traumatic stress as a forgetting disorder. It’s a problem in being able to forget … But forgetting is a very important process of our psychology. If we didn’t forget, our brains would become too full. So, it’s as important as the process of accumulating information. So, the ability to forget is a powerful part of our recovery, particularly from trauma.” Dr. Ursano said that art, in the form of drawing or in the form of words, can be a very important component of recovery from traumatic stress. In fact, Dr. Ursano said drawing is often used to treat children, since they often lack the vocabulary to express their emotions. For me, drawing allowed my mind to focus on two positive activities simultaneously: First, I was trying to capture the likeness of my fellow passengers in graphite or pen. Second, I focused on immersing myself in the act of drawing itself. Dr. Ursano said that patients have many options for dealing with trauma and PTSD. In my experience, I found the following tips helped me deal with my trauma: 1. Choose a mode of expression that’s comfortable: “Someone who is a dancer may need to dance about the trauma,” said Dr. Ursano. Once a patient finds the appropriate mode (words, drawing, painting or another medium), the patient can then find his or her voice. Doing so allows the patient “to speak to both the trauma and the hope. And that is what recovery is about,” he elaborated. 2. Seek a state of relaxation: What I hadn’t realized at the time was how the activity of drawing relaxed me. Dr. Ursano said the activity itself provided a sense of security. “One creates a space in which one can be and feel safe. Just to be able to find that safe space and remember that it exists. The process of creating that is, in itself, the process of creating hope.” 3. Don’t critique yourself, but add dates: Whatever mode you choose, be generous with yourself and avoid critiquing your work. If you’re drawing, don’t fret if you simply want to scribble. Give yourself space to work in a manner you might not normally work in, too. But put dates on the works, which can serve almost as a visual diary. 4. Be selective — don’t show everyone your work: Refrain from showing others your work, or show it only to a spouse or close friend, at least at first. “In psychotherapy,” Dr. Ursano said, “the response of the therapist will be to the benefit of the person or patient that is there.” But there’s no “rule” on how others will respond outside of therapy, where responses can be vastly different. “Some will run away,” Dr. Ursano explained. “Others will want to talk about it more than you want to. And some will appreciate the new meaning that it brings to their lives.” Dr. Ursano said patients who have lived through trauma have many options to help them heal: “We have wonderful treatments for post-traumatic stress these days that are highly effective, both psychotherapy and medication. Reaching for those resources is done usually through one’s primary-care physician.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Japan Might Lose Out in the Korea Talks,"Dr. Funabashi heads a think tank in Tokyo. TOKYO — Even if Tuesday’s meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, goes well, Japan stands to lose from it in some ways. Despite a last-ditch effort last week by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to play adviser to Mr. Trump before the talks, the American president still seems rather unconcerned by Japan’s long-term strategic interests — actually, its imperatives. As Mr. Abe put it last week, “first and foremost, we need to seek advancement for the abduction, nuclear and missile programs.” He meant that Japan’s priorities are to obtain the return of all Japanese citizens that North Korea abducted years ago, North Korea’s actual denuclearization and an end to its efforts to develop any missiles, and not just the kind that can reach the United States. Although the abductee issue is an emotional and sensitive matter in Japan, the government finds itself dependent on third parties to discuss it on its behalf, much like President Moon Jae-in of South Korea reportedly did with Mr. Kim in late April. On this question, and other major matters to do with North Korea, Japan has no choice for now but to try to influence negotiations from the sidelines, or else it risks being left behind altogether. In the event that Mr. Trump does take up the abduction issue with Mr. Kim for Japan, as he has pledged to do, the North Korean government probably would use the hostages as leverage and release them only for specific gains, as in 2002 when it allowed five Japanese captives to return home in exchange for the promise of economic assistance. Then there is denuclearization, which means different things to different parties. For Japan, the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program is essential, as James Mattis, the United States secretary of defense, has said. Verification, the most important prong of this approach, may also be the most difficult to satisfy: It would require North Korea to truthfully reveal the location of all its nuclear sites and fissile material — a very unlikely prospect. Mr. Kim should be expected to exploit any ambiguity in order to hedge or dither while trying to secure relief from international sanctions. He is playing a long game and has time on his side. Election cycles in the United States, South Korea and Japan are short, but Mr. Kim is unelected and is only in his 30s. Even if he vows to make what seem like significant commitments toward denuclearization, he will already have accomplished one of his main goals: Just by dint of these talks being held he will have succeeded in getting the United States to, in effect, treat North Korea as a de facto nuclear weapons state. Denuclearizing North Korea can only be a phased process, for technical reasons, and it could take up to 15 years according to the nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker. Mr. Kim might slow it down further by first proposing, as he has begun to do, a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War to replace the 1953 armistice currently in effect. This, however, would be a dirty peace, especially for Japan, which in the meantime would remain as exposed as ever to a North Korean attack. Japan will be all the more vulnerable if, as the government fears, the United States seeks to obtain North Korea’s agreement to freeze its intercontinental ballistic missiles program without obtaining guarantees that North Korea will also curtail its development of short- and mid-range missiles. Such an arrangement might protect the United States, but it would leave Japan (as well as South Korea) in the immediate danger zone, as well as open to nuclear coercion by North Korea. Of even greater concern for Japan (and, again, South Korea) is that the United States, as a concession to North Korea, might offer to revise some aspects of its alliance with South Korea. For example, it could scale back joint military exercises or agree to withdraw U.S. troops from the country. But either proposal, even kept vague, would undercut America’s longstanding commitment to the security of South Korea, with far-reaching implications for Japan. Any such curtailment would draw Japan deeper still into North Korea’s threat zone, while also undermining the credibility of the protection it is supposed to derive from America’s nuclear umbrella and generally weakening its alliance with the United States. That, in turn, would give Japan reason to expand its missile-defense system and, perhaps, its strike capabilities against North Korea — and maybe even a reason to hold public discussions about what has long been a taboo here: obtaining nuclear weapons of its own. In this respect, progress toward denuclearizing North Korea could backfire. Another major security consideration for Japan is China and its efforts to dominate the region. China’s strategy is to slow down North Korea’s denuclearization, weaken the United States’s alliance with South Korea, marginalize Japan and frustrate cooperation among the United States, South Korea and Japan — all goals that would actually be advanced if Mr. Trump takes an ambiguous stance on denuclearization. Mr. Abe has welcomed the talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim as a chance to make progress on the issues that matter to Japan. But he now keenly realizes that his efforts at golf diplomacy — nearly 30 telephone calls and official meetings with Mr. Trump, including two at Mar-a-Lago — could not convince the American president that alliances are not transactional but based on trust. Mr. Trump has displayed too little consideration for Japan’s interests, especially given the importance of this relationship. As a result, Japan is both dangerously exposed to the threat posed by North Korea and largely disenfranchised in the current negotiations, and it could suffer even from progress made in the talks.",The New York Times
2018,How Kate Spade’s Vision for Simple Bags Became a $2.4 Billion Brand,"Kate Spade was a fashion dynamo who turned a cheerful vision of affordable luxury into a leading American brand, but relinquished control before it became a commercial juggernaut. Initially known for simple handbags in punchy colors, the Kate Spade New York label grew into a sprawling lifestyle brand that includes furniture, baby gifts, and sneakers. Ms. Spade walked away from her company more than a decade ago and was nurturing a new label before her death on Tuesday in an apparent suicide. January 1993 Not long after quitting her job as an editor at Mademoiselle magazine, Ms. Spade began her company with the help of Andy Spade, whom she later married. Mr. Spade, who met his future wife at Arizona State University, put $35,000 from his retirement savings into the fledgling business. The couple introduced an initial lineup of six purses, including one later sewed using burlap fabric sourced from a potato bag maker. In 1996, the Spades opened a store in SoHo, and by 1998, the company was generating $28 million a year in revenue. February 1999 The Spades sold 56 percent of the company to Neiman Marcus, the high-end department store, for nearly $34 million. The label spent the next few years expanding into other retail categories by entering licensing partnerships with Lenox’s home goods, selling luxury diaper bags and strollers, dressing flight attendants and immortalizing its preppy Upper East Side aesthetic in $70 coffee table books. The company also faced criticism that the factory workers making its handbags were being grossly underpaid, and responded by saying that it could not control its contractors’ labor practices. October 2006 Neiman Marcus, which was taken over by two private equity firms the year before, bought out the remainder of the Kate Spade brand. Neiman then promptly sold the full Kate Spade package for $124 million to Liz Claiborne, a clothier that had already acquired Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand Jeans. In 2007, the Spades left the brand, which by then was generating more than $80 million a year in revenue. January 2014 Liz Claiborne, which sold much of its portfolio and changed its name in 2012 to Fifth & Pacific, rebranded itself as Kate Spade & Co. The company, long a target of counterfeiters, also developed a strong presence at outlet malls and department store discount shelves, raising concerns among analysts that it was devaluing its reputation. May 2017 Coach, which has since become a holding company called Tapestry, agreed to buy Kate Spade & Co. for $2.4 billion. By this time, Kate Spade offshoots like Kate Spade Saturday and Jack Spade had been shut down. A year earlier, in 2016, the Spades and two partners quietly started a new company, Frances Valentine, selling handbags, footwear and accessories online and through retailers like Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom.",The New York Times
2018,How Latino Voting Power Will Count in the California Primary,"Update: Read our analysis of the primary night in California, and about races from New Jersey to Montana. For more, sign up for our California Today newsletter. LOS ANGELES — For more than three decades, political pundits have referred to Latino voters as a “sleeping giant,” to describe a demographic reality that has yet to translate to clear political force. With each presidential election, much is written about how important Latino votes could be in securing the White House. In California, Latinos make up nearly 40 percent of the overall population, already outnumbering non-Hispanic whites. Even if their political clout isn’t yet fully realized, Latinos’ political engagement in California is impressive, especially when compared with states like Arizona and Texas. There are all-Latino City Councils, Latinos leading the State Legislature and Latinos running the largest cities in California. Has the giant already woken? Latinos make up 34 percent of the state’s adult population, but they account for just 18 percent of likely voters, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Although Latinos live all over the state, Latino voters are disproportionately concentrated in urban areas. More than any other issue, a 1994 ballot initiative called Proposition 187 is credited with turning a generation of Latinos into reliable Democrats. Republicans led by Pete Wilson, who was governor at the time, backed the ballot initiative, which sought to deny public services to undocumented immigrants. The measure passed and Mr. Wilson was re-elected, but the victory was only a short-term one, with lasting partisan consequences: Among Latinos who have registered to vote in the last year, just 3 percent registered as Republicans, according to Fernando Guerra, a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, many analysts predicted a “Trump effect” — expecting that Latinos would turn out at a significantly higher rate because of the candidate’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. But there was little sign of significant change at the polls. According to the Census bureau, voter turnout among California Latinos in 2016 hovered around 33 percent, an uptick from 2014 but no more than in past presidential election years. The turnout rate for the 2014 midterms was about 25 percent for Latinos, compared with 37 percent for the state overall and 47 percent for non-Hispanic whites. “In general, they haven’t turned out to vote more than anyone else, they have actually done less,” said Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California, who has written about Latinos and politics for decades. “Turnout has underperformed nationally, with few exceptions.” Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday. • What is a jungle primary and how does it work? •The two leading Democratic candidates must contend with Jerry Brown’s long shadow • Republicans are struggling to field candidates on the ballot in November. • Meanwhile, Democrats, too, are wary of a possible disaster. • Everything you need to know about the top races in the state. Several former Republican strongholds with growing Latino populations, like Orange County, chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, but that swing could also be attributed to wealthy white voters casting ballots against Mr. Trump. And some political scientists fault California candidates and their campaigns for not doing enough to reach out to Latino voters. “The metaphor, sort of a sleeping giant, suggests that they are apathetic and unengaged and are asleep,” Francisco Pedraza, a professor at University of California, Riverside, said of Latino voters. “The key difference is that in districts where they have yet to turn blue, you look at campaign spending and there’s not a lot of it. We’re leaving votes on the table if we’re not investing in those areas.” On a recent afternoon in downtown Fullerton, one of the largest cities in the 39th Congressional District, few people even seemed to know there was a primary election coming up, though campaign signs lined the main street. “Nobody has called me, knocked on my door, asked me for my vote,” said Carlos Rivera, a 32-year-old data analyst who lives in Fullerton. “I vote when there’s something I care about. I’m not sure whether that’s true this time.” Latinos have faced voter intimidation in the state for generations. In the Central Valley, for example, farm owners would threaten to fire workers if their names showed up on voter rolls, according to Matt Barreto, who runs Latino Decisions, a polling firm. Latinos have also won court battles over the ways local voting districts have been drawn to dilute their voting power. There are undoubtedly other factors as well. For example, across ethnic lines, people with college degrees are more likely to vote, and Latinos lag behind non-Hispanic whites in higher education. They also have disproportionately higher rates of poverty, which is associated with decreased voting. If Latinos are the primary key to turning California blue, as many people in the state say, it’s fair to argue that they can sway any election when the candidates are closer than 10 percentage points apart in the polls. A clear example is the area now covered by the 36th Congressional District, where Raul Ruiz won in 2012 in large part by focusing on the growing Latino population in the district, which includes part of Palm Springs and other large swaths of the Coachella Valley. Before his victory, the area had not been represented by a Democrat since the 1980s. Change came even more quickly in Orange County, when Loretta Sanchez defeated a longtime Republican congressman, Bob Dornan, in 1996 in a district that is now seen as solidly Democratic. But that trend has yet to take hold in the wealthiest parts of Orange County or in the reliably conservative Central Valley. Democrats and Republicans have a mixed record of focusing on Latino voter turnout. Mr. Barreto said there has been a general reluctance to spend money for Spanish-language campaign advertising, which often boosts Latino turnout. But he said there were “very early signs” that those attitudes were changing, and that Democratic groups in particular were willing to invest money in getting Latinos to the polls for the midterms. It depends on how many show up to vote. Antonio Villaraigosa once personified Latino political power — he was the first Latino elected mayor of Los Angeles in modern history. But his campaign for governor has struggled. He is counting on a large turnout among Latino voters to lift him to the No. 2 spot in the primary, and thus onto the November ballot. But some polls show him getting the nod from fewer than 25 percent of likely Latino voters. While Latinos are generally expected not to turn out as heavily as non-Hispanic whites do, exit polls for state elections in New Jersey and Virginia last year showed that Latino turnout was up modestly compared with past midterm elections. “If Latinos were turning out en masse for him, he wouldn’t be in the singles,” Mr. Suro said of Mr. Villaraigosa’s poll standing in the crowded primary field. “This is the first credible Latino running for governor in forever. You’d think, if there’s a groundswell of Latinos going and saying ‘here’s our chance,’ you’d see it in the numbers by now.” Marisol Fuentes, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother, said she was not drawn to candidates merely by a shared ethnicity. Rather, she said she was confident that she would vote for the “most liberal” candidates she could find. “We have a president attacking everything I stand for, and a congressman who lets him get away with it,” she added. “I will tell anyone who listens that we have to get people in office who will fight for rights for everyone.” In the congressional races, Latinos make up roughly one-quarter of registered voters in the race to succeed Ed Royce to represent eastern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County. They also account for roughly 25 percent of voters in the battle to unseat Steve Knight, a Republican who represents the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. And they are a significant chunk of voters in districts in the Central Valley and San Diego where Republicans are facing tough re-election bids. If Latinos prove to be a force that pushes Democrats over the top, nobody in California is likely to argue about their power sleeping. An earlier version of this story misidentified Fullerton as one of the largest cities in California’s 48th Congressional District. It is in the 39th Congressional District.",The New York Times
2018,"How Long Can We Live? The Limit Hasn’t Been Reached, Study Finds","The mortality rate flattens among the oldest of the old, a study of elderly Italians concludes, suggesting that the oldest humans have not yet reached the limits of life span. Since 1900, average life expectancy around the globe has more than doubled, thanks to better public health, sanitation and food supplies. But a new study of long-lived Italians indicates that we have yet to reach the upper bound of human longevity. “If there’s a fixed biological limit, we are not close to it,” said Elisabetta Barbi, a demographer at the University of Rome. Dr. Barbi and her colleagues published their research Thursday in the journal Science. The current record for the longest human life span was set 21 years ago, when Jeanne Calment, a Frenchwoman, died at the age of 122. No one has grown older since — as far as scientists know. In 2016, a team of scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx made the bold claim that Ms. Calment was even more of an outlier than she seemed. They argued that humans have reached a fixed life span limit, which they estimated to be about 115 years. A number of critics lambasted that research. “The data set was very poor, and the statistics were profoundly flawed,” said Siegfried Hekimi, a biologist at McGill University. Anyone who studies the limits of longevity faces two major statistical challenges. There aren’t very many people who live to advanced ages, and people that old often lose track of how long they’ve actually lived. “At these ages, the problem is to make sure the age is real,” said Dr. Barbi. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Dr. Barbi and her colleagues combed through Italy’s records to find every citizen who had reached the age of 105 between 2009 and 2015. To validate their ages, the researchers tracked down their birth certificates. The team ended up with a database of 3,836 elderly Italians. The researchers tracked down death certificates for those who died in the study period and determined the rate at which various age groups were dying. It’s long been known that the death rate starts out somewhat high in infancy and falls during the early years of life. It climbs again among people in their thirties, finally skyrocketing among those in their seventies and eighties. If the death rate kept exponentially climbing in extreme old age, then human life span really would have the sort of limit proposed by the Einstein team in 2016. But that’s not what Dr. Barbi and her colleagues found. Among extremely old Italians, they discovered, the death rate stops rising — the curve abruptly flattens into a plateau. The researchers also found that people who were born in later years have a slightly lower mortality rate when they reach 105. “The plateau is sinking over time,” said Kenneth W. Wachter, a demographer at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored the new study. “Improvements in mortality extend even to these extreme ages.” “We’re not approaching any maximum life span for humans yet,” he added. Brandon Milholland, a co-author of the study finding a limit to human life span, questioned the new paper. The research, he noted, was limited to just seven years in one country. “You’re reducing yourself to a narrow slice of humanity,” he said. Dr. Milholland also took issue with how the team analyzed their data. They only examined two possibilities: that the death rate continued its exponential climb, or that it turned into a flat plateau. The truth might be somewhere in between, he said: “It seems rather far-fetched that after increasing exponentially, the chance of dying should suddenly stop in its tracks.” Dr. Hekimi, on the other hand, praised the study for the quality of its data and called its conclusions, “very interesting and surprising.” The new research doesn’t explain why death rates flatten out in the oldest of the old. One possibility is that some people have genes that make them more frail than others. Frail people die off sooner than more resilient ones, leaving behind a pool of tough seniors. But Dr. Hekimi speculated that there might be other factors at play. Throughout our lives, our cells become damaged. We only manage to partially repair them, and over time our bodies grow weak. It’s possible that at the cellular level, very old people simply live at a slower rate. As a result, they accumulate less damage in their cells, which their bodies can repair. “This is a reasonable theory for which there is no proof,” Dr. Hekimi said. “But we can find out if there is.” A flat death rate doesn’t mean that centenarians have found a fountain of youth. From one year to the next, the new study suggests, they still have a much higher chance of dying than someone in her nineties. Exactly how long centenarians live may simply be a roll of the dice each year. But even if this turns out to be the case, Jeanne Calment’s age won’t be easily matched, said Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for aging at Newcastle University, who was not involved in the new study. “The higher the ceiling gets set as records are successively broken, the harder it gets to break it,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,How Luchino Visconti Made History Sing,"Critic’s Notebook Among the Italian filmmakers who achieved international prominence in the decades after World War II, Luchino Visconti possessed perhaps the sharpest historical insight and the keenest literary appetite. The 14 features he directed between 1942 and his death, in 1976, included adaptations of books by Dostoyevsky, Camus and Mann, a biopic about King Ludwig II of Bavaria and several forays into the political upheavals of mid-19th-century Italy and early-20th-century Germany. Visconti, a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party, was also one of the founders of neorealism, dramatizing the struggles of working-class Romans, Sicilian fisherman and migrants from the southern countryside to the factories of the north. These descriptions — realist, historian, man of letters — while accurate, create a somewhat misleading impression, an implication of dryness or sterility that could not be further from the truth. Visconti, the subject of a comprehensive retrospective at the Film Society of Lincoln Center starting Friday, was more sensationalist than scholar. His films are as intoxicating as they are illuminating, a welcome reminder, in this or any time, that seriousness and pleasure go hand in hand. His historical films are essays disguised as operas. “Senso,” his 1954 tale of Venetian intrigue during the Third Italian War of Independence, begins at a performance of “Il Trovatore” and is swept along on the music of Verdi and Bruckner. “The Leopard,” set in Sicily around the same time (the 1860s), culminates with a scene at a formal ball that conveys the rhythms of radical political change through the intricacy and sensuality of dance. The protagonist of “Ludwig,” who ruled Bavaria from 1864-86, is less interested in statecraft than in the music of Wagner and in building palaces that resemble fantastical stage sets. A restored print of “Ludwig” — almost four hours of opulent set design, languorous camera movements and ambient eroticism, featuring actors from various countries dubbed into Italian — will conclude Film Society’s program with a weeklong run starting June 22. It’s late Visconti (originally released, in truncated form, in 1973) and also what you might call advanced Visconti. The best preparation might be a half-dozen selections from earlier in the series. To describe “Ludwig” (or Ludwig himself, for that matter) as decadent might seem like an understatement. Surrounded by gilt, velvet and crystal, a glass of champagne never far from his hand, the man known as the Swan King (played by the Austrian actor Helmut Berger) literally decays before our eyes, his teeth blackening in his mouth and his blue eyes sinking into his perfectly sculptured cheekbones. Ludwig’s kingdom is gradually swallowed up by the bureaucratic Prussian empire, which sets a gaggle of officious black-suited doctors and politicians to investigate his majesty’s mental health. Their inquiry is in part an act of implicitly homophobic persecution — among the “eccentricities” that concern the authorities is Ludwig’s taste for the company of gorgeous young men — and in part a symptom of encroaching modernity. An old aristocratic order, at once morally flexible and rigidly traditional, is giving way to something new, and the change is bittersweet, containing both progress and tragedy. Ludwig’s fate is a variation on the one faced by Prince Fabrizio, the Sicilian nobleman played by Burt Lancaster in “The Leopard,” who contemplates the arrival of the new order with melancholy acceptance. Something beautiful is sacrificed on the altar of the future, which nonetheless must be embraced. This ambivalence is central to Visconti’s work and is often described in terms of the supposedly contradictory facets of his personality. He was an ardent Marxist who happened to be the scion of a wealthy, titled family, a gay man working in a profession (and a culture) steeped in machismo. His aesthetic temperament is often assumed to be in conflict with his political sensibility. It is sometimes said that the visual and sensual pleasures of Visconti’s neorealist films undermine their austere moral intentions, or that their beauty transcends the grittiness of their settings. But it seems to me that his lyricism is its own argument, an insistence on the inseparability of art and life. Visconti’s second feature (and first masterpiece) was “La Terra Trema,” originally commissioned by the Communist Party as a documentary on the exploitation of Sicilian fishermen. Instead, Visconti constructed a fictional story, using real people and locations, about the attempted rise and bitter fall of ’Ntoni Valastra and his family. Moments of melodrama and scenes of everyday life are stitched together by deliberately dry third-person narration. You don’t forget you are watching a movie, but you are somehow simultaneously aware of the human reality in front of your eyes and the cinematic artistry that makes it visible. Early in the film, ’Ntoni’s boat and his fellow fisherman from the village of Aci-Trezza go ashore to unload the morning’s catch and sell it to wholesalers, who take most of the profit. The bustle and clamor make it seem as if a big-city stock exchange has been transported to a Mediterranean beach. There is no distinguishable dialogue, only a cacophony of shouting and haggling. The camera travels through it all in a single unbroken shot that lasts more than two minutes, a thrilling technical feat that manages to communicate an enormous amount of information about the political economy and social organization of Aci-Trezza. There are clear divisions of class, generation and status, but because of the absence of cuts, we see coherence within chaos. There is injustice here, but also a kind of stability. In defiance of custom, ’Ntoni tries to eliminate the middlemen, mortgaging his family’s house to buy a bigger boat. His rebellion, though ultimately futile, disrupts the old order and fully exposes its cruelty. His defeat is confirmed in another scene on the same beach, a ceremonial blessing of the fleet that brings out the whole town. This time, as the speeches of local authorities proclaim unity and harmony, the editing splinters the action into a series of discrete, disjunctive shots. People who had previously been joined in argument are now isolated from one another, alienated, at odds. The relationship between the two moments is dialectical: The aural noise and visual integrity of the first scene are reversed in the second. An exploitative system held together by custom is now maintained by fraud and force. Justice lies over the horizon, and things may have to get worse before they get better. “Rocco and His Brothers,” Visconti’s second masterpiece (and his contribution to the Italian cinematic miracle of 1960, the year of “La Dolce Vita” and “L’Avventura”), ends with a similar gesture. Again, a family trying to improve its lot has suffered devastating defeat. Rocco Parondi and his brothers, who migrated to Milan with their widowed mother, endure the fracturing of their familial bonds and the crumbling of their traditions. But their loss, like Prince Fabrizio’s and King Ludwig’s, is a toll paid on the road toward the future. The faith in that future might now count as an object of nostalgia in its own right, and it’s hard to deny that Visconti offers 21st-century audiences a banquet of voluptuously old-fashioned delights. The longing in some of these movies can transmute into a wistful regard for the world they come from. In that world, Marcello Mastroianni could be cast as the feckless protagonist of the Dostoyevsky adaptation “White Nights” in 1957 and then, 10 years later, as the existential antihero of “The Stranger,” based on the Camus novel. Dirk Bogarde could sit on the beach contemplating the passage of time and the torso of a young tourist in “Death in Venice.” The world could fall apart, slowly and beautifully. Decadence is not what it used to be.",The New York Times
2018,How Many People Can’t Tolerate Statins?,"Ask Well Medical researchers, normally a genteel lot, disagree sharply on the extent to which side effects from statin drugs are a problem. Q. Are there studies concerning the number of people who cannot tolerate statins? A. Yes. Studies show that about 5 percent to 10 percent of people are unable to tolerate statins, largely because of muscle aches and related side effects, including potential muscle damage. But many people who have been labeled intolerant to the drugs probably are not, and medical researchers, normally a genteel lot, disagree sharply on the extent to which side effects are a problem. Proponents of statins argue that concerns about safety have been overblown, with some even describing the research on side effects as “fraudulent.” Opponents maintain that the concerns are real. Both sides agree that the debate is important, since a patient who has been inappropriately prescribed a statin risks muscle damage. But a patient who has been inappropriately denied a statin risks heart attack. Statins can cause a spectrum of muscle symptoms. Muscle aches, known medically as myalgias, constitute the greatest number of muscle complaints and the greatest area of controversy. More serious muscle problems, on the other hand, are not controversial, since they are a clear contraindication to treatment with the drugs. The psychology of myalgias involves the nocebo effect, the flip side of the placebo effect. Whereas a placebo is an inert substance that exerts a beneficial effect, a nocebo is an inert substance that exerts an unpleasant effect. The Effect of Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance (STOMP) trial examined the issue of muscle symptoms directly. STOMP studied 420 patients who had never received statins. About 5 percent developed myalgias while taking the statin atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor), and about half that many developed myalgias while taking placebo, or more precisely, nocebo. The GAUSS-3 trial examined the question from another angle. GAUSS-3 studied 491 patients who had been labeled intolerant to at least two different statins. Surprisingly, more than half of these previously intolerant patients were able to tolerate low-dose atorvastatin. While the rest developed myalgias on atorvastatin, half as many also developed myalgias on placebo. The key for patients who have muscle symptoms while on statins lies in a blood test known as creatine kinase, or CK, an enzyme found in muscles. High levels of the enzyme indicate muscle damage. If muscle damage is present, alternatives to statins should be used. If muscle damage is not present, temporarily discontinuing statins — in what doctors call a “drug holiday” — and restarting at a lower dose may be tried. Alternatively, many people who are intolerant of one statin may find that they are able to take a different statin without difficulty. Diet, exercise and many other options are also available for people who are ultimately unable to tolerate statins. The only mistake would be to allow dangerously elevated cholesterol to go untreated.

2018,How Many Spideys Can Fit in a Trailer? Try 3 in ‘Into the Spider-Verse’,"“Black Panther” brought more people of color into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and struck box office gold. Now “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” introduces a more diverse alternate reality. In the new trailer, we meet Miles Morales, the son of an African-American father and Puerto Rican mother, who learns the ropes from webslinger Peter Parker and ultimately dons the superhero’s mask. The animated film transports the action from Spidey’s usual home turf, Queens, to Brooklyn, where Miles (voiced by Shameik Moore from “The Get Down”) is being raised by his policeman dad (Brian Tyree Henry). He’s not the only new Spider-Person, however, as Peter Parker’s longtime love interest, Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), shows up in costume near the end of the clip “Into the Spider-Verse” was produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who successfully built the “Lego Movie” and “21 Jump Street” big-screen franchises but were replaced as directors of “Solo: A Star Wars Story” by Ron Howard. The vocal ensemble includes Jake Johnson as Peter Parker, along with stars not heard in the trailer: Mahershala Ali as Miles’s Uncle Aaron, Lily Tomlin as Peter’s Aunt May and Liev Schreiber as the villain Kingpin. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” lands in theaters on Dec. 14. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Jake Johnson’s status in the trailer. His voice is heard in the clip; he is not one of the stars in the cast but not in the trailer.",The New York Times
2018,How Marc Jacobs Fell Out of Fashion,"In recent years, Mr. Jacobs has left Louis Vuitton, shrunk his own business, shut dozens of stores and lost his longtime business partner. And what’s happening with that I.P.O.? Though the fortunes of the fashion designer Marc Jacobs have fallen in recent years, he can still attract a celebrity following. In 2015, he waited patiently for Cher, his date to that year’s Met Gala.CreditCreditLandon Nordeman for The New York Times Monday night, when some of fashion’s biggest names gather at the Brooklyn Museum for the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards — often called the Oscars of the fashion world — a familiar figure will again be celebrated: Marc Jacobs. He is nominated for the group’s top award, women’s wear designer of the year, as he has been every year since 2013, winning in 2016. He was awarded the group’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. Those accolades, and the continuing presence of Mr. Jacobs on the annual list of the fashion industry’s most creatively successful designers, may come as a bit of a puzzle to anyone who has followed his career the past few years. There was a time that Mr. Jacobs identified and attracted a new urban woman, one who mixed downtown attitude and uptown glamour. Celebrities like Sofia Coppola and Winona Ryder embodied the look, and not only wore Mr. Jacobs’s clothes (along with what was widely considered the “it” bag of mid-2000s) but also became his muses, the cool girls of the red carpet. Now, there is a sense that Mr. Jacobs has lost his way. With turnover at the top and a designer who himself has suggested he no longer understands what customers want, the label is turning out clothes and accessories that lack a compelling point of view, failing to generate the excitement created by younger peers like Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra. During an earnings call with investors in January 2017, while responding to questions about the business environment during the Trump presidency, Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH, which owns a controlling stake in the fashion house, said, “I’m more concerned about Marc Jacobs than the U.S. president.” Later that year, the company’s chief financial officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, said that Marc Jacobs was “probably one of the few negative performances we have in the group,” and shortly afterward LVMH shut down the label’s small men’s wear business as a cost-cutting measure. In a recent interview, Luca Solca, the head of luxury goods research at Exane BNP Paribas, estimated that Marc Jacobs has been losing more than 50 million euros, or about $61 million, annually, for the past few years, with flat revenues over that time period. In 2015, in what now looks like a telling moment, Marc Jacobs folded its popular, lower-priced Marc by Marc Jacobs line. The move baffled many fashion insiders, because only two years earlier, the highly regarded British designers Luella Bartley and Katie Hillier were ceremoniously brought in to revamp the contemporary label. (“A little piece of our heart broke last week when we heard the news,” Refinery29, the fashion website, lamented when reports about the label’s closing became public.) The company has also closed dozens of stores in the past few years, both in Europe and New York, including a near-decimation of the stretch of Bleecker Street once called “MarcLand” because of the ubiquity of the designer’s various shops. The quintessential New York fashion label now has no flagship in the city beyond a modest boutique in SoHo. Bookmarc, the one remaining Marc Jacobs store on Bleecker Street, sells books and branded trinkets. As concerning as the store closings are, the corporate turmoil at the label is perhaps more troubling. In addition to the departures of Ms. Bartley and Ms. Hillier, and the layoffs of the majority of its European staff, there was the exit of Robert Duffy, widely regarded as the “driving force” behind Mr. Jacobs’s rise. Mr. Duffy first met Mr. Jacobs in 1983, at the designer’s graduation dinner from Parsons School of Design, when Mr. Duffy was a young executive at Reuben Thomas looking for new talent. “I called the school the next day and asked them to put us in touch,” Mr. Duffy told Port magazine in 2012. “Marc called me back, and we met that day and had lunch and shook hands. The next day we started working together.” Over the next three decades, Mr. Duffy was both Mr. Jacobs’s business partner and his tireless champion, and in 1997 orchestrated LVMH’s investment in Marc Jacobs. But he stepped down from his leading role in 2015, ceding day-to-day duties. A representative for Mr. Duffy, who remains on the board of the company, said he was out of the country and unavailable for comment. A new chief executive, Sebastian Suhl, took the reins, and unified the contemporary and ready-to-wear collections under a single brand. But after less than three years on the job, Mr. Suhl was replaced last year by the former Kenzo head, Eric Marechalle. Both Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Marechalle declined, through a company spokesman, several requests to be interviewed. In January, Marc Jacobs hired the Baja East designer John Targon to focus on the brand’s contemporary, or lower-priced, line. But two months into the job, Mr. Targon was let go. “John Targon is a talented designer and we appreciate the work he has done here,” the company said in a statement announcing his departure. “Ultimately, working together did not make sense for the brand and we wish him the best.” Ron Frasch has followed Mr. Jacobs’s career with admiration. But like many, he is perplexed by the recent moves, including the folding of Marc by Marc Jacobs. “Marc by Marc has always been the revenue engine behind the brand,” said Mr. Frasch, a former chief executive of Bergdorf Goodman and president of Saks Fifth Avenue, and who now focuses on luxury apparel at Castanea Partners, a private equity firm. “I don’t know how they made that decision. The storytelling is a little confusing to the customer.” LVMH declined to make any of its executive available for interviews, but it issued a statement this week. “The turnaround is underway at Marc Jacobs International and we are seeing very encouraging signs of progress,” the company said. “It’s realizing some of the benefits of the tough actions taken to right-size the business.” “Year-to-date we are seeing some positive signs from retailers and customers, and substantial improvement on the bottom line,” it added. “The company needs to stay focused but it is heading in the right direction.” For more than two decades, ever since he dressed models in flannel for his 1992 grunge collection for Perry Ellis, which sharply divided critics (and then was fired a year later), Marc Jacobs has been regarded as by far the most exciting and talented American designer of his generation, the only true successor to Calvin, Donna and Ralph. In 1997, while earning accolades (though little profit) at his own label, Mr. Jacobs took on the role of creative director at Louis Vuitton. He transformed the French trunk maker into a full-scale fashion house, creating sensational runway shows, bringing in collaborators like the artist Takashi Murakami and quadrupling business. Simultaneously, with the powerful backing of LVMH, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Duffy took the Marc Jacobs brand global, with estimated sales of around $300 million by 2006 and new stores colonizing upscale shopping districts from Paris to Tokyo. As Mr. Frasch put it, “They created fashion excitement. It wasn’t a formula. Something new was going to happen every season. Marc wasn’t in a box like some brands are.” During New York Fashion Week, the entire fashion world looked to Mr. Jacobs to capture the zeitgeist and amaze them — and he delivered, season after season, with standing-room-only, rock-concert-like runway shows. A designer hits big when his personal vision coincides with the moment. Amanda Mull, a 32-year-old managing editor for the PurseBlog, was in college during Mr. Jacobs’s glory days, and she remembers saving up for his $1,300 “Stam” bag. Named for the model Jessica Stam, the purse was made of sumptuous quilted leather with a chain-link strap, a novel and instantly recognizable design. In those days, she said, Mr. Jacobs created pieces that “managed to be a little punk rock but still super luxurious. It appealed to the girl who isn’t the typical fashion girl, who’s interested in being a little subversive.” As a young, fashion-forward, creative professional living in Brooklyn, Ms. Mull would be the target Marc Jacobs customer, but she can’t recall the last piece she bought by the designer, nor can she pin down what the label represents these days. “At one time, there were things that exemplified the femininity that he built his brand around,” Ms. Mull said. “Whereas I don’t know what a Marc Jacobs outfit would look like now. His current stuff feels a little too focus-grouped contemporary, like they’re trying to figure out what trend can be played to.” Of course, Mr. Jacobs continues to have loyal fans and friends in high places — in the words of Anna Wintour, he is “a great, great designer.” (And Mr. Jacobs can still rock the red carpet: This year Janelle Monáe accompanied him to the Met Gala; in 2015 Cher was his date.) But along the way, something seemed to go wrong. Mr. Jacobs’s dramatic physical transformation from “a withdrawn schlump in eyeglasses,” as a 2008 New Yorker profile of him said, into someone “muscular, bronzed, shining with diamonds,” seemed to presage a new era, one that not all fans embraced. In 2011, Jenna Sauers, a writer for Jezebel, told The New York Times that she missed the “old” Marc. “There was something about him that was so endearing,” Ms. Sauers said. “He was kind of a schlub, and you felt he loved his work. I have a lot of affection for that Marc.” Mr. Jacobs bristled at such criticism. “If my unhappiness was creating insecurities, and that is what people miss, I’m sorry,” he responded in that article. “But I’m the same person, only stronger now, and more positive.” Meanwhile, his history of erratic behavior — including announcing he was entering rehab for drug and alcohol abuse, a very public relationship with a former porn star and accidentally posting a photo of his bare bottom to Instagram — continued to raise concerns about Mr. Jacobs’s ability to run a large company, doubts that have never really gone away. (Though at 55, the designer may finally be settling down; he made news in April by proposing to his fiancé, Char Defrancesco, at a Chipotle.) In 2014, Mr. Jacobs stepped down from his role at Louis Vuitton after 16 years, ostensibly to allow him to concentrate on his own label ahead of a planned I.P.O. Speaking to The New York Times at the time, Michael Burke, the chief executive of Louis Vuitton, hinted there was more to the designer’s departure than a corporate maneuver, saying the label was “not as focused as it needed to be” under Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Burke went on to grumble about Mr. Jacobs’s last-minute, chaotic, costly approach to presenting a collection (“Literally a few days before the show, he could completely change his mind because it was not of this week”) and to praise his successor at Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesquière (“Nicolas does not work that way”). And what of the I.P.O.? It has barely been mentioned since, and the current troubles make it unlikely, at least for the foreseeable future. The problems extend to the creative side, as well. For years, Mr. Jacobs seemed to know exactly what people wanted, and then, quite suddenly, he seemed to not know. Perhaps the creative drift is attributable to the departure of Mr. Duffy, who was not only Mr. Jacobs’s partner in business but the person who kept the designer on track and on schedule, sitting beside him in the weeks leading up to a show. Others say the company has long lacked a strong creative director, someone who can translate Mr. Jacobs’s vision into actual expression for the design team. That role was occupied successfully by Venetia Scott, who oversaw Marc by Marc in its early heyday, but she left the company in 2015. As for Mr. Jacobs himself, he appears uninterested in channeling modern culture. “I am so appalled by the whole social media thing. I don’t get it, it doesn’t appeal to me,” he told British Vogue in 2015, before he began posting sexy selfies. In his recent collections and in interviews, he seems content to look back fondly. Last year, photographed surrounded by ‘80s hip-hop legends like Biz Markie and Salt-N-Pepa for In Style, Mr. Jacobs told the magazine he felt “out of touch with what today really looks like” — a startling admission for a fashion designer in charge of a global brand. His runway shows are still highly anticipated. People go to pay their respects to a genius, and hope to be wowed like so many times before. But the events have also taken on a poignant air of irrelevance; the clothes feel disconnected from the marketplace, and indeed, they are rarely promoted on the Marc Jacobs e-commerce site. The most recent show, in February, was held at the Park Avenue Armory, a stark, cavernous space made more so by the lack of any production (just folding chairs in two long rows) and the gloomy, baroque music. Cathy Horyn, reviewing the show for The Cut, likened it to a “sumptuous funeral,” and The New York Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, declared of Mr. Jacobs: “He is one of our great talents. It still may not be enough.” Meanwhile, others have moved into the creative and commercial spaces Mr. Jacobs once dominated. Designers like Alexander Wang and Alessandro Michele of Gucci, who has cleverly mastered social media, and streetwear labels like Supreme, have proven they understand the current fashion moment. The lines snaking around the block outside the Supreme store recall the lines of young women who once clamored to buy a $5 heart-shaped compact because it was Marc Jacobs-branded. And then there are Balenciaga, Loewe, Altuzarra, Proenza Schouler, Givenchy, Mansur Gavriel and all the other brands competing for market share in an increasingly crowded, competitive and difficult retail environment. “It’s like a tsunami,” Mr. Frasch, the luxury investor, said. “Brands that 15 years ago were barely on the radar have come on the scene. You go back three, four years ago, Gucci was losing real estate in stores. They’ve made big, bold, risky decisions. That’s what consumers are looking for right now, that newness.” But a shift has happened regardless. While Mr. Jacobs continues to design luxury ready-to-wear and be recognized by the CFDA, the Marc Jacobs label is no longer perceived as a luxury brand by consumers. It is more in line with contemporary labels like Coach and Kate Spade. Perhaps there’s no greater evidence of that shift than this: Today, the influential Barneys New York has stopped carrying Marc Jacobs bags. On the Marc Jacobs e-commerce site, the full price of new product arrivals dropped from almost $700 on average in 2015 to around $350 in 2017, according to research compiled by EDITED, a retail technology company. The pricing strategy has increased sales. There is a sense the company’s finances may be stabilizing, if not turning around, Mr. Solca said. The label has a new hit bag too, the $295 “Snapshot” with its colorful camera strap. Marc Jacobs Beauty, a makeup line that is marketed prominently in Sephora, has been growing steadily, especially among young women. When Lady Gaga wore the beauty products to the 2018 Grammys, she garnered as much attention for her smoky eyes as her performance. (The beauty line is a licensing agreement, so Marc Jacobs receives royalty payments, without production costs.) But the shift away from luxury has also led to consumer confusion, the sense among longtime fans that Marc Jacobs — and the products that carry his name — has been devalued. Asked if Mr. Jacobs can recapture his earlier success, Mr. Frasch was cautious in his answer. “It’s harder. Certainly much harder than it was,” he said. “And it depends on Marc, it depends on LVMH and what their projections for the line are.” (While LVMH is known for sticking with underperforming brands in hopes of a turnaround, the other LVMH-owned American fashion house that was a consistent earnings drag — Donna Karan — was offloaded in 2016.) Fern Mallis, formerly the executive director of the CFDA and now an industry consultant, stated what many people seem to believe about Mr. Jacobs: That despite his recent struggles, “Marc is someone you can never count out.” His talent is too great, she said. “He’s a risk taker. He doesn’t really care. That’s pretty fabulous.”",The New York Times
2018,How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa,"When the godfather of management consulting landed its biggest contract ever in Africa, it made the worst mistake in its storied nine-decade history. The McKinsey & Company offices in Sandton, Johannesburg’s financial center. In 2015, the consulting giant entered into a contract that turned out to be illegal.CreditCreditGulshan Khan for The New York Times JOHANNESBURG — The blackouts kept coming. The state-owned power company, Eskom, was on the verge of insolvency. Maintenance was being deferred. And a major boiler exploded, threatening the national grid. McKinsey & Company, the godfather of management consulting, thought it could help, but was not sure that it should, according to people involved in the debate. The risk was huge. Could McKinsey fix the problems? Would it get paid? Would it be tainted by South Africa’s rampant political corruption? In late 2015, over objections from at least three influential McKinsey partners, the firm decided the risk was worth taking and signed on to what would become its biggest contract ever in Africa, with a potential value of $700 million. It was also the biggest mistake in McKinsey’s nine-decade history. The contract turned out to be illegal, a violation of South African contracting law, with some of the payments channeled to an associate of an Indian-born family, the Guptas, at the center of a swirling corruption scandal. Then there was the lavish size of that payout. It did not take a Harvard Business School graduate to explain why South Africans might get angry seeing a wealthy American firm cart away so much public money in a country with the worst income inequality in the world and a youth unemployment rate over 50 percent. And a bitter irony: While McKinsey’s pay was supposed to be based entirely on its results, it is far from clear that the flailing power company is much better off than it was before. The Eskom affair is now part of an expansive investigation by South African authorities into how the Guptas used their friendships with Jacob Zuma, then the country’s president, and his son to manipulate and control state-owned enterprises for personal gain. International corruption watchdogs call it a case of “state capture.” Lawmakers here call it a silent coup. It has already led to Mr. Zuma’s ouster and a moment of reckoning for post-apartheid South Africa. Yet despite extensive coverage of the scandal by the local news media, one question has remained largely unanswered: How did McKinsey, with its vast influence, impeccable research credentials and record of advising companies and governments on best practices, become entangled in such an untoward affair? McKinsey admits errors in judgment while denying any illegality. Two senior partners, the firm says, bear most of the blame for what went wrong. But an investigation by The New York Times, including interviews with 16 current and former partners, found that the roots of the problem go deeper — to a changing corporate culture that opened the way for an aggressive push into more government consulting, as well as new methods of compensation. While the changes helped McKinsey nearly double in size over the last decade, they introduced more reputational risk. The firm also missed warning signs about the possible involvement of the Guptas, and only belatedly realized the insufficiency of its risk management for state-owned companies. Supervisors who might have vetoed or modified the contract were not South African and lacked the local knowledge to sense trouble ahead. And having poorly vetted its subcontractor, McKinsey was less than forthcoming when asked to explain its role in the emerging scandal. “I take responsibility,” McKinsey’s managing director, Dominic Barton, said in a recent interview. “This isn’t who we are. It isn’t what we do.” Regrettably, he added, the firm had a “bit of a tin ear” in its early response to the crisis. Since the Eskom disclosures, much of McKinsey’s business in South Africa has evaporated. Mr. Barton has made six trips there to assess the damage and make amends, and McKinsey has asked its 2,000 global partners to repay South Africa, where it is under investigation. Indeed, the harm to the McKinsey brand is more profound than the fallout from the epochal Galleon hedge fund case almost a decade ago, in which McKinsey’s former managing director and a senior partner were convicted on charges related to insider trading. Neither man acted on behalf of McKinsey. More broadly, the scandal in South Africa — which has ensnared several other overseas companies — underscores the risks that arise as governments increasingly turn over responsibilities to consultants who operate mostly in secret, with little or no public accountability. [Corruption in South Africa: A Guide to Our Recent Reporting] McKinsey built its brand as the ubiquitous adviser to businesses great and small. But in recent years, it has created an increasingly powerful unseen presence as counselor to governments across the globe. The extent of that global influence is difficult to evaluate because, as a matter of policy, the firm will not reveal clients or the advice it gives. Even so, by examining government records, along with McKinsey publications and other company documents, The Times found that the firm shapes everything from education, transportation, energy and medical care to the restructuring of economies and the fighting of wars. McKinsey’s clients include sovereign wealth funds worth more than a trillion dollars, as well as what one marketing brochure describes as “defense ministries, military forces, police forces and justice ministries in 15 countries,” where the company consults on such matters as the maintenance and support of “armored personnel carriers; minesweepers, destroyers and submarines; and fast jets and transport aircraft.” McKinsey “is a hidden, unaccountable power that has a prestigious face,” said Janine R. Wedel, a professor at George Mason University who has written extensively on what she calls “the shadow elite.” She added, “Think of them as a repository of the most intimate information that governments and others have, from what they are investing in to who wields influence.” McKinsey refused to work in South Africa until it embraced democracy in the mid-1990s, but records show that it consults for many authoritarian governments, including the world’s mightiest, China, to a degree unheard of for a foreign company. Late last year, two McKinsey partners spoke at a meeting of the state-controlled conglomerate China Merchants Group that focused on carrying out Communist Party directives. McKinsey is also advising the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as he seeks to make its economy less reliant on oil. While confidentiality is necessary in private business, it can become problematic when public money is involved, as in South Africa, or for that matter in the United States, where McKinsey has advised more than 40 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration. Since President Trump took office, McKinsey has greatly expanded consulting for Immigration and Customs Enforcement through that agency’s office of “detention, compliance and removals.” Their contracts with the agency exceed $20 million. Asked about those contracts, a McKinsey spokesman said the company’s work focused primarily on administration and organization and was unconnected to immigration policy, including the separation of children and parents at the border. Certainly, consulting firms other than McKinsey keep client lists confidential and work for authoritarian governments. And McKinsey has undeniably been a force for good, through its pro bono work and by helping many organizations become more efficient engines of economic growth. As for the quality of people McKinsey hires, many have gone on to run some of the world’s biggest and most successful companies. That is why McKinsey’s behavior in South Africa is so startling. In 2012, a new class of recruits — the worker bees in McKinsey’s hive — settled in at its office in Sandton, Johannesburg’s financial center, often called the richest square mile in Africa. They were part of a notably diverse group. Given South Africa’s historic battle against apartheid, it was a point of pride at McKinsey that more than 60 percent of the office’s 250 employees were black South Africans. Many described their work as a calling, an opportunity to make a difference in a young and still-struggling democracy. Years earlier, McKinsey’s South African partners had decided that to be relevant, they had to embrace the public sector, because of its outsize role in South Africa’s economy. But a South African government weakened by corruption also represented a risk to McKinsey’s sterling reputation — a reputation forged by its founder, a math whiz from the Ozarks named James O. McKinsey, and nurtured by his disciple and successor, Marvin Bower. Over the decades, the firm — that’s what it calls itself — became confidant to chief executives and presidents, simultaneously the secret-keeper of corporate America and its most effective evangelist, preaching the McKinsey way to companies across the globe. In 1952, McKinsey helped the incoming President Dwight D. Eisenhower staff his new administration. Later it helped to set up NASA, and helped to invent the Universal Product Code — the bar code. The company was instrumental in Wall Street’s rise as a dominant force in the economy, providing SWAT teams of brainpower to help Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and countless other financial companies adapt and move into new markets. There came to be a not entirely hyperbolic narrative of McKinsey’s preordained white-shoe path through the world — the Harvard Business School recruit turned McKinsey consultant turned rising corporate titan. And few companies have a better track record of producing them: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who oversaw I.B.M.’s turnaround in 1990s, is a McKinsey veteran. So is Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai. “So pervasive is the firm’s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey,” wrote Duff McDonald, author of “The Firm,” a 2013 book about the company. McKinsey has had its share of bad publicity, but much of it has focused on people who have already left. One very public flap emerged in the summer of 1970, when The Times (also a McKinsey client over many decades) published front-page articles detailing an explosion in consulting fees paid out by New York City. At the center of the controversy was a young McKinsey partner, acting as an unpaid official in the city’s budget bureau even as the city was spending taxpayer dollars on contracts with the firm. It looked bad. And while McKinsey was cleared of wrongdoing, the experience helped steer the company away from government work, avoiding the publicity, the ethical quandaries and the generally lower fees that came with public contracts. But if McKinsey had learned a lesson, it soon began to unlearn it. By the early 2000s, McKinsey re-entered the public sphere in a major way — and now government contracts and work with state-owned companies make up 16 percent of the firm’s revenues. There was another lesson being unlearned as well: Work for a fixed fee. In the late 1980s, an up-and-coming partner in McKinsey’s energy practice, Jeffrey K. Skilling, had been part of a committee considering whether payment should be based on delivered results, such as reduced costs. As Mr. Skilling told the journalist Anita Raghavan, the panel concluded it would not work, because getting paid based on impact, for example, could give McKinsey an incentive to tell clients to reduce costs even if it was not in their interest. Doing that, Mr. Skilling said, “could destroy” the firm. Mr. Skilling — who would become Enron’s chief executive and end up in federal prison after its vast accounting fraud was revealed — saw the ethical trap. A future generation of McKinsey partners came to a different conclusion. Starting around 2001 or 2002, McKinsey again began to rethink its fee-for-service rule. Its competitors were already changing over. After years of deliberation and study, the firm agreed in 2011 to allow “at risk” contracts alongside its traditional fee structure. “There’s been client demand for that, clients saying we like that approach,” Mr. Barton said. “If you don’t get the results you want, then don’t pay us.” With this new pay policy and avid embrace of government work, the firm’s South African partners had been handed a seductive vision of the future. Some of McKinsey’s young associates in Johannesburg would end up on the ill-fated Eskom deal. But first, there was an ambitious project at the state-owned rail and port agency, Transnet. McKinsey had worked with Transnet since 2005, embedding itself so deeply that one board member wondered how the agency could ever oust the consultants should the need arise. Still, Transnet remained an underachiever, its ports inadequate, its freight rail system moribund. Then, in February 2011, Transnet got a new chief executive, Brian Molefe, who had been running the country’s public pension fund. His tenure began with controversy. The South African media had already linked him to the Guptas, a family led by three brothers who arrived in South Africa a quarter-century ago and became ostentatiously wealthy through a web of businesses, once commandeering an air force base to fly in wedding guests from India. McKinsey and Mr. Molefe set out to revitalize the agency by buying as many as 1,064 new locomotives in what would be the biggest government procurement in South African history. But McKinsey would have to take on a subcontractor, under a South African law requiring companies that worked with state-owned enterprises to have black-owned partners. According to prosecutors, the Guptas saw these black-empowerment companies as a way to empower themselves, and state-owned companies like Transnet became willing accomplices. Transnet steered McKinsey toward working with a company, Regiments, owned in part by a businessman linked to the Guptas. But weeks before the winning bidders were announced, McKinsey bowed out, saying the process was moving too quickly. As it turned out, Transet agreed to pay about $1 billion more than the agreed-upon price for the locomotives. And, as leaked documents published last year in the local media revealed, one of the winning bidders, a state-owned Chinese company, paid more than $100 million to shell companies tied to another Gupta associate, Salim Essa. Although it is unclear what, if anything, Mr. Molefe knew about those payments, he left Transnet to search for a new challenge. He found it in 2015 as the chief executive at Eskom. The power company had long been the public’s favorite punching bag, notorious for its high rates, sputtering from one crisis to the next. Officials worried about getting enough coal, about delaying maintenance to keep electricity flowing. During the World Cup in 2010, Eskom feared that the lights might go out at any moment with the whole world watching. To address Eskom’s financial troubles, McKinsey and Eskom drew up an audacious new reorganization plan. McKinsey’s team leader on the project was a popular partner, Vikas Sagar, a stylish, Porsche-driving fitness buff in his 40s, known for hugging colleagues when the spirit moved him and fiercely charting his own course. He was assisted by Alexander Weiss, a serious reverse image of Mr. Sagar, who thought little of commuting between his home in Germany and Johannesburg. McKinsey’s proposal appeared perfect for a company in desperate financial straits. Eskom would pay only if the plan produced savings. Then the consultancy would get a percentage. All the risk, ostensibly, would be McKinsey’s, since it might spend heavily but get nothing in the end. Yet for all the upside, the proposal had a Trojan-horse quality: Eskom would hire McKinsey not knowing what the final bill would be. The plan left several McKinsey partners uneasy. Could Eskom absorb and apply McKinsey’s recommendations? And how would a contract with an anticipated payout in the hundreds of millions of dollars be received by South Africans? Also troubling was the fact that McKinsey had won the contract without competitive bidding. “You are betting the office,” one former partner recalled warning colleagues. If the final payout became public, that official added, “You are going to be slaughtered just for the size.” The contract’s structure — with the risks it posed for McKinsey — was not universally embraced, either. “Trying to do a 100 percent at-risk contract at Eskom is trying to play God,” a former partner said. “You are really guaranteeing that I can turn around everything, no problem.” To accomplish that, McKinsey might need more political clout and expertise than it could deliver. Most of McKinsey’s current or former partners who spoke to The Times requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. McKinsey did provide several partners for interviews on the condition that their names not be used. Mr. Sagar did not respond to repeated messages seeking an interview, and Mr. Weiss declined to speak to The Times. Concerns notwithstanding, the prospect of a big payday made the contract popular not only in Johannesburg but throughout McKinsey’s global empire. Supporters included two senior partners with oversight in energy and power: Yermolai Solzhenitsyn, the novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s eldest son, in Moscow, and Thomas Vahlenkamp in Düsseldorf, Germany. Both declined to be interviewed. In the end, Mr. Sagar and his allies carried the day. In situations like these, risk managers are supposed to serve as corporate lifeguards, ready to whistle back dealmakers if they expose the company to unnecessary legal and reputational peril. Yet the Eskom contract was approved with less scrutiny than regular public contracts. That was because state-owned enterprises were treated as private corporations, where reviews focused on commercial viability, not political risk. Had McKinsey vetted the Eskom contract properly, it might have spared itself some of the grief to come. The contract, it turned out, was illegal: The power company had failed to get a government waiver from the standard fee-for-service payment, despite assuring McKinsey that it had done so. “For the scale of the fee, they were prepared to throw caution to the wind, and maybe because they thought they couldn’t be touched,” said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a local advocacy group. If McKinsey fell short in vetting the Eskom contract, the same could be said about the scrutiny of its minority partner, a company called Trillian Management Consulting. McKinsey’s putative marriage to Trillian produced its first awkward moments when its chief executive, Bianca Goodson, showed up angry at the consultancy’s Sandton headquarters on a January evening in 2016. Under McKinsey’s agreement with Eskom, Ms. Goodson’s company was supposed to provide consulting support, but with only two employees was unsure how to do that. Feeling ignored and marginalized, Ms. Goodson planned to raise her concerns at a meeting of McKinsey partners. Four hours in, she got her chance. But before she could finish, Ms. Goodson wrote in an account later submitted to Parliament, a McKinsey team leader abruptly left the room, another partner said not to worry too much about work because she would still get her financial cut, and another made “whipping sounds and gestures,” an apparent inside joke, prompting laughter among the partners. Ms. Goodson left more disillusioned than before she arrived. Two months later, she resigned. During the internal debate over the Eskom deal, several partners had questioned whether McKinsey knew enough about who precisely was behind Trillian. Now rumors began reaching the McKinsey office that Trillian Management and its parent company, Trillian Capital, might have ties to the Gupta family. McKinsey knew little about Trillian — a new company, with no track record, that had broken off from McKinsey’s previous minority partner, Regiments, after a business dispute. What’s more, Trillian had refused McKinsey’s requests to divulge its ownership. Even so, McKinsey chose to kick the can down the road and continue working. What McKinsey did not yet know was that Eskom’s chief executive, Mr. Molefe, had placed dozens of phone calls to one of the Gupta brothers during and after contract negotiations. An influential senior partner in Johannesburg, David Fine, had grown increasingly uneasy about Trillian, according to his testimony to Parliament. One source of concern: Over the objections of two senior partners, McKinsey’s team leader, Mr. Sagar, had been meeting with Eskom and Trillian without any other McKinsey officials present. Eventually McKinsey hired a private investigative firm to dig into Trillian’s background. When that did not produce any definitive leads, Mr. Fine began running internet searches on companies named Trillian and found the name “S. Essa” listed as a director. Weeks later, the South African media revealed the majority owner of Trillian as none other than Salim Essa, the Gupta associate whose shell companies had received more than $100 million in the locomotive deal. On March 30, 2016, McKinsey told Eskom in writing that it was severing its ties to Trillian. But while McKinsey had finally taken a stand, it quietly undercut that decision by continuing to work alongside Trillian — independently, rather than as a subcontractor. To the consternation of some McKinsey partners, that arrangement continued until the end of June 2016. With the local media revealing ever more of the Gupta family’s influence, Eskom — not McKinsey — prematurely terminated the contract. Mr. Molefe resigned that November. Mr. Molefe did not respond to requests for comment for this article; a lawyer for the Guptas declined to comment. The abbreviated tab for barely eight months of work: nearly $100 million, with close to 40 percent going to Trillian. In the United States, with an economy over 50 times as big as South Africa’s, a contract that size might have gone unnoticed. But in South Africa, millions of dollars flowing out of a struggling public utility and into the pockets of consultants driving Porsches and Ferraris created an unsavory image that required a response. Yet McKinsey kept quiet, one of many decisions the firm would come to regret. Late the next year, South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority would deliver a stinging summation of the Eskom case. McKinsey, the prosecutors would allege, had been instrumental “in creating a veil of legitimacy to what was otherwise a nonexistent, unlawful arrangement.” That arrangement, in turn, allowed a company controlled by the Gupta associate, Mr. Essa, to profit. That conclusion was based in part on a letter obtained by a widely respected human-rights advocate, Geoff Budlender, who had been asked to investigate Trillian, including its ties to McKinsey. For the first time, McKinsey was being publicly held to account. Mr. Budlender asked to interview McKinsey but was told to put his questions in writing, which he did. In response to one question, McKinsey denied working “on any projects” with Trillian, as either a subcontractor or a black-empowerment partner. With his trap laid, Mr. Budlender pounced. He attached a Feb. 9, 2016, letter from the McKinsey team leader, Mr. Sagar, to Eskom. “As you know,” Mr. Sagar had written, “McKinsey has subcontracted a portion of the services to be performed” to Trillian. The letter went further and authorized Eskom to pay Trillian directly, rather than through McKinsey, as was customary for a subcontractor. Asked to explain the conflicting answers, a McKinsey lawyer, Benedict Phiri, took weeks to respond, saying he needed to speak with his colleagues. Finally, he wrote that, given ongoing legal disputes, it was “inappropriate” to comment. Mr. Budlender concluded that McKinsey’s denial was false. “I have to say that I find this inexplicable, particularly having regard to the fact that McKinsey presents itself as an international leader in management consulting and given the widespread public interest in this matter,” he wrote. In the interview with The Times, the McKinsey managing partner, Mr. Barton, said the office leadership in Johannesburg had been unaware of Mr. Sagar’s letter, and had only learned of it from Mr. Budlender. But three current or former McKinsey partners told The Times that Mr. Sagar’s German colleague, Mr. Weiss, and the firm’s lawyer, Mr. Phiri, also knew of the letter. McKinsey’s lawyers said that the letter should never have been sent. Even so, they said, the authorization to pay Trillian referred to another, much smaller contract, and it was predicated on Trillian’s meeting certain conditions. In late 2017, a parliamentary committee began calling witnesses as part of its own investigation of state capture. One witness was Ms. Goodson, the former Trillian executive, who said she had been told soon after being hired that Mr. Essa owned Trillian. She also testified about meeting Mr. Sagar and Mr. Essa in Melrose Arch, a wealthy enclave with high-end retail and sidewalk dining where deals are made. McKinsey sent Mr. Fine, who withstood nearly four hours of questioning. He addressed criticism head on, beginning with the size of the contract. “We should have absolutely had a fee structure that was capped,” he said. Mr. Fine, who had no role in the Eskom contract, said he had been assured that Eskom did derive measurable benefits from McKinsey’s consulting. Yet his comments betrayed an element of doubt. As a native South African, he said, he couldn’t help asking himself, “If these benefits were there, why then has the price of electricity gone up and has the liquidity position of Eskom deteriorated?” Mr. Barton, in his interview with The Times, insisted that his firm helped Eskom solve important problems. He expressed frustration at the overarching narrative that McKinsey took money for little work. “There was real work being done,” he said. Grieve Chelwa, an economics lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said in an interview that McKinsey’s top ranks in South Africa were overwhelmingly filled by Europeans who “may not have had the political antennae” to pick up potential problems. “The less charitable interpretation is that they knew,” said Dr. Chelwa, until recently a fellow at Harvard’s Center for African Studies. “They made a risk calculation that we know what is going on or we have an idea what is going on, but then there is 1.6 billion rand to make, and what is the probability that all this falls in our faces? They made that kind of calculation and they said, ‘O.K., the risk is worth doing,’ and they did it.” It is a risk McKinsey now regrets taking. The advocacy group Corruption Watch referred the firm’s conduct to the United States Justice Department for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. McKinsey declined to say whether federal investigators had contacted the firm; the Justice Department declined to comment. The National Prosecuting Authority in South Africa has frozen the proceeds of the Eskom contract, pending the completion of the government’s investigation. And several banks and corporations, including the South African arm of Coca-Cola, have said they will not do business with McKinsey until investigations are concluded. McKinsey vehemently denies breaking any laws, and says that this view has been validated by a monthslong internal inquiry involving more than 50 lawyers reviewing millions of documents and emails. The firm does admit mistakes. McKinsey will now give state-owned companies the same scrutiny it would government agencies or ministries. That policy may have a major impact in China, where McKinsey has advised at least 19 of the biggest state-owned companies as well as the country’s powerful planning agency. In a statement, McKinsey said that it was “not careful enough about who we associated with,” that it should not have worked alongside Trillian after cutting its ties and that it did not communicate properly with Mr. Budlender. “We are embarrassed by these failings, and we apologize to the people of South Africa, our clients, our colleagues and our alumni, who rightly expect more of our firm.” At the end of June, Mr. Barton, 55, will step down as previously planned. McKinsey’s nearly 600 senior partners voted to replace Mr. Barton with Kevin Sneader, a British citizen. Last weekend, as The Times was preparing this article after weeks of questioning McKinsey about its secretive culture, The Financial Times published an interview with Mr. Sneader, who said the firm could no longer “hide from the outside world.” Mr. Sagar has left the firm with his full benefits in place. Mr. Weiss has been sanctioned, though McKinsey declined to say what that involved. The firm’s Johannesburg lawyer, Mr. Phiri, resigned, and the head of McKinsey’s Africa practice was transferred to Hong Kong. Mr. Fine, who now leads McKinsey’s worldwide public-sector practice in London, cast the fallout from Eskom in personal terms. “I have seen the anger and disappointment in my clients’ eyes,” he told the South African Parliament. He added, “I’ve experienced rejection from people that I really love and trust, and that’s been hard.”",The New York Times
2018,How Mnuchin Keeps a Steady Grip in a Tug of War on Trade,"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared that the trade war with China was “on hold” and that the United States would temporarily holster its tariffs. The reassuring comments calmed markets and raised hopes that Mr. Mnuchin, one of President Trump’s most enduring and trusted advisers, was winning the internal trade battle that has gripped the White House. Then Mr. Trump weighed in. In a one-two punch last week, the president doubled down on the trade war with China and threw in ones with Canada, Mexico and Europe for good measure. This weekend, some of those countries hit back, as finance ministers from the six other nations attending the Group of 7 meeting in Canada issued an unusual rebuke over America’s trading practices and the use of tariffs against allies. The statement said that tariffs “undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy” and called on Mr. Mnuchin to make their worries known to Mr. Trump. The scolding laid bare the uncomfortably familiar spot that Mr. Mnuchin finds himself in: trying to be a voice of moderation and a statesman in an administration that sees diplomatic norms and protocols as signs of weakness. He has so far managed to stay in Mr. Trump’s good graces while advocating a more free-trade approach, but that balancing act is showing signs of strain. Mr. Mnuchin, unflappable in public, is privately making his case with a president who campaigned on blowing up trade agreements and surrounded himself with hard-line advisers who continue to toe that line. “You have an intellectual slugfest going on in the White House,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Sometimes Mnuchin has victories and sometimes he has failures, but he is clearly one of the strongest voices for the free-trade position.” The internal tensions boiled over in May during a trade mission Mr. Mnuchin led to China, when he got into an argument with Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump’s hawkish trade adviser, by reminding him where he stood in the administration’s pecking order after Mr. Navarro confronted him about his sidelining of the rest of the team from the talks. On the plane ride home, Mr. Navarro sat in a separate cabin from Mr. Mnuchin and remained publicly silent for days about the trip while Mr. Mnuchin declared the talks a success and said the trade war was on hold. The victory was short-lived. “He didn’t say it was on hold indefinitely,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week as the White House announced that the China tariffs and investment restrictions would be coming, after all. “And look, the president ultimately makes the decisions on trade,” she added. “And when he does, we announce them. And that’s exactly what’s taken place in this process.” Mr. Mnuchin has managed to remain in Mr. Trump’s good stead by rolling with the punches, avoiding the fate that has befallen Mr. Trump’s campaign managers, chiefs of staff and cabinet secretaries by pleasing a president who prizes the unpredictable and governs by whim. That has given Mr. Mnuchin a key role inside the West Wing and the president’s ear. Current and former White House and Treasury officials say Mr. Mnuchin has managed to thrive by employing a mix of assertiveness and obsequiousness, staking out his position to the president but quickly changing course to carry out Mr. Trump’s marching orders, even if his message did not win the day. “He’s kept the focus on the president’s agenda, rather than himself,” said Jason Miller, a former campaign spokesman for Mr. Trump who worked closely with Mr. Mnuchin. “He’s managed to do it without elevating his profile too high.” That skill was on display in mid-May, when Mr. Trump tweeted that he was going to find a way to help put back in business a Chinese telecommunications company that had been punished for violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The decision blindsided administration officials and lawmakers, including Democrats who publicly criticized Mr. Trump’s decision and said the president was caving to China. Mr. Mnuchin, along with the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was dispatched to Capitol Hill to try to calm angry Republican lawmakers and explain the rationale behind allowing the company, ZTE, to remain in business. Several of the lawmakers appeared unconvinced and, according to a person who was in the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin advised them to take their concerns directly to the president. He has also learned when to fight and when to toe the president’s line. While colleagues describe Mr. Mnuchin as someone who believes in free markets and views trade barriers as a last resort, those close to the secretary say he has learned to appreciate Mr. Trump’s use of the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool. In talks with China, he has been focused on the president’s desire to see the bilateral trade deficit reduced, rather than emphasizing some of the other trade barriers that many lawmakers and executives say put American companies at a disadvantage. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former top strategist, has said that Mr. Mnuchin is in over his head in the negotiations and that he is letting Mr. Trump’s leverage slip away by failing to force China to make major changes to its industrial policy. David Loevinger, the Treasury Department’s senior coordinator for China from 2009 to 2012, said it was apparent that the Chinese government was trying to elevate Mr. Mnuchin’s role in the negotiations because they see him as the American official most likely to cut a deal. “Among the possible choices, they see Mnuchin as being less hawkish than some of the other counterparts,” Mr. Loevinger said. Mr. Trump dispatched Mr. Ross to Beijing to continue talks through Monday, but the president has expressed wavering confidence in his deal-making abilities. The China hawks within the administration, Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, continue to have sway with Mr. Trump. And populist voices outside the administration have already been heckling Mr. Mnuchin as inept amid reports that the United States was on the verge of making an agreement with China that was viewed as merely symbolic. Mr. Mnuchin has at times found himself the subject of derision, characterized as a fawning banker who cannot tell the president “no.” Last year, the Treasury secretary was scoffed at by economic policymakers from across the political spectrum for insisting that the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts would pay for themselves. Nearly every independent economic analysis found otherwise, and the analysis produced by the department was mocked for its lack of rigor. He has also clashed with some of the more conservative members of the Republican Party. Last year, as the White House pressed lawmakers to raise the ceiling on how much the government can borrow, Mr. Mnuchin told members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to “vote for the debt ceiling for me.” His plea was met with groans and hisses. His stance on social issues has also propelled him into controversy. Last August, fellow alumni of Yale, where Mr. Mnuchin earned a bachelor’s degree, called on the secretary to resign when he defended Mr. Trump’s handling of racially inspired violence in Charlottesville, Va. A month later, Lawrence Summers, a Clinton administration Treasury secretary, called Mr. Mnuchin the “greatest sycophant in cabinet history” for supporting Mr. Trump’s criticism of football players who knelt during the national anthem. His travel, as well, has been the subject of fierce scrutiny, including a Treasury inspector general investigation, after he took several government planes to travel to places such as New York and Miami at a cost of nearly $1 million. He drew fire for inquiring about the use of an official military jet for his honeymoon, and for taking time out of a trip to Fort Knox to watch a solar eclipse with his wife, Louise Linton. When he returned to Los Angeles for the holidays last December, he found a box of horse manure addressed to him, waiting near his home. Mr. Mnuchin publicly brushes off the criticism and points to his role in successfully steering the Republican tax cut package, which many said would never pass, through Congress. Within the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin has developed a reputation as a micromanager. He resisted choosing a full-time deputy for more than a year, preferring to oversee everything from carrying out the new tax law to overseeing financial sanctions. That has at times created problems. When the Internal Revenue Service systems failed on Tax Day, the response to the crash was slowed because Mr. Mnuchin was in New Hampshire at a tax event with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. He had required that any big decisions be cleared by him, according to a senior government official. A Treasury spokesman said that this reflected the secretary’s commitment to being hands-on when problems arose and did not slow the response. Mr. Mnuchin’s closest aides describe him as a collegial and mentoring figure. Despite his earnest persona on television, he is known to possess a wry sense of humor, even occasionally brandishing impressions from old movies such as “The Pink Panther Strikes Again” to lighten the mood. But when it comes to the president, Mr. Mnuchin puts up little resistance when policy decisions are made, and he even keeps his pet peeves to himself. While Mr. Mnuchin insists that most people refer to him by his given name, Steven, he does not flinch when Mr. Trump just calls him Steve.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Much Can Democrats Count on Suburban Liberals?,"Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. Just how reliable is suburban liberalism? In affluent, largely white Massachusetts communities like Wellesley, Southborough and Dedham, Hillary Clinton crushed Donald Trump by margins ranging from 23 to 50 percentage points. These and other townships surrounding Boston epitomize the gains the Democratic Party has made nationwide in liberal, well-educated suburbs. Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, published a book last year, “The Space Between Us,” suggesting that the ideological commitment of liberals in these and other similar communities may waver, or fail entirely, when their white homogeneity is threatened. Not only is the upscale wing of the Democratic Party an unreliable ally of the left on economic issues — as I have noted in this column before and as Lily Geismer and Matthew D. Lassiter eloquently pointed out in The Times last week — but Enos demonstrates that the liberal resolve of affluent Democrats can disintegrate when racially or ethnically charged issues like neighborhood integration are at stake. Six years ago, Enos looked at nine townships southwest of Boston that were “overwhelmingly racially and politically liberal.” As such, these communities were a “test of the power of demographic change because these were people who, we might think, would be unlikely to change their attitudes in the face of immigration.” Enos and his colleagues conducted an experiment, which is described in detail in a 2014 paper, “Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes,” published by the National Academy of Sciences. The results are thought provoking. Enos described the experiment as a randomized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact, in which Spanish-speaking confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted, for a period of days, into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus simulating the conditions of demographic change. To achieve this goal, during the summer of 2012, Enos dispatched “a small number of Spanish-speaking confederates to commuter train stations in homogeneously Anglo communities every day, at the same time, for two weeks.” The stations were on two Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority commuter rail lines into Boston — one starting in Worcester, the other in Forge Park — at nine stations in upscale, mostly white towns. Enos reported that the Anglo commuters he studied had an average income of $143,365, and 88 percent had college degrees, compared with 30.4 percent nationally that year. The median household income for the country at large was $51,371 in 2012, according to the census. The study had a complicated design, and I invite readers who are so inclined to ascertain the details for themselves. Here is Enos’s description of his experiment: Under the assumption that people with similar characteristics tend to ride the train at the same time, I selected pairs [of trains] that were close together in time so that the treatment units [train platforms onto which Spanish-speaking confederates had been inserted] within each station would have similar passengers. Within a matched pair of train times at each station, one was randomly assigned to treatment and one to control, resulting in 18 matched pairs of train times. This design means that we should expect subjects in the treatment and control conditions to be, in expectation, identical. Enos continues: Subjects were exposed to the same Spanish-speaking persons in a location near their homes for an extended period, as would be the situation if immigrants had moved into their neighborhood and used the public transportation. The Spanish-speaking confederates reported to Enos that persons noticed and displayed some unease with them: for example reporting that “Because we are chatting in Spanish, they look at us. I don’t think it is common to hear people speaking in Spanish on this route.” After the experiment, the confederates reported that other passengers were generally friendly to them but also reported that they felt people noticed them for “not being like them and being Latino.” Members of the treatment groups and control groups were surveyed before and after the two weeklong experiments in an effort to identify the effect of exposure to Spanish-speaking people. In both surveys, respondents were asked three questions about immigration along with other more general questions: 1. Do you think the number of immigrants from Mexico who are permitted to come to the United States to live should be increased, left the same, or decreased? 2. Would you favor allowing persons that have immigrated to the United States illegally to remain in the country if they are employed and have no criminal history? 3. Some people favor a state law declaring English as the official language. Some other people oppose such a law. Would you favor such a law? How did the respondents’ answers change? Treated subjects were far more likely to advocate a reduction in immigration from Mexico and were far less likely to indicate that illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in this country. The experiment, Enos wrote, demonstrated that exclusionary attitudes can be stimulated by even very minor, noninvasive demographic change: in this case, the introduction of only two persons. In his 2017 book, reflecting on the results of his experiment, Enos is more direct: The good liberal people catching trains in the Boston suburbs became exclusionary. Exposure to two young Spanish speakers for just a few minutes, or less, for just three days had driven them toward anti-immigration policies associated with their political opponents. Enos examined national precinct and county-level voting results in recent elections to see what effect a black president, Barack Obama, had on whites living in segregated areas as opposed to those living in unsegregated areas. In the 2008 election, Enos found that with a black Democratic nominee, white voters in the most-segregated counties were between five and six percentage points less likely to vote for Obama than white voters in the least-segregated counties. That pattern had not emerged in the previous four presidential elections when the Democratic nominee was white. “Every time a white Democrat had run going back to 1992 — segregation had had no such effect on the vote,” Enos wrote: In 2008, this was a massive effect of segregation: the gap between the most and least-segregated counties was almost equivalent to the gap between men and women. Enos then looked at results from 124,034 precincts, almost every precinct in the United States. Again: A white voter in the least-segregated metropolitan area was 10 percentage points more likely to vote for Obama than a white voter in the most-segregated area. These voting patterns, according to Enos, reflect what might be called a self-reinforcing cycle of prejudice. In the mid-to-late twentieth century, Enos writes, “whites — spurred by forces including their own racism — abandoned the inner cities.” But, he goes on, that “is not where the story ends. Attitudes do not remain static.” In practice, the very fact of being segregated creates an environment in which hostile views “become even more negative and their political consequences even more severe.” In other words, Prejudice may have helped cause segregation, but then the segregation helped cause even more prejudice. Looking beyond the borders of the United States, Enos argues that as much as support for diversity is integral to modern democracy, diversity can make governing more difficult: The negative effects of diversity may be responsible for some of the profound differences between places such as Denmark and Zambia or Singapore and India. Noting that these four countries are all democracies, we see the consequences of voters — normally separated by geographic, social, and psychological space — coming together to govern and having to make decisions and allocate resources. It appears that when people are faced with these decisions in a diverse democracy, rather than a homogeneous one, they often choose not to do the things that “make democracy work,” failing to bridge the space between groups by cooperating to share resources and provide for the common welfare. This tendency, according to Enos, demonstrates “why diversity is such a vexing problem.” Liberal democracies endorse diversity, Enos writes, indeed, it is often considered one of our strengths and liberal individuals usually favor diversity as a matter of ideology and public policy. We often support diversity out of a genuine ideological commitment and because we rightly perceive that diversity can improve the performance of many organizations, such as universities and businesses. But, he continues, “looking across the world and even across states and cities within the United States, most of us would rather not live with some of the social, economic, and political consequences of diversity.” This is what Enos calls “the liberal dilemma.” Enos cites Gordon Allport, formerly a professor of psychology at Harvard, who described “contact theory” in his 1954 book, “The Nature of Prejudice.” Under the right circumstances, Allport argued, interracial contact could reduce hostility. Those circumstances, Enos notes, include “economic equality and social integration.” In practice, Enos points out: Allport’s conditions for prejudice reduction are seldom fulfilled. One of these conditions was that interpersonal contact would reduce prejudice when members of each group were of equal social standing. In reality, not only does equality between groups not exist, but true interpersonal contact across groups seldom takes place, even when groups are proximate. Two groups can live in the same area without having meaningful interpersonal contact. It almost goes without saying that the patterns Enos describes have been crucial to President Trump’s political success. Trump’s “most dramatic gains,” Enos observes, “that is, where a greater percentage of voters voted Republican than had done so in 2012 — were in the places where the Latino population had grown most quickly.” Not all of Enos’s findings are bleak. Group hostility, he writes, grows as the size of the immigrant population grows until it reaches a certain point and then begins to recede: The relationship between the proportion of an out-group in an area and group-based bias is curvilinear: it becomes greater as the out-group proportion increases until reaching a tipping point and then starting to decrease. This means that when a group makes up a large portion of a place — for concreteness, say 40 percent — each additional person above 40 percent actually decreases group-based bias. For those seeking to unravel what happened in the 2016 election, “The Space Between Us” is one of the most consequential of recent political books, a list that also includes two I have written about before: Lilliana Mason’s “Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity” and the forthcoming “Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America,” by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck. I asked a number of political scientists for their views on the questions raised by Enos’s book, including Tesler, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. Tesler emailed: Ryan’s book is brilliant and his findings dovetail with my belief that we’re in for a tough road ahead as the country diversifies, at least in the short term. The 2016 election, in which Trump’s rhetoric resonated with voters living in communities undergoing high rates of change, “was a perfect recipe” for the expression of anti-immigrant sentiments at the ballot box, Tesler said. That does not “have to always be the case,” Tesler continued, noting a paragraph at the conclusion of the book he wrote with Sides and Vavreck: Public opinion contains reservoirs of sentiment that can serve to unify or to divide. Take immigration. Places that experience rapid growth in the population of Latino immigrants do not necessarily become more anti-immigrant. “But the polarizing rhetoric of politicians ‘politicizes’ the places where Americans live,” Sides, Tesler and Vavreck observe, and people who live in places with a recent influx of immigrants then become more concerned about immigration. This unfolded in 2016: white Democrats voted for Trump in the highest numbers where the Latino population had grown the most. In other words, it takes a politician like Trump to light the match. “What gave us the 2016 election, then, was not changes among voters,” Sides, Tesler and Vavreck write, it was changes in the candidates. Only four years earlier, issues like race and immigration were not as central either to the candidates or to voters. That changed in 2016 because of what the candidates chose to do and say — and then after the election because of what Trump has chosen to do and say as president. A 2010 study, conducted before Trump appeared on the political scene, reinforced the key role of politicians in fanning the flames. Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, found in “Politicized Places: Explaining Where and When Immigrants Provoke Local Opposition”: When faced with a sudden, destabilizing change in local demographics, and when salient national rhetoric politicizes that demographic change, people’s views turn anti-immigrant. In other conditions, local demographics might go largely unnoticed, or else might remain depoliticized. Enos himself was ambivalent in response to my question: “What does your book say about the prospects for an integrated society, particularly a residentially integrated America?” He wrote back: Like many things, it depends on whether you want to take the optimistic or pessimistic view. The optimistic view is that many, if not most, groups that are once segregated visible minorities seem to be integrated over time, almost as if there is something natural about this process. However, Enos continued, the pessimistic view, which is a cold shot of reality, is that some groups have never residentially integrated in the U.S. and elsewhere. The most obvious example is African-Americans. We are still living with pernicious outcomes of the segregation of blacks. The big question facing America, in Enos’s view, is whether other groups, especially Latinos, might follow a similar path as blacks and never be residentially integrated with Anglos or whether they will look more like previous immigrant groups. On this score, Enos is not optimistic: Current trends in residential patterns may make this problem worse. As our cities sprawl and more of us move to suburbs (which are still growing faster than central cities), our chances for contact are reduced and our ability to form enclaves is heightened. It is, he added, “difficult to see how these forces can be reined in.” In fact, the predictable “decrease in group based bias” notwithstanding, the force that may prove most challenging to rein in is Trump and the legion of Republican candidates who have seen how effective anti-immigration rhetoric and policy has been in turning Democrats into Republicans. In politics, once a new strategy or tactic has proved a winner, no matter how reprehensible, it’s next to impossible to return to the past.",The New York Times
2018,How Much Can Goldman and Morgan Stanley Pay Out to Investors?,"One calculation was consuming Wall Street on Friday. Investors and bank executives were trying to work out whether the results of Thursday’s regulatory stress tests will force Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to reduce the amount they expect to pay out to their shareholders. Stock buybacks and dividends can help support stock prices, so any time they are smaller than expected, investors may be disappointed. Since the financial crisis, the largest United States banks must receive approval from the Federal Reserve to return capital to shareholders. The stress tests, which the Fed administers, are a crucial part of the determination of whether a bank has spare capital to distribute. Capital is a bank’s main financial defense against losses. Under the stress tests, the Fed estimates how much capital a bank might have left after suffering big losses in a severe economic downturn. First, let’s say a bank enters the tests with capital that is equivalent to 8 percent of its assets and the stress test, at its worst point, takes capital down to 4 percent of assets. What then matters is how far that 4 percent is above the Fed’s minimum capital requirement. If in this hypothetical case the minimum level is 3 percent, the bank would be free to pay out a dollar amount equivalent to 1 percent of its assets. Put another way, a bank with $1 trillion in assets could distribute as much as $10 billion to shareholders. The bank, of course, might decide to pay out less, say $7 billion, because it doesn’t want to risk going below the minimum in future tests. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley nearly hit their minimums on a capital measurement called the supplementary leverage ratio. Under the worst-case scenario, Goldman Sachs’s ratio fell to 3.1 percent, just above the Fed’s 3 percent minimum, and Morgan Stanley’s declined to 3.3 percent. When bank analysts saw these results, they did the following sort of calculation. In Goldman’s case, the firm had $1.39 trillion in assets and other positions at the end of first quarter. The 0.1 percentage point difference between the minimum requirement and the stress test low point is equivalent to $1.39 billion. Given that Goldman Sachs bought back $6.7 billion of stock and paid out $1.2 billion in dividends last year, it would appear the bank might have to reduce the amount it distributes to shareholders. For Morgan Stanley, the 0.3 percentage point difference is equivalent to $3.27 billion, which is less than the $3.75 billion in stock that the bank bought back last year. Morgan Stanley also paid out $2.1 billion in dividends in 2017. But the above example probably doesn’t capture everything that goes on when making these calculations. In the past, banks that have been close to the minimum level in the tests have gone on to announce higher-than-expected distributions. The mystery won’t last for long. The banks submitted their capital plans before the stress test results were revealed, and they will have a chance to resubmit them over the next few days if they were asking to pay out too much. On Thursday, in its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, the second leg of the stress-testing process, the Fed will reveal whether it objected to any of the bank’s plans for paying out capital. The Fed will also say which banks changed the size of their payouts from their original request. Once the Fed has made its capital review public, the banks typically announce how much stock they intend to repurchase in the coming months. Goldman Sachs’s stock on Friday was down 0.42 percent, and Morgan Stanley’s fell 1.8 percent. The wider stock market, measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, was up 0.2 percent.",The New York Times
